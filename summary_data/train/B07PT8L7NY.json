      "text": "I was very pleased with this staple gun, I liked that it came with a remover and 3 staple sizes (narrow crown, u-shaped and brad nail). I bought it for various craft projects, making a silk scarf stretcher and upholstery projects. It does take some hand strength to push it down (hence, heavy-duty), so if you don't have that, you may just need a regular office stapler but this was very well packaged, very well made, easy to load the staples and love that it came with a remover tool. I would recommend this product!",

I got tired of going to the firing range and having to rent a stapler every trip for two dollars to put up my targets. No more. Mounting targets is all I use this thing for so I expect it to last a long time. This stapler is pretty solid and it takes a little effort to punch a staple out, but I need that as I'm stapling targets to wood. I can't come up with any negatives about this stapler. I'm happy with it and it won't take long for it to pay for itself.",
