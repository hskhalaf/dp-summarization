      "text": "Once assembled, this jungle gym is awesome. It's super sturdy and kids love it. NOTE: This ships in 5 separate boxes, each approximately 1'x2'x7', and each is very heavy, especially the 2 boxes containing the jungle gym base. We lost a couple of joints and small bars in shipment simply due to the abuse the boxes take traveling across the country. Other than slight shipping delays for all the boxes to arrive, we enjoy and recommend this product. Definitely use a drill with Allen bits to assemble. If not, the assembly will take far too many hours. With drill, assembly took 1 person about 5 hours. Final dimensions are ~18' x 13.5' x 6.5'.",

We switched out the drop bar for a baby swing so our little one could use it too and are very pleased. Definitely stands out in the yard - it is bright - but makes the kids SO HAPPY.",

Please read the reviews before you order because there are too many pieces to have to inventory to tell the manufacturer what is missing. Apparently there is little quality control in repackaging. I didn't open the open boxes. I thought I was ordering a unopened product. Nowhere did it indicate I was purchasing an open box or returned/repackaged product. Too many unsolvable problems and a huge hassle! so disappointed :(",

What I didn\u2019t like was how some of the plastic connectors stripped. This didn\u2019t allow for proper tightening and it couldn\u2019t be undone due to not having any extras of that part. It was also difficult to fix or adjust something as there are so many parts to this play set. The assembly was ok but not great.",

It is because if you tighten them and you made a mistake, you won't open them again; the screw head will strip. The jungle gym is the time consuming part.
