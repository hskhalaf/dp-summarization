      "text": "I bought these GoPlae white because it's the style in Europe, but also because they are gender neutral. You can pass them down if they survive one child! Of course, I also like the quality as usually. I am appreciative that the sole is flexible, and that the base is not too narrow. Also, notice that the sneakers have zero drop, no heels, which supposedly is better for children musculoskeletal development. But by all means, search about it! My children loves them. And they usually wear this brand or Livie and Luca.",

They really need to offer the straps as a separate add on or redesign it so it doesn't fall out so easily.",

My only problem with them is that they seem to be wearing very quickly where the plastic of the smo rubs against the inside of the shoe. Hoping they last!",

The extra extra wide ones sold by Stride Rite and Saucont that I do find only Velcro half way across the foot. The long straps on these shoes are incredible and are even bigger than we need (which is awesome). Plus, when you open the shoe, the whole shoe flaps open and this makes it very easy for children to put shoes on for themselves. I am very pleased with this shoe and would definitely buy again. I am clicking \"TOO WIDE\" for the parents out there that struggle to find shoes that fit wide feet.",
