Was using over the weekend snapping pictures of my daughters birthday parties and turned off when not in use and now it won\u2019t come on! Tried multiple batteries, charging overnight and camera won\u2019t turn on! When googling issue, found this is a common issue of the camera just dying! Horrible product! Would never buy again!! Such a waste of $500 and many missed memories captured!! Then told will cost a few hundred to fix!! Beyond annoyed- Camera was always kept in camera bag- never dropped, damaged etc!",

      "text": "A fine camera, more compact than a DSLR with its multiple lenses, but fitted with an excellent zoom lens and capable of shutter-priority, aperture-priority and fully manual operation. Think of it as a halfway point between a pocket point-and-shoot and a DSLR that's so bulky you end up using your phone instead. The in-camera three-image HDR often delivers a good result; but HDR photos tend to be too exposed, and so require further adjustment by computer editor. So you might as well just take bracketed exposure-compensation shots and merge them on a computer where you have more control. Slowest shutter speed is eight seconds, long enough to make those silky waterfall shots I've always admired.",

I had messed around with a P510 in a store, but then realized the P520 was the \"upgrade\". I went with my gut instinct and bought this camera. I am SO happy that I did! I have pulled off some shots that I never thought possible, I am overly pleased with this camera! The ONLY gripe that I have so far is that I wish it came with a more in-depth instruction manual. 11 out of 13 pages tell you how to \"set the camera up\" and then you're pretty much left to your own devices. Finding videos online have helped tremendously.",

The camera was actually in better shape than I imagined because it is almost new: without scratches etc, good strip, etc. However the zoom button next to the shutter button (not the one located in the lens) doesn't work. That's my only complaint for now. I think that should have been advertised since the most important one is that one.",

My camera is ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS.It will take some time to learn how to use all the features. As far as I can tell right now, my P520 works beautifully. It's everything I hoped for and more. I will definitely buy from Electromax again. THANK YOU!!",

My only complaint would be that it is still sometimes difficult to focus/see what you are trying to get a pic of, either with the view finder or LED screen.

There's not real manual Focus. For me, it is important. I like to be abble of focusing on my own. So, I returned it and purchased a Fujifilm Finepix HS50exr. Much better in my opinion.",

Battery life was usually good, but went dead without any warning. Most photos needed Photoshop work before printing because they were very flat and dull. I'm comparing this to my wife's Panasonic which was reliable, took sharp bright photos which didn't need any preprinting work.

      "text": "Simply a great camera! For the people that might find it complicated because of the many options it provides, I suggest just picking a few modes you commonly use and spend a month or two practicing with it. Add more options as you need them and you gain experience. Don't depend on the little printed manual - download the full manual from the CD or online. I have taken excellent pictures with it over the past month. My wife and I both have this model camera and use them very successfully. I suggested this model to a friend and she loves it as well!",
