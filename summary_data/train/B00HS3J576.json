I also love the sparkle on the base of these lamps and that the shades aren't busy (there's a pleasant subtle sheen) so they don't compete with the base. Also these aren't full-sized lamps but they're not tiny so they're a perfect pair for a small desk or singly on side table.",

Everything was packaged carefully in a surprisingly small box. The box contains two CFL (corkscrew-type) bulbs, so the lamps are ready to go right out of the box. It's as simple as screwing in the light bulb and plugging it in. Can't get any easier.",
