It burns evenly without smoking. It definitely will last a long time. If only I could find a candle that would scent my entire room. This isn\u2019t it.",

For $15 I expect a decent sized candle, and you could certainly find a great nice big one (that is still a soy candle) at TJ maxx for that. This is puny. It says slow burning but it doesn\u2019t give you an approximated burn time. My bet is it really doesn\u2019t last long. No one wants a candle that only lasts a few uses :/",

Upon arrival, my own inspection of the candle confirmed the raving reviews of the product. The candle is VERY slow burning while emitting a perfect intensity of fragrance. $14.95 turns out to be quite the bargain for this candle, simply because it has the capacity to noticeably out-last other candles. I purchased the Cedarwood-Mango scent and love it. The light fruitiness and earthiness of the scent complement each other very well.",
