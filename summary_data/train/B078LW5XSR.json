It's cheaply designed even though it's made out if carbon, the bar ends are not standard sized and the internal cabling system is broken. It looks good but it's a piece of crap chinese bontrager knock off. If you go to their website it claims in the top it's made in the united States but the about us section is misleading, literally unfinished and from Guangdong China.

If you don't mind the hassle for the cost savings and/or are running di2 than these could be more favorable.",
