      "text": "My daughter is in the high school marching band. She is very pleased with the sound and playability. This is a significant upgrade from the beginner model she played previously (which is now flat as a pancake, but that's another story altogether). She was able to hit higher notes with this trumpet immediately which gave her a nice confidence boost. Highly recommended for this price range.",
