This kit came in today and I used the nail puller (torture looking device). After about 2 mins of slow pulling and a little pain it popped out. Honestly I was shocked. 100% works when nothing else would. High quality stuff with great packaging. Trust me it's worth the purchase.",

The nail corrector is really a magic tool, looks strange but very useful, I search the tutorial video on Youtube and find it's easy to use. It's really helping me. Package looks beautiful and I think I would buy one set for my mother and father. The ingrown kit include 6pcs items, and very good stainless steel. If you buy them separately, will cost you a lot more. Definitely worth buying!! Recommend!!",

All the tools in the set are very well fabricated and high quality. The set comes in a nice box and arrived promptly. Rather than return the set, I am going to try to wrap something grippy like a textured tape on the scissor handles.",

Usually, I had to dig into that side to be able to cut the sharp edge, very dangerous and painful. After 2 times of using the corrector... no more pain.

Also, it is more suited as a nail straightener than an ingrown corrector seeings how it has to connect to the edge of the nail. Regardless, this is a must buy for those that take care of their feet.
