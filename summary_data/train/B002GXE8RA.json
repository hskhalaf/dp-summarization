In any case, I did try to use it recently and the brushes fell apart. I\u2019m guessing either the afternoon sun or the winter snow or some combination of the two was just too much for it. Might do better in a protected location. Just didn\u2019t work for us.",

All four stripped before I was able to screw them fully into my deck. And, yes, I drilled pilot holes in my deck, so I wasn't over-torquing the screws.",

While not a complete failure, this tells me the manufacture (in china, of course) has little if any pride it its product and could care less if you got what you paid for or not. For a cheap product, i guess one should not complain much or have any real expectations of quality. Would not buy again.",

      "text": "Hah! \"How long can you wear them comfortably?\" I'm going to say that wearing this will leave a mark that won't be better in the morning...... On the other hand, using for the purpose intended? Pretty much wears like iron, a lot longer than the jute-woven-in-metal ones we replaced yearly. Still in good shape. Note that the best use is to screw it down on a board you can stand on with one foot while scrubbing the other; the brushes are tight on your boot.",

      "text": "I was pleased with the weight and materials of this boot scrubber, preferring the plastic inserts rather than wood, which eventually rots and cracks. The bristles, however, are much stiffer than expected and the space between is too narrow for large men's boots, which have to be forced in (it has to be screwed down). But it certainly does a good job of scrubbing off muck and mud.",

We used it all last fall and again during turkey season and so far it's holding up quite well.",
