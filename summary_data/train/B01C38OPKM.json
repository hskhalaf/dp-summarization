Whether you let the ruffle hang outside of the frame or inside, you need the sides to be separated from the end for proper hang. The frame catches the ruffle in the corners so you have to bunch it up and you lose the end ruffle. Cheap but defective.",

The negative is that I wish it had come with slits on the bottom corners, so I will have to make a cut for it to fit over my rails rather than be bunched up. Time will tell about durability, but looks nice for the price at this point.",

I am over-the-top pleased with that feature. In addition, the feel is genuinely soft and luxurious and the color is true. I've already recommended them to others who have purchased them and are happy.",

A couple reasons why I returned it was because it was a tad too long and I kept tripping on it when getting in/out of bed. It is also difficult to make the bed because the bed skirt gets caught and moves around (but that's normal with all bed skirts). I will say it is a tad wrinkly, but nothing a quick iron can't fix (if you're into ironing your bedding haha). It really is a great item if you can look past the minor issues.",

It was wrinkled when it arrived, but it took me only 15 minutes to iron and it was very easy to iron. This bed skirt was inexpensive, so I was surprised by the quality.

I probably should have paid closer attention to the 15\" depth and purchased the queen size instead. Our bed has a head and foot board so sits lower than other king beds. I will now have to run a seam down the center to bring the sides up a bit. Again, this was my fault and has nothing to do with the bed skirt.",
