I felt queasy and disgusted for the better part of two days. What was once a favorite snack/brand of mine has now been ruined by what I can only assume to be poor factory hygiene and quality control. I know all food has a certain unpreventable and miniscule amount of insect segments and rat hairs in it, but something like this is unacceptable. I would like a refund please.",

      "text": "If you like Indian food you may like this snack mix. To me it is like heaven. I ate a whole bag in a couple of hours :/ (not like heaven). A tiny tiny bit spicy to some people (I live in the South and know what real spicy is). To me it could actually be a bit more spicy. Anyways, some peanuts, wheat crackers, dry peas and sultanas (light seedless raisins)",
