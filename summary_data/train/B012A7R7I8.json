I've worked with many types of air inflators and have purchased numerous over the years. This is a great little (much smaller than I expected it to be) machine that is powerful and never overheats. It also has a really great feature that provides air when the nozzle is pressed so that the machine isn't in constant running mode. This is perfect if you are inflating balloons without assistance. I'm glad I found this machine and HIGHLY recommend it.",

I especially like that the blue nozzle is \"on demand\" meaning that when you depress the nozzle, air is released. The reason this is such a nice feature is that you're not listening to the machine running constantly, as it only runs when that nozzle is depressed. To use the 2nd nozzle you must either synchronize the balloon with someone using the blue nozzle, or just put up with the machine noise. No picture of the machine, but an example of what can be done with it. It blew up all the balloons for our event and never broke a sweat!",

Please Note - That it only inflates balloons - it is not a helium tank so balloons will not float but you can fill a room with balloons or tie them into an arch for a more intricate design.

      "text": "Used it to blow up over 100 balloons to create an arch. Took less than a hour to blow up the balloons and another hour or less to put the arch together. Way easier than blowing it up yourself and less expensive than renting a helium tank. Don\u2019t decorate often but you can\u2019t beat the ease and convenience it brings. Worth buying!",

Initially we needed to keep letting air out because it blows air very quickly, but after a few minutes we got the hang of it. We blew up all the balloons in the two garlands in the picture, plus extras we didn't use in less than an hour. (that includes our breaks in between). If you have any ambitious balloon projects this pump is the way to go.",
