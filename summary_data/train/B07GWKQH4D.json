I\u2019ve only been able to get notes to transfer back to the app twice. Additionally, the quality of the notes is terrible. While my hand writing will have smooth curves to the letters, the notes are squared off and almost look like they are made up of a series of straight lines as compared to my actual writing. I stopped using this, it\u2019s worthless.",

The pen is finally a manageable size - feels just like a regular pen. It's gorgeous - beautiful design - and swaps easily with Cross ink. That said, it's very very glitchy. Sometimes connects easily; sometimes does not. Digital rendering of ink to digital file is HORRIBLE with this particular pen. (I've owned several livescribe devices). And that is my biggest complaint... the transfer to digital is so splotchy, that I can't read it consistently. Even got brand new notebooks to confirm. Darn!
