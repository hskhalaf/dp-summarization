I've only used them once so far, but very happy with the performance. I think the low heat setting is sufficient for me, and that makes them stay warm longer which is nice. My only criticism is the battery being in the sock can be a bit uncomfy depending on placement. But there has to be a way to make these warm. Also, the box is super cute so this makes for a great gift! My picture is of the box because I was pleasantly surprised with the box and packaging.",
