I purchased the 65cm next which was perfect as my desk chair but now I'm stuck with two exercise balls since I couldn't even really return the 55cm since there's a charge for returning it. You'll see in the picture the difference of the 55cm (left) and the 65cm.",

Now it's at a full 65 as advertised. Highly recommend.",
