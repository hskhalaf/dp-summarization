The swing is high gloss wood and the patches keep the feet from slipping off, or if they use this as a sit on swing they won't slide off. Amazon sells these and they come in multiple colors. It took a minimal amount of time to put it up, just make sure you scope out a good branch first. Grandbaby loves it and so do the little neighbor kids.",

However- I do wish it came with longer ropes. It comes with (2) 30' ropes which means the tree limb can only be about 15' to 17' off the ground. This is pretty limiting unless you live in the low country with big arching live oak limbs. You are going to need much longer ropes to successfully hang the swing in most conditions. I would say (2) 50' ropes as part of the standard package would make this a much better product.",

My only complaint is that it has no grip or traction material on the surface that you stand on--you have to purchase something separately. Considering the price of this item, I think it should include traction material.",
