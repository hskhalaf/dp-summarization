      "text": "This drone is great for someone looking to learn how to fly one. The altitude hold feature works great. Being able to change out the batteries is also great. Although a battery only gives you about 8 minutes of flying time you can have multiple batteries charged and they dont cost much at all. Changing the battery only takes about a minute. Very easy to do. The video quality is great. The only thing to really keep in mind is that this drone is very light. If winds are more than 10mph you will have a littlw difficulty keeping it steady. All in all this is a great product and alot of fun.",

      "text": "Understanding I only paid 80 bucks for this unit: This is my 3rd drone for \"Beginners\". Not really a strong suit for this drone. Not sure if its the connection to the unit, but the controls are either very loose and it flies wherever it wants, or it flies tight and barely moves when using the joysticks. Trimming features are pretty much useless - they do not change the flying patterns or controls as needed. The max flight time on the included batteries has been about 2-3 minutes. On the plus side, it has lots of different beeps and sounds for various warnings! I would recommend looking for a drone in a little higher price range.",

Still, there are plenty of trainer drones without cameras for half the price.",
