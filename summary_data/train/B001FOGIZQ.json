Considering she weighed all of about 9 lbs (if that) and was making a dent in the mattress after 2 weeks, I didn't think this mattress would hold up through the year. This mattress also retains heat too much and my daughter would be very hot and sweaty after her naps. Ended up getting a new mattress and junked this one.",
