It held up fine but my foot seems to be too far back even with the back strap cinched all the way. I have a 10.5 size foot. This is why I only gave four stars. For the price though, these are fine.",

This may be an isolated incident so I would not let it stop anyone from buying these. That being said, this is a good snowshoe for trekking though snow in the woods.
