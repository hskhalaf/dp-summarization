I'm so excited to just have this game...as a Monopoly collector but also as a huge Disney fan. With the new CGI version of the Lion King releasing this July I am just really excited to have this edition!",

The pieces (grubs and slugs) used to place in the board as owned and property added are too light weight so the move off the board easily if the board is bumped even a little bit which with kids happens often. I feel this was cheaply put together and priced way to high.",

We love it but I\u2019m disappointed that the board came warped and idk if it\u2019s the intent but the color for properties are messy/incomplete and the quality of cards are cheap just thick paper, so can easily tear or be damaged. The tokens are awesome and pride rock definitely a cute fun addition. But not worth price if you care about quality. The Five below store sells monopoly for $7 and the board title quality are perfect. But if you don\u2019t care and love Lion King then it\u2019s a cute fun game",
