I find myself reaching for these for tons of tasks that were previously reserved for their larger and more powerful 18/20/24v counterparts.

The combo's packaging had a red line marked across it's front which makes me wonder if I was sent a defective product. Apart from that both units are light (approx. 2lbs 3oz with battery installed) and very powerful.

I think there is a big & beefy battery pack you can get that may allow for this though, but I don't have it and it's not worth the money for my needs.

Both tools are very professionally built and packs a hefty power in it. You won't get caught short on power or duration of usage. I was just so amazed by the quality and power of this set of tools. Highly recommended.",

The actual time it took for me to charge batteries from about empty to when the light stops blinking was ~80 minutes for each battery. Difference in time may be because the batteries are 2Ah while the old 12v Bosch batteries used to be 1.5Ah. Aside from the slow charging, the drill and impact both perform well. The drill chuck is pretty straight with very little wobble. Impact has a little bit of play, but never seemed like an issue in actual use. Side note: there are also no bit holders on the drill or impact.",

Used it multiple times since I just moved into a new house and needed to put together a lot of furniture Pros: - compact and light - weight distribution feels very ergonomic - feels well built and each battery charge lasts a long term - lithium battery has great shelf life - price is reasonable at $115 - love the two-speed and torque setting dial Cons: - The bag that comes with it is useless, not big enough to hold drill bits case, and no compartment at all - not really a con of this product, but I think the 18V combo sometimes can be bought at lower prices.",

Lightweight, portable, and the 12v battery lasts quite a long time even under heavy usage conditions. Used both tools to disassemble an old piano. The drill had no problems drilling out/extracting a few stripped screws, and the impact driver passed with flying colors and only reached max torque a few times on larger 1\u2019 sized bolts (at which point I had to switch to my socket set). Great product from Bosch \u2014 5/5 stars!",
