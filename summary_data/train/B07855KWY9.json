While it is pretty stiff, it is exactly what I was looking for to fill an empty space in our bedroom. I can definitely see myself relaxing on this seat with a good book. Hoping it loosens up a bit with use, but overall I am very pleased with the purchase!!",

I have three screw holes that seemed stripped and I can\u2019t get anything to screw in. This includes one of the feet. I hate to do it, but I may have to find a way to glue three screws in place.

We followed the directions and for the most part were able to get the back installed, though the screws had difficulty catching so they'd screw in completely and tightly. We had to improvise to get the legs to attach. Only one of them would catch so, since my husband is a residential construction superintendent, we wound up using construction glue/liquid nails to firmly install the legs. We have animals and needed something aesthetically pleasing, serviceable and inexpensive. This fits the bill for what we need but I wouldn't want to try putting another together.",
