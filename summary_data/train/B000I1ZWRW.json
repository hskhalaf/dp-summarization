I've known how to use some settings on cameras, but the DSLR has more to offer that I was not expecting. The lens that came with it is also very nice and I love it. I'm not even an amateur, if anything I'm a beginner in this type of field, so all the extra pieces I got (including the manual from my seller) is fantastic. I would definitely recommend this camera as the quality is quite good for an old model DSLR.",

      "text": "I had an old Rebel EOS film camera with many accessories and autofocus lenses. I bought just the XTi body with the intent of reusing my lenses etc. Camera is very high quality, takes excellent high-res digital photos, but after trying to take some low-light shots I realized that I needed an image-stabilization lens. Not the fault of the camera at all. It does so much, the only limitations are really my own knowledge. I haven't yet used the software that came with the camera...still using the very good iPhoto that comes with my MacBook. When I learn more about the camera, the software that it uses may be more valuable (for post-processing raw format images, I guess).",

Aside from the upgraded CMOS sensor and added features, the big difference for me is the LCD display. On my digital rebel the settings display only filled the top portion of the small LCD. On the XTi the information actually fills the whole screen which a 2.5\" display. For my 40+ year old eyes that have reduced near vision that is great! I now can shoot and adjust without having to pull my glasses up to see the shutter speed, ISO, aperture, etc. The bottom line...its solid Canon quality at a reasonable price!",

Least digital noise in higher ISO settings, durable body, very user-friendly settings. This XTi has a quick change on point of focus and a larger LCD viewer which I like. In the nearly 3 yrs of using my first Rebel, I haven't found much about these cameras I don't like. The one thing I miss, that I had with my G series Canon point & shoot, is a preview of my shots in a tip-out LCD viewer.

The quality of photos are far superior to my previous point-and-shoot 2mp camera. Now that I have this camera, I'm taking a lot more photos and really satisfied with the results. The price is not too high that a first-time buyer is intimidated and not too low that you feel its a cheap starter. The kit lens (18 - 55mm) is okay for basic use but I'm already exploring to purchase a better lens. Overall, the Canon XTI is a great camera especially for digital SLR rookies.",

There were some nice features to consider as well, but along with those came the added cost--more than double the price.

    "title": "Canon Digital Rebel XTi 10.1MP Digital SLR Camera (Black Body Only)",
    "description": "Style:Black Body Only| Product Packaging:Standard PackagingFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nCanon EOS Digital Rebel XTi offers an unbeatable combination of performance, ease-of-use and value. It has a newly designed 10.1-megapixel CMOS sensor plus a host of new features including a 2.5-inch LCD monitor, the exclusive EOS Integrated Cleaning System, and Canon's Picture Style technology, all in a lightweight, ergonomic body. The Digital Rebel XTi is proof positive that Canon continues to lead the way with our phenomenal digital SLRs.\n\n \n\n10.1-Megapixel APS-C Size CMOS Sensor\nCanon's large-area CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) sensor captures images with exceptional clarity and tonal range, and offers the most pixels in its class. This APS-C size sensor (22.2 x 14.8mm) has the same 3:2 ratio as film cameras, enabling an effective angle of view that is 1.6x the normal EF lens focal length. With pixel resolution of 3,904 x 2,598, the Digital Rebel XTi not only offers the most pixels in its class, but bests many professional-level cameras. Recorded on Canon's CMOS sensor, each pixel is captured with fine detail to create images of tremendous depth, nuance, and resolution, ensuring enough information for even poster-sized prints. DIGIC II Image Processor\nThe EOS Digital Rebel XTi is the product of Canon's extensive in-house development: The DIGIC II Image Processor was designed specifically for Canon digital SLR cameras and enhances every aspect of image capture. Information captured by the CMOS sensor is processed and assembled into images of exceptional quality. With the DIGIC II Image Processor on board, photographers can expect natural color reproduction, precise white balance in any number of lighting situations, and unparalleled clarity. The DIGIC II Image Processor employs sophisticated signal processing algorithms and works at greater speeds, all while consuming less energy. The entire processing chip--not just the software that drives it--is dedicated for use in a digital still camera.\n\n \n\nResponsive and Reliable\nThe EOS Digital Rebel XTi has a brilliant 2.5-inch LCD monitor with approximately 230,000 pixels. Also used in Canon's Professional EOS SLRs, this screen displays more than images. Shooting information and playback are both displayed on the LCD, so that the photographer can see all of the shooting information simultaneously on one screen. Not only can images be viewed larger than on the Digital Rebel XT, they can be viewed at a greater angle (160 degrees) than many other conventional LCD monitors. Display Off Sensor\nWhen composing images, the Digital Rebel XTi's external display turns off automatically thanks to the newly developed Display Off Sensor. This new sensor detects the photographer's face against the back panel of the camera, and turns the screen off to prevent the LCD monitor's brightness from disturbing the photographer's eye while looking through the viewfinder.\n\n Speedy Operation\nWith a startup time of 0.2 seconds, the EOS Digital Rebel XTi is ready to go the instant it's brought to the eye. And the Digital Rebel XTi's shutter can record images as fast as 1/4000 seconds and as long as 30 seconds, plus bulb at up to 3 frames per second (fps) for 27 consecutive shots. It synchronizes with Canon Speedlites at 1/200 second.\n\n \n\n9-Point AF\nThe EOS Digital Rebel XTi has a high-precision 9-point AF system for speedy and accurate focusing in any situation. Conveniently located on the back of the camera for thumb-controlled action, Canon's cross key buttons enable instant choice of the 9 focus points or allow the camera to choose them automatically. One-Shot is perfect for still photography. AI Servo AF tracks moving subjects, ensuring accurate focus. AI Focus AF switches between One-Shot and AI Servo when subjects are moving and stopping. The Digital Rebel XTi's focusing system functions in metering ranges of EV-0.5 to 18 and displays information on the Digital Rebel XTi's big LCD display. Picture Style settings\nWith Picture Style technology and the EOS Digital Rebel XTi, photographers can recreate characteristics of their favorite films. Color, saturation, sharpness, and contrast settings create noticeable variation in the saved image. In addition to six preset Picture Styles (Standard, Portrait, Landscape, Neutral, Faithful, and Monochrome), users can create three additional settings for their particular photographic style.\n\n \n\n Print/Share Button\nPrinting and uploading to a computer is incredibly simple with the Digital Rebel XTi's Print/Share button. By connecting the Digital Rebel XTi to a computer via the USB 2.0 port, it's easy to transfer some or all of the photographs in the cameras memory to folders on the computer.\n\n EF and EF-S Lenses\nThe EOS Digital Rebel XTi is compatible with all Canon lenses in the EF lineup, ranging from ultra-wide-angle to super-telephoto lenses, and including Canon's EF-S series lenses, manufactured specifically for Canon's APS-C sized digital sensor. Canon lenses employ advanced optical expertise and micron-precision engineering to deliver unprecedented performance in all facets of the photographic process. Aspherical optics and fluorite elements, for example, are featured in the universally acclaimed L-Series lenses, and Canon's Image Stabilizer technology in select lenses minimizes the effect of camera shake.\n\n Flash Photography\nThe EOS Digital Rebel XTi features the acclaimed E-TTL II flash metering system. Whether using its flush-mounted integral flash (guide no. of 43 feet/13 meters at ISO 100), or any of the flashes in the EX Speedlite line, E-TTL II provides reliable flash output through numerous exposures.\n\n Software \nThe EOS Digital Rebel XTi comes bundled with the updated Canon EOS Digital Solution Disk (Version 13.0), which features powerful software programs designed to extend the EOS experience to the computer. These include Canon's ZoomBrowser EX for Windows (Version 5.7), ImageBrower for Macintosh OS X (Version 5.7), Digital Photo Professional (Version 2.2), Canon's EOS Utility (Version 1.1) and PhotoStitch (Version 3.1). Each application is designed to perfect captured images and streamline the digital workflow.\n\n Digital Photo Professional (Version 2.2) is an image processing program that enables high-speed RAW image processing, high-speed previewing for real-time image adjustment, and support for sRGB, Adobe RGB, and Wide Gamut RGB color spaces. Because it's CMS (Color Management System) compatible, Digital Photo Professional allows for easy image layout and printing in Adobe RGB in conjunction with Easy-PhotoPrint and PictBridge printers. It also features the Digital Rebel XTi's Dust Delete Data Detection tool for cleaner images.\n\n EOS Utility (Version 1.1) for Macintosh or Windows handles the connection between the camera and computer, whenever they're connected via USB. It allows remote-controlled shooting from the computer, handles downloading of images from the camera to the computer, and allows seamless linking to either Canon's ZoomBrowser/ImageBrowser or Digital Photo Professional software once images have been copied to the hard drive. Furthermore, it's used to upload settings back into a USB-connected camera.\n\n ZoomBrowser EX (Version 5.7) for Windows and ImageBrowser (Version 5.7) for Mac OS X are the easy, user-friendly options for viewing and editing of JPEG and even RAW image files. Both allow viewing of numerous types of images including finished TIFF and BMP files. Both also have a variety of search options for finding images, allow re-naming of single images or batches of files, and offer a variety of options for printing without using a separate image-editing program.\n\n Dependable for Cleaning the Sensor\nThe EOS Digital Rebel XTi not only sports a newly refined body with better ergonomics and a new grip, but it also has some of Canon's most advanced improvements in dust reduction. No matter how careful photographers may be to change lenses in dust free areas and to keep their equipment as clean as possible, dust often ends up on their cameras' sensors, creating distracting spots on recorded images. The Digital Rebel XTi's integrated hardware and software solutions make trouble with dust a thing of the past. The Digital Rebel XTi is the first digital EOS SLR camera to feature this important technology: by ensuring the sensor is free of dust and debris, the camera guarantees a cleaner image.\n\n Self Cleaning Sensor Unit\nTo combat stray dust that enters the camera and adheres to the image sensor during a lens change, the Digital Rebel XTi features an all new Canon-designed Self Cleaning Sensor Unit. The low-pass filter cleans itself automatically with ultrasonic vibrations, removing dust from the sensor assembly.\n\n \n\nDust Delete Data Detection\nDust that has been missed by the Integrated Self Cleaning Sensor Unit can also be erased with software included in Digital Photo Professional (DPP) Version 2.2. The Digital Rebel XTi's imaging sensor is able to single out the dust particles on its surface, then plots out their location coordinates within the image. This data is transmitted along with the image, whether JPEG or RAW, and can be either manually or automatically erased in Canon's DPP 2.2. This added software option ensures the cleanest possible image, perfect for printing or archiving.\n\nREVIEW FROM DPREVIEW.COM\n\n\n \n\nLearn more about this camera\nat DPReview.com Canon Rebel XSi Digital SLR: Highly Recommended by dpreview.com \n\nFour and a half years have passed since the first affordable digital SLR from Canon; the EOS 300D (Digital Rebel). In that time we have witnessed two further iterations (the EOS 350D and EOS 400D) leading up to today's fourth generation EOS 450D, with twice the megapixel count of the original (twelve versus six) in a smaller body with a far wider range of functionality and features and a $200 lower list price. Since those heady days in 2004 when the EOS 300D was the only kid on the block we've seen Nikon, Pentax and Olympus all attempt to hit the same sweet spot of size, features and price at the 'lower end' of the DSLR market, with varying degrees of success. Without a doubt the EOS 450D will have to do more today to prove itself in an increasingly crowded market. \n\nOn the third page of this review you'll find a detailed breakdown of all of the changes and updates compared to the EOS 400D but the headlines are; a larger 3.0\" LCD monitor, Live View with both passive and contrast detect AF, Spot metering, improved auto-focus, 3.5 fps continuous shooting a larger viewfinder and a switch SD/SDHC for storage (all previous cameras in this range were Compact Flash). Other features appear to be inherited from the EOS 40D; 14-bit image pipeline, Highlight Tone priority, optional High ISO noise reduction, 'My Menu' and display of the ISO sensitivity on the viewfinder status line. There's also the new stabilized kit lens (for review and samples click here). \n\nNote that throughout this review we will refer to the EOS 450D by its European name; if you live in other parts of the world you'll know the camera by (in order of silliness) Rebel XSi or Kiss X2 Digital, but they're all the same. \n\n>Read more at dpreview.com",
