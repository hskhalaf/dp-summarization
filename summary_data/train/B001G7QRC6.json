      "text": "We keep this in constant supply. It's not a miracle cure for a bug bite or other rashes but it does substantially reduce itching and that's worth it. It can slightly sting at application so little kids don't love it, but for anyone old enough to get past that the net result is worth it. You need to hap the tip facing down to get the liquid to come out, so that sometimes requires contortions.",

You'll want to apply it as soon as you know you've been bit and then apply as needed as the itch returns. It can sting a bit if you've scratched the top layer of your skin off, but the stinging tends to be quite soothing when it is replacing an annoying, unending itch! Plus, this is a great alternative to cortisone creams (which will eventually thin your skin and is not good for you).",

      "text": "Great portability. I really like that I can keep this in my purse (or tucked in my sports bra when I'm walking our dog) so that I'm ready for whenever I get bitten. Which is a lot unfortunately! The mosquitos really love me. It does help keep the itching in check for a decent time. I'm not saying you'll never reapply but I think it's better than anything I've tried so far. I should also mention that it is liquid so even though the dispenser only has a tiny hole for it to come out of it is still likely to drip once you apply it.",
