      "text": "Got the Callaway 3+ (13.5) about three weeks ago and have played a number of rounds with it. I have biased it to the 12.5 degree/draw setting and am crunching it 220+ yards straight down the fairway. Not bad for a 66 year old duffer. Great feel and very easy to hit. Would highly recommend this club for those who have trouble hitting the drivers that look like they have a small animal on the end of the club. Have no problems at all keeping up with those who chose the drivers and keep it in the fairway much more consistently. Pretty much shoot in the mid 80s even with a crummy short game.",
