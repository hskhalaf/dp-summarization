      "text": "Love this phone! Was an iPhone user since 2008, finally switched from that crap and got an android, and what an android! Have been using it for a month now and will likely NEVER get another Apple product. Awesome optons, versatility. finally a computer in my pocket that I can do almost anything with, compared to apple which decided what I needed my phone to be, or what the GUI was to look like. Great vendor, delivered on time, as promised, good tracking. Will do business with them again anytime!!",

However, it comes with a European power adapter which I can't use in Canada, luckily I had one from my old phone but it should have been listed in the description. Came very very quickly which was bad for me because I was out of town. Otherwise very excited to use this phone.",

I can't remove it. OK I can live with that, but for me you should be able to remove it. The other thing is the block screen: I can't configure it so it doesn't sound when I block the phone, or every time I touch the screen. I can live with that too. That's all by now jaja",

I've spent hours (literally) on the phone with four different tech-support people at OnePlus, each says they can't help, and that I will get a call from someone who can help, but nobody ever calls. Three weeks now. I just need a stupid charger. How hard can it be? Customer service is worthless - and so is the phone without a charger.",
