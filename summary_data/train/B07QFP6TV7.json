Once I got a fit, I used the \"Spring\" or 3/4 wet suit to continue swimming in an unheated pool even though the water turned colder, as expected, in the fall. The suit makes swimming laps comfortable with water temperatures down to 65 F or a bit lower. However, outside temperature has dropped to 40s and 30s, at least for now, and I have suspended the laps until warmer weather. Note, I also use Vaseline on lower legs and arms which helps the warmth factor quite a bit.",

The 2XL fit me exactly as it should - just the right amount of snugness. It seems well made. Did it have a strong odor of neoprene out of the package? Absolutely, but that's what it's made of. Stunk up the whole room after I opened it. But, one soak in the tub with a little dish detergent and now it's hanging in my closet. Can't smell it unless I'm within a foot of it.
