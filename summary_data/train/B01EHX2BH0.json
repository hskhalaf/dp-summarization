I can live with that amount of unknown, and the breeds given all seem to fit. Directions were easy to follow and the kit was simple to mail back. Test results came within the estimated window even though Christmas fell right in the middle of it. I was somewhat expecting delayed results because of the timing, but that wasn't the case.

Wisdom will not specify a breed it will list is as Herding, Terrier, Asian etc. You can get up to 65% comeback in a group (no specific breed). If I would have know this I would have spent the extra money and went with Embark DNA as they list all the breeds down to single percentages! I knew the mother was Border collie and the father is Great pyrenees but she has a Rough collie face very slanted and collie colors (orange and white) The results came back 50% unspecified. They were thrown in a breed group which doesn't help me at all! Huge waste of money.",
