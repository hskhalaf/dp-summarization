I think this thing is great, it works all IM clients well and you can go on the net and actually upload stuff. The keyboard is backlit so it's always easy to work that, it's touch screen and easy to navigate. Websites load pretty fast for a handheld and you can scroll 3 different ways. You may not be able to have every one of the applications open but, it's NOT a computer, it's a personal communicator. Just wanted to mention that since some have that confused.",

Also there was never a restore done on this item and it was shipped with all kinds of stuff already programmed into it. Other than that service was as expected, no issues in that area.",

Furthermore, it took Amazon sooo long to ship it out to me, that I couldn't use it for what I bought the stupid thing for in the first place. The camera is crap, everything seems fuzzy no matter what you do, and it's so hard to find a firmware update. I wish I could get my money back. This pathetic \"Jack Of All Trades\" device is a piece of junk, stay away from it!",

I have two of these devices and they were wonderful when sold. Sony never kept up on it and thus it now performs very poorly. The software is outdated and despite numerous calls to Sony where they promised that they would look into it, they never did. It operates on a Linux system in which Sony never released the source code allowing Linux users the ability to update the device themselves. Don't buy this unless you want a cool looking paperweight. I will never buy another Sony product again.",

    "description": "Color:Black| Product Packaging:Standard PackagingThe 802.11b/g WiFi Sony mylo personal communicator gives you what you need to stay connected. Mylo uses wireless LAN technology so there are no monthly bills or long-term contracts. Call your friends on Skype for free or IM them on AIM, Google Talk, or Yahoo! Messenger using the back-lit slide-out keyboard. You can also browse the Web, take photos and then share/view them on the 3.5-inch LCD touch screen. All this on a device small enough to take virtually anywhere. Sony mylo, the fun of your PC in your pocket.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nThe redesigned Sony Mylo COM-2 (which stands for \"my life online\") enables you to stay in touch with all your IM and e-mail contacts without having to lug around a laptop. While still curvy along the sides for a comfortable feel in the palms of your hand, the top and bottom of the Mylo COM-2 have been given a sleeker straight edge. Other improvements include a larger 3.5-inch LCD (800 x 480-pixel resolution), a bump in Wi-Fi speed to 802.11g (in addition to 802.11b), and a built-in 1.3-megapixel camera. Other features include an easy-to-operate back-lit, slide-out QWERTY keyboard, an embedded microphone and speaker, multi-format digital audio player, and integrated Skype VoiP capabilities. \n\n \n\n\n\nThe redesigned Mylo COM-2 now includes faster Wi-Fi connectivity (802.11b/g), a 1.3-megapixel camera, and upload/download capabilities so you can share photos on the Web. With the integrated wireless LAN, you won't have to worry about monthly bills or long-term contracts--just connect to any open Wi-Fi network and start chatting with friends using AIM, Google Talk, or Yahoo! Messenger. You can also browse the Web as well as send and receive email. Enjoy free Internet phone calls to and from any Skype enabled device and PC anywhere in the world, or Skype-Out to any phone number for a nominal fee.  The built in 1.3-megapixel camera lets you capture photos, edit them on the built in photo editor and--because the COM-2 features upload and download capability--post them directly to your blog or even to your Facebook page. \n\n Through its hi-resolution touch-screen, enhanced Web Browsing combined with Adobe Flash Lite 3 support means you now have access to websites like YouTube and others. Flash Lite support also means you can play compatible casual Flash games. \n\n In addition to powerful communication features, the Mylo COM-2 also provides a wide variety of digital audio, video, and photo playback. Like it's predecessor, the COM-2 is compatible with MP3, ATRAC, WMA (including secure Windows Media DRM 10 tracks you've purchased from online music stores or downloaded from subscription services), and it now can also play un-secured AAC tracks. The improved video player supports both MPEG4 simple/advanced along with the improved video quality of MPEG4 AVC. And the Mylo COM-2 is all about multi-tasking: listen to music while you IM or surf the Web. \n\n The rechargeable lithium-ion battery provides up to 20 hours of continuous music playback, up to 7 hours of video playback, and up to 6 hours of Internet calling. It comes with 1 GB of internal memory, which can be expanded via Memory Stick Duo media, and it offers USB 2.0 high-speed connectivity to your PC. \n\n Mylo Widgets\nThe Mylo COM-2 comes with several pre-installed widgets that range from a Google search widget and the Facebook Notifier (tracking activity on your Facebook page) to more advanced apps like the My Contacts widget, which works as a consolidated buddy list for all the IM applications on the Mylo. In addition to the preinstalled widgets, you'll be able to download new widgets from the Mylo web site as well as register as a developer if you want to build your own widgets. \n\n Note About Connectivity\nThe mylo Personal Communicator COM-1 requires a compatible wireless LAN access point to use the interactive IM, email, and Web features. It generally requires no additional monthly service charges as long as you are connected to free access points found in homes, cafes, businesses, and campuses. However, some access points and features may rely on Internet services which may require a fee.",
