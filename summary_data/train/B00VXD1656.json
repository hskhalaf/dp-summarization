Bought some separately. -Drink tube doesn't have enough retention points and flops around a lot. Bought some seperately.  -Barely enough storage to hold all my stuff for mountain biking. I should have just bought they hydration system. (Not sure if that's even possible) Thought the pack would be more useful.",

Still, the pockets are adequate, the bladder and feed system are outstanding, and the construction is top notch. The straps could use a little more width or padding at the top. I have above average traps and the straps dig a little after extended wear. This is not a deterrent to use, however. After a week straight with this on my back, I still love it.",

The mil spec model is head & shoulders above the rest of the line. 3 liters allows you to drink what you want without having to \"ration\" like the one and two letter packs. Kept water cold for 6-1/2 hrs in the Florida sun...kept it cool for 9 hrs SUPing on a 30 mile paddle. The two compartments are big enough to be useful but not too big. Even carry an extra 20 oz bottle of frozen water with electrolytes under the sinch strap between the top and bottom compartments. Very comfortable and first rate quality. Will be purchasing a second one to attach to my board to expand my range soon.",

There are some handy spots to hide away some energy bars or tools as well, but nothing much else. The build quality seems tight and I love the multi-cam pattern. Water stays cold on long rides (I usually add a tray of ice cubes first) and holds more than enough for a thirty plus mile ride or more. I highly recommend the Antidote from Camelbak!",

    "description": "Water is life. You need to have a hydration system of some type for range training, emergencies, travel or recreation. Camelbak has stayed at the forefront of hydration systems and is the one many other companies copy. Their packs are easy to use, clean out and are comfortable to wear all day on the range, biking or hiking. I keep one non-tactical-looking example stuffed with gear for covert emergency use. I have several others set up for various uses. Select at least one that fits your needs. Reservoir features: more than just a reservoir, the MIL spec antidote reservoir redefines the ultimate delivery system for an Operator's water supply and provides maximum adaptability for changing missions or combat environments. Includes our quick link exit Port and ql hydrolock Bite valve adapter: tube clicks off for faster refilling with auto shut-off; new fill Port: industry's largest opening with air-light 1/4 turn open/close for quick, secure seal that can't be over-tightened; lighter weight lower profile design. Additional features: external fill access-allows for a quick Refill without removing pack, Side-Release shoulder straps for rapid removal, multiple drink tube exit ports-for routing drink tube over the shoulder or under an arm, noiseless zipper pulls, top and bottom external zip pockets hold your essentials, lightweight, durable 500D corduroy fabric.",
