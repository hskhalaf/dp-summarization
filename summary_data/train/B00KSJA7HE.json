I can't say I have seen a huge difference yet but my face definitely feels smoother, softer and more hydrated. I'm going to keep using this for sure.

I've been using Anavita for a month now with a few drops of 2% hyaluronic acid both morning and night and have seen a clear difference in my skin. It is clearly softer and the tone is much more even. I'm not sure about getting rid of wrinkles (I have pretty small ones for 62), but the color and feel of my face is enough to make me order it again. Plus, I'm sending it to my daughter so she can get a head start! But, are there coupons to help with the cost????",

In addition, when you get near the bottom of it, the jar is designed in such a way that a lot of the cream is hidden in creases near the bottom of the jar, making it difficult to get it all out. Finally, near the end, the cream gets drier and even thicker, making it almost impossible to use. I gave the product two stars, because it does seem to moisturize fairly well, it's just the application of the product which leaves so much to be desired. I would not buy this product again.",
