I'd say it earns a firm last place in a ranking of all 8 generations. But hey, it's a Pokemon game. It's missable, but if you don't have anything better to do its probably worth a look.",

I also am sad that i really don\u2019t care for what \u2018storyline\u2019 there is, or taking down the league, or any of the characters. I just want to unlock the map so i can explore more freely.",

And by quickly, I mean after a few hours of gameplay. I also finished this game within 20 hours and there is hardly any post-game to enjoy (Like the other reviewers mention, the Battle Tower is a far cry from the Battle Frontier and the post-game story lasts for only an hour). For $60, I was expecting much more (GTS, Mega Evolutions, post-game content, better animations, etc). Long story short, it's easily one of the worst Pokemon games. Still decent compared to most games, but not up there with the other mainstream games.",

With raids, unless you\u2019ve already got a code and a set group of friends playing with you, you will rarely if ever come across other players to join in your raids.

Overall, even though it seemed like it would be rough from the get-go, it was a gratifying pokemon experience and a great foray into the main console generations.",

It does suck that the dex was cut, but it's also made completing everything so much less of a hassle and/or overwhelming. The story is pretty weak, but there are fun characters with good designs. There's also a decent amount of new Pokemon with cool designs. tl;dr It's a fun game, but nowhere near perfect.",

But the battle animations are somewhat terrible for the most part then made up with some of the legendary special moves being a blast. Yeah good for Poke\u0301mon fans alike old and new.
