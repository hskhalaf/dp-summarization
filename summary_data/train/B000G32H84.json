I emailed the manufacturer last week, but I have not yet had an answer from them. If I don't hear back in the next few days, I am returning the machine.",

After doubling the yeast, it came out perfect. Note: you cannot select light brown when you use the timer for delayed cooking, however, the crust came out perfectly anyway. This machine does not \"rock\" off the counter, as other units do. It is a heavy, quality product. I would highly recommend. The one pound size is great for households with one or two people. Love waking up to the smell of bread cooking. It's positively sinful. This makes a wonderful holiday gift.",

With this machine, I just put all my own allergy-friendly flours/starches in the machine, hit a button, go do other things, and three hours later, I have a loaf that my child can safely eat. It is worth every penny!!!",

So if I want to make a \"quick\" recipe that contains nuts, choc chips, etc, I have to stay nearby and add them while it's kneading. Kind of defeats the purpose of easy/convenient ya' know? Btw, it makes SMALL loaves. Perfect for a family of 3 like us. Also, I bought this when it was $100, not over $300 like now! Wow! I'd be really, really ticked off if I'd paid THAT much!",

We use bread flour and Peak full cream milk powder in the recipes. Fresh, warm bread ready for the toaster in the morning. Easy to clean, works like a charm, and it does all the heavy lifting. Expensive, but well worth it. Buy this machine and be happy. And look for Peak milk powder (or Nestle's if you care) for dry milk that doesn't taste like dishwater.",

I was hoping to set the crust option to light crust, however that option it not available for the French bread setting. I will try one more time using the French bread recipe but use the normal bread setting so I can adjust the crust setting. Hopefully that will work.",

Have made the basic white bread several times. Easy, fast and tasty. If I were to change anything it would be make the written instructions a bit easier to follow. Tip: Get a pair of 'Ove Gloves' to remove the bread from the baker and the loaf from the pan. I hate to get burned!",

Once more, you get what you pay for. Superb !",

So far, every bread has come out well - pretty good considering I used 2 lb recipes cut in half for quite a few of them. Very happy overall and now I make bread 1-2 times a week and its perfect for two of us.",

      "text": "after having tried a sunbeam, oster and cuisinart without success, we decided to spend a bit more and get the Zojirushi. At the beginning the pan looks a bit small, but the loaf size is perfect for 2. One loaf lasts for 3 breakfast meals for us. Also, the pan is more thick and heavy than the other we have tried. I guess that is one of the reasons why the bread always comes out perfectly cooked, unlike the other ones we have tried. Small size is awesome for limited counter space kitchens, and bread always comes out good, even when I unfortunately mixed the yeast with olive oil in a 7hour delay bread. We are extremely happy with it!",

It always worked perfectly, and kneaded even very stiff doughs effortlessly. Vast improvement over my old $100 two-paddle Breadman, which had a weak motor and died after not much use. For twice the money, I got much more than twice the use out of it. I bought another one, and put it in a safer location. At the rate my old one was going, it might have lasted another decade or two, so I don't expect to be needing another replacement any time soon.",
