I would have rated it at the highest level, but nothing is perfect except one... Would recommend and would buy for someone eles as a gift. FYI: Only setback is your computer and your TV must have an HDMI connection. My old laptop has only the AV connection and my TV does not. So this is not a problem with this product just my equipment.",

      "text": "I had hoped that this product could be used to tie two tv's to one cable box so that the sound etc would coordinate between two rooms, and without the need to run long HDMI cables. The problem is that the unit has very limited range. Reception really needs line-of-sight installation as going through a wall greatly reduced performance,even when the receiver and transmitter were within 10 feet of each other. When working within the distance limitations, however, the unit does work well.",

I had been thinking of just building a machine to be just a media server but found this. My computer sits across the room from my TV (15 feet) and it has good transfer and sync on HD/1080P video. My only complaint which may just be my video card is if I leave the transmitter hooked up my screen goes black every few minutes for about 3 seconds and also the sound on my computer will not work with the HDMI plugged into the transmitter.",

If the transmitter and receiver were any further apart, the transmission lock (as indicated by the solid white light on the units) would not occur and no picture was transmitted. I found it absolutely useless and am promptly returning it. Unless you can live with the transmitter and receiver being virtually next to each other, I suggest you look elsewhere.",

The only problem that I have experienced is that when the receiver has no power, the PC (I have an iMac 2.66GHz) the mouse and screen has slow moments. Also the receiver fan is noticeable.

This is in sharp contrast to many other video signal transmitters that change the resolution and/or quality and/or introduce compression artifacts and are slow.
