The second set was a total joke, it was a set that someone had abused and returned with missing parts, dirty and with glue remnants on the pullers. The glue gun was missing as well. The only thing I was annoyed about with this last set is that the glue sticks that came in the set were very short, not as shown in the pictures.",

I had to use the broken LIFTER to fix the dents, but, it was just useless. Returned it for a refund. The product material seems pretty high, it appears to be a bad quality control at the factory.
