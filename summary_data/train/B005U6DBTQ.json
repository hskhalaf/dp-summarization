There are 3 interchangable ports for chain connecting barrels, and a bottom spigot, with a valve to attach a hose. All ports will fit a standard hose. These are great for watering the garden. I currently have town water and it smells like pool water, coming out of the tap; so this is a good alternative.",

When I connected a hose to the overflow valve, the hose pulled down on the valve and moved it considerably making me think that the valve won\u2019t last very long. Otherwise, I\u2019m really pleased with it.",

I've got a garden hose attached to the top overflow valve so I can divert excess water, but the water doesn't flow out of the hose unless I jiggle the hose a while - not practical during a heavy rain or thunderstorm. So I'm getting overflow water around my foundation during a heavy rain- not what I want.",
