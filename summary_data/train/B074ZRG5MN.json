After hours of listening to music quietly enough, not to damage your hearing, and with enough isolation from the outside world not to be bothered by people talking on the phone next to you, I'm happy to say this has been a very good purchase. Environments that I previously didn't like before because I could not focus, are now perfectly fine for work, study. And the quality of sound is indeed superior.",

I tested the top end options and although the sound from the Bose was amazing I listen to a lot of heavy metal / bass heavy music and I just couldn\u2019t get the depth of sound I wanted. I went for the Sony and haven\u2019t been disappointed, they are amazing. I can listen to my music at a much lower level (saving my ear drums), I don\u2019t hear any of the booming music that the gym plays and they stay put throughout my training session.

I have not tried the BOSE and maybe they are more comfortable but i don't have any regrets with the SONY product (no comfort problems so far). The only thing I didn't realise is that there is a choice between the ANC functionality OR Google Assistant/SIRI using the hardware switch, using the app you can dynamically switch between the 2. For me I would rather keep it as ANC so it doesn't matter. Sound quality is good and I am happy.",

They are well made, leather is great, gesture control is really cool and the app does some great stuff. Particularly cool, but potentially a bit gimmicky, is the voice focus and ability to make the music come from different angles. There is a newer version of these, with battery and feature upgrades, but for the price you aren\u2019t going to get anywhere near this quality anywhere else. Well done Sony.",

Only other gripe is the upper limit of volume is rather quiet too. My ears are fine, trust me I don't have hearing issues. Yet, anyway! Overall I'm happy with them, glad I got them in the sale for \u00a3200. Wouldn't pay more than that.",
