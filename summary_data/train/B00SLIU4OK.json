I work in an office but frequently have to go out to agricultural fields and these boots are very adequate in both atmospheres. Very happy with my purchase. Would buy them again",

      "text": "I was just going to return this shoe due to the annoying squeak but I read NightSky724's review and he nailed it. He used vaseline in his fix. I used a silicone spray on one shoe and a product called Ballistol on the other, just as a test. Both worked just fine and entirely eliminated the squeak. Apply the lubricant sparingly (use something that is leather friendly) to the area shown in the attached photo (tip of orange pointer) where the tongue rubs against the two sides. You might as well coat the entire tongue for a uniform color. BTW these shoes are great if you have a bunion issue. I'm thinking about ordering another pair just for a backup.",

I was right, it fits perfect, holds my foot just snug enough that it doesn't roll inside the shoe.

Recent flooding rains in the South made evading puddles impossible making feet wet again. Will try spraying with waterproofing product, but if default is in the seams it won't help. Will try though because shoes are very comfortable. As I thought, spraying did not improve anything. NOT waterproof. Obviously defective when made, but...very comfortable. Good walking/working boot just stay away from wet grass, puddles.",

More comfortable than expected, fit as expected, priced very competitive.",

One thing I will say is that they discolor very easily when in contact with road salt. It turns them a much lighter color in that spot. It's easy to get out the salt, water and a rag worked, but living in the far north, road salt is a given in the winter and having discolored shoes walking into meetings and presentations isn't exactly putting my best foot forward.",
