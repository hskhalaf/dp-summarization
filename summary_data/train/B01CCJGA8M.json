FFS how much do you have to spend to get a \"REAL, WORKING\" dash cam. One that works ALL the time not intermittently. I bought this one because of the price (just under $100). Had purchased others under or around $50 but returned them because they were crap. I own quite a few electronic devices that never fail. How come no one can produce a dash cam that DOESN'T FAIL or do I have to spend $400?",

The battery doesn't last no more then 30 minutes but it you keep it plugged in all the time it will keep recording and you don't have to worry about the battery life .. I do wish the SIM card space was a lot more but it makes due .. I would recommend this camera to anyone",
