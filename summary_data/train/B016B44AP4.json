The 3D surround technology was impressive and I have it set up in a non-standard room with limited wall space behind me for 'bouncing' the sounds. Right out of the box the surround was impressive. After I used the built in system to fine-tune the surround, it was worse. I deleted the tune and went with stock. Tested it listening to Logan and John Wick. The surround was impressive. I was not so sure until the pool-bar scene in Logan where I could hear the pool tables behind me. Nice.",
