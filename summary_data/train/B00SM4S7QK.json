It's VERY magnified, shows every wrinkle, blemish and pore. It was pretty shocking at first, but i'm getting used to it now and my makeup job is much more professional looking. It really shows every flaw, but the end result is great for flawless make up. Getting the makeup on while being unable to avoid every wrinkle, blemish and pore is disconcerting, but when you're finished and look into a regular mirror you'll look spectacular. I thought \"whew, this is much better!\" .",

I used the screw in type due to the mirror will be moved quite often. That being said it was easy to install. I only recommend that you install at the right height for you because it only moves side to side. Will not adjust up and down, only the mirror itself swivels. I would use this again in another house.",
