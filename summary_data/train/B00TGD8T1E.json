I did not buy the shoe for how it looks, rather the performance. I would definitely buy another pair after I retire these. Update, I've worn out my original pair, just placed another replacement.

My big toes' nail are turning black. :( - Though cushy at first, I started feeling the pavement just after a few weeks of running in them. - I don't think this shoe is made for everyday pavement and asphalt running.",

Well it was a good idea but does not work. the arch becomes really hard, the front of the sole is very thin and hard. you don't feel the boost anymore.",

I stopped using them a couple weeks and then tried again on a treadmill and even though I didnt get shin splints, my feet ached. I did like how light they were, but they dont have much cushion. I now use them strictly for walking long distances like a trip to the zoo or safari park. I would not recommend these and I'm upset I wasted $80.",
