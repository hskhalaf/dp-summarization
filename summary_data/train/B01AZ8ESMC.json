It works the same as the old one I had and serves the purposed I bought it for *my young daughter.* I am only disappointed that I can not download Hulu *this version is not compatible with your device*. This is extremely frustrating. I've got Hulu on my Samsung phones and Amazon tablets, why won't it work here!? I've been able to download quite a few other streeaming and network apps w/out issue...but no Hulu. Smh.",

Good quality, has decent weight, speaker could be louder and have better sound quality but I think my daughter will love it! I'm debating whether I should buy one for myself!",
