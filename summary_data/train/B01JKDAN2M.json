I ended up giving it away and opting for another unit (Invisiclean Claro) which had a DC Motor. The benefits of DC motors are: less than half as noisy, MUCH longer lasting fan motor, and use about 80% less electricity. It's like going from incandescent bulbs to efficient LED. If this company made them with a DC motor I'd buy a few of them.",

      "text": "Bought just over a year ago. Pleased with the air cleaning. Though now it makes a terrible squeaking noise while operating. It\u2019s so obnoxious that my son with allergies can no longer sleep with it running, even on the lowest setting. I\u2019ve emailed customer support, so will update you when I get a resolution. Update on Feb 26, 2019 - very good experience with support. Went through their troubleshooting and sent in video of the noise. They quickly responded and sending out a new fan now. Updating to 4 stars. Great service. Would have liked to see fan last longer, so not 5 stars yet",

I love how quiet it gets into sleep mode, and I appreciate that it is loud enough to serve as a white noise machine when it is run on high. A major factor for me in this purchase was the affordable cost of replacement air filters. If I could change anything about the design, it would be adding an option to dim the LED lights without turning it all the way down to sleep mode. I run it at high when I sleep, Because I like the white noise. I wish I could turn the lights down then too.",
