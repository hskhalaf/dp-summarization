Cons - after a few days of using the serum, the skin on my face got really itchy, turned red, and broke out. I also experienced peeling, flaky skin. My review of negative experience with this product was blocked from Kiehl's web page, as they said I violated terms for posting. My review said only that the product unfortunately didn't work for me, and i experienced dry, flaky skin and redness after using. I use quite a few Kiehl's products, and am a fan in general, and I intensely dislike the suppression of negative constructive product reviews.",

Also, I SWEAR my eyelashes are growing! Thank you amazon for carrying this product.",
