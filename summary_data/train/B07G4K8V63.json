While it did not take the pain away, it did considerably lessen the aching (from an irritation factor of 9 to like a 3). The effect lasted for about 3 hours after applying. I did find it a bit greasy, which is why it is rated 4 instead of 5 stars.",

This is the first cream I have tried, and am interested in the forms that have arnica and msm, but for the price, I have no complaints. I\u2019ve ordered it twice and will again.",

After the shingles healed the pain remained, that left me with PHN, which is a pain that my doctor says could last a month, a year or longer, Since starting on Hemp Activ my pain is very manageable.,......So I highly recommend this product.",

Before I received this cream, I was in terrible pain, was only getting about 3-4 hours of sleep per night, taking way too much NSAIDs (ibuprofen, etc.) and could not walk without a limp. I received the cream and was amazed at how much it helped relieve my pain the first time I applied it. I am please to say that I slept 7 hours the first night, reapplied again in the morning and was able to walk almost without a limp. The pain is not entirely gone but it is a pain that I can live with, without having to take any pain meds!!!",
