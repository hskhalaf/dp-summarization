      "text": "My dog, a 77lb St. Bernard/boxer puppy loves these, except they are not \"long-lasting\" as other readers have suggested. His white fur stains and he ends up kicking himself until he's red trying to get it all off. He loves eating them and one takes him less time to go through than his food bowl. I will not purchase again, as he needs to stay busy with something that lasts longer and doesn't stain his fur.",
