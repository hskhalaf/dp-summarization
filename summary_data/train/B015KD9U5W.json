However, aside from promising good looks, the shoe offers the same advantages it did in the early 1980s when it was released as a running shoe.This is probably the reason why several generations of sneaker fans continue buying these shoes not only for its nostalgic appeal but also for its consistent delivery of a comfortable midsole cushioning, a snug fit and a durable outsole to last for years.",

Overall it is a nice looking shoe and relatively comfortable. There is minimal arc support, which at times causes issues for me after an extended period of time, but overall they are nice to wear so long as they are still in good condition. These shoes have had a lifespan of about 4 months of everyday wear. After 4 months the heel started to flatten out and the sole's cushion started to give way.",

The sole is a little thinner than some other sneakers, and the shoe is probably not best for heavy extension on nasty surfaces, but as an everyday shoe, it's wonderful. What's more, the upper is not gaudy, not a teenager's attempt to grab attention, so these are nice shoes to wear while working in an office or while teaching.",

I put some extra thick insoles in them to compensate for some of the roominess and that seemed to work a little. Oh well; they were only $31 so, I will use them for the gym. The shoes that fit me the best by far seem to be converse and onitsuka tigers - they make 12 1/2. If only the other shoe companies started too as well.",

Speaking of size.... I had read several reviews on these shoes along with other similar style Pumas, and a common theme was that the can run a1 /2-1 size smaller. So I finally decided to go with the full size larger than the normal 11 I wear. I think that a 1/2 size bigger would've done the trick but the 12's are not too big. Would definitely recommend these shoes to a friend",

They may have been responsible for getting me into the VIP lounge at JKL. They're comfortable for sure and seem like good quality. The only complaint I have is that they don't breathe and may make your feet overheat when you're out looking awesome.",
