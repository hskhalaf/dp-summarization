It doesn't change how great the shoes feel but when those lugs roll (while scaling over rocky terrain) they are a tripping hazard. Seriously. I tried Gorilla Glue with a 24hr curing time and that worked for about 30 minutes of walking... :-) I am now going to attempt to contact the seller and get their reaction. I absolutely love the fit and feel of these shoes both on & off the trail. Disappointed in the sole quality... (previous review): The fit perfectly, great quality, excellent design.",

These completely fit the bill. They have great tread, perfect for climbing up the Xunatunich ruins in Belize, and he did not get any blisters despite wearing them on this 4 hour hike for the first time. Incredibly comfortable (per husband) and definitely will buy again when these wear out. They're pretty durable, so I am guessing that will be quite some time down the line.",
