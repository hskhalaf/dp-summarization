      "text": "Overall this is a great coffee pot for the money. The only thing that prevents it from getting a 5 star rating is that there is a persistent smell of hot plastic that comes from the base of the coffee pot. It does need to sit on a pot holder to prevent burning of a table. The plastic in no way seems to be melting, or in anyway does it appear to cause damage, but the smell is annoying. Other than that, ours regularly makes 1-2 pots of coffee a day and stays on for about 4-5 hours a day with no other problems noted.",

I am so glad I purchased this Hamilton Beach percolator. It not only makes great coffee now I don't have the large coffee maker taking up counter space. Instead, I have my percolator, which looks beautiful. I personally, do not have any problems cleaning it or setting it up to brew. What really surprised me, is how quick it prepares the coffee. It keeps the coffee hot for quite some time, I finish the pot before it gets cold anyway.",

At this point, the blue brew light May or may not light and the green ready light doesn't come on at all. If the pot is on, the house smells of plastic. Very disappointing.",
