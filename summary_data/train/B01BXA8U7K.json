Update 31DEC2018: Filled this 3 months ago and placed it on a shelf to test if it would evaporate like a zippo does, as of today, it was still lighting with a single strike! Not sure they will work in a windy situation, but it seems to be a great emergency fire starting option(one of many I have)! This is so good, I ordered a second one to add to my wife's go bag.",

Best of all, it gives you a actual flame, not just a spark... definitely recommend, and will be purchasing more myself.",

    "description": "This clever tool is an invaluable, possibly life-saving utensil that is equally at home in your wallet, purse, bug-out bag, toolbox, or even the kitchen drawer. The all new design is made out of solid stainless steel, making it even more rough, tough, rugged, and ready for the trail. The improved design holds double the fuel of the original Everstryke match and believe it or not, we\u2019ve managed to make it even more simple to use! Grab one today to make sure that no matter where you are, you're never more than an arm's length away from a fire source. Note: Lighter fluid is not included...you must add your own.",
