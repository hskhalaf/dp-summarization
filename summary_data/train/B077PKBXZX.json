      "text": "I was skeptical of buying paint on Amazon, especially at this low price point. I'm sure glad I made the purchase. What an incredible value for a great paint! I was a professional painter for over 15 years and am quite a critic. Given the coverage of this paint, I'd expect to pay well over $25/gallon. I did a side-by-side comparison with 4 alternative paints that were all much more expensive and none of them covered like Montage. Two coat application was necessary for each paint I tested (as expected) but the uniform finish was best with Montage. I'll certainly be using this paint again for my next project!",

Bc of my brown marble kitchen counter tops and the lighting in my kitchen, the paint can look gray on dark gloomy days even though it\u2019s a nice neutral cool brown. Didn\u2019t bother me but just be aware of this when choosing the paint color! I only used half the container which is 1 gallon to do 2 coats to my kitchen cabinets.",

The matte finish really hides the imperfections in the wall. The smell was not bad at all. Typical new paint smell that dissipated after a couple hours. I wish this company had more colors because I am sold on this paint!",

We did need two coats as the previous color was still showing through after the first coat, but one gallon was sufficient for our 110 sq.ft. room, we have a good amount left over that will be great for touch ups as needed. Definitely recommend. Color: Dove Grey",
