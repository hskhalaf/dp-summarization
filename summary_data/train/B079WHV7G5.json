So, I've tried several brands and this is my favorite. I like 4th generation vanilla bean but for sweet treats and such. Overall, plain ghee, this texture is silky, smooth and velvety in terms of mouth feel. Flavor is full butter. You can taste the freshness. I use it to sautee everything - spinach, kale, asparagus and mushrooms. I use it for eggs too. Sometimes, I eat it out if the jar. This stuff is true to it's name - gold nugget of goodness.",

    "description": "Size:8 Ounce (Pack of 1)CLARIFIED SPREADABLE BUTTER 8oz\n\n Why is our Gold Nugget Ghee special? Here in Northern California we benefit from a rainforest environment that allows our cows to have full-year access to green grass pastures. We then lovingly clarify our cow butter over a slow open flame to remove all the water and milk solids. The result is a delicious decadent spread with nutty buttery notes and choc-full of health benefits. Ghee is high in Vitamin A, D, K2, Omega 3's, and Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA). \n\n Ghee is considered the golden elixir of Ayurveda, and originates in ancient India. \n\n Use as a healthy alternative to butter, cooking oil in recipes, or blast your brain with essential fats in your morning coffee or tea to get your day started!\n\n Gold Nugget Ghee is the highest grade product made with your health and our planet in mind.\n\n Store in a cool, dry place. Refrigeration is optional. While clarified butter is shelf stable, use a clean utensil to avoid introducing anything foreign into the jar. \n\n Ingredient: Organic full-year/pasture-raised butter (milk)",
