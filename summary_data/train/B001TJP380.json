They're solid, cheap to replace and simple to put together. If it can survive half of the town's babies and toddlers, it can probably survive your kiddo at home. Don't get me wrong-- it's no-frills. It's just the wooden structure- no padding, no cushion, but it's pretty a pretty good buy. My kiddo doesn't so much sit on it as use it as a climbing frame or ladder to reach counter tops, but I can't complain.",
