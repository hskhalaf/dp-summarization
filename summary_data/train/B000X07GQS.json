In 3 hours it drained 18\" of water- probably close to 5000 gallons. We used the U.S Pool Supply brand 1 1/2\" x 50' hose found here on Amazon, I'm sure it would be a much longer process with a garden hose. We had hoped to purchase the 1/3 hp version but that one wouldn't ship for 1-2 months, so we went with this 1/4 hp model. Very happy with this purchase!",

      "text": "Feels like a solidly built pump. Very easy to operate. I put it in a large flower pot filled with water and the thing purged the bucket off the water in under a minute. I don't think asking a rating for longevity is a fair question because I don't know how long it's going to last . I plan to install it in our rain barrel to power our drip irrigation system, but I feel the pump is got more power than may need to extend the irrigation system to farm out all that power. Overall, looks and feels solid, easy to operate out of the box.",

      "text": "I've been using it to pump out kiddie pool on our deck (about 1000 gallons) and it works really well. I didn't time but it takes about 10 minutes or less. Attaches straight to a garden hose and is very quiet. It is able to pump down to a very low level of water where I can just tip the pool and dump the rest. I also has a mesh guard to keep any floating stuff from getting into the pump. Really helped me change the water more frequently to keep it nice and clean. Very happy with this pump and it might have some other utility use down the road but my main intention was to maintain kiddie pool.",

I had the pump connected to about 25 feet worth of garden hose and it pumped just fine. Only concern is the legs it stands on are pretty small plastic pins, i fear it could puncture the vinyl though as of now it has now. Overall works good, I would recommend it to others.",

It is quiet (relative to other pumps this size I've run), it is reliable and it is powerful for it's size and it's power and distance ratings. I would highly recommend a Superior pump to anyone for any application.",

I use it in an outdoor sump that collects rainwater from the gutters. The water often has small bits of leaves and other debris, and these tend to get stuck in the thin openings in the plastic mesh that protects the rotor blade. This means water can't actually enter the blade chamber, so the pump stops working. I've recently removed the plastic mesh entirely, and it seems to work for now, but I'm sure it's only a matter of time before something larger jams the actual rotor blade.",
