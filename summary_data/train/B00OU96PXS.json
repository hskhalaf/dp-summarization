The sole is a little rigid at first but it loosens quickly. The cushioning is great for any kind of run. They look great, both stylish and functional. Extremely comfortable. My wife and I both own a pair, she over pronates and I don't. These shoes work perfectly for both of us. If there were downsides to this shoes I would list them but as far as I can tell, there aren't. I love that Asics still makes all black shoes, it is hard to find nice looking all black, quality running shoes.",

I have a pretty narrow size 13 foot, and this shoe and its predecessors have always fit nicely. This is marketed as a sort of \"middle of the road\" shoe - not particularly geared toward under- or over-pronated gaits. My Asics shoes have held up really well over the years, and I typically wear them well beyond the 300 - 600 mile recommendation for running shoe life, probably in part because my treadmill has some shock absorption.",

I've found it's best not to pull the laces before tying as it makes them almost too snug. I used to wear wide, but was finding the sides were choking my foot. I slipped these babies on and haven't had foot pain. Even though these have gel inside, get some gel inserts. The extra gel really helps with standing all day in retail.",

They do have arch support which would probably be adequate for people with arches but on advice of my PT I add a thin, full length arch support (orthotic) under all my shoes' insoles to keep my feet happy.
