Only the puma design is leather and most of the shoe is a cheap synthetic material. Also, there is no stitching round the outside of the sole. I presume this means the upper is simply glued on, so I am expecting these to fall apart like the last pair of cheap pumas I bought. The \u00a360 RRP Pumas are usually better quality. At \u00a335 these cheaper quality of these shoes is maybe tolerable, but I won't buy them again.",

The trainers feel heavy and even though the size is right, and most importantly, they don't fit properly on the feet. There's a gap on both sides between the ankle and the fabric which doesn't give a great look when wearing the trainers. I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy those specific shoes as it would be a waste of money.",
