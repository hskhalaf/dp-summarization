Unfortunately, after wearing them for this short period and for very light work, I find they do not breathe resulting in \"swamp\" foot after a 12-hour shift. I work exclusively indoors, so these would be terrible for someone who works outside. Also, after this short period, I noticed the upper is separating from the sole, so these will be worthless within a couple of weeks.",
