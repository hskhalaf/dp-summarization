These blades should be twice the size, but it's just a tiny little blade the width of two fingers. Three if your fingers are ridiculously thin.

Blades pulled at the hair on my back and didn't cut, plastic tab also broke off when removing the cutting head to see what the issue was. Returned and bought the cheaper version without the rechargeable batteries and it worked perfect. Buy the cheaper version!",

The head is simply too small, if you have any sizable area to shave. The worst thing is this shaver scratches the living hell of of my back. I have red scratches all over my back that stay there for a week and right after shaving my skin feels like it\u2019s on fire from all the irritation. Of course I WOULD send it back but I missed the window by 8 hours....neat. Bottoms line look somewhere else",
