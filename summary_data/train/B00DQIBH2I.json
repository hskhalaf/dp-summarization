I was disappointed in the quality of my camera phone pictures and wanted the flexibility of an interchangeable lens camera without all the bulk of a DSLR. This camera has so many options and easy to use menus to customize your pictures if you want, but you can also use the auto settings for great pictures, too. I am looking forward to learning more about this camera this summer. It comes with a manual that is easy to follow. I am really happy with this purchase and Amazon's pricing is great.",
