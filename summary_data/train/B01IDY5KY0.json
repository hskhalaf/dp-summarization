It\u2019s too bad that the Dolby at most while not perfect, this is still the best sound bar I\u2019ve ever heard. It\u2019s too bad that the Dolby Atmos doesn\u2019t work over ARC with Samsung\u2019s own TVs, but then there isn\u2019t a lot of content for that right now anyways. Even though this is a very wide sound bar, it\u2019s still isn\u2019t wide enough to get particularly good stereo separation. However, the audio quality itself combined with a really good sub woofer makes up for it. Voices are very clear, bass is deep and shakes the room, so for the money it\u2019s hard to complain.",
