After 90 minutes of trying to figure out where my documents were going (after choosing a folder on my drive) I still couldn't find them. My rule is simple...on products like this, if they aren't easy to operate they go straight back. This is one of them. :(",

It does very long receipts if I choose the paper option. The receipt shows up on a black background. Probably a way to fix that but not concerned about it. It's quieter than the Scansnap as well.",

Too bad Air Printers have yet to manufacture items that do what they are advertising to do. This All-in -one advertising is a joke don't mess around. Buy this very small but east to use scanner. I've not been sorry. The ease of use and software included makes life so much simpler.",
