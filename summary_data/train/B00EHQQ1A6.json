Do a bit of research and you will find that true peruvian maca (the one with the medicinal qualities) is Lepidium peruvianum Chacon. Any product labeled as maca but having Lepidium meyenii as the ingredient, is actually a plant from Bolivia that isn't a true maca plant. Wish I would have known that before I wasted my money.",

The point is not the taste though, i feel it gives me energy and has helped with everything. Im 4 weeks postpartum with hormones everywhere and this is a huge help. I dont feel so anxious/depressed and tired. It also helps with appetite regulation. I was eating over 3000 calories some days and now im down to about 2300 (i exclusively breastfeed).",
