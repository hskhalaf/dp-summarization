I'm becoming very annoyed at the \"only available as addon\" stuff from Amazon, but I guess that's how they are making up for their losses on PRIME? There were indeed 4 in the box, price point was great, pulling up the wick a touch via pliers helped a ton, not timed one but I presume that has taken 40% or so off the '100 hours' of run time. Still a great thing to have in the house here in Hurricane Land or car glove box in areas that get heavy snow.",

I suspect, given that some of it is still in liquid form, that it would work, though I can't be completely sure. I really wasn't expecting them to freeze like that above zero. It seems to me that emergency candles need to hold up better in extreme cold (many probably buy them for winter vehicles). I can't speak to how they work, only to comment on the freezing point...that may be a consideration for those looking to buy these.",
