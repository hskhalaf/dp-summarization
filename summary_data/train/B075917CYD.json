So far I'm so i excited for this pouch. I got it to hold my atomizer for vaping. My atomizer kept tipping over in my purse leaving the juice everywhere which, mind you, isn't easy to get out. This pouch is just the right size, material's light weight but strong and it hangs on my belt perfectly at work. I can also fit my phone in it. I hope it holds up. M",
