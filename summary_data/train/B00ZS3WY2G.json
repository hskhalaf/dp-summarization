The only issue I have is that all the weight of the apron and whatever you carry in the pockets rests on the back of your neck - ended up rubbing the back of my neck raw. I replaced the straps with the Dickies apron suspenders which really helps redistribute the weight to your shoulders. It was an unexpected additional expense that I hope can be incorporated into future designs.",

I have used it several days now and it is starting to move a bit more easily, but also I an getting used to it. It performs it's function very well indeed. I am a \"wiper\", and my pants and shirt would always be filthy at the end of a day's work. With this apron on, I can wear the same work clothes more than once. I really, really like it.",

First the right side went and then the left. I have had this happen with cheap cloth aprons, but never within a few hours of putting it on. It seems like all the extra stitching on these two spots have actually compromised the integrity of the cloth under the pocket. I really wanted to like and use this apron, but I will be sending it back.",

Very well constructed of decent weight canvas with ample pockets for my needs. The 1 inch Neck and back straps much more comfortable wearing in contrast to the thin straps used on other brands. Only initial minor issue I had with this apron is the stiffness of the waxed canvas. Need to beat it up a bit to get it to get the stiffness out of the canvas in order to feel more comfortable while wearing it in the workshop.",

The only things that I'm not 100% satisfied with are the pocket arrangements and the neck strap. It would be nice to have an additional chest pocket with slots for pens/pencils so they weren't just floating around in the pocket. Also a better way to clip on a tape measure. The neck strap isn't padded or anything, so depending on how much stuff you have in the pockets, it'll start to give you a neckache after a couple hours. Overall I'm pleased with the purchase though.",

This is a classic, the kind of apron worn by generations of working people. Just keep in mind, it will take some time to break in, just like a good pair of leather boots. Its made from natural products. It'll be stiff and feel like you're wearing a sheet of cardboard at first, but only for a while. Wear it around a while. In time your movements and body heat will soften the stiffness out. Then it will feel like it was made for you. What could be better?",
