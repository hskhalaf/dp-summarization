While many users enjoy the improved responsiveness, some still find themselves more comfortable wearing a stiffer and more solid shoe like Reebok Legacy Lifter.",
      "pros": [
        "Users agree across the board that the shoe provides a solid and stable base for weightlifting exercises",
        "Its elevated heel helps to improve ankle mobility and achieve deeper squats, according to many wearers",
        "Some avid weightlifters enjoy the shoe\u2019s flexible forefoot because it helps them get a better ground feedback",
        "The new textile upper allows the toes to splay more easily in this model, which was lauded by the experts",
        "Multiple buyers admire the new minimalist design of the trainer"

      "cons": [
        "More than a few athletes think that the forefoot flexibility detracts from stability, especially for heavier lifts",

I'm sure with a few uses they will adjust!",

It was hard justifying spending so much money on an items when I am only a beginner and my Converse was doing what I need them to do (provide flat support). I came across these shoes which was within my budget and figured I would try them out. Great product! I have a better understanding for the need for Weight lifting specific shoes. While these shoes are not as flashy as the 200-300+ pairs, it does EXACTLY the same thing without breaking the bank. Great option especially for Flat footed people such as myself since these shoes do stretch a bit.",

Also, the 13.5 was only $45 for a $200 shoe. However, I believe a 13 would have worked fine. I only squat in these and for that and the money the 13.5 works great. I had been squatting in an almost totally flat shoe prior to this. These are a great improvement .",
