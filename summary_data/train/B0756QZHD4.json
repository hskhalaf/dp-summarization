Both my 5 year old and my 18 month old play with them. It's a very simple but fun toy and they are so beautiful to look at. Very well made.",

She loves stacking and nesting toys, so I think she'll have loads of fun with these, along with trying to figure out what other small toys she has that will fit inside each one - other than the next nesting doll size down. Some of the clear shrink wrap was split on the seams that covered the painted dolls, so the company that produces them should actually invest in clear wrap that is a little higher quality for shipment purposes and so none of the paint is rubbed off from handling. Otherwise, I find them to be adorable.",
