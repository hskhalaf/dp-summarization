It\u2019s rather impressive. It seems well made, durable, each slot usb 3, and a slim flat profile makes it easily portible. It does the job. So far, I\u2019m impressed.",

Just be aware of the limitation. Also, it tends to run hot. That's just with it hooked up/nothing in it. Not horribly but noticable. Overall it's cool because it \"works\" so I'm not upset at all.",
