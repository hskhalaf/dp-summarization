The instructions clearly indicate that you are not meant to use this pan over very high heat on stoves or in ovens, and frankly you should not need to. I have it used it, no kidding, several dozen times since I bought it and I have yet to do any kind of scrubbing to get it back to like-new. I do a lot of cooking and while I can appreciate the advantage of using tri-ply etc. I don't think it's worth the extra expense. This is an excellent product!",

Food cooks evenly on our propane gas stove, and the lid fits well. I am a little concerned about what one reviewer wrote about its not being made of real stainless steel. How do you find out what exactly its content is????",

The quality on this is outstanding, which isn't a surprise since it is Cuisinart!",
