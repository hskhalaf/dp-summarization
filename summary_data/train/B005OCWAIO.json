      "text": "I sprinkle a little of this on my siamese cats' hard and wet food daily and it has really helped cut down on their loose stools, gas, and vomiting. This powder contains ezymes of pre and pro biotics together which is great... the prebiotics give healthy enzymes for the probiotic bacteria to eat. I noticed improvement in my cats' digestion almost immediately. One 1lb container lasts me about 6 months for two cats. Be careful to read the directions and not overdo digestive enzymes... too much can make the problems worse or introduce new issues.",
