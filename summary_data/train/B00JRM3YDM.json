THIS IS JUST CHEAP CHINA JUNK and a waste of your time.

A warm amber makes the entire room beautifully cozy. No need for a lamp shade ! These look wonderful all by themselves. No wonder they're so popular ! I highly recommond them. Make sure you get \"Edison\", not copy cats... Remember, they light is on the dim side....so buy 60W if you want it a little brighter :)",

Of course being only 40W, this won't illuminate much space, but you are buying this type of bulb for the aesthetics rather than efficiency. It emits a warm orange light that really accents wood tables or desks, so that was an added bonus I had not anticipated when purchasing this. If you are looking at Edison bulbs, than you obviously have something in mind in regards to how you want to use it. Buy it and you'll have quite a throwback experience!",
