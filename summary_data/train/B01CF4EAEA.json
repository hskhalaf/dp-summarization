The first item though wasn\u2019t as fresh as I thought it should be. The corn chips seemed not as crisp as they should be. So I\u2019m wondering if anything else is not as fresh? I\u2019ll update this if I find something else not fresh.",

So I figured a box f vegan snacks would be perfect since the rest ofher family isn't vegan. She loved it. Not sure if she ate everything in the box... I'd hope so since her birthday was like 6 months ago. But anyway, this makes a great gift for a vegan who is surrounded by non-vegans",
