So I ordered a second one which came the next day--again without user instructions or warranty card. I returned this one also and got a full refund...and ordered a completely different hard drive. So I cannot comment on how well this item works as I did nothing more than take it out of the box, put it back in the box, and returned it. This lack of user manual and warranty card has been mentioned by several reviewers, so it evidently is a quality control problem with the manufacturer.",

Dosen't heat up too much, very fast data transfer, and it is indeed impact and water resistant (accidents have tested both features). Its also pretty light, which I prefer, some of these drives can get very heavy and are annoying to carry. My only con is that the little clips that are suppose to hold the USB cable along the outside popped off and got lost wothin a few days of using them, and didn't hold onto the cable well to begin with. I will probably buy a second one.",
