These earbuds come with three different sizes of covers, perfect for those of us with smaller ears. These earbuds are super comfortable to wear. I like that the plug is at a 90 degree angle; I'm hoping that will help with the life since I use them with my phone and an armband at the gym. It seems like this would put less stress on the connection, but only time will tell. I would definitely buy these again.",

These are such a lightweight deign that I thought they would break at the first moment of tension on the line. On the contrary, these little buds are more durable than any others I have tried. The microphone is clear and the sound is incredible. The guards they give you make it so that these almost never fall out, even during and intense workout. Great little pair of headphones that would make a great stocking stuffer.",

The bass is moderate still but more present than before, the mids are very clear, and the highs are no longer too strong, just nice and crisp without being shrill.",

I prefer those for audio quality but for comfort and build quality I prefer the JBuds. These are fine for Rock and Metal but I'm going to look for something slightly better.
