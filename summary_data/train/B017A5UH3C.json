      "text": "It does everything that it says it does, but there are two things that you should be aware of before deciding to buy: The app is very slow to connect to the bulbs, it uses bluetooth to connect so you have to be very near to one of the bulbs or it won't connect at all. You have to use it in a lamp that is open top and bottom so that the bulbs can dissipate heat, otherwise the lamp will automatically turn down it's illumination to cool the lamp. This eliminates most uses in ceiling lamps unless you don't mind the auto dimming after the lamp has been on awhile.",
