After months of driving 100+ miles round trip to purchase a 24-pack of plastic bottles, I can now have it delivered to my door. My only gripe is the price fluctuates which can delay the delivery. I signed up when the cost was just over $16/case and depending on stock, the price increases. Amazon will not ship the product until the stock increases/price drops. That being said, Perrier is addicting. I love the way the carbonation burns my throat; which makes it impossible to ever enjoy regular bottled water again. Perrier also helps with appetite control. The added bubbles allow me to feel full much faster.",

After researching sparkling mineral water, the caution was that some are high in sodium. Perrier and a couple of others have zero sodium listed. Not only that, it clears my throat. I like it chilled, but not over ice, for the melting ice compromises the sparkly. A little more: when we lived in Italy, we learned that the children were sometimes given wine that was half water with their meals. When we occasionally have wine, mixing it with Perrier is very good. Purists, it's okay. To each his own.",

Ergonomic and fits perfectly in the palm of your hand. The cap? Definitely overusing plastic and bad for the environment, but it spins right off. The price? Very competitive based on what I've seen. Bottom line, you either like pamplemousse or you don't. Enjoy!",
