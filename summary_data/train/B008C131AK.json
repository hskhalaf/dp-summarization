With that being said, this product did not match my skin tone. It came off very orange and just not a great match. However, what was more alarming was that the product was somewhat \u2018chunky\u2019? There was little white pieces in it, almost like little exfoliating beads? I thought maybe the bottle I was using was expired so I tried the other one and the same thing happened. I don\u2019t know if this is a common problem but it was definitely sketchy to me and I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for that reason alone.",

      "text": "PROS: First, I like this product. It is lightweight, my face is not shiny and I feel confident in its SPF 30 ability. I have very dry sensitive skin and a regular foundation was too intense for my face to handle. I use this product alone or with other makeup items. I have not had an acne breakouts with this product. CONS: I with this product has a little more pigment. I normally have to put on a regular concealer with this product for a more finished and glowy look. It takes about 5 mins to dry. Your face will look oily for around that time and you need to have patience for it to set into your skin.",
