      "text": "We used this for a 3-4' tree this past Christmas, and it's a perfect stand with a nice, deep well so you don't have to water constantly (and it doesn't spill easily). I had the hardest time finding a stand for a small (but not tiny) tree, but we hit the jackpot with this guy. The screws are easy to use, and screw easily, and since you're dealing with a small tree, it's not nearly the ordeal that putting big trees in a stand is. As long as we're in our little apartment and buying more diminutive Christmas trees, this guy will serve us well. Highly recommend!",
