      "text": "Great sound quality, much better than you'd expect for such a bargain. However they can become uncomfortable after listening for a decent period of time (1-2 hours) as the earpieces rest on your ears rather than around them. Also because of the design, it won't be blocking out much outside noise as sound cancelling is not one of it's strengths. If you're looking for deep, rich sound that you can listen to for hours on end, look elsewhere and dish out the extra cash for a better pair. However if you're looking for quality sound from quality headphones at an unbeatable price, look no further as you won't find better headphones at this price.",

I only had the product for one day, so I'm not sure if that would have improved with time. Since it was shipped directly from Amazon, return and refund was easy as pie.",

From 2014: Pretty tight on my head and ear pieces don't swivel so they crush my ears after a while. But the sound is great and there is good cushioning on the ear pieces.",
