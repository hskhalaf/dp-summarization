      "text": "This cart didn't last a year, the main problem I had with this cart was the weak bond between the wheels and the four metal rods. Construction overall its excellent, it's just that its UNUSABLE if it doesn't have the wheels working. I own some cheap plastic laundry carts and they have lasted more than two years. The company should fix their design flaw. This shouldn't happen especially for the price. Every month I had to tighten the screws so it wouldn't wobble and the wheels just come off easily. 1 star since the wheel and metal frame are not strong.",

I thought that the threaded piece would be welded for this prices and \"commercial\" status..but it appears simply pressed in! It is a defect which will come up..and now that the 30 days has expired, there is no return. I will reconsider buying any more items from Amazon, with such a poor return policy.

First impression: super sturdy, commercial grade wheels, very large size, nice comfortable height to push without breaking your back, good looking (for a laundry basket) with a very big white, thick, waterproof bag. The bag is folded and attached to the top and although you could take it off to carry laundry, it would not be practical or super easy and after all no need since it is on wheels... Will use and update review if anything comes up. So far, love it.",

Screws wanted to walk sideways etc but take a moment to be sure things are all squared and aligned and then it goes together well. Rolls very easy. Size is small enough to tuck in small spaces but still hold a fare amount of clothes. Overall a win!",

Not commercial grade, but more solid than big box store wire products. Upper hanging rack a little wobbly bc it connects via \u201cpush button lock\u201d rather than a screw. Wheels veer off, so you do have to guide it. Wish there was a two tier basket option. Basket is not removable. Excellent for two person apt size.",

The wheels are all wonky at this point, and the entire frame seems to gradually shimmy itself loose with repeated use. Maybe this is great for people who only have to move this amount of laundry a little ways, but for, say, moving large loads to a shared laundry room in an apartment building, it just didn't hold up long term. Which is sad, because it is the PERFECT size for large amounts of laundry, and the bag holding the laundry is super sturdy.",

I am not good at putting things together so I paid someone to do it for it. He took about 15 mins. Love it. The only thing I would have liked is for there to be 2 compartments, one for whites and one for colors. Maybe the Whitmor will pay attention to what customers want and improve their product in the future. Highly recommend it!!! The best laundry basket on wheels on the market from my perspective.
