It just didn't fit that well for us. I bought the ErgoBaby 360 and it's much more comfortable and the baby fits correctly in it. Even though the Performance was supposed to cut down on heat, I really felt there was no difference in how hot the baby and I were in this vs. the 360. Go for the 360.",

If my son had a cooler body temperature and didn't sweat so much, it would have been great. I recommend it if you really want to baby wear, but don't buy more than one until you see if your child gets too hot in it.",

It does suggest practicing this, and I think it's right as I couldn't figure it out from the couple of illustrations it gave. So I think it's a bit hard to use. As I've only used it with my wife, she's put the baby in with me already wearing it on my back. Once the baby is in, it's great.",

Have not tried the 360 to compare but definitely like it better than the baby bjorn. I like how it rests on my hips to support weight like a hiking backpack. May seem bulky putting it on and taking it off but after awhile I can do it super fast. Would recommend it to all my friends.",

And getting the strap that holds your shoulder straps together is nearly impossible without the assistance of another person. That's really the only flaw though but it's a pretty major one since I imagine that's a major purpose of it. If I had extra hands I wouldn't need this thing in the first place. Very durable and well made. Will hold up well.",

I tried the hip place position...it was a bit confusing...but I'm sure after time, I'll get the hang of it. I LOVE the pokets and the hood.

When you have a child nap time can prevent you from leaving the house, but having the Ergo allows my daughter to take naps when I am out doing errand or taking a walk. Another great feature is that it is comfortable. Other carriers hurt my shoulders, but with the Ergo the weight of the baby is distributed evenly throughout my body. Another great feature is the snap on hood. The hood protects the baby from the sun and gives the baby proper head support. Buy it and you will be satisfied.",
