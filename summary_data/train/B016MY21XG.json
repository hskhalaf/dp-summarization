These supplements really seem to help him with day-to-day pain and stiffness, but I would recommend pairing these with a stronger/different brand over time simply because there are some days/seasons where these just are not enough. He eats them like they are treat AND they work excellent as pairs with regular pills. He has to take phenobarbital twice daily for his epilepsy, and I can squish the pills into these Doggie Dailies treats and he eats them right up.

As a person that frequently has to shove things down his throat because pill pockets and hiding them in hot dogs, cheese, etc. don't work, it is great relief to have him look forward to something.

Taking this and the low dosage into consideration, I switched to Cosequin, on sale at Costco for a great price and in the standard dosages offered by most other manufacturers. Avoid this product. It has the potential to make your dogs ill with all the weird ingredients. Stick to what it is known to work....glucosamine and chondroitin.",

We also figured we would place my old guy Shih-tzu on them. Well my young dog continued to improve and run like crazy. The big difference I saw was with my old guy. He is jumping. And his movements seem much easier. They eat them every morning without a problem. I am so happy I have these to help my dogs move easier and have better joint health.",
