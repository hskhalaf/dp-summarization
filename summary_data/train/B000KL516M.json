      "text": "We purchased this fork specifically for moving 20 yards of mulch which is about 2/3 of a dump truck. It takes about 4 full scoops to fill a normal wheel barrow. A flat head shovel would take about 20 scoops and you would have to fight the edge catching on the mulch. This was solid throughout the whole process. We originally went to Fleet Farm and saw their version was 65 dollars so we decided to get this one for half that. We did later see one at Menards for slightly cheaper but not sure how it compares. Overall I would recommend this item.",

To early to tell after one day use, but we might get another of these $28 manure forks which is an overall better design other than the the straight handle, we prefer a \"D stile\" handle .",

I can pick up as heavy a load as I can handle and there is absolutely no flex whatsoever from the handle or the tines. The handle is beefy fiberglass, the grip is nice and thick, and the tines are bigger than they need to be. My kind of tool!",
