You will be without choice but to discard half the tape roll, unused. I have been a subscriber to these sticky rolls; and so, I have used many of them. Without exception, the rollers jam because of that design flaw. I just can't deal with it, anymore. I am finished with this product. No more purchases.",

Despite daily vacuuming, the battle is ongoing. This tool removes all the fur from our clothes in only a minute or two so that we are once again tidy and ready to go.

I primarily use to remove excess dog hair from a blanket on her side of the couch and these suit that purpose well. My pooch will even let me roll these directly on her which was surprising but indicative the level of the stickiness.",

These are only useful for the lightest of lint removal. The strips are not very sticky and if you roll too fast they come apart from the roll and stick to each other. I would equate these to dollar store lint rollers, because you use twice as many strips due to poor quality. I regretted buying the 5 roll pack and will never purchase this brand again.",

Each sheet picks up quite a bit and loses its stickiness quickly though. As far as I can tell, they haven't left any sticky residue behind on anything I've used them on. I happen to lose quite a bit of hair on whatever, and these also work well for cleaning my own hair up.",
