I learned from a physician these are invaluable for anyone, regardless of age. If you're at the computer a lot, Christmas baking, house cleaning - you will be surprised how much this collar saves you from getting aching muscles in your neck. At night, you can wear it to sleep. It may sound uncomfortable, but flip it around and wear it backwards with the smaller piece in the front and bigger in back. You'll never wake up with a stiff neck again.",

Also great for airplanes - much better than the standard neck rest sold for flying. I do agree that the fabric is itchy.
