But it's been only used in the same house and on 1 adult. He's only about 200 lbs max and 6'3. Please refer to the photo attached. But received an extra star for the awesome customer service.",

We had to use it this way for several nights. Other reviewers have noted that this might be because the inflate/deflate dial is not positioned correctly... we tried many different 'Off' positions.

      "text": "This product is 3 years old, and was used for guests only, for no more than a week at a time, a year or so apart. The mattress developed a hole (perhaps during an interstate move, I just don't know..) that could not be patched, so I called customer service. Even tho the warrantee was expired, Marc sent a new one, free of charge, no questions asked. I will always do biz with this company. Marc was a genuine pleasure to speak and do business with, and the mattress was attractive and comfy.",

We've had it replaced once because it would not stay inflated after less than a year. The replacement isn't any better. It can't stay inflated for 24hrs without losing half the air. Very disappointed in this air mattress. I will say the customer service is great as they quickly replaced our first one. Sadly it just hasn't proven to be a reliable air mattress over time. We'll sadly have to purchase a different air mattress for guests.",

Where this shines is the support - the vertical air columns really work well. Cons: Takes longer to inflate (much more than the standard 4 minutes). Sometimes, the motor shuts off and I have to wait for it to cool down (about 30 minutes) to finish inflating. The power cord is a little short - so, you have to keep an extension cable handy. The sides are a little more unstable since there are no air columns there. So, a bit of a squeeze to accommodate 2 people even though it is queen size.",

Problem is that we have to reinflate it every other night because it loses air and it's brand new. I think it is overpriced.
