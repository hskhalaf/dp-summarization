I got out of my car today and the phone fell face down on uneven gravel. The screen protector completely shattered. I peeled it off and there was not a scratch on the $1150 phone. There was also no residual adhesive on the screen. The pack came with 3 which I originally thought was unnecessary. I will now enthusiastically place number two on when I get home from work. Not bad for about 3 bucks a pop.",

They also include a template guide that allows you to drop the screen protector inside the guide allowing for a perfect installation. I've used Maxboost before on older iPhones and have always been pleased. They really stepped up their game with the installation on the new iPhone X.",

I do not know how it\u2019ll fit the other models listed in the title. Also, the installation tray is a good idea but didn\u2019t work as instructed. I wasted one screen protector trying to get rid of the air bubbles with it on. I was having the same problem with air bubbles on the second protector until I removed the tray. I cannot attest to the durability as I have not dropped my phone to the point of cracking my screen.",

It also doesn't reach all the way to the case (also because the phone is rounded), so there's a small gap all the way around. This hasn't seemed to impact the performance though, minus the pulling up already mentioned.",

      "text": "Update- they sent me a new one and also a letter for a credit for a new one. Good customer service. At first I thought this was great. But within 2 weeks I used up all of the protectors in the pack! I\u2019m on my 3rd, which is already cracked In a couple places within one day. I haven\u2019t dropped the phone at all this time and have no clue how it\u2019s already cracked. The other 2 times I did drop the phone (in a case) and it got very cracked. Strange bc I\u2019ve dropped the phone many times in the past without cracks. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s protecting the phone but why does the protector itself crack so easily ?",

      "text": "Great price, Arrived next day, easy to follow instructions, works like any screen protector so i'm very happy. The template is an excellent new feature i have never seen. Being OCD, in the past perfectly applying a screen protector was a 15min job, with the template it made it simple and fast. I aligned the top two corners and slowly let it sit down to the bottom and the bubbles worked out on there own in seconds. Perfectly aligned on my new iphone XS",
