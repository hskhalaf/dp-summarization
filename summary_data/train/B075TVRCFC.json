      "text": "Updated Review: This bag was a little bit big for my back for a small (110 lb) female. I loved the design though. It was super well made and very durable. Fit all of my gear inside with no problem. I was upset I had to return it and it didn't work out, but the company was amazing and sent me a different bag, free of charge! A much smaller model, which I love. Thank you BagSmart! Original Review: Bag itself is great, but it was very large for a smaller female videographer. I was looking for a smaller sized bag. It is a massive backpack!",

      "text": "This is a sturdy bag. It stands up when set on ground. It has nice storage. What I would change about it, is to have access to my cameras on the front side. To access the back side where the cameras are stored is awkward. The straps are in the way. Included inside is a smaller portable bag which is nice. It's too bad the smaller bag isn't big enough to carry a fully assembled camera. Also a strap on the smaller bag to hang over your shoulder would make it ideal. This backpack is my personal item while travelling which is great but it's too bulky to lug around while shooting on assignment.",

It\u2019s kind of big, but I don\u2019t mind it since it leaves me more room for gear! However the biggest downfall of this bag is the poor quality of the materials \u2639\ufe0f I went to open the flap on the inside of the bag, and it tore while I was barely pulling on the zippers. I\u2019m pretty bummed about this considering it\u2019s a $100+ backpack, and I probably can\u2019t get a replacement, I definitely expected better quality materials, but everything else is pretty good and I would still recommend it.",

You can't really fit anything extra except for your camera, some lenses, and your laptop. It become extremely heavy to carry with just that amount of stuff as well. The straps on the outside are also absolutely awful. It takes extreme effort to get the leather strap into the leather hole. This was very poorly constructed, the holes are much smaller than they should be for the straps. I will certainly be sending this product back.",
