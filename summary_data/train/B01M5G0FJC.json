My entire family has sensitive skin and this is my absolute favorite all-natural face sun screen on the market. The stick makes it easy to quickly, but carefully, protect my daughters faces from sun damage. In fact, they enjoy putting it on themselves rather than me having to try to rub lotion in, which usually gets in their eyes. This product does not run into your eyes once you get wet either and it smells fantastic. The whole family really loved it and we will for sure be ordering it again! I am also looking forward to trying other Miami Gorgeous products too!",
