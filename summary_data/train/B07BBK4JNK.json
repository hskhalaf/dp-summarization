Also worth noting is that these tips are softer and more pliable than others I have used. This quality is great for me because I put them on my cat\u2019s BACK paws to stop an itching habit she has, and the regular stiff ones are too curved for back claws. These worked great for the back claws and she isn\u2019t able to hurt herself with her scratching anymore. Very happy and will buy again.",
