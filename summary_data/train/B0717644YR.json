Holds all of my shampoos, creme rinses, etc, Misc. items that you never know what to do with but tend to use daily. I just wheel it out when bathing and wheel it back into the closet when not in use. Holds everything I need, and I never worry whether I'm forgetting something like I would if I was carrying everything back and forth everyday. The drawer is great for those items rarely used that you have trouble finding places to put, but want them when they are needed.",

There weren't that many parts and a first glance it seems to be simple. Once I started I realized that most of it was not quite aligned properly making it difficult to get the screws in. Once the screws were started there was next to no space to actually turn the allen wrench to tighten it all down. The space was so small I couldn't get any other tool in there to do it. I don't think I would buy this again because of how difficult the build was.",

Which simply cannot be pulled out/opened without brute strength, and even then it\u2019s difficult. Assembly was as others stated-holes don\u2019t align well, making this far more time consuming and frustrating to assemble than it should be. The glass insert on top doesn\u2019t really fit well into the opening -it\u2019s not obvious, but it\u2019s not a clean fit. Overall, it looks nice, but without being able to open the drawer, I gave it low ratings.",
