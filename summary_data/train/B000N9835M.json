It\u2019s a beautifully crafted footwear with a surprisingly lightweight build, satisfactory traction on challenging terrain, and a price tag that\u2014although quite expensive\u2014is considered a worthy investment by many. Water intrusion and heat buildup also do not pose a problem as the Light II has a breathable waterproof membrane by Gore-Tex. On the flip side, buyers criticized the boot for having a too-narrow default fit and requiring a long break-in period.",

        "Many wearers found a high level of comfort in this hiking footwear",
        "This above-the-ankle hiker gained positive remarks from a multitude of owners for its waterproof performance",
        "One expert reviewer even conquered streams, snowy regions, and wet grasslands with not a trace of moist on his feet",
        "Many Danner enthusiasts considered the Light II a worthwhile investment",
        "Quite a number of customers were all praises for this leather hiker\u2019s satisfying breathability",

        "Many users weren\u2019t too thrilled about the long break-in time the Danner Light II demands",

After wearing them for a bit, this becomes uncomfortable (kind of feels like there is something inside the top of the shoe rubbing against the top of my foot). I guess it feels that way because there IS something there: extra material...rubbing away... Trouble is, I did not try them until after the 30 days were up. I know, I am stupid, but I was out of town. Anyway, I will try calling Danner and see what they say.",

I definitely cannot wear these in hot weather - but, I have to admit that I'm averse to heat overall, so this may not apply to everyone. Otherwise, I highly recommend these boots. I also have the 400g Elk Hunter made by Danner for Cabela's. That's a great snow boot for extreme cold. Otherwise, I'm happy with my light ii's for snow.",

I went on line and ask the question and Danner Boots came up. After some research I ordered a pair of light weight---Water proof---wide size boots---MADE IN AMERICA.

I typically chose 4e width and wasn't worried about a 2e boot. They are snug just before the toe box and after the first week they seem to be breaking in. The leather is thick and rigid quick is excellent but it will take some time. I need to pick up some leather treatment to help the break in and protection. Very pleased with the boots",
