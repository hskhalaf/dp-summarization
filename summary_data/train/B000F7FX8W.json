Sadly my dinner party is tomorrow night and the salmon I purchased according to the dimensions listed does not fit in the pan. The dimensions printed on the box reflect the smaller size.",

      "text": "We love to cook seafood but have not tried poaching, which is relatively easy and also a healthy way to cook fish. Poacher arrived in perfect condition. We have an oval shaped gas burner so the poacher fit well on it, rather than having to straddle two burners. We also plan to use it in the oven. The poacher is nicely designed, and easy to lift out the contents. We'll be using the poacher frequently, and maybe for other uses as suggested by reviewers.",
