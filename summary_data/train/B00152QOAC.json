I checked the straps when we stopped every 4 hours or so and they were always in place, no issues even with snow and speeds around 80 mph. Would absolutely recommend",

After the trip I noticed that my back bumper has a dent in it where the carrier was resting. I guess the pressure of the straps and drive pressed the unit enough to cause a dent. THAT SUCKS. Now I have to take the care to the body shop to fix the car. Obviously I sent the unit back. Won't buy Thule again",

It gets 2 stars instead of 1 because when the bike is on there, it's super secure. Overall it's very stable, but it's too big and sharp enough to damage your bike. I would not recommend this product. I'm going to try to sand it down and ignore the scratch on my bike.",

My family has some bikes with odd geometry (Time Trial, women's step-through); these require some interesting mounting strategies to get the bikes on.

    "description": "Entry level strap rack featuring Thule's Stay-Put anti-sway cages and patented FitDial hub for precise fit and fold down arms.Thule Fit General Rule: Thule Strap Racks Have Been Designed To Fit Vehicles With Standard Factory Installed Spoilers, Unless Otherwise Specified In Our Fit Guide. Please Note, Thule Cannot Be Responsible For Fits On Vehicles With Aftermarket Spoilers.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\nThe Thule Passage Bike Trunk Mount Carrier is an easy-to-install and use trunk rack carrier with value-added features that make it the perfect choice for an up-and-coming and family oriented cyclists.

Rubberized cradles and no-sway cages for drastically minimized movement.\nView larger. NO-SWAY, NO-HASSLE FEATURES\nTrunk mount carriers do not require a roof rack, are easy to install and offer easy access to bikes. This makes them common, especially with new cyclists and families, but they can also be one of the least stable and awkward options on the road, sometimes leading to bike-on-bike and bike-to-vehicle contact and presenting problems with parking. The Thule Passage Bike Trunk Mount Carrier does away with these issues with its no-sway, no hassle usability. It quickly secures to trunk and/or hatchback seams with multiple straps just like other carriers in its class, but also contains unique setup features. The first of these is a wing adjustment knob and FitDial combo with recommended numerical positions for specific vehicles. This limits the trial and error in how the carrier should lay against your vehicle. Once this optimal fit position is confirmed it is locked into place with easy to turn wing adjustment knobs. Then there is the one-button connection feature for carrier arms, allowing for instantaneous installation, removal and maneuvering of the arms to the side then down and out of the way for parking situations with the carrier on, but empty of bikes. It also features narrow cradle arms, capable of holding a wider range of bike frames including smaller child frames. Most impressive though is the no-sway cage feature. Attaching and extending below each of the rubberized cradles that support your bike frame and attach to the carrier arms, no-sway attachments dramatically reduce bike frame movement front-to-back and side-to-side.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n * Carries up to 2 bikes (2-Bike model) or 3 bikes (3 bike model) on the trunk or hatchback of your vehicle\n * Soft rubber cradles protect bike frame while holding it securely\n * Patented FitDial provides the perfect fit to your vehicle\n * Arms twist to the side, then down when not in use\n * Narrow cradle arms hold a wider range of bike frames including smaller child frames\n * SoftCushion pads protect trunk and hatch\n * Anti-sway functionality to prevent bike to bike contact during transit\n * Vinyl-coated buckles provide firm hold to vehicle and protect against scratches\n * Six strap system secures rack to vehicle\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\nThule Passage Bike Trunk Mount Carrier, all necessary straps and mounting hardware, and instruction guide and warranty information.\n\nLIMITED LIFETIME WARRANTY\nThule will warranty all Thule brand car rack systems and its accessories manufactured by Thule during the time that an original retail purchaser owns the product.

No warranty is given for defects caused by normal wear and tear, cosmetic rust, scratches, accidents, unlawful vehicle operation, or modification of, or any types of repair of a load carrier system other than those authorized by Thule.\n\nABOUT THULE\nThule was founded in 1942 by the Thulin family, when Eric Thulin, a true lover of the outdoors, put the Thule name on a pike trap he designed and began to sell in Scandinavia. It wasn't long before he added other practical items to the company's portfolio. By the 1960s, the company began to concentrate on car-related products, including its first roof rack. The Thulin family sold Thule to the publicly listed company Eldon in 1979, and it has continued to grow both organically and through acquisitions ever since. The Thule Group is a world leader in providing transport solutions for an active life.",
