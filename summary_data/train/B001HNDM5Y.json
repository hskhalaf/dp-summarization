Once scraping the ends of some really corroded jumper cables showed a 15 amp pull from my little Honda's alternator to a big Ramcharger truck battery that went dead. Got it settled down a little to 12.5 amp and started the truck. Probed the truck alternator and found it delivering 70 amp to it's battery. Highest I ever saw was an 80 amp draw on a 12 volt alternator that was hooked up to do welding underground in a coal mine with a probe that cost three times the price. Invaluable tool.",
