The product sits on top of the skin and never fully rubs in, but it doesn't leave too much of a white cast and it's honestly what I'd expect from a good natural sunscreen vs. a chemical one. Since it sits on top of the skin, it can transfer to fabrics fairly easily, and it doesn't always wash out. Even so, I'm really happy with the application and protection, and when I'm out I will repurchase.",

I think it's a huge testament to this product that we only reapplied once all day and none of us got a sun burn! A little goes a long way and it doesn't have a strong \"sunscreen\" smell to it. Make it in small bottles for fitting into pockets next!",

This was very much NOT the case. It has a silvery finish that does not blend in at all. I was excited about a product for Black skin so it was sad that it did not work out.",

However, if you follow the instrucltions to apply 15 minutes before going into the sun and you spread the lotion thoroghly, it stops looking so white and gives great protection.",

It takes a long time to absorb, that was my only negative. It was kind of hard to rub in and then kind of just stayed on my skin for a while. It did work well though, no burn! It did what I wanted and needed for a good price so it was worth it to me.",

However, this does work much better than Mercola's SPF 30, and it rubs in better so you don't look like a white ghost. I still get burnes with the Mercola stuff, this is more effective. I will likely buy it again.",
