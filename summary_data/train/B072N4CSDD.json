      "text": "Material is a fuzzy brown material with wavy pattern, fuzz is about quarter inch long. Reminds me of a blanket. Should hide spills fairly well. Cup holders are plastic with silver paint. Seats are comfy and have good depth, both ends of the couch recline fine so far. It's quite large, but its not designed for laying down, but knew that going into the purchase. Two of the boxes were heavy. The center backs were hidden underneath the end benches. Once I found them the rest of the assembly was pretty much self explanatory.",

That was about 2 weeks ago and I still don't have the refund. After I finally received the couch one of the recliners would not recline (see picture). I had to take a hammer to the metal to remove the obstruction. However, even with all of these issues, I love the couch. It's very comfortable and the quality is excellent for the price. I highly recommend; just be prepared to deal with some headaches along the way.",

The middle part is sinking in and uneven, the back piece behind one of the storage containers broke and falls so we had to use a rope to tie it until I can figure out what to do. I don\u2019t have money to sink into items that don\u2019t hold up and I\u2019m completely disappointed. I\u2019ve emailed the manufacturer so hopefully something can be done.",

We may need someone from the company to come over and help out with the removal of the cushions without damaging the couch. Thank you.",
