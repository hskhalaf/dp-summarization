The reset worked and I got the device paired successfully and it now performs as advertised. Resetting is not intuitive and is not included in the instructions.",

Update: I really enjoy this when I can get it to pair but I travel a great deal and even though it pairs with my headphones at home, half of the time when I am in a hotel room and try to pair it, it will not pair with my headphones. I assume it is due to the numerous background Bluetooth devices. It is supposed to remember my headphones but just does not seem to work. Perhaps faulty but very frustrating.",

So far I've messed around with listening to an old boom box with bt earbuds. And Ive transmitted Spotify and Pandora from my phone to that old boom box. Great sound and it works like a charm. I was alittle worried about attaching it to exquipment at the gym to listen to their hooked up tvs. Was just worried about logistics with the little chord. But it's so little and light that that is no longer a concern. What a nifty little gadget!",

My idea was to use this to transmit the analog audio from an airplane entertainment system to my iPhone, then listen on the Rays, which only has a lightning connector.
