The only downside is that there are only three resistance bands and not five, but that's a minor issue for me. I don't need that much variety in resistance configuration and can get by with two medium and one heavy resistance.",

      "text": "This reformer was the best I could find to fit in a small space. It is fine for doing basic moves and keeping me into my Pilates habit during Covid. However, it's very narrow - I am 5'7\", average build, and I can not put my arms down bedside me on the carriage when I lay down - I have to put my arms across my chest or put my hands under my rear. Also, the padding on the carriage is very thin, so anything I try to do kneeling I need an extra layer of padding.",

      "text": "Once unpacked took about 10 minutes to put together. I don\u2019t have an area where I can just leave it unfolded all the time so I love the fold up feature. I just prop it behind a living room chat while not in use. Not the sturdiest machine, wants to come off the floor about a centimeter when I am doing full 3 band arm work but nothing I can\u2019t deal with. For the price and compact design I love this machine!",

I was a member of a Pilates club and I was devastated when the club closed due to covid. :/ I wish I had purchased this machine sooner... because it\u2019s perfect for the workout that I need! It folds pretty easily so I store it next to my TV, and I unfold it when I\u2019m about to watch my fav shows. For the price... this is a steal! I love it",
