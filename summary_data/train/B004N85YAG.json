Samsung has never made a Bluray player that works well with Netflix streaming and even admits it. It is now July 2013 and the whole unit just crashed. I turns on and off by itself and won't even play discs anymore. Do not buy this product--- or any Samsung bluray players. On the other hand, I love their tvs and have 2 that work beautifully.",

I would rate it 4.5 because I'd prefer to have more internet-available options (such as Amazon Prime videos, for example, rather than only Netflix). But that's a software issue, not hardware. For the hardware, this thing is sleek, silent and sensational. And Region-Free Blu-Ray discs play perfectly, which is really a nice feature. I'm not \"locked in\" to only one region if I get overseas Blu-Rays as long as they're region-free. The closest competitor would be an Oppo (at a MUCH more expensive price).",

After much researching with NETFLIX, etc. it turned out that the electronics in the device must have degraded. It is not a WIFI issue, the rebuffering also happens when plugged in. We have fast broadband. We will try to get a replacement. The remote control is not really cleverly designed, the confirm button is flush with the cursor buttons and therefore hard to find in the dark. Other than that: looks very nice and the system is easy to use overall.",

Upon researching DVD's it seems from other reviews that this is the rule rather than the exception. From what I can read most customers are turning back to Sony which is what I have done. It's on order so wish me luck. Samsung has lost this customer forever !",

It's very noisy when playing a disc and half of the time it will eject a disc for no reason and it has to be reinserted before it will play it. The internet is extremely slow and every other time I use it, it says it needs updates and then I have to wait for half an hour to do that before I can use it. I would not recommend this product.",

Ironically when I turn it on, it takes over the settings of an older samsung tv (not a smart tv) which I find odd, but it is OK. I also wish the DNLP worked a little more user friendly / plug/play. you have to search for things vs. it just 'finding' all of your video in outside sources.",

It does not work, I called many times, downloaded updates which continues to locks up my computer. It never connects to the player or TV. But the rest of the player is fine. This is a new model so they say I have to wait for an update. Its been well over a month and still no update. How can they put out a product and it don't work and have no update to make it work is beyond me. Very frustrating. Other than this its a great player for a good price.",

First of despite purchasing this BD last week the software is already outdated since January, means no current fixes for the 6 months. That would be fine if it's work, but it doesn't! BD found my network but wasn't able to connect to it in Auto mode. Tryed manual- no good. Called Samsung support. The call taker is just waste of time: reste, turn on and off, unplug/replug etc and then transferred to 2-nd line who suggested to turn off the router wirewall ;-( didn't help either. So it will go back to Amazon.",
