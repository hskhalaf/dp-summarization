It was only a matter of time that the speed began to slow down, the smell never dissipated and the unit quit working completely. I first thought it was due to overheating; however, after being left overnight, it never fired back up. Needless to say, it is on its way back in less than 3 weeks.",

      "text": "I am so excited with this mixer. I have made cinnamon rolls, cookies and large batches of sauces. I cater and its wonderful. I can double my cookie recipe and make 13 dozen cookies in one batch. I can make a batch of rolls with 12 cups of flour and it runs smooth. Its so quiet, the deep bowl keeps everything inside the bowl. We did a lot of research for about one year before we bought this dream machine. We were excited that the gears weren't plastic and hopefully this mixer will last a lifetime. Its costly but I think its worth the extra $$$'s. This machine makes me smile!!!",

This has the power for them, but the attachments really are slow. The machine itself is a workhorse. I use it at least 3 times a week!",
