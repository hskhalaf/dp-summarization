I wear 10.5 for all my athletic shoes (running, trainers, and basketball shoes) and these fit just right. I'm deducting 1 star because the Black color I selected on Amazon shows a different color scheme (Yellow UA logo with gray soles), but the one I received is a completely blacked out color scheme. I decided to keep it since I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning and getting a new pair since these will only be using primarily at the gym.",
