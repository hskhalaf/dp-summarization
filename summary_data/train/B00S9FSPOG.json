I also have a pinched nerve between C1 and C2 that causes pain that makes me nauseous.

      "text": "My tween daughter usually needs Dramamine for any car trip over 20 minutes or so. The problem is, of course, that it knocks her out. I bought these despite not being completely convinced that the majority of the positive reviews weren\u2019t paid for or fake. I put Dramamine in the glove box, just in case, and put one of these stickers behind her ear. Not only did she not complain of being carsick, but she even read a book in the car, something she\u2019s never been able to do before. We\u2019re really happy with this purchase. Honestly, I\u2019m still surprised though. I never expected it to work at all much less as well as it did.",

Our trip for 200 miles was without any complaints for nausea and request to stop for burping out.At that time we could reach our destination in clean clothing , nice mood and happy.After that I am having them in my bag as required medicine.",
