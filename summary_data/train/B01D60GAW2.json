It may take a week or so but your ants will be gone. They don\u2019t ingest this. It\u2019s like a barrier that keeps them away/kills them. It\u2019s worth a try.",

I ended up giving the rest of the bag to a friend since he's got a full house to deal with - he was going to spray pesticides but out of concern for his toddler and also the stream he lives near, I convinced him to try this first.",
