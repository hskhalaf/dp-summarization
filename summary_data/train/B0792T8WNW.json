But when the clothes are dried in a dryer it has an unexpected scentless aroma that is a little strange at first, probably because I\u2019m so used to strong smelling detergents. So it doesn\u2019t smell as \u2018fresh\u2019 as you might like. But the product does clean well, but strong stains like ketchup can remain. This detergent works better in combination with Oxyclean powder. There seems to be some type of scent in the formula. But, it\u2019s a great price for the amount you get. Please mark if you find my review helpful. With gratitude, thank you so much. Hopefully this review can help others as well! :D",

I smeared some of the detergent on the collar area (where it's bound to start looking brown), and it came out white as snow! I bought some compression socks on Amazon too. They smelled like straight vinegar so I chucked them in the wash. I put my nose to them as soon as they were done, and they smelled like sweet nothing :) 10/10 would recommend!",

There is virtually no scent. I also mixed it with Oxi to boost stain removing capabilities. I use an old tide cap and put 1 cap full a load. Also they fill the containers as much as possible they're not skimpy on the amount of soap. As you can see from the picture my thumb is holding the spot at the level where the remaining soap is.",
