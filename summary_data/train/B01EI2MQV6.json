One of the best tires out there for any one who loves going offroad. Had them for about a year or so they are daily driven from work to home and every weekend i put about 600 miles driving round trip from odessa tx to el paso tx. they have alot of tread still left on them. I go offroad every weekend (mostly rock and sand) and they work flawlessly. Will definitely buy for same rig or any other 4x4 vehicle",

    "description": "For superior traction in harsh terrain, look no further than the PATAGONIA M/T off-road tire. Whether it\u2019s rocks, mud, snow or sand the PATAGONIA M/T is one tough tire and will provide maximum traction in any terrain. Designed to be at home rock crawling, exploring the desert, mud bogging, playing in the dunes, or a casual drive through mountain trails, the PATAGONIA M/T has all the attributes to overcome any terrain. The high-void tread design is engineered to provide aggressive biting edges while promoting self-cleaning. Staggered, off-center tread blocks provide increased traction while enhancing on-the-road performance. The PATAGONIA M/T\u2019s 3-ply sidewall provides additional protection against impact damage, while stone ejectors combat stone drilling, especially useful for rock crawling and all-terrain exploration. Built to tackle rugged terrain anywhere you may want to explore, the PATAGONIA M/T will allow you to push your vehicle to the limit. This off-road tire is available in LT and flotation sizes for both import and domestic 2X4, 4X4 and AWD vehicles.",
