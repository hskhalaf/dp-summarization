So I would say if you are an adult looking for something similar find something else unless you wash your clothes daily and it's just you. But perfect for kids clothes!",

This one is the perfect size for my clothes - it doesn't have a huge capacity, but it'll hold a week's worth of clothes (I wear scrubs to work). Super convenient zipper on the bottom is perfect for dropping the clothes into the washer. The hooks are a bit loose on the doors (the hooks will tilt on the door and keep the door from closing), but it comes with adhesive pads to tighten it up. I haven't used them though, so I can't comment on whether or not they help. Overall a great hamper for tight spaces, kids, or adults who don't need a huge hamper.",

Finally...after 14 yrs I found a solution! I hung this from the inside bathroom door and viola... no more uniforms on floors all week!! It worked!!! Thank you from 'happy wife- happy life' !",
