Would've been nicer rather than having to turn it on and off from the plug switch. Doesn't stop me giving it a 5 star as I feel its only a minor inconvenience.",

I've had no burning at the base and certanly no uncooked results. I would happily recommend this little cooker!",

We use the Tesco Jasmine white rice and the recommended ratio of rice:water is 1:1. The texture of the rice is soft and fluffy and has a good bite to it. We tend not to use the warm function because it can make the bottom layer of rice overcook. Sometimes a very thin layer gets very lightly burnt at the bottom but I really like that - much like chinese claypot rice. Apart from that, the rest of our rice is amazing.",

      "text": "Very disappointed with this rice cooker it replaced a similar looking one which cooked rice very well and only occasionally stuck to the bottom of the pan. This one, even though it boasts a honeycomb bottom to stop it sticking is far worse a large amount of rice is lost as it sticks to the bottom of the cooking pan and takes a lot of soaking in water to remove it. I have tried spraying it with oil which helps a bit. The other problem I have with this rice cooker is it proclaims to be German manufactured, however it is made in China. Very misleading.",
