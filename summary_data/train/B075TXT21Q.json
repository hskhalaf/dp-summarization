While I do wish I had snowshoes instead (at a few 5ft deep parts I sank into) these cleats kept me from sliding. They stayed on the shoes well, I had great traction on shallow unpacked and packed (groomed) snow and I think they'll work well for icy conditions as well. They were study enough that I felt comfortable leaving them on in patches without snow. I got the XL size which fit well on my 9.5 full size Oboz hiking boots",

With these cleats I can now walk securely without the risk of falling and possibly dropping my dogs's leash and him running off. They are very easy to put on and I do clean them with water after each use and sometimes wipe them down with some oil to prevent rusting (which they have not!). Would be a great present for elderly parents who still go on occasional walks or simply for anyone needing a secure grip while being outdoors in the winter. I highly recommend these cleats!!!",

I've worn them a half-dozen times ice fishing on glare ice and have not once felt off balance or like these weren't giving me max traction. Something to keep in mind, these will clog easily and become an unstable platform via ice buildup in slushy ice conditions with sub-freezing air temps. In otherwords, if preceding days temps create slush and slush layer does not refreeze fully, it will accumulate on the cleats and turn icy if air is subfreezing. Tap them with the ice scoop and away you go.",

I am now buying my second pair as my first ones finally broke after 50+ hikes and a serious beating. Highly recommend these over buying the more expensive options like Kahtoola.",
