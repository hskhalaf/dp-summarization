Honest 5 gallon capacity marked off inside by easy to read embossed 1/2 gallon markers. Multiple arches for superior build strength are employed at each free-wheeling caster's corner attachment point, as well as all along the bucket's edge, providing superior confidence of a safe and problem-free proper disposal/transfer pour of the bucket's contents at the end of the project. The free-wheeling (and not lockable) casters make the controlled speed transport of the partially filled bucket over bare floors and low-pile carpeting safe and almost too easy! Definitely worth it's modest price.",
