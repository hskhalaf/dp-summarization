I am so excited that we found something he can do! It is truly amazing that my career cognitive delayed boy can master something! He has found something he is truly amazing at. This Lego War Machine offered him zero challenge, but I\u2019m sure it would be a challenge to you to I. It is so well built, and now he plays with it since he put it together. Thanks Lego for giving my sweet boy someone he can be amazing at!!",
