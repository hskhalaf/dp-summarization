      "text": "I tried to save a few bucks by buying this off-brand Vremi griddle instead of Lodge. I already own a Lodge and wanted a second griddle as a back up for when I'm serving a crowd. This Vremi version is not well seasoned: it arrives black, but the surface has a very rough texture (unlike Lodge, which comes smooth and pre-seasoned like a centuries old well seasoned iron skillet) When seasoned properly, a good iron pan is naturally non-stick. Even when oiled, absolutely EVERYTHING sticks to this Vremi pan. Also, it has a slightly smaller cooking surface than the LODGE. I wish I would have just spent the extra ~$10 and bought the Lodge.",

I was desperately trying to find a good sized dual sided griddle and this ine fit the bill. After seasoning both sides, i was able to make pancakes and they came out awesome. I cant wait for the seasoning to get thicker the more i use it so itll be smooth as glass. Super happy with it!!",

One of the curved lips near the handles catches and the whole thing sits slightly at an angle. It wouldn't be such an issue, BUT then all the oil runs off instead of being useful ON the griddle",

Otherwise, if properly greased, you can make a nice brown pancake. Very heavy, nice quality and will be a \"go to\" item for many many years! I love the basics and goodbye junkie cookware!",

My husband had to hacksaw off parts of 2 burner covers to get the griddle to fit the stove. Also, because of the 1\" all around the griddle grease gutter, the USABLE GRIDDLE AREA is only 15\" x 8\". Can barely fit 2 pancakes on it. Finally the grease gutter it very shallow (less than 1/2 inch), it can easily overflow -- and it's a bit tricky to empty in the middle of cooking a meal when the grease & the griddle are piping hot. My husband likes this griddle because it's cast iron, but I definitely would not recommend buying it.",

      "text": "We took this camping. It was really nice because we basically were able to use just this almost the entire time. We could cook anything on it and it fit right on top of our coleman camp stove. Cooked sausage links and rolled them into the edges while we cooked the pancakes. You could put it over the fire too, but this was easier. We will use it at home on our BBQ and on our gas stove. Love that it has 2 different styles in one! Nice addition and doesn't take up too much space! It is quite heavy, but thats what you get with cast iron.",
