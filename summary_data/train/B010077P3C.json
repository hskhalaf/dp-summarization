It is a bit higher than I thought it would be but that's okay since it works perfectly for my small dining space. Such an amazing find on Amazon!! I did purchase the lights recommended from the same company and very pleased with those too. Well done!",

I wish the small crystals were centered on the strand but the hole for the wire is off-center and the crystals are randomly shifted which kind of messes up the whole arrangement. But it's not too bad. Also, one of the bulb sockets is defected. I thought I had a bad bulb. It turns out that I need to \"untwist\" a bulb a little bit to make contact within socket. Provided that LED bulbs last for years, It doesn't bother me too much. Other than that I am very happy with this product.",
