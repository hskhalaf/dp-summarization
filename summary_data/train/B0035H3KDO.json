I have a pretty extensive home shop - more so than many pro shops in that something always needs to be fixed on the ranch. I have about 10 different drills of various size and power... but this is the GO TO drill and the one you want. It runs strong, doesn't get too hot and has a sold weight along with excellent balance. Girls, if you want to get a gift for your guy this season... this will work just fine ! :)",

Had problem drilling slow and the lock button only works when you are at the fastest setting so this feature didn't help me. And did I say it's heavy? I'm a woman with not much strength but hubby was fine with it. I instead swapped drills when I got tired.",
