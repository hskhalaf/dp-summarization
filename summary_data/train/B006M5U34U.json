      "text": "A little expensive but a great light. Bought this for my wife and I could really see the difference between that and my Gobe. This sola 1200 really lights up a night dive and the strap is great. The battery life seemed get into the yellow or low juice mode only after 30 minutes of diving at 45 feet in 78 degree water and that was on full charge but using the highest lighting setting. Great product. It really put everyone else lights to shame.",

I did an awesome job lighting up a nice area that I was looking at and it was definitely the most powerful light on the boat. I have to say I also really loved the handgrip thing with this light. It made such a huge difference underwater to not have to be holding a flashlight. If you got the money and you like night dives I suggest you consider this light. The optional controls on this light are a little bit hard to figure out for me and I really wasn\u2019t able to do more than turn it on and turn it off.",

This light outperformed every other light the group used for the night dives. The wide angle is great and very bright. It is also nice to be able to switch to spot mode to get really deep into cracks in the coral or even to point out certain features. I have it mounted to my camera most of the time and it works well for that as well even if it is not technically made for photo.",

Both say Sola dive 1200 s/f the cheaper one says black and the expensive one say blue. Other than that why the price difference.",

It lights up a really wide area on night dives, but doesn't scare off the shrimp or lobster. The narrow beam is awesome for investigating the crevices in the reef; the wide beam is good for night dives. There is a mechanical locking switch, as well as an electronic locking switch (hold the lever forward for 4 seconds). This ensures that the light won't be accidentally activated. I would have given it 5 stars, but I had to squeeze the bank account to afford the purchase.",

It recharges in just few hours so I was ready the next morning. Very comfortable and light weight yet very bright.",
