Just recently ate some of my kids leftover food out of one (which I've never done before) and noticed it tastes like the dishwasher detergent. I've been checking them regularly since then and there is always residual detergent on them. Something about them absorbs the dishwasher detergent and doesn't rinse clean. And I do use jet dry. Sick to think that I've been feeding my kids trace amounts of dish detergent for a year.",

They are sturdy enough so that food does not fall out and the plate does not collapse. There is no suction cup on the bottom but since they are silicone they do stick some to the table and do not easily move around. My granddaughter loves the colors and picks a different one for each meal. Definitely would recommend product.",
