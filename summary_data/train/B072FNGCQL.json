I put them in glass voltives, light 6-8 of them, place them around out deck and light them. fast forward 5-10 minutes and more than half of them are out. The rest of them have a tiny flame that doesn't put enough citronella to keep bugs away. Glad there's insect repellent out there!",

Keep in mind that in order citronella candles to work and be effective they must be made with REAL CITRONELLA OILS, not synthetic ones.

These Real Citronella Candles made with Authentic Citronella Incense will create the perfect atmosphere for any occasion with its glowing yellow color and general appearance. Aside from being a wonderfully addictive citrus scent, these CITRONELLA SCENTED VOTIVE CANDLES may work as an insect repellent to keep insects, bugs and mosquitoes away.
