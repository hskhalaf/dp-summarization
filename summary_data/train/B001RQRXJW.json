The tank is a bit heavy and feels about 4pounds with air but I have not actually weighed this on a scale. To compare it feels almost twice as heavy as my 20oz CO2 tanks and is a bit heavier than my 68ci/4500psi Nitro tank. Overall I love this tank and will be using this for a long time. All future tanks I get will also be from Ninja. Great stuff guys! xD",

I would reccomend this purchase unless you really want a Ninja branded tank. I know some buyers have received this, but I along with some others have not so use caution when ordering. Regardless of what you receive however I believe this is a quality buy. MUCH better than using C02.",
