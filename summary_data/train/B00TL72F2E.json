      "text": "I have a ton of 20v Dewalt tools. They are really fantastic. This blower is a good overall value when purchased with the 5.0 battery and charger. $200 seems expensive, but 5.0 batteries are $100+ and chargers are $30-$50, so as a combo it is a good value. I think the blower is powerful enough for normal homeowners but I do hope they come out with a smaller tube to increase the velocity. It works well for sidewalks and driveways and roads but a smaller diameter tip would make it more useful in grass and bushes.",

I thought it just wasn't possible to get more power out of a battery-powered blower. I was wrong. By a lot. This (...I'm so sorry) blows them away. It's not even close. This is incredible. I can't believe I wasted years NOT owning this. If you need this category of product \u2014 and if you're a homeowner, you can probably use it \u2014 buy this one. You won't be disappointed.",

That's assuming it is not going continuously, full speed. It does charge relatively quickly & it's so lightweight we wouldn't want a heavier, bulky battery!

      "text": "This is perfect for my needs. I looked at the more powerful 60V blower, but after watching some reviews on YouTube, I decided this would be perfectly fine for my home. I am able to easily clean out my garage and shed with this unit. It is powerful enough to certainly blow leaves off my driveway as well as assist with putting down pinestraw. I love that you can vary the speed with the trigger as opposed to all on or all off. I am coming from a corded blower which has more power than this, but this is SO much easier to use in so many ways. Very happy with this purchase. Always had good luck with DEWALT tools.",

      "text": "Bought for my dad who does a lot of gardening at home. He was a bit apprehensive at first, but after trying it out he loved it! He says it has enough power and is super comfortable to hold. His favorite feature is the trigger control for air flow. You can gradually increase power by squeezing harder. He loves this and it really helps to blow leaves out of his planter beds without blowing all of the soil out too! He is also satisfied with the length of charge. He usually uses for 15-30 minutes and has never run out of a charge.",

I feel like I've been duped. This product should sell for about $49 if your just blowing off small deck it should be fine but other than that its just not worth it!",

I can barely clear my 400 ft driveway before having to recharge. Luckily I also bought the 20v hedge trimmer so I have an extra battery. The trimmer, by the way, runs forever on a charge! Overall I'd still recommend this blower for light duty applications. The Milwaukee is probably better, but it's also twice the price and probably overkill for what I need.",

The DeWalt is very quite and will not disturb your neighbors when you are outside on a Saturday morning blowing leafs around. The blower is also light weight and very easy to use, very satisfied with the quality of this product.",

If you use more than two batteries I want your house because it's too big!!!",
