It fits well after I purchased a band adjusting kit. It does get attention from anyone that sees it. But that is where the positives end. It's just a piece of jewelry. The date is in a bad spot and hard to see. It keeps time very well, but there is no back light. Nothing in the watch even glows, so don't expect to use it in dim/dark areas. Had I known this from the beginning, I would have chose a different watch.",

The watch face reflects a beautiful orange/reddish hue and is complimented by a dark face behind the glass. There is no glow to the watch numbers.
