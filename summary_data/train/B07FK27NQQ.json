Great quality, and super user friendly... like the alignment guides to make sure my putter has a straight path, and I\u2019m slowly getting better with my putting skills. I\u2019m a teacher, so I brought it to my school and my students LOVED it... going to get another one. Definitely great for all ages and anyone wanting to practice their putting.",

Turns out he already had a practice set (oops!), but to my delight he actullay prefers this one! The reason: the inclined hole allows him to practice longer putts then he would normally be able to at home. A 6 ft putt feels twice as long! He likes to use it when practicing in front of the TV, where space is limited. He loves it, and for the price im stoked.",

Honestly, the website description made it seem like it returned all balls back to you, but your ball is only returned if you miss the hole. So, this is only convenient if you are a bad golfer. If you\u2019re good and make the shot, then you have to walk over to the hole to retrieve your ball. My nephew wasn\u2019t very impressed, I wasn\u2019t very impressed, and I personally found it boring and a bit misleading. You can basically accomplish the same thing by putting into a glass for free.",
