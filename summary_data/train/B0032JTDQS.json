Adjusted the dept on the gun but nails still weren't being driven down far enough. I finally removed the rubber cover on the tip and finally the nails were driven as deep as I needed them to go. Once off, the gun worked as I was expecting it; however, i had to remove the tip in order for that to happen. They probably need to make the rubber cover a bit thinner so it doesn't affect the nail depth.",

I just finished this small project, fired off at least 1000 nails (in the summer heat, humidity & afternoon showers of Atlanta) & still going strong! It works much better & has more features than my \"Harbor Freight house brand\" nailer, and expectedly falls short of my $180 Hitachi nailer. This NuMax nailer met and far exceeded my expectations for the price I paid, hence the 5 stars. Plus I now can save my expensive nailers for indoor projects & furniture making.",

I went through several thousand nails on the project, switching between 1.5 and 1.75 length nails, with only one jam in the nailer.

Problem is that the hardboard is more like thick paper than wood, and the nails go through it too easily.
