I contacted Sauder and informed them of this mishap. They made a verification of purchase and immediately shipped out replacements. I had them within 48hrs. It took me an hour for each bookshelf to be put together. Always check inventory prior to assembly.",

My husband had very little trouble putting them together - the only thing that went somewhat wrong was that the top is fairly thin, so on the first one he tightened the screw and it almost popped through the top. After that little learning experience, though, he didn't try to tighten so much and the others came out looking great. We have been using them for several months and they look great and are sturdy enough to stand up to three kids grabbing games and throwing them back in all the time!",

The way that the guide holes are drilled allow the screws to be pushed through the top. So, now the top is damaged in two places. Unsightly. They could easily make the holes so that it would be impossible to damage the top or they could have supplied shorter screws. Very disappointed.",

Likely the countersink holes drilled by the factory in the piece of trim were drilled slightly deeper than they should have been and the result is three ugly holes the the \"most visible\" section of this bookcase. I will contact Sauder and see if they are willing to replace the top section, but what a disappointment. I've attached pictures so you can see this.

I am happy to report that it fits right in and matches our wood perfectly! Overall it seems very sturdy, the only slight complaint I have is that the back board (cardboard) was slightly larger than the back of the unit so one corner is sticking about a half mm above the top left corner of the bookcase.

Additionally, while putting this together the sharp edges of the slide-together pressboard shelving left me with some pretty gnarly cuts on my fingers. Overall a pretty terrible bookshelf.

What I really liked is that they were sturdy and after assembly did not look like they were \"put together\" by us, but rather by a real carpenter. The only problem was that since they were so heavy the outer, thin cardboard boxes they were shipped in ripped, but luckily the bookcases were not damaged.",

I'd guess it would be simple to add some wood glue to make it a bit better, but that really shouldn't be needed for this sort of furniture. I don't think the point on construction and hardware here has to do with price...it is higher quality in terms of design and wood quality than a number of other such things I've bought, and most have far sturdier designs.",
