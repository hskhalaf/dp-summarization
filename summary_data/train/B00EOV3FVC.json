      "text": "This scanner works extremely well. When you scan, you specify ahead of time if the scan will go to a file, efax, dropbox, or whatever, making it a really good way to automatically organize your data. On the other hand, you have to go to their website whenever you want to use the scanner, which would not make it good for realtors or other people who may want to scan something when they are not on the internet. I felt the different attachments that automatically kick the sheet back at you were very clever, but you will only use one and the others will be thrown out... that seemed wasteful.",

I've been using to scan paperwork for scouts. This way I an review their work later and they can still keep their originals. It's a bit slow, so I would not recommend it for \"big\" or \"quick\" jobs, but for your small, portable jobs, I think its a good and affordable scanner. I only gave it 3 stars because it is heavier/bulkier than I expected for travel and it does only scan 300dpi. It's better for B/W vs. color, but again...serves my purpose well.",

I've experimented with trying to feed the pages slightly differently, but keep getting crooked images with blacked out segments. Seems like the mechanism that pulls the page through doesn't present the paper to the image capture area smoothly. I contacted the company's tech support - they told me to try recalibrating, which I did and that did not help. Passed that on to tech support and never heard back. Maybe they know it's expected? Anyway, I can't recommend this scanner based on my experience with it and with the company.",

So many well-known companies have been hacked that I just don't like putting everything the scanner's website. I have personal geneology and medical files I would rather keep confidential. Installation requires going to the site to get the software. Yuk. I'm old-fashioned and just want a disk. It works fine, pages go in and out easily. The quality is fine for my purposes. I would just as soon have my old scanner that does one page at a time. But I can see the allure for people in the technological age.",
