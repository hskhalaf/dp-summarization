The only annoying thing was that the 1TB drive that came with it was 5400RPM. Not the worst thing in the world, but being a 5400 makes gaming a little sluggish. I ended up buying a 1tb SSD to replace it and it really brought the system to life. I really recommend this laptop if you are interested!",

There are other laptop which are hitting 100c at peak performance but this maintains at 70-80c which is useful and will help to improve the product life. Initially I thought of m15 Alienware due to heating issues I choose this product. Only issue is with the laptop flip there is a slight gap. Thanks to \u201cAMAZON\u201d I got this product at low price. 256+2tb with 1060 6gb original price with tax was around 1800$ but AMAZON got a deal and I got this laptop for 1600$.

My previous laptop was not powerful enough to allow me to edit 4K footage, and really could only handle medium-sized Photoshop projects. The Razer Blade 15 has power to spare for these specific use cases. With the Nvidia graphics card, I am able to render out of Premiere Pro and After Effects minutes faster than my old laptop. I have also run up to 3 large Photoshop projects simultaneously without a stutter. I have done some mild gaming (Skyrim, Rocket League, Fortnite) and it performs extremely well with the games I own. I have certainly pushed it through its paces, though.",

You\u2019d be better off buying lower spec versions of razer laptops and upgrading yourself later on because its alot cheaper and samsung SSDs are the fastest.",

It does get warmer than usual and it has a short battery life to work on the go (if you are lucky, you get a good 6h use from a full charge).
