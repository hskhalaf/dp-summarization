I would prefer if the mounting angle was wider, and some UI issues, but not a deal breaker. Requires some finesse with electrical wiring and if your junction box isn't recessed inside the wall you can mount Presence on top just fine. I recommend assigning a static IP to Presence through your router using the MAC address. Cuz even if Presence loses its WIFI connection it can still reconnect relatively fast when the WIFI is back on.",

    "description": "Style:Outdoor CameraHave alerts sent directly to your smartphone when an intruder or vehicle enters your property\nUnlike conventional cameras which notify you whenever they detect movement, Presence can distinguish between people, cars and animals. Presence will tell you if someone is loitering around your home, if a car enters your driveway or if animals are in the garden.\nEvery home is unique. With Presence, you receive customised notifications that match your needs. You can choose to be alerted instantly when someone enters a zone you have selected. You can also choose not to receive alerts for animals. The Alert-Zones feature allows you to select specific areas for alerts if the camera detects a person, animal or car.\nPresence protects you day and night, thanks to its built-in smart floodlight. The light can be switched on manually in the app or set to come on when it detects a person, car or animal. It helps you find your way safely at night and deters any unwanted visitors.\nSimply install Presence in place of an outdoor light fixture or set it up wherever is best for you (entrance to you home, garden, etc.).\nIn just a few minutes, you can install your very own sophisticated security system, complete with powerful floodlight. Your property is now protected against break-ins!\nSpecifications:\n-Video sensor: 4 MP\n-Full HD: up to 1920 x 1080\n-Field of view: 100\u00b0\n- LED floodlight: 12 W, variable brightness\n- Infrared night vision, detection up to 15 m\n-Local data storage: MicroSD (8 GB Class 10 card included)\n- 100-240 V power supply\n- Wi-Fi: 802.11 b/g/n (2.4 GHz)",
