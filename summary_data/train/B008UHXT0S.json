    "title": "Honeywell CO48PM Evaporative Air Cooler For Indoor & Outdoor Use, 1062 CFM - 10.6 Gallon Tank",
    "description": "Spend more time outdoors with Honeywell Outdoor Evaporative Coolers (Swamp Coolers) keeping you and your family cool all summer long. Outdoor Fans help to circulate warm air, Outdoor Mist Fans cool by spraying wet mist over your furniture and serving area. Honeywell Outdoor Evaporative Coolers provide a powerful cool breeze without wetting you and your guests. Like a breeze flowing across a lake, Honeywell Evaporative Coolers provide a natural, cool breeze with the power of water evaporation. Honeywell Evaporative Coolers combine 3 appliances: Evaporative air cooler, fan and humidifier - into one compact energy-saving system. A fan alone creates a breeze by recirculating warm air, but when you add water and/ice to the tank, Honeywell Evaporative Coolers reduce the temperature of incoming warm air, transforming it into a cool moist breeze. Honeywell Portable Air Coolers are built to last and carefully crafted with the science of aerodynamics to minimize energy consumption while maximizing the airflow. An evaporative air cooler offers an energy efficient cooling option when the air is hot with low humidity, such as desert areas like the southwestern United States (recommended humidity level is 60% or less for maximum efficiency).cfm1062",
