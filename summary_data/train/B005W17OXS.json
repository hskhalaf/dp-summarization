Setup the folders and users and then give permissions (Read Only, Read/Write, No Access) to each folder for each user. Nice intuitive interface. Windows sees it on the network just like another PC.",

Fit for a small business or someone looking to have a powerful media server. I use Plex right now, but Synology is coming out with their own very similar product. Additionally, Synology has great customer service, and an active community on the help/ how-to forums. If your question hasn't already been answered, it will be shortly.",

      "text": "I am unsure why there are so few reviews of this stellar NAS. Yes, it's not the cheapest out there but if you are looking for a 2 bay unit that can and does consistently saturate a gigabit link under load then look no further! I threw a pair of 3tb WD greens into it and a day later everything was screaming fast. The installation process was quite possibly the easiest of any NAS I've set up. I had heard a lot of good things about Diskstation Manager, but wow, words cannot do it justice. It is beyond perfect. Would buy again in a heartbeat.",

Included backup software works fine for PC's, but the claimed support for Apple's Time Machine has proven to be false. Yes it appears to work initially, but the next day you'll notice your Mac complaining about the integrity of the backup and asking to backup again. It does this daily. Looking up the issue online there are tons of threads on it, but no solution.",

My DS712+ came with DSM 3.1 cd, I did the upgrade to DSM 3.2 online with no problems in less than 5 min. If your are looking for the best NAS in the market, just go for Synology.",
