I had been using the reusable k-cup that came with the Keurig, but the mesh lining ripped over time, so grounds were making their way into my cup of joe (or 6) each morning. This newer k-cup, though, shoots the water through the grounds even faster than the old one, and there's hardly any \"sludge\" at the bottom. Easy to clean and wash. 10/10 would recommend! Worth every penny -- buy yourself a coffee grinder if you don't have one and stop using one-time-use plastic k-cups that hurt our environment!",

How, and why are you allowing sellers to lie to the consumers?",

Maybe if the container had a bigger hole on top to match the holes created in the pods it might have been better. Anyway, it doesn't work.",
