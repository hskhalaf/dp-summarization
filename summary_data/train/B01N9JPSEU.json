The build quality is nice, styling is sleek, and touching the buttons leaves you feeling like you're dealing with a really high quality product. I've already suggested the case to a few friends. The RGB strip that comes with the case is long enough to run across the front or rear. if you want more lighting I would advise ordering the 1M Phanteks RGB strip upgrade. The 2M strip would be far too long for this smaller case. The 1M strip is long enough to go around 3 edges. I ran my 1M through 3 edges, and then put the strip that came with the case behind my radiator.",

This looks like a returned part which is missing all the parts and has risers already installed in the case. I can't believe phanteks doesn't even look for the parts it is sending to the customer. I called amazon customer service and they requested manufacturer to send the replacement screws for me. I can't work on my project because of this. However case looks amazing in white and no complaints about the style and case itself.",

The manual shows 'all' connections except for that one. A friend put my rig together but left that cable in the midst of a rats nest in the back and I was beginning to think I had a case with a faulty panel board.....found it and plugged it in and voila. Aside from that, very happy with this case. Looks great, not too flashy with room for extra upgrades in the future. I would recommend this case for the price point (got mine on sale for 69),",

The main problem is that the power supply basement is way too small. There's two available HDD spots in the basement which cut in to cable routing. Trying to fit a Corsair RM750x in the thing was a nightmare, and it gets worse every time I need to plug in more power cables. If the whole case was an inch or two longer or taller, to allow the basement to be more roomy this would be a much better case. Don't think I'll be buying Phanteks mid tower, again.",

Plugging the led into the mobo results in very dim red lights that I cant change. Due to not having an extra sata plug available the downlight also does not work. So make sure you have 1 available. Beyond me not knowing i would need a sata plug from the psu to power the lights, its a good quality case with nice quality and easy to build in with all the space.",

Front panel is super restrictive, only two small intakes at top and bottom of panel with very tight dust filters. Temps on GPU drop up to 10C with panel off versus on with 2x 140mm front and 1x 120mm rear exhaust. Proprietary rgb connectors is just dumb, it's bad and Phanteks should feel bad about that. Would I recommend it? NO. There are better options for the same/less money, some of them even made by Phanteks, there's a reason this has been replaced.",

It took a lot of work to take these screws out and replace them with others, and the box with all of the case parts,screws and directions were deep inside the case that required some thinking to find and access.

Problem with that is you won't have any space for 3.5\" hard drives. Really great case. Love the RGB options and the openness of it. Great for my mATX board.",

If you want it to sync with your ASUS AURA equipment, get the RGB LED 4 Pin Adapter, you will need it! It's cheap enough. Though I wish there was more head room for a radiator. All I could fit up top was a fan and it barely doesn't touch the MOBO.",

A little black tape though and all was well. Really good cable management system with a few cable ties thrown in. It also came with an LED strip with a generous lead cable. Top notch!",

The tempered glass is beautiful and fits well. Do yourself a favor and get a fan hub to hook everything into on the back side of the case to clean up some more cables.",

This product is easily a steal. A+ Phanteks.",

However there are a few differences between this one and the p400s, most notably is the fan controller hub, and the lack of additional dust filters/ vent covers. Also while the case looks amazing, the airflow is a bit restrictive. Popping off the front cover helps nullify this issue but it doesn't look as nice, all in all its a great case still and for the price it's pretty hard to beat.",
