The unit gets so hot that it melts it\u2019s own plastic. It\u2019s so hot that it hurts your hand to hold it by the handle. If that weren\u2019t bad enough...it will blast out incremental embers of pure FIRE that leave little fried places on your hair. The hair obviously falls out in those spots. Pros: With great dexterity and a bottle of heat protectant...you can do a full blowout in less than 20 min. 10/10 might burn your house down. Will burn your hair off at the very least.",

When I got Revlon's hair dryer, I was surprised at how effective it was. I'm very low maintenance with my hair, & just wanted this hair dryer to dry my hair after I shower. This hair dryer did just that. It's not a huge dryer either, so it can be very travel friendly. There's also no bad hair drying smells that come out of it either, which is even better. Overall, I would recommend this product.",

It does not bend as some smallish blow dryers do, but it still won't take up alot of space if you want to take it traveling with you. Definitely would have to go into your suitcase or small rollerbag carry-on. Happy with my purchase, arrive in a few days thanks to my Amazon Prime Membership.",
