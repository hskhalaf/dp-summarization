Played with all the troubleshooting scenarios, checked connections and fuses and still... Have tried emailing their customer service (overseas, likely) without any response so far. Will get additional stars based on customer service response. We shall see...",

Took about 15 minutes to put the four sections together (hint: fluff the top section before putting it on) and about two hours to fluff all the branches. Only question is what options are available for the topper? Does anyone aside from National Tree makes compatible ones? Find the star and bow one to be fairly limited.",

It takes a while to get the branches all sorted out there are a lot of them, but take your time (maybe an hour with 2 people) and it looks great. The multi function lights are a big hit with the wife and kids. I would recommend this product to anyone.",

I believe there are six different settings and each one of them works on our tree. Everyone compliments our Christmas tree when they are over! Definitely a tree I would suggest to anyone.",
