Many of the recipes can be made on top of the stove quicker and easier. It appears they took regular recipes and slow cooker recipes and tried to make them gluten free. Tell me where I will find gluten free orzo? Where will I find GF mushroom soup? Maybe if I was 21 and didn't care about a healthy diet I would like this but I'm not. Also, need specialty silicone cupcake liners among other special utensils. Not worth the work.",
