I am 5'3 and think it worked perfectly for my height but not sure how it would do for anyone taller. My traveling companion is 5'10 and she didn't think it was very comfortable/useful.",

I gave it one less star because it kept my feet either one on top of another or close together, which is ok for a short time, but the misalignment becomes uncomfortable after such long flights. I will definitely use it again but plan to buy another one so each foot can have its own sling. Great for legs to rest on though (like what is pictured above)",

Really light and packable, doesn't bother the person in front of you (just be considerate), and I shortened it all the way. This, plus my inflatable neck pillow, and I was able to \"curl\" up and sleep on an overnight flight for the first time maybe ever!",

There was no comfortable way to keep the feet next to each other. I think the best solution would be to get 2 of them just so your feet can be kept apart. But other than that, it's a definite step up from keep your feet on the floor or on top of your below-the-seat personal item, especially on long flights",
