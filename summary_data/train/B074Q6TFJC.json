      "text": "Bought this for a friends birthday present and had to get one for myself! It's such a great little light. Someone wrote a review saying they couldn't tell when it was done charging- there is a tiny red light on the ring that indicates charging so not sure what their issue was. I love pulling this out when taking pics with my friends, they get so excited about it! Unfortunately it doesn't work on the other side because it blocks the front camera but I still love it and carry it everywhere with me just in case a good pic opportunity arises!",

Charges pretty quick...about 45 min for a full charge if battery is completely gone. The little screw in the back started to come loose but I was able to fix that with a little nail push. Way worth the money. I think I'll buy a few for gifts since my girlfriend all take my light to use on their phones!! Lol",
