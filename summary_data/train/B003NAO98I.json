      "text": "Our second Olympus 8010, and both of them worked great! With the first one, I was truly amazed that you begin by cleaning the camera in a bowl of clean water ... amazing. The only reason that I bought a 2nd one, is because, for my next vacation, I washed the camera in a clean bowl of water -- but, also opened the battery/SD door, too -- totally my fault, and was laughable until I remembered the price: hahaha. Excellent camera, with great snorkeling, zip lining, posing, scenery and action vacation photos. Don't forget to also get (and use!) the \"floatie\" device that helps you to find your camera, once you drop it from your kayak.",

It flashes so bright that it drowns out the picture. I took a close-up picture of a part in a dim area to get a model/serial number. The flash drowned out the entire picture where I couldn't even see the object - just white light! Then I pulled out my HTC Windows phone and snapped a picture and it came out perfect. I bought this camera specifically for waterproof, but what good is that if the camera can't take a decent picture? Very disappointed.",

It also takes about 10 seconds to boot up when you first turn it on. Its verrrry slow... But it was nice for water activities.",

The lost camera was terrlfic met all needs and took great pictures underwater and above... just wanted to replace it. Have't yet used this camera, but getting it set up has been time consuming and inconvenient. Manuals and instructions are poor and sketcy. The operating manual is only provided on line and set up is lengthy and unfriendly.",

I'm happy with my purchase, but this camera is terribly slow between pictures, which has caused me to miss a fair amount of shots. Other than the speed issue, this is a good, tough camera for all my adventures.",
