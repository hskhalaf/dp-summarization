If you want a little more oil than a light mist, then this fits the bill. It is absolutely fantastic for grilling, even if you just want to spray on a little oil to make it more non-stick.",

It was spraying much less than normal and not in any particular pattern. I requested a replacement and that one works well. So it seems like the main issues are price and potential quality control. I've tried several different kinds of sprayers before and this is still the best as long as it works properly.",

      "text": "I bought these oil spray bottles for my Dad for Father's day and he loves them. He does a lot of cooking and uses quite a bit of olive oil and peanut oil. He loves being able to just grab a bottle and give a quick squirt right where he needs it instead of pouring from the larger oil bottles he buys at the store. Not sure how easy they are to clean as he's never mentioned it but so far no clogging and they are easy to use. He's got sort of arthritic hands so the squeeze-pull trigger is great for him instead of the push-down-top models.",

Smaller utensils can be used with significant over-spray outside the pan area. Just creates an oily mess in the kitchen. Would return it if I could. Does not meet my needs.",

It has its place in the kitchen-- like on the grill. It does not replace the Misto oil sprayer which delivers a very small amount (but requires pumping up pressure frequently, having to maintain the nozzle, and cycling out the oil so it doesn't go rancid or gummy). I would definitely buy this again, though I do wish it was a finer spray. Adding a variable pressure valve to the trigger would do it (higher pressure leads to smaller droplets).",

My only complaint is that the shape of the bottle means it has to be pretty full to spray correctly. If the bottle were a little bit narrower, you could spray even when there's only an inch or so in the bottom. But because of the shape, you need to have 2-3 inches of oil in the bottle or it won't spray, because the normal spraying angle causes all the oil to fun into the corners. So, that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, but I do really like it and use it all the time.",
