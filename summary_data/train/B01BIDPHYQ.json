It would be quicker to fill a glass with water by standing outside in the rain than getting water through this filter. Luckily for me, Amazon refunded my money without any hassle - I guess that is why I continue to buy from Amazon. I took a chance with this generic filter to save money, but it definitely is not worth the savings - already ordered the name brand filter. Perhaps this filter is an adequate substitute on some GE model refrigerators, but definitely not mine.",

I'd say that's not worth the risk. Buy the real thing and stay away from this trash.",

      "text": "The product itself fits fine in my fridge but when I was first running water through it to ready it for use it seemed like the charcoal was not tightly packed as with the GE brand filters. That was suspect. Now that I have filled several water bottles I can definitely taste the difference. The water tastes just as if it was coming from the faucet without filtration. The product itself didn't come with any information, no instructions, nothing at all. So for being economical, I can see why the minimalist approach. Unfortunately, I will not be purchasing a second one.",

But as of now, it's worth the price and I'm actually surprised that I'm satisfied with my purchase!",

The water on the door had slowed down to a trickle or even a drip even after installing two different GE filters over the past 3 years, so we had just stopped using the water on the door. Now our ice stopped filling so I decided to try one more filter before we called the repair man. And suddenly we have water coming out the door and it\u2019s perfect water pressure and tastes fine!! The GE filters weren\u2019t working and this replacement filter worked! (The ice problem was just a frozen line).",
