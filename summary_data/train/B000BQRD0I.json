You could tell that this one (priced about half of hers) was a little less durable and would tip over if you hit it with a good amount of force. That being said, this is a quality steamer that gets your wrinkles out of your clothes without hassle. It heats up fast and puts out a good amount of steam. I would recommend this product if you want a quality Steamer in your price point. I would probably spend the extra money for a nicer one with a bigger base next time.",

Yes, high amounts of steam come from the steamer and onto my clothes, but because of the awkward, inflexibile, and extremely hot hose (when compared to other manufacturer's products), I would go with another brand, personally.",

It's not bad for blouses (inside-out steaming), but don't count on the crisp look regular ironing provides.",
