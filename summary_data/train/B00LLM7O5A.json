      "text": "Good fungo for the price. Does everything I need it to as a high school baseball coach. The only weakness is that it is made of ash and the grains will eventually split because it\u2019s an open grained wood. This can be negated by taping the barrel of the bat and should las several seasons. Pair this with a nice grip and it\u2019s almost perfect. I suggest lizard skins brand grip. Bottom line: for a low price it\u2019s a great fungo, nothing beats the sound feel and handle of a wood fungo. If you want a better longer lasting wood look at a maple(or other closed grain woods) fungo.",
