      "text": "One of my hobbys is casting bullets from lead alloy for reloading ammunition, and now that I've had a stroke, I needed protection from spills of very hot metal. This leather apron from Leaseek fits the bill perfectly. The leather is sufficently thick to provide protection, but is still very flexible. I am a large man, but the length and width are more than enough to protect even me. Leaseek did an excellent job getting this to me quickly, and it is exactly as described (well, actually, a little better than described). Thanks again !! A great product at a great price.",

Hopefully, I will never had to put it to the test on a large scale, but it's worked beautifully on a smaller scale. I had a glass rod \"pop\" when I put it in the flame and the apron kept a small shard from going down my shirt and one from landing on my leg. I would definitely buy it again!",
