As noted, I have to fiddle with the volume buttons to get it to play from the UE2 every now and then, and the BONG sound effect is insanely obnoxious. Thankfully, you can turn them off.",

I've bought him many in the past several years and they always give out too soon. Can't attest to longevity for this product, and it did cost more than the lessor quality speakers I purchased in the past, but he is thrilled with the difference in sound. No comparison he says. Sorry, can't get technical with my review, but I can tell you that it's easy to use, easy to transport, (I also purchased a crushproof case to protect), and sounds incredible. The battery charge lasts a lot longer too. Can't help but recommend this product",

It's small size makes it very portable. It also has great volume -- better than most other small speakers. I'm picky about sound quality and this passes my tests-doesn't buzz, has good balance.

Even at that volume level and distance away all sounds are clear and distinct: drums, bass, guitar, keys, voices, etc. Friends heard mine and trashed their current ones (JBL and Bose) and got this one. Now we can block party and connect three of them when we are together. Awesome!",

Super easy to setup and use and it's the perfect size to fit in my water bottle holder on my bike (I won't wear headphones when I bike, but I'll certainly use speakers). Compact design, very rugged - accidentally already tested its water resistance by leaving it out overnight in the rain. Great buy, especially for the price point.",

The battery lasts forever and the quality/volume is pretty good. We loved this speaker so much we decided to buy another that stays on our 2nd floor.",

There is just enough bass, it's best quality is how clear and crisp it. I very much recommend it (way better than the JBL Charge 3 I used to have).",

In no particular order: The max volume indicator sound is obnoxious. All the rest of the utility sounds are great, but max volume is gross. Why? Also, the plug socket is hard to get in. It just wouldn\u2019t work if I\u2019m not concentrating hard on... plugging it in. This shouldn\u2019t be this hard. And finally it\u2019s sometimes iffy on the Bluetooth connection. But mostly just fine. It\u2019s essentially a great product. I bought two. Use one at home and one at work every day.",

It is noticeably louder and bassier than the bose and the sound quality really isn't that much behind. The shape is also a plus because it can fit into cup and bottle holders",
