Most recipes have a color picture and some have as many as four. Something like lentils gets 5 pictures to show each kind. Like I said, it teaches well.",

The recipes are not overly crazy, and although the ingredients lists look daunting on some of the recipes, most of the stuff many average people already have in their pantries (or can find easy substitutes). The pictures make me want to just eat everything, so the only drag is that you have to make everything first! But the meals are really easy and the info that goes along with each one is awesome!",

And the calorie/nutrient table at the back is helpful when you're browsing recipes in search of lower sodium, higher protein, etc. meals.

If you are looking for authentic ingredients and recipes, particularly for seafood, I think Nancy Harmon Jenkins's cookbook is superior and I will likely add it to my collection soon. But for an initial transition to Mediterranean cooking, this America's Test Kitchen Mediterranean cookbook cannot be beat.",

The one positive is there are many recipes so you may find a few that you can use. If you enjoy experimenting with spices and less common ingredients then this book is for you. If you are a busy person who cooks to live versus loves to cook, then this book is not for you.",
