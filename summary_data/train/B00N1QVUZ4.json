I got the yellow and grey curtain, paired with grey rugs and it looks amazing! There was a slight blemish on the upper left corner of the yellow but it's not big enough for me to worry about sending it back. I did not use the clips that came with it, as I like the ones I already have better but they are very cute! I'd recommend this curtain.",

I tried to take a photo to attach to the review, but my phone introduced some purple undertones into the picture. The curtain is true dark gray at the bottom, not black (nor does it look black in the photo). The tiny circles have a slightly raised texture. Overall, I'm quite pleasantly surprised by the quality, especially for the price. The holes for hooks are a little bit flimsy and tore slightly when I put the curtain hooks through them. Otherwise, highly recommend.",

I will say, however, that although it looks like the ombre fades to black in the picture provided, it really only fades to a dark gray. Still pretty - but do think I may have liked it a little better had the ombre faded to black. Not bad for the price and looks nice!",

I dread having to take it down to wash and rehang eventually. With grommets, it would look nicer hanging as well, instead looking like the hook is going to rip right through the fabric some day.",

Holes for the hooks seem strong and fit over the larger hooks with the metal ball on the ends. Definitely use a liner as it would not be super waterproof on its own and, I imagine, would be prone to mildew if left wet. Happy with it after a month of everyday use!",

Threw it in the wash, bought a liner, and I'm very happy with how it makes the bathroom look.",

Don't know how you can mess up a shower curtain this bad like this but I guess anything is possible these days",
