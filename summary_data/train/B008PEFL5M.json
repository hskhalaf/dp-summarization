Only 7' 5\" x 9' 5\". There's fine print on the label that says \"Finished size is approximately 6\" smaller or up to 2% smaller\". 2% of 10' (120\") is 2.4\". So clearly it's quite a bit smaller than \"up to 2% smaller\". That's actually 5.8% smaller in length and 7.3% smaller in width than advertised. Fine point, but jeez just give me an actual 8' x 10' tarp for crying out loud or put measurements on the ad that reflect what it actually is. Be honest.",

I had about 18\" of tarp left over at base, but it was not an issue, but would be nice if the company offered a tarp to fit these canopy sides perfectly. Canopy sides usually cost $25 to $30.00. So, at $10.99/side- it's a bargain.",
