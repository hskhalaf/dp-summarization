Best part is that after long time of gaming or doing projects they don't make your ears hurt or exhaust you head. to bad they don't make them any more.",

It's a major design flaw & an inconvenience. The audio & chat is good. This headset takes batteries because it's originally a wireless headset. It is inconvenient having to have it plugged in & still having to change battery's. If you're going to offer multiple ways to use a headset, then they have to work properly.",
