Solid black and minimal tread makes it \"cool\" enough for the city bike and a lot safer than the slick. Not sure about durability but at this price if he gets a year out of it, it will be worth it. I will even consider using it for my X-bike when the much more costly Vittoria tires finally wear out. I'd give it 5 stars but unsure about the durability at this point.",

They were easy to install and each week I check the pressure and top off when needed. Its that simple and you won't regret this purchase.",
