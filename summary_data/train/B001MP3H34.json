The pictures are more than clear enough considering the frame's low resolution. It displays both my 16:9 and 4:3 pictures well, although the widescreen photos are better. The one thing I don't like is that there seems to be no way to keep the clock from displaying between pictures. EDIT: I've been corrected. The clock can be disabled. Thanks.",

Don't get me wrong, it's not a horrible item for the money, but if you spend another [...], you can get one that is much much better.",
