I purchased 18-200mm lens, 16mm F2.4 lens and it came with 16-50 zoom. The camera comes with small flash, but never mentioned in the specs. Good working too, but it is not properly exposing when using 18-200mm lens. The lens length blocks the flash light (big negative). Samsung need to keep the flash at a higher level. Quality: 5/5 Usability: 4/5 (sometimes irks) Easy to carry with 16mm lens and default flash.",

That doesn't bother me as the set of lenses that are compatible with it are amazing, we are really spoilt for choice these days.",

It has only HEVC which is H265 which needs to be converted via samsung i launcher software on the PC - takes time and in annoying - Hope samsung will enable it in the next firmware update. I dont use the 4K actually its too big to edit and not so smooth on my PC but the 1080P normal resolution even in 13 mbps.",

I love these features from my smartphone camera.

The nx500 comes with a lens that is normally between $200-$300 so for just the camera you are paying around $500-$600. To get the nx1, it is $1500 for just the camera and $1700 with the lens that the nx500 comes with. Really the price difference is $800 for the nx500 versus $1700 for the nx1. DO YOUR RESEARCH and find out if the nx1 is worth $900 more! If not, you will love love love this camera!",
