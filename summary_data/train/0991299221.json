This book is impeccably written and has concise explanations of confusing logical concepts. The practice questions included are also very good examples of varying difficulty. I would definitely use the Powerscore books (specifically LR) before consulting any more expensive/comprehensive prep company, since I think many will find these books adequate--the value and quality is that good. Their method for approaching Sufficient/Necessary assumption questions in particular was the best I've seen. If you struggle with LR like I did, definitely check out this book.",

I feel that I bumped my previous score by around 10 points using the PS Bibles the second time around. Here are my 3 keys for efficient studying: 1.) Work through all Powerscore Bibles (LG, LR, RC), 2.) take as many prep tests as possible under times conditions (minimum of 10-15), and 3.) debrief each prep test by throughly reviewing all questions. LSATHacks.com has explanations to all of the prep test questions you miss. Follow this and you'll be on your way to a higher score!",
