Life changer (at least in the kitchen). I love being able to dump ingredients in and walk away while it is mixing. My cookies even tasted better because it will mix much longer than I could ever do by hand. The motor is powerful and quiet, too. No need to buy that more expensive mixer, this one is perfect!",

Was so excited baked pound cake same night it arrived. Put that cake in freezer, made 3 other pound cakes during Thanksgiving. That first cake made with Hamilton Beach was the best of the cakes. I like having pouring shield for adding flour. Flat beater mixes as well as Kitchen Aid mixer. I also like having handle on bowl. I look forward to using this mixer for many years.",

The wires themselves are fine, but the hub part of the attachment has a metal that is deteriorating excessively, leaving a fine black powder on anything it comes into contact, powder that gets worse with moisture and does not completely wipe off because it is the metal itself degrading. I don't feel safe having that kind of metal near food. We'll still use the mixer but we are looking for alternative attachments.",

Additionally; the handle is basically a flat piece of metal, which must be padded with something to keep it from painfully biting into one's palm and fingers, So far it seems to be running well enough, but feel there must be something more efficient and suitable, especially for the price.",

Continue whipping that cream as the buttermilk separates and the solids collect as homemade butter---just mix in salt to taste after straining out the buttermilk for a different baking use. The 400 watt motor has all the muscle I need for 2 loaf recipes and the whole thing cleans easily, attachments and machine. The best kitchen purchase I've made since I bought new major appliances.",

When I plugged the mixer into the outlet and attempted to turn it on, nothing. I proceeded to try two other outlets and nothing. So much for being most reliable. I have returned the item and purchased a KitchenAid.",

I was very pleased with its' performance when making a cake. The mixer is much quieter than a KA, and the ingredients are mixed, even at the bottom. (problem I had with the KA) I also like that it has a 3yr. warranty. I will enjoy making holiday treats with it!",

In my house if it does not go into the dishwasher or washer it does not come in. I highly recommend this mixer.",

It started out okay, but after a few months of use; it wobbles a lot at the higher speeds; requires you to constantly stop the mixer, scrape down the bowl and beaters and continue; and it cuts off or slows down sometimes for no reason! I am so disappointed, as I thought Hamilton Beach was a quality product. Unfortunately, too much time has passed to return it, but I will not buy this brand again.",
