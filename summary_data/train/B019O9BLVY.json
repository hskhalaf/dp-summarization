It can be brightly back lit in a number of different colors, has a great feel (once I got used to its mechanical key switches), and a simple interface that requires no additional software driver to implement all its extended functions (back light controls, OS media playback controls, etc.). I like it's small size without the unnecessary numeric key pad, but do wish I could turn off the somewhat distracting, periodic \"breathing\" of the back lighting that it does - to just have the back lights on for a constant and steady appearance. Recommended as a good value that works great!",

The only issue I have had is after a few months the usb plug housing is going out. I'm going to have to splice a new end on it which sucks. It came wonky but i didn't think too much about it. Not sure if it is just one that slipped past QA or what. No other reviewers mention this so I guess I just got unlucky.",

Perhaps one day someone could software mod it to enable full lighting customization. Best board for the price. No doubt.

I do find the keys to be a little tight together compared to my standard keyboard, but I'm getting used to them. I was sad that the keyboard did not have a num pad, as I use it for my work quite a bit. However, that aside, the colors are beautiful, and it adds fun to my daily routine. I will see how the durability holds up, but overall very happy with this purchase. It is very comfortable for my wrists, and I like that I can flip it as needed, based on my sitting location.",

I was surprised by how heavy and substantial it was. The mechanical keys are very cool. The compact overall size is nice as well. No extra fluff.

You can control the brightness of the LED's and the speed at which they change color. The keyboard is weighted and really feels solid. The keys are similar to Cherry MX Blues and are extremely clicky for that enthusiast who really loves clickity clacking along. The fact that this keyboard is under $100 is truly astounding when every other mechanical keyboard out there goes for over or near $100. Shame on you Corsair. Either way get this keyboard and try it out! You will not regret it!",
