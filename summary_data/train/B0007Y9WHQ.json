Watched a youtube video and the seasoned user doing the video got the same sort of chunks using a sweet potato but seemed to want me to think that was the desired results...nope, want spirals. The suction cups do not stay attached to the counter by a long shot. I already have a mandolin to slice things thing so this is just not a useful addition if it's not going to spiralize.

Just two tips: The end of the vegetable MUST be sliced off totally evenly. A slight slant in the end makes it very difficult to spiralize. And... The directions say this is dishwasher-safe, but I find it really easy just to rinse it off in hot water and then leave it to air dry. It's a pretty awkward shape to put into the dishwasher.",

The platform is solid and doesn't move when placed on a flat surface. The end results - veggie 'noodles' - come out wonderfully. I haven't tried the ribbon blade yet.

Some problems: the sucker feet don't always want to stick, and even if they do, the force of spiraling makes it wander sometimes. The body, while durable enough to keep it from actually breaking, is too flexible, especially the handle. I think if you use this occasionally for soft things like zucchini (avoid yellow squash, the seedy mush in the middle clogs this machine right up), you'll be okay. If you want an everyday workhorse, especially for hard stuff like beets or potatoes, you should invest in something sturdier.",

On the other hand, if you plan on making potato chips or curly fries, you may be disappointed. The cutter blades for curly fries is too thin.

The edge gets crispy but the center stays soft. So if you're looking for something to give your everyday veggies some pizzazz, I love spiral cut onions, then this is for you!

The blade has remained sharp even after over a year of use. The only issue I had with it is that the suction cups on the feet don't stick well on all counter tops. If your counter top is shiny it doesn't stick as well. Also, if you wait too long to clean the blade inserts they can be hard to clean. Love that it can be thrown in the dishwasher. My kids love to use it too. Makes great curly fries and zoodles.",

There are so many recipes out there to use with spiralized veggies and I want to try each one. I've used spiralized veggies in salads, with pasta sauce, and other sauces, just saute\u0301ed. I've made curly fries (baked of course). Everything has been delicious. Even my 7-year-old son enjoys helping me do the spiralizing (I would never let him use one of those hand-held ones). And he's loving all the dishes I've made too. For some awesome recipes and ideas, check out",

My main reason for getting this is that I love red onions but it takes so much time to slice them not to mention the smell onions leave on the hands on the eye stinging. With the Panderno slicer, I can slice an onion in less than a minute. I donated all of my old mandolins to the church's yard sale.",
