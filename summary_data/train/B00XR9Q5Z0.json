When we smelled the food in the bag, it had a weird, almost plastic-y smell to it. Definitely a different smell from all the other bags we had received in the past. Really unfortunate because up until now, we liked this product.",

Just add water and they soften quickly. My dog's skin allergies looked great, ears looked great and his adult fur started to soften like puppy fur. All after just one week of feeding. And he loves the lamb flavor. Looking forward to tying other flavors. Cheers to Stewart Freeze Dried Dog Food!",

Once is maybe a fluke, but this is the third bag that I have opened with half the contents turned to powder. Makes it difficult to feed the right amount. It's the poultry flavors that have been the most problematic. Why not use the same box packaging that the larger patties come in? For the price of this food, they should insure we receive the item intact.",
