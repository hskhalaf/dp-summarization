I knew this before I made my purchase so it wasn't a surprise at all, but it should be included or built into the platform. Until it does, it's still just 4/5 stars.... Yes, I would recommend this monitor! As a whole, the price is right for what the R271 brings to the table.",

We went through two other monitors we bought from some classified ads, but neither of them could compare at all. The colors looked all weird and they had huge bezels. This monitor just made them look bad. So we ended up buying another one, and have been very satisfied with our purchase. I even love the BASE of it. Seriously, the little round base is awesome. It's so minimal. Unfortunately it doesn't slide up and down, but it does tilt. I totally recommend this monitor.",

Trying to make adjustments can be a pain since you can't see which button you are pressing, but once I got the settings to where I wanted them, I shouldn't have to use them much. And since there is a blue light next to where the power button is, I can easily find that to turn it on and off.",

They ddn't seem to work according to the descriptions. I'm missing something, somewhere;",

These monitors have very thin side frames so when I put two of them together (they were on sale) the view is flawless. Of course there is a black frame in the middle of the two but hardly noticeable. I'm now spoiled when I use spreadsheets I can now stretch it over the monitors and it's so much more efficient. I think the monitor lighting is good as described as my eyes don't seem to tire from using them.",

Only negative is that there in no VESA attachment on back of monitors to mount. That is a minor drawback though, and the link below describes how a company is making an adaptor now!

If you want to mount this monitor on a stand please be aware that this 24-inch model doesn't have the universal VESA mounting holes in the back instead you will need to get a mounting bracket.

The monitor rests stable on the desk, and the round stand base is great for collecting coins, paperclips, etc. The monitor + stand is super thin and doesn't eat up very much footprint on your desk at all.
