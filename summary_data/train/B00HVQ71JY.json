      "text": "Good value in comparison with Coolibar and other brands. I like these pants especially because they are not short - with long legs, this allows for ankle coverage. (5' 10\" female) I have a funny tan line around my ankles from wearing shorter sun swim tights with sunscreen at the ankles - actually makes my ankles look dirty! The pants wash and dry easily and the logo seems to be holding up. Great for paddling sports. Thanks for offering these great pants. I love wearing sun protective clothing so I can limit my sunscreen chemical exposure and avoid introducing those chemicals into aquatic environments.",

Expensive, and I got tired of replacing it yearly due to deterioration of the fabric. I have owned these for over two years, and love them. No stretching after many hundreds of uses. Keep their shape, my tan lines prove they provide great sun protection. Easy to take off, wet or dry, easy to put on dry, a little harder to put on wet. I am six feet tall and weigh 170 pounds and large was perfect for me. Higly recommended.",

They were snug as they should be but not as tight as compression runners. The material is stretchier than most running tights so it have more give in the water but held their shape well. Quick drying in the sun, they would be mostly dry by the time the dive boat reached our hotel's dock. Highly recommend.",

There isn't extra fabric in the crotch, so they are indeed unisex or at least ok for women. Cheap looking super thick draw-string. Length is ok, have 33 inseam and they're down to ankle bones.",
