I purchased a switch that has PoE ports so I just ran a single CAT5 cable to the AP and it works like a charm. I use it in my home due to so many issues with my old network configuration. This AP broadcasts my same SSID of my wifi router at other other end of my house so I no longer have different SSID's. No more dead zones or slow internet connections either.",

The other port then lets you run wired ethernet out to another device like an Apple TV or small switch where you can support other ethernet wired devices.
