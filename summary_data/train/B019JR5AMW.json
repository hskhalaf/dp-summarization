You get FIVE lenses, all for different purposes (with directions as to what their intended use is). The frames themselves look great. They look great on, it comes with a soft cloth case, a hard shell case, a cleaning cloth... for $20, these glasses FAR exceeded my expectations. Will order another pair soon. As for the fit, I have a longer, thinner head. Saw some comments on here about people's heads getting squeezed by these. Mine has plenty of room on both sides. Actually bordering on too much room, but again... I'll blame that on my thin head.",

So big that it pokes into my ridge under the eye and at the edge of the nose. I couldn't possibly stand wearing them more than 2 or 3 seconds. Sadly they have to go back. If the manufacturer is reading this, hopefully you'll make a variety with a nose bridge that is more streamlined. Even a little change would help. Surprised no one else has mentioned....",

The lenses are a bit fidgety to replace the first time (with no usable instructions in the package) but once you figure out how to pull out the bridge while slightly squeezing, there really aren\u2019t any other worries. Since I do woodwork at times, the inclusion of the clear lenses makes these my go-to for that as well. Two for the price of one!",

After two years, why am I writing now? Because the nose piece broke and I wrote to Torege to ask if I somehow get a replacement frame. They responded very quickly and (after I submitted verification of my original purchase) sent me a new pair! I was so impressed and grateful for their excellent customer service.
