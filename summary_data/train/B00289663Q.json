The set I bought the older grandson is over 3 years old, is used at least 5 days a week, and looks very good. I just started using this set recently and it already looks older than the other set. I used a butter knife to cut up pancakes today and the butter knife scratched the plate! Very flimsy and of a poor quality plastic. I would not buy it again and, in fact, am already looking for a replacement.",
