The return was easy and the replace one seems to work OK, though it still doesn't work as smoothly as the old one did, which is exactly the same model/style.

Also helps using it before marinating to get more of the flavor into the meat.

I told her I was going to fix one she could enjoy and she certainly did. It's also so easy to use. You just press down on the handle and the micro blades do the work for you.

Must be careful not to hit any bones because it can dull the blade. Easy to clean. All you need to do is put it in the top rack of your dishwasher and make sure its facing down.

In order to clean the ends of the needles you have to engage the unit to expose them. I've found it easy to clean, I also will fill the cap with warm water & dish detergent and allow the tenderizer to sit and soak for a few minutes after using.",

Beef or chicken cooks clean through even on the grill in half the time. Marinade really penetrates well. Note: Instructions say to go over the meat 4 or 5 times. NOT for 4 or 5 minutes! 4 or 5 times takes 30 seconds or less.",

The meat particles rinse right out and then into the dishwasher to sanitize it. As for the tenderizing action, it's great, really makes a big difference when buying the tougher cuts. Even a few taps on chicken fillets makes them fork tender and it seems like the seasoning penetrates deeper into the meat if you don't have time for a lengthy marinade.",

The higher priced Jacquard with 48 blades is well worth the extra money: having more blades makes using it much faster and easier. The method of piercing the meat instead of pounding it is, in my opinion, does a much better job of tenderizing.I highly recommend this product. It is well made, durable and will last me a lifetime.",
