A fairly large well-built camera packed with features and excellent photo quality usually reserved for much more expensive cameras. Easy to use point and shoot, but has a lot of really advanced features, if you know how to use them all. The hi powered zoom really brings in distant scenes, beautiful photos and outstanding video capabilities. The image stabilization really works well too. Bought it for my daughter, but nearly bought another for me. Should be able to find it around $300-$329. Definitely recommend for the low price and it's a Canon.",

Unfortunately, the shutter opens and closes too slowly for me to keep the focus on my kids as they run up and down the field. I have now purchased the Canon rebel and the reaction time is much quicker for this purpose. However, I still love this camera since it takes great/clear pictures and has an amazing zoom. With this camera, I can use it for other, slower-moving sports (like baseball), and for everyday uses without the need to replace the lense. I highly recommend the camera -- just not for the sports feature.",

Its image control (exposure, focus, close-ups) is excellent. It even takes movies. I strongly recommend purchasing a User's Guide to get the most out of all of its features. I got \"A Short Course In Canon PowerShot SX20 IS Photography\" manual that I really like. The documentation that comes with the camera is limited and mostly online. Note that this camera does not come with a memory card. I got some SanDisk Ultra II SDHC 4GB memory cards for it that work great.",

It's a shame that Canon is too cheap to include a Users' Manual. Someone has written a book for the Canon Powershot SX20 with good ratings on amazon (but for $30), so I'm going to buy that, although it irritates me to have to do so.

My only complaint is that the instruction manual is on a disc which can be downloaded to a computer, but with no printed manual, looking up something on the fly is impossible. I was able to print the manual (4 pages on an 8 1/2 x 11 sheet) and that can fit into my camera bag (folded). It is a chore to do, however. The small wheel on the back of the camera can sometimes be accidentally turned while searching for buttons, but not a big problem. Picture quality is VG for an entry camera and the 20x zoom is great.

If you are really picky about the picture quality, however, you may find a noise, which is usually the case in all Mega Zoom cameras. Anyway, this won't affect much unless you view the images in 1:1 scale. Also if the light condition is good this effect is less visible. The bottom line is this is well worth the price!",

The lens is fast enough in low light to capture some long-range zoomed images of birds in the relatively darkness of the tropical rainforest. While substantially larger and heavier than a point-and-shot camera, the SX20IS is smaller and lighter than a DSLR. While the photo quality is compromised compared to a DSLR, if you are not a professional, or a dedicated photography hobbyist, you will be happy with this camera.",

      "text": "Briefly, if you ever used a DSLR you more or less see the picture your taking and can expect good results, but with the Canon (SX20 IS) what you see through the viewfinder is not always what you get, You just have to trust that the picture will look good and typically they do. The LCD Monitor is a real plus for low and high angle shots. The video is really good quality. Myself, I think it's more complicated than a DSLR. Plan on spending a lot of time reading the manual, if you want quick pictures, buy a point and shoot. This is not a DSLR. Dave",

The zoom was perfect and zoom was probably the most important feature we were looking at. Super easy to use.",

With the classically stylish PowerShot SX20 IS, you can produce magnificent HD movies and dazzling photos. Loaded with features, it\u2019s got a high-powered 20x wide-angle optical zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer, 12.1 megapixels, a big 2.5-inch Vari-Angle LCD, Blink Detection and more. \n\nThe PowerShot SX20 IS is equipped with many of the same features as a higher-end camera: an ultra-powerful zoom, eye-popping resolution and advanced picture-improving technology. 12.1 megapixels of resolution gives your photography incomparable depth and ensures that any section of any shot can be enlarged and cropped with no loss in quality when you edit the image even if you choose to print the image. It can create crisp, clear 13 x 19-inch posters. \n\nPowerShot SX20 IS Highlights \n\n\n\n20x optical zoom in action 20x wide-angle optical zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer\nThe PowerShot SX20 IS is equipped with a 20x Optical Zoom lens with a focal length of 5.0-100mm (35mm equivalent: 28-560mm) that allows you to shoot any scene from wide-angle to telephoto. The camera uses a VCM (Voice Coil Motor) for high-speed, quiet, energy-efficient lens movement with precise control. Focal length is conveniently indicated on the lens barrel. \n\nThe lens is optimized to fully exploit its zoom length and wide shooting angle in concert with the camera\u2019s high 12.1 Megapixel resolution. UD glass effectively suppresses chromatic aberration, while enhanced negative refractive power ensures that distortion at the wide-angle is also corrected. Further aberration is controlled with the inclusion of a double-sided aspherical glass-molded lens and ultra-high refraction index lens. \n\nThe SX20 IS is equipped with Canon\u2019s acclaimed Optical Image Stabilizer Technology that automatically detects and corrects camera shake--one of the leading causes of fuzzy or blurred shots. Even when zoomed in, you can get the steady, crisp, brilliant images you\u2019ll be proud to shoot and share. And Canon\u2019s Optical Image Stabilizer Technology is convenient to use. It functions perfectly with or without a flash. \n\nUse the optical zoom while shooting superb 720p HD movies with stereo sound\nIf you long for the convenience of an advanced still camera that also creates superb movies, the new PowerShot SX20 IS lets you record video in beautiful high definition (1280 x 720 pixels). The camera also makes it easy to enjoy HD movies (and still photos) on your HDTV with a mini-HDMI connector for direct connection to a high-definition monitor. You'll enjoy the HD experience with no degradation of image or audio in the signal, plus the ability to display up to 130 thumbnails at once. \n\nImproved Smart AUTO intelligently selects the proper settings\nJust set the Canon PowerShot SX20 IS to Smart AUTO and you're ready for maximum enjoyment from your picture taking every time. It's a relaxing and satisfying way to shoot because you can completely concentrate on your subject knowing that the camera has the technical details covered. Advanced Canon technology intelligently analyzes your situation and shooting conditions. Then it automatically selects an appropriate setting from 22 specially defined settings. So whether you're photographing flowers, a captivating sunset, or your friends at the park, you can be confident that you're getting dramatic, memorable images. \n\nShooting Modes\nAdvanced presets for the best possible photos under certain conditions. With 24 Shooting Modes, you're ready for whatever shot comes your way. \n\nDIGIC 4 Image Processor \nCanon\u2019s proprietary DIGIC Image Processors have long set its cameras apart from the competition, and the new DIGIC 4 sets the bar even higher. Faster, more accurate noise reduction delivers better image quality, even at high ISO speeds. \n\niSAPS Technology is an entirely original scene-recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos, iSAPS works with the advanced DIGIC 4 Image Processor to improve focus speed and accuracy, as well as exposure and white balance. \n\nLarge 2.5-inch Vari-Angle LCD enables easy viewing\nThe camera\u2019s 2.5-inch LCD screen gives you the big picture, whether you\u2019re shooting, reviewing or showing off your images. This high-resolution screen offers a crisp, clear picture to make shooting, playback and using the camera\u2019s menu functions especially convenient. Clear and bright, it also features Night Display for easy viewing in low light. It also has an electronic viewfinder that provides sharp images when you shoot close-up with Super Macro shooting mode. \n\nThis AA battery powered camera enables you to easily power up\nConveniently, you don\u2019t need to worry about running out of batteries or having to recharging them. Since AA-size batteries can be purchased at any store, simply get new ones locally wherever you go--no special power adapters or chargers are needed. \n\nWhat's in the Box  * PowerShot SX20 IS Body \n * AA-size Alkaline Battery (x4) \n * Neck Strap NS-DC4 \n * Lens Hood LH-DC50 \n * Lens Cap \n * Digital Camera Solution CD-ROM \n * USB Interface Cable IFC-400PCU \n * Stereo Video Cable STV-250N",
