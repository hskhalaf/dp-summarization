      "text": "My daughter brought this hammock to my attention when she blithely packed hers to bring home for a visit -- such a tiny footprint! I put mine up when two young city visitors come around, and they squeal with delight at this unusual outdoor comfort place. They pretend they are inside a leaf, and so they are! Thank you for creating this exquisite hideaway of peace for all who come to my home. It's very strong and hardy, and I can't wait to order the black straps that are designed for it. We're using river boat straps presently, but the black straps would be kinder to the oak and maple trees.",
