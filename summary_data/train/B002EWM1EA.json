      "text": "Works just like it is supposed to. I can go from blues to heavy metal with the turn of a dial. The drawback is that if you run off battery power, it will eat batteries very fast even when unplugged and the unit is turned off. I still can't figure out how that's happening, but it does! I have to take the battery out when I'm done playing or I know I'll need a new one when I practice the next day. Nine volt batteries are NOT cheap if you replace them every day. Yes - I've ordered a 9v adapter. :-)",

I love the color, yes the build is plastic but it's not like I'm stomping to kill the thing. And it sounds amazing! Nice and bright (if you make it so) The only reason it's not a perfect 5 stars is because of the hiss. The digital noise. If toy pick up a noise gate like I did, you're golden. But on its own... Theirs is a lot of noise.",

This pedal gives some crazy tones. It didn't take a while before I found a perfect sound. It gives out a gain sound that you can still recognize every note you play. This made my amp sound 50 times better. Makes it super easy to change from clean to distorted sounds fast.",

READ BEFORE YOU BUY It requires two music instrument cords, for the amp and another for guitar (not included). It does not come with a power supply adapter. It can use 9V batteries but will not get enough juice unless plugged in. (batteries not included)",

Not terribly touch sensitive but more than enough pedal for a beginner. the only problem is the plastic casing. Tone knob doesn't appear to do much....gain isn't a lot better. better than most solid state distortions included in amplifiers of the 'practice' amp variety. As an example, the distortion is better than what my little Peavey Envoy can provide. Also better than the Danelectro distortion pedal (Fabtone series). recommend as a cheap alternative pedal.",

Some need a little of both. The BEHRINGER Overdrive/Distortion OD300 has all your bases covered. \n\nTRUCKLOADS OF TONE\nWith its dedicated OVERDRIVE/DISTORTION blend dial, you can turn all the way to the left for pure overdrive, or all the way to the right for straight-ahead distortion. In between, you get an infinite amount of options for creating the perfect overdrive/distortion cocktail. And with the dedicated TONE, LEVEL and DRIVE dials, everything you need to create a signature sound is at your fingertips.\n\nEASE OF USE\nThe LED tells you when this pedal is working its magic, and the top-quality on/off switch maintains excellent signal integrity in bypass mode. You can power the OD300 with either a 9 V battery, or the optional PSU-SB DC power supply (not included).\n\nVALUE\nWhy settle for just overdrive or distortion when you can have both? Set your tone on fire with distortion, overdrive, or a potent blend of both with the BEHRINGER Overdrive/Distortion OD300.\n\nDesigned for use with: Guitar/Bass/Keyboards",
