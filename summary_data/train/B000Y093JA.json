For under $100.00, I think you can easily get $100.00 worth of value/wear out of them. In my experience, if you need a wide size, move up a half size. For reference, I wear a wide in Eastland, Redwing, and Bass and I wear a 9 in Brooks, Asics, and Sperry. I ordered a 9.5 (American) in these Blunnies and they fit great -- except that I get some pain on the top bone of my foot after a long day of wear. They have not stretched out.",

I know people have complained about the materials being less than they were 10 or so years ago. However, I do think they perform better when worn more regularly. I know someone else pointed this out. All I can say is, they do wear out, but I really wear them a considerable amount. I work with dogs and do a fair amount of outdoor work; so as far as I'm concerned, they are durable boots.",

The pair I received have already loose seams, shoddy leatherwork and one shoe has a slightly uneven sole. I will update this review when I hear back from Blundstone, but I'm posting now to advise anyone interested in buying Blundstone's on Amazon to shop around first and see if you can find a retailer in your area so you can see the shoes you're buying.",

    "description": "Bei den Farmern Australiens seit \u00fcber 100 Jahren sehr beliebt ist dieser klassische Workerboot von BLUNDSTONE. Er sch\u00fctzt und st\u00fctzt den Fu\u00df optimal bei harter Arbeit. Inzwischen ist der bequeme und robuste Boot auch au\u00dferhalb von 'Down Under' aus dem Stadtbild nicht mehr wegzudenken. Aus wasserabweisendem Leder mit Elastikeinsatz. Bequemes Fu\u00dfbett; leichte, rutschfeste Gummisohle mit 'Shock Protection System', dadurch extrem gelenkschonend.\no Material: Rindsleder\no Beidseitig elastische Eins\u00e4tze\no Innenmaterial: Leder\no Textile Innensohle, herausnehmbar\no Gummilaufsohle stark profiliert\n\n\nPflegehinweise: Leder reinigen: Entfernen Sie zuerst alle verkrusteten Verschmutzungen an Ihren Stiefeln mit einer weichen Borstenb\u00fcrste oder einem feuchten Tuch und lassen Sie Ihre Stiefel an der Luft trocknen. Bitte stellen Sie sicher, dass Ihre Stiefel nicht direktem Sonnenlicht oder Heizungen ausgesetzt sind, da sie das Leder austrocknen. Tragen Sie Lederpolitur, Spray oder Creme auf das Leder auf, um Ihre Stiefel zu pflegen. Wenn Sie zum ersten Mal eine Politur verwenden, versuchen Sie es an einer unauff\u00e4lligen Stelle des Schuhs, um zu pr\u00fcfen, ob sich Farbe oder Aussehen \u00e4ndern. Wenn Sie eine Politur verwenden, tragen Sie eine kleine Menge Lederreiniger auf ein Poliertuch oder eine B\u00fcrste auf und reiben Sie den Schuh in kreisf\u00f6rmigen Bewegungen ein. Wischen Sie den R\u00fcckstand weg und lassen Sie ihn wieder trocknen.\n\nHinweis: Blundstone-Stiefel sind mit australischen Gr\u00f6\u00dfen markiert. Bitte beachten Sie, dass sich unsere \u00bd-Gr\u00f6\u00dfen auf die Breite und nicht auf die L\u00e4nge beziehen. Die australische Herrengr\u00f6\u00dfe entspricht der in Gro\u00dfbritannien. Die australische Gr\u00f6\u00dfe von Frauen ist eine geringere Gr\u00f6\u00dfe als in Gro\u00dfbritannien.\n\n\n\nBlundstone's adult 510 slip-on boot is an everyday casual work shoe you'll get miles of wear in. Featuring 2.5-millimeter-thick weather-proof leather, a well-designed shock protection system that reduces shock by 33 percent, and a removable Cambrelle footbed that wicks moisture away, this work boot is designed as much for comfort as for dependability. It also includes an injection-molded dual density polyurethane outsole for a softer step. This high-quality ankle work boot also has flexible elastic panels and finger loops at the top of the shoe for easy slip-on and removal.\n\nBlundstone has been making sturdy and unique boots in Tasmania, Australia, since 1870. The family-owned company has maintained the quality, integrity and authenticity of their products for over 130 years. Blundstone boots are no-nonsense, go-anywhere, do\n\nSee more",
