It impossible to keep new fresh batteries in a camera all the time. I can't take it any where unless I have a pack of new fresh batteries on hand at lest ten of them to start with. Now I just can't use it. Don't buy this unless you get a 90 day warranty. Dennis 560 in West Philly.",

The pictures are beautiful! i just wish the batteries would last longer. This was my first digital camera.I think I am going to get a 10 MP so i can get a better zoom. I also would have liked a bigger LCD screen. UPDATE: I just found out that you have to buy special batteries for this camera-not AA batteries but CRV batteries. NOW THIS CAMERA WORKS PERFECTO!",

I found that natural light is always better than the light from the flash. Also, don't expect a super-high powered zoom lens, this lens is perfect for cropping subjects a little closer. I use the movie feature often, it is perfect for making internet ready movie clips. I just plug into my powerbook laptop and without clicking anything the files mount onto my desktop.",

      "text": "We bought this camera 1-1/2 years ago. It was being discontinued and we got it for what we thought was a good deal. We very quickly learned that the pictures come out very dark, sometime almost black. Not just indoors either, pictures taken outside are very dark too. Videos are quite difficult to see when playing back. About a week ago, the camera died completely. We've always been very careful with our camera and have never dropped it or anything. The screen doesn't work and we can't take pictures now. I suppose it's a good thing because now we can actually get a good camera.",

I bought this in a hurry from Ritz Cameras (I have the same feelings about that place). So, I'll just toss it sometime and buy something else with a new lesson learned: Avoid Pentax like the plague.",

      "text": "This camera was purchased because of its low price, low weight and small size. It was going to be installed in a radio controled airplane. While this camera has many interesting bells and whistles, its ability to control contrast and to capture colors is poor, compared to Nikon and Canon of similar megapixel ratings. I could see little difference in contrast when the in-camera contrast was adjusted, and reducing the ASA/sensitivity did not help. The shadows and blacks always had a strong blue cast, even when cloudy/sunny settings were manipulated. The quality of the images were even beyond the help of Photoshop CS. I recommend it only for beginners.",

      "text": "I bought this last year and liked the look and the size, as well as the aa batteries, but discovered to work well you had to buy special aa batteries, and even with these the camera was very slow. Not just slow btwn pics, but slow in capturing images after you press the trigger. So, it took nice pictures if my subject was a mountain or something that stood still, but many pics turned out blurry from the fact that the flash went off a number of times and people moved before the camera captured the photo. Additionally, I dropped the camera from a few feet and the lens stuck open, so i felt it wasn't very durable.",

While it was a great little camera for the first 15 months, it now runs through batteries faster than I can take a picture - literally. Customer service recommends using rechargeable batteries (which I have been using), but otherwise repair was their only solution. Friends with the same camera are also having the same problem. While other manufacturers might charge a little bit more, I think a different brand (i.e. Nikon) is well worth the investment.",

What's the point in a 4 mega pixel camera if all you get is a really well defined bad picture. Needless to say the camera went back the next day. I'm sticking with Canon for my next camera.",
