After years of low cleaning tables that left my back aching I decided to splurge a bit and try this table. Height is great, sink hooks up to camper and works well, cleans up quick. My only suggestion is having the inner surface and inch taller than the border surface so laying a knife flat when cutting a fillet is a bit easier. That one micro kept it from being a 5 star but just barely. Great utility product that saves your back and time in line at the cleaning station.",
