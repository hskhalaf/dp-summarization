Its held together with a tiny bit of plastic that the unit rotates around . Since all the weight of the unit (filled with snacks) rests on this tiny piece of plastic, one can see how it could break easily upon lifting the unit. They should really make that one part with a metal bolt and washers. It needs to be something more durable than plastic to withstand the movement of the lazy suzan and moving and lifting the tray.",

I also like that I can see what is running low and restock easily. It doesn't look bad on the counter either. It was very easy to assemble and functions exactly as one would hope. I could see this being handy and convenient for a very long time. I think it will make a great gift too.",

The height of the overall rack is 16 inches, not 14 inches. I had measured my pantry shelves beforehand because they\u2019re not adjustable, so I had to be sure this rack would fit. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t, which would have been nice to have known before ordering it. Looks like I\u2019ll be returning it after all.",

So, unless this certain piece on was a bit defective, might be a common problem. Fortunately it is a very easy fix with some strong super glue and it has not affected its use. It's been working great and saved up some space.",
