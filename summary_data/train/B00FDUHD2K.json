It works very well - and being a USB 3 drive, it's fast too when plugged into a USB 3 port. However, the clear plastic sliding shield on this flash drive \"doesn't slide\"! It's extremely difficult to get it to move. I literally have to use a pair of kitchen pliers to get it to move. That is totally unacceptable, so the protective cover has to stay open all the time - making it totally useless, which is so irksome, it cost it two stars in this review.",

I bought these last two when they were the deal of the day, but I own about 3 or 4 previous generation PNY thumb drives, so this isn't my first rodeo with this brand. We're old friends. These are great. I don't need to go into detail about a thumb drive, since I'm sure everyone knows what they do, but the value is great and I've had no problems with data loss or anything of that sort with PNY.",

Stick with a brand you can depend on, like PNY, even if you pay a few dollars more. I like the built-in slide cover on this one, as you can't accidentally lose the cap. Drive seems quite fast on file transfers, although I admit I haven't benchmarked it.",

Overall, it's a nice flash drive that works as expected.",
