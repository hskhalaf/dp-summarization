I have purchased keys from Kinguin.net in the past and I will probably will again it is much cheaper but, the last key I bought I had to call Microsoft to get it activated because the key showed as previously activated....for a $3000 build I'm not taking a chance spent that much might as well spend a little more and get an OEM key from MS that is worry free. I'll save kinguin for the budget builds.",

Everything loaded as expected, and the code worked the first time. Once the new machine connected to the Internet, the OS activated automatically. OS is now fully updated and current.

So I bit the bullet and ordered a new hard drive, a hard drive switch box, and Windows 10. The install went so smoothly that I decided to do my wife's computer also in the same way. So now we both have dual boot systems with a push of a button. Windows 10 is awesome.",

To get the system running took no effort at all, but to get it working well (disable Cortana) shouldn't have taken any time at all. I also find that the customization features, while welcome and numerous, are a bit disorganized and sprawling. I've been trying to get my home PC and work PC to look the same for months and I still can't find the right options.",
