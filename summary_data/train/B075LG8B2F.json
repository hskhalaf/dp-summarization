Being Cali born for 25 years n moving to DC was a shock to my body come winter time. 50 Degrees was bone chillingly painful but this was the perfect solution! even when it was 20 degrees outside it felt like a nice 70 inside the jacket which turned my 6am car warm up from a near death experience on a daily basis to a walk on the beach on a warm summer (cali) day. Totally worth the incredibly high price tag.",

One thing that\u2019s unexpect ed is that it jet black looks awesome. Jacket has a much more European tailored look than the American jackets which I really like. Best winter jacket I have ever owned. UPDATE- I see some people taking a star off for the zipper getting stuck.

Sometimes the zipper can get caught on the inside lining, but not anything serious enough to complain about.",

However, the \"replacement \" I got was not at all the same jacket, not even close. None of the softness, different style, heavier, way cheaper feeling. It does have marmot labels but no new tag, and it has definitely been washed a few times. It might be a knock off. So yeah, the real deal is the best jacket ever but be diligent",
