For someone in their early 20's or someone with modernness it gives simplicity yet flashiness that your granddad would appreciate. The house of hamilton produces prestigious watches and backs the name up. For someone as myself with a mild collection with little knowledge of watches this really brings me to a collectors level where soon my collection will be relevant to not just me but everyone. I love it. Would have given 10 stars but the 5 system's what I'm working with.",

Lesson: Buy this great watch, but next time, find a great guy to give it to! LOL!",

I myself like watches of case diameter of 44-50mm, but then again I am bigger than my son. What really struck me about this watch was the combination of case diameter and case slimness, along with swiss quartz movement and price. Very sharp and a quality watch too! Highly recommend.",
