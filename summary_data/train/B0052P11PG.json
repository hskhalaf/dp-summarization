Wait until all skincare or makeup has dried downbefore applying. 2. Gently pat it into skin; don\u2019t rub. 2. Use to smooth makeup creasing 3. DIY a BB cream dation by mixing 25% foundation 75% line filler. 4. Turn loose powder formulas into sheer cream like formulas for a fast natural look 5. smooths flyaway hair or brows Bottom line: Give it a try.",

I used the Honey app to follow the price and bought it when a alert came up with a low price. So, mystery solved. It's not a filler (something that is essentially Spackle for the face). I had checked EWG.org to see if it had unhealthy chemicals. It does not, it's basically benign. I'll use it and if it actually improves wrinkles (not holding my breath), I will update this review. I still need a Spackle compound to go under make up but don't want to use something that pours carcinogens through my skin.",

My skin feels so nice to the touch. I have very sensitive skin and am always worried when trying a new product, but no issues with this one. It pats on nicely and makes my skin feel silky. It almost feels like a very light balm.",
