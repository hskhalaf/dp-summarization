This F600 version works pretty good with AT&T 4G LTE ( you can use this link to check the compatable between your phone and carriers in US [...]) Daese has a great customer service. The shipment is fast and they have tried their best to meet the customer satisfaction. I said this based on my own experience and did not receive any thing from them in return.",

Feels great in the hand, and you don't need a case. I highly recommend it. You will not have buyers remorse. Cons * Battery is very average. Which is why you should carry a 2nd battery. * Speaker isn't as good as G3 and G4. Not bad. Just not as good. * Fingerprint sensor is hit and miss. I'd say 90/10%. But it's fast. * I wish Qslide had the Youtoube app. * Despite the claims, screen is NOT shatter proof.",
