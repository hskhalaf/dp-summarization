They are very VERY similar to Frangos... a little softer, and the individual pieces are larger, but the satisfaction is the same. I haven't seen them at Costco lately, but was lucky to find this package through Amazon, a great price, for a really great treat! Delivery quickly and in perfect condition.",

They were Dilettante, so they were good, but I still like the mint ones which I am addicted to, I think, best. Given my addiction, this review may be unfair. They are definitely worth ordering and enjoying! I've been enjoying their chocolates since they were a tiny hole in the wall business in Seattle. I'd dance at Cornish and go there for a treat. Completely blew my program, but worth every calorie, and every penny!",

The chocolate Is so amazing and creamy it truly just melts in your mouth. The mouth feel is heavenly with zero waxy left to ruin in like in so many other chocolates. The mint is a perfect level without being overbearing or the sharp taste you get from most other mint chocolate. I will be a lifelong customer of these.",
