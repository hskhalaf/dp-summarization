      "text": "The picture at Amazon makes it look huge in comparison (once you take it out of the box, you will be stunned at the actual size). I almost made the mistake of getting the Casio because it is so tiny, but reviewers said the 4MP Casio was a complete sham (more like 2MP) so I got this one instead. Very glad. Night mode is excellent and everything else is Elph quality- basically what you'd expect. Pretty tough too. Just to be sure, I got a \"standard\" memory card because I was told the other ones wouldn't be compatible?",

This is a no nonsense camera. Straight point and shoot anyone can use it. I like how small it is cause you can truly take it anywhere. As they say the best camera is the one you have with you. Is very cheap on ebay if you want one. This or the sd20 which is the improved version.",

Trust me if you are looking for a compact camera you will not be disappointed. It works as nice as the Canon G2, & G3, which I also owned but where to bulky and I wanted something more compact.",

    "title": "Canon Powershot SD10 4MP Digital Camera (Black)",
    "description": "Color:BlackAMAZON.COM\nThe smallest Digital Elph yet, the petite and undeniably chic Canon PowerShot SD10 packs a lot of digital photography power. It features a 4-megapixel resolution, movie mode with audio for up to 3 minutes of video, 5-point AiAF, and a fixed focus lens with 5.7x digital zoom. This model comes in stylish black, but the SD10 also comes in white, bronze, and silver. \n\n Optics and Resolution\nThe PowerShot SD10 offers a 4-megapixel CCD sensor that produces images up to 2272 x 1704 pixels for photo-quality 11 x 14 inch enlargements. Other resolution modes include 1600 x 1200, 1024 x 768, and 640 x 480. The fixed focus lens has a focal length of 2.8mm. The SD10 enables you to get closer to your subject with its 5.7x digital zoom. The SD10 also features Canon's nine-point AiAF system for focusing accuracy and shutter speeds of 15 to 1/1,500 second. \n\n Movie Mode \nIn addition to taking still photos, the SD10 can also record up to 3 minutes of video with sound. It has two resolution settings: 320 x 240, and 160 x 120. You can record for up to 3 minutes per clip in either resolution. Note that you cannot use the optical zoom when in movie mode. The included 32 MB memory card can hold 85 seconds of video at the highest setting. \n\n More Features\nThe SD10 features a fast start-up time of just 1.4 seconds, and a shot-to-shot speed of 1.5 seconds. The Quick Shot feature lets you activate the shutter immediately in one stroke after you press the shutter release button; the SD10 even optimizes the focus automatically. \n\n Canon's DIGIC (DIGital Imaging Core) processor ensures excellent color rendition and white balance for every shot, as well as super-fast auto focusing, noise-free imaging, and advanced flash exposure performance. Even before the shutter release is pressed, the built-in iSAPS (intelligent scene analysis based on photographic space) technology is analyzing the scene and making camera adjustments to deliver fast focusing and perfect exposures. \n\n Other features include: \n\n * 1.5-inch LCD monitor (no viewfinder) \n * Built-in flash with Auto, Red-eye Reduction On/Off, Slow-sync modes \n * Shooting modes: Auto, Manual, Slow Shutter, Quick Shot, Stitch Assist, Movie \n * Photo effects: Vivid Color, Neutral Color, Low Sharpening, Sepia, Black & White \n * Metering: evaluative, spot, center weighted average \n * Continuous shooting of 1.6 frames per second, up to 8 frames \n * Self timer with 2 and 10 second options \n\nPrinting\nCanon has introduced a series of printers designed to work directly with its lineup of digital cameras. Using these printers, no computer is required--simply connect the camera to the printer and start printing. Printers include Canon's bubble jet direct printers i900D and i960, and card photo printer CP-200 and CP-300. Of course, photos from your camera can also be printed on any home computer system with an inkjet printer, sent off for online processing, or simply enjoyed on your computer screen.  Storage and Transfer\nThe SD10 is compatible with Secure Digital (SD) MultiMedia (MMC) memory cards; a 32 MB SD card is included. When shooting in Large/Normal mode, you can store 26 images on the included memory card. Images can be downloaded to either a Mac or PC via USB 1.1, which means the camera can be connected to any USB-based Windows Me/2000/XP and Mac OS 8.6 or later computer without installing any software. \n\n Power and Size\nThe camera is powered by a proprietary rechargeable lithium-ion battery (NB-3L). It measures 3.6 by 1.9 by 0.7 inches and weighs 3.5 ounces (excluding battery). \n\n What's In The Box\nThis package includes the PowerShot SD10 digital camera, 32 MB Secure Digital memory card, rechargeable lithium-ion battery (NB-3L), battery charger (CB-2LU), USB and AV cables, and wrist strap. It also comes with ArcSoft Camera Suite and Digital Camera Solutions CD-ROMs with imaging software and USB drivers for Windows and Mac.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe PowerShot SD10 lets you express your personal style with a choice of cool colors and textures, a super-sleek size and a 4.0 Megapixel design that gives you the high resolution images that make a big impression. \n\n Super-Slim Size, Awesome Colors\nThe ultra-thin PowerShot SD10 is yours in a choice of four richly textured colors--choose the one that suits your personality. There's Black buffed to a high-gloss, White with iridescent pearl coating, Bronze with a radiant hair-line finish or Silver with a true metallic feel. The camera measures a slim 3.6 by 1.9 by 0.7 inches (excluding protrusions), and weighs just 3.5 ounces. \n\n 4.0 Megapixel CCD with Canon's exclusive DIGIC and iSAPS Technology\nWith the imaging power of 4.0 Megapixels and Canon's exclusive DIGIC and iSAPS technology, it's easy to produce images of outstanding clarity, detail and real-life color. \n\n \n\n\nCanon's 4.0 megapixel CCD with Digic and iSAPS technology captures outstanding clarity, color, and detail.  The DIGIC Imaging Processor speeds image handling, so autofocus is more accurate, fluid and natural. iSAPS, Canon's digital scene-recognition technology, teams up with the DIGIC for faster more accurate focus and exposure, plus better white balance. \n\n Canon High-Resolution Single Focus Lens and 5-point AiAF Autofocus\nWith its high-resolution Canon lens, the PowerShot SD10 lets you create breath-taking pictures filled with life's rich details and bold, natural hues. The 5-point AiAF delivers precise focus automatically, no matter how you frame your subject, so you can shoot with real confidence \n\n \n\n\nCanon's Super Macro Mode delivers close-up detail. 5.7x Digital Zoom and Super Macro Mode\nWhen you're shooting from afar, Canon's sophisticated 5.7x Digital Zoom moves you in with the touch of a button. For extreme close-ups, Canon's Super Macro Mode gives you perfect focus even when your subject is just 1.18 inches from the lens.  Quick Shot Function and Movie Mode\nUsing the camera's Quick Shot Function, you're free to shoot immediately--without pause or lag--simply by pressing the shutter button. The PowerShot SD10 even optimizes focus so you'll never miss another great shot. \n\n With Movie Mode, you can create movies with sound--up to 3 minutes long--and view them on the camera's LCD.
