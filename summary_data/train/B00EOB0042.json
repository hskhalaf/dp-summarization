I stopped using the deodorant and hoped the problem would resolve on it's own, but no such luck. It got to the point where I could barely lift my arms due to the pain. Went to the doctor and she confirmed that I had numerous underarm abscesses likely due to clogged pores. This has never happened before, so I'm certain the deodorant is to blame. Started antibiotics today and hoping for some relief soon. Needless to say, I won't be purchasing Green Tidings again.",

The directions say to put on a small amount, so no swiping back and forth several times, which might make it last longer. It also is drier than normal deodorants, which means it doesn't glide on. Like I said, it's very dry and it keeps you very dry. I bought the lavender fragrance and love it! Very nice smell. So even though it's small and dry, it seems to work wonderfully. I will be purchasing it again, only the larger size next time.",

This made me nervous about making the switch. I made a decision to try out Green Tidings based on the overwhelmingly positive review and I'm so glad I did. It does well with the odor and I have not have had any skin reactions, nor adaptation phases so far. Please note that it does not prevent you from sweating.",

This product ends up being nearly ten dollars for a tiny little \"sample size\" container. Who spends that kind of money for a sample?

      "text": "I LOVE this product and will only buy this deodorant from now on! I have tossed my chemical filled deodorants in the trash! For whatever reason, my usual Dove and Secret deodorants were no longer effective, after using them for YEARS. I searched the Internet for truly natural products with good reviews, and found Green Tidings All Natural Deodorant. This outstanding product TOTALLY works. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND! I also gave one to a dear girlfriend who has extremely sensitive skin, and it works great for her as well. It has a very pleasant, light lavender scent, and not only is it a deodorant, it keeps my perspiration at bay.",

But with time (about a month) it started to cause a burning sensation and I developed cysts (deep zits that hurt) in my arms pits. So alas, I think I will not be able to use this great product anymore. It is worth it to buy the sample size to try it out. So much better without the chemicals that are found in regular deodorants and it does work.",

I haven't been outside in extreme heat, just around 80 degrees or so, but it held up. I will try and update once the summer kicks in. Update 7/22/2015 The deodorant still works in hot weather, into the 90s. I clean my arms with witch hazel or alcohol to kill off bacteria. My underarms have darkened, which is an unfortunate side effect, but because if the effectiveness, I still purchase it. You have to decide which side effect is worth dealing with: underarm odor, harmful ingredients, or darkened skin. I really hope this review helps you!",

I'm not worried about the \"natural\" smell lol!! Definitely wait a few minutes after shaving before applying to underarms if you have sensitive skin like me. It can burn a little on freshly shaven skin. I love this product and will keep ordering it in the future!!!",
