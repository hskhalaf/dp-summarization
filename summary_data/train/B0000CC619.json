Although only a 3.2 MP, it's shutter response, color, and image clarity is far better than any camera-phone and still holds it's own with many other dedicated cameras when set to maximum resolution. In fact, having outdoor images averaging ~840KB are very handy for quick downloads, emailing, digital albums, and basic use reprints. I think we all have \"that relative\" that likes to send bloated 4MB pictures to everybody. Only major con is that the video function does NOT record audio. Minor con is the use of XD cards instead of SD, but otherwise still a solid camera.",

I exchanged it for Sony P72 which like some others has focuse illumination feature and takes crisp pictures indoors. What a relieve!",
