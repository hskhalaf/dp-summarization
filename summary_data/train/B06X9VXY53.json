Honestly it's a normal, non-invasive \"hum\" that seems to be about average volume. It emits the *same* sound without producing any fluctuating or weird noises, which means that it just blends into the background and consequently you don't even think about it. Power: All fine; I recommend settings 2-3. All in all - for the price, a good buy.",
