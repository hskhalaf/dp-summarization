Rather than that I'm very happy with this little deep fry. It heats up pretty quick too. So I recommend this to anyone that is single or 2 persons that live in the house. Update I can fry three of those chicken legs easy\ud83d\ude42 with out the frying basket.",

It arrived the day AFTER I ordered it (how do they do that?) and so I used it tonight to cook some fried mushrooms and some french fries. THE BEST! I wanted a small fryer as there is just me and my husband now and this on did not take up much counter space and there is still plenty of room inside to cook enough food for a family. I let it cool down and then put it in our refrigerator....we'll use again tomorrow! I love this little fryer. Don't hesitate...just buy it. You'll be glad you did!",

Could have had a FIRE if left unattended. Then I checked the box. Gold old Presto used to be stamped out it Wisconsin, this too is now made in China. So sad. It's a cute little unit would have been perfect if it wasn't so cheap and broken.",
