It is not worth my time to send it back so I will use it as is. I would not gift this to someone as it is not, in my opinion, a giftable item. Certainly not great quality.",

It is flimsy and mine had scratches on it (even though there was film wrap attached) so there was no way anything I framed would be acceptable. Some advice for would-be DYI framers -- like so many things, it is not as easy as it looks. If you can afford to have your precious photos or whatever professionally framed -- do it! I am not going to bother returning the frame but will chalk it up as a learning experience!",
