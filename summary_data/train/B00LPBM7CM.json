Honestly, it would have been so much better to get a bike from Walmart and get them to assemble it. This was a horrible experience and the manual is crap. EDIT: *The replacement came in a few days! This time around, things went much quicker; maybe about 45 minutes. But I did have to buy the tools on my own so that's something that could have been said before. And the brakes are pedal brakes, not hand brakes. Other than that, it's good!",

      "text": "The assembly wasn't too hard, but they didin't include any of the tools to assemble it, which every other bike I have ever ordered did. It worked out fine though as I did have the tools available. My son LOVED the bike and really enjoyed riding it for 2 weeks. Then he started having problems with the chain. The part of the bike that the pedals are attached to seemed to be loose, and the chain also rubbed against the plastic piece that it was next whenever he braked. I have requested a return, and am still debating whether to re-order this bike or go for a different one.",
