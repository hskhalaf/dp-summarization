My children ended up with fiberglass splinters due to this flimsy product collapsing under their tiny weight, and they had no way to clearly communicate why they were in pain. It's garbage. The rods that support the tent are fiberglass without proper sheathing. They simply snap with a tiny amount of pressure and the fibers are released to wreak havoc. This item should be recalled. Every customer should be refunded. It is trash that will hurt your children.",

I even fit in it with her and we still had enough room for a few dolls to have tea with us, although it was of course, a bit tight. It doesn't take up too much space in my house (like I would complain about ANYTHING of hers taking up space haha). Set up was easy. The instructions aren't good, so I got it up by trial and error. Still, I had it assembled in under 5 minutes. Absolutely adorable and she loves it. Best $20 I've ever spent on Amazon!",

After they are done playing just put it back in the convenient storage bag! This is an unbelievable purchase for the price.

A sturdier mesh would make the tent VERY durable. And the second thing is the fiddly little ribbons that keep the supports from sliding around.

The stars are glow in the dark and the windows are a nice touch! It stands up with four metal rods. Super easy to put together and tear down. Came with a bag to store! My kids have played with it constantly since we put it up even setting it up as a seperate room.",

It was pretty tricky for me to figure it out. The second photo is a photo of the sticks use to hold the castle up. The stretch easily and you just put them in place... but putting them on the inside of the castle and making it stand was a bit much for me. But the outcome is pretty cool and I\u2019m sure your little princess would love and enjoy being a princess in her own castle with this one.",
