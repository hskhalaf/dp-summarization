My cooks are consistent and there is no noise for all it does. I\u2019ve used the rotisserie function over 20 times and it does a great job! Quick tip: every time you start/stop the rotisserie function it changes the direction of the turn. Just in case you set up your cook to render/have the fat flow out a certain direction.",

I also made Beef Jerky, just need to put timer 2 or 3 times. since the max is 2 hours (at 175 F). Also, It does heat up at surrounding areas, so make sure there is enough clearance surrounding toaster. It will be great for WINTER TIME usage here in Houston Tx, I Have not tired making Cakes or pies.. but will soon (in winter).",

At times the chicken cooking will spatter slightly and the inside of the oven will need cleaning. This included the tray that came with the oven, it was grease stained and hard to clean. Might be better if the tray had a no stick surface on it. Honestly the only complaint I have. It is great to have this and not fire up the full size oven during the summer heat.",

The chicken came out okay, but the problem is that you have to buy a really small chicken for it to spin properly. That is fine, though, because I have a good recipe for roasted chicken that doesn't involve a rotisserie. Love this oven!",

We've had it for almost a month and last night was the first time we did rotisserie cornish game hens and the result was awesome. The footprint is about the same as the model it replaced but a little taller which makes it easier to clean. I wish it had a light inside like another model that we were looking at, but the price of that one was quite a bit more. We cleaned the interior right after it cooled down when we used the rotisserie function to prevent splatters from getting baked on.",
