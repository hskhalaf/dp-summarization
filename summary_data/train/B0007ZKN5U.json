She used to have a plastic stroller that costed twice as much and was garbage. Was very easily put together in minutes. Her cat Mishie loves rides with the 22\" reborn doll. Everyone is happy with this purchase. I'll recommend it to anyone I know with little girls.",

There should be a way to clip the bed of the buggy to the frame. What they have for this is dumb and does not work. Very disappointed and so is my 3 year old grandaughter I wish I could return it but do not have box it came in. Very sad in California.",
