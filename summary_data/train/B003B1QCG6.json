I live in Ohio & the pool temp had been right around 72 degrees. I put on this new over & it raised the temp 10 degrees overnight! Then, I went on vacation for a week & when I returned the pool temp was 94 degrees! It raised the water temp over 20 degrees in a week. Wish I would have purchased this years ago!",

I called the seller and it sounds like this was a known problem that they say has now been fixed. They replaced the cover for no charge (they usually charge shipping but I live local to their warehouse and I picked it up), which is why the review is 3 stars instead of 1. Now I'll wait to see if this one actually holds up; it seems much thinner and lighter than the original. Seems to work just as well.",

      "text": "Perfectly fits my 18' round pool. No overlap. I find that if I keep it on 2 days in a row the pool is completely heated. The trick is don't run your pool during the day. Let the cover sit on the pool, come home from work and run your filter. The the first 12 to 24 inches of water are very warm under the cover. Let that water circulate for about 10 minutes. Do the same thing again the next day, and your good to go. This cover also keeps water and chemicals from evaporating. Seems very sturdy. Hoping to get 3 seasons out of it before he chemicals start to eat away at it.",

That way you're not pulling apart the seams, your pulling with them. No tears yet and I've had it a couple months now. I'll add the fifth star if I can get the aforementioned three seasons out of it.",

We learned that the best way to use it is to have it on all the time, unless the pool is being used, and to run the pool pump after the sun goes down (maximizes sunlight going into the pool). I would definately say get one if you dont like to swim in cold water!",

Pros: It works Since the cover floats, it's very easy to put in and take out Lightweight, but durable Cons: No instructions Not a perfect circle -- does require some trimming of material to fit correctly",
