We left the middle dangly crystal off, as it's just decorative anyway. The only issue is that the crystal cover seems to make your room look like there are yellowish spots everywhere. You can change the light setting from bright to to more natural looking though, which helps a bit. Overall, very happy with this fan.",

Instead of sending back I modified base slightly to install. Once modified worked fine. I do not know why base would have been different. I did not contact the company or seller for exchange, but 4 stars.",

After two months it started to make a little bit of a buzzing as we used the fan almost constantly. When we contacted tech support, they gave some tips and said it shouldn't make the noise any longer. It worked and they even followed up after a week or two and shortly after it started to make the noise again. After telling them this, they mailed out a replacement with little to no hassle. Overall I would recommend this fan as my wife loves the look of this fan.",

I purchased two of these fans and the first one took over 3 hours to install by a certified electrician! Directions also do NOT tell you that you need to install the remote control sensor box BEFORE final installation of fan. Beautiful look, but super bright with LED lights. Nice breeze. Overall, I\u2019m satisfied, I just wish the directions were clear about the blade and remote control installation. It wouldn\u2019t have taken half the time to install if instructions were clear. Hope this is helpful to someone.",

I will have to purchase rubber to go around the blade edges. As mentioned in other views the light is very bright and fluorescent and the fan is rather small, even my six year old noticed. It s very pretty however and casts beautiful shadows in my daughter\u2019s walls. She loved the fan.",
