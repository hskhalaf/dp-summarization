You do not, I repeat, do NOT need a fancy garbage can for dirty diapers, especially one that has replacement bags that are over triple the cost of regular trash bags. You only need a regular trash can with a lid that latches (so your mobile baby and/or pets can't get in) and a Costco sized box of regular kitchen trash bags. Bought this diaper pail for my second baby and kick myself constantly for not getting it with my 1st. This should be one of those \"#1 piece of advice for new parents\" things",

I am trashing our diaper genie and adding a 2nd one of these to our upstairs changing area.",

We liked the diaper pail otherwise and wanted to exchange it for a new one, but when I went back to make the purchase the item was no longer available on Prime + $10 more. This seems very odd. I wish they made it easier to make this purchase. We will keep looking. Hope this helps you save your time and money!",
