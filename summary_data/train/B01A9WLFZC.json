What I noticed was a calm, and subtle focus increase--likely because of its lower bioavailability, causing it to be smoothly regulated as opposed to my current CDP complex. I actually prefer this supplement over CDP, which ended up giving me issues associated with choline overload. (weakness, headache, irratability, dopamine antagonism, etc.) I found two capsules a day to be the perfect dosage for this product. Nested Naturals Bitartate works extremely well stacked with uridine since cholinergic overload is very unlikely at the reccomended dosage.",

I've never ever been a real fan of pills or tablets just because most times you have to swallow them whole or wait until they dissolve which can take a long period of time. This pill is very easy to swallow and I can see the difference in me after taking it for a couple days now. Definitely going to continue using this product.",
