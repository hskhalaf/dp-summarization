We ordered these for our bathroom and I didn't realize how far they would stick out, the faucet came well past the middle of the sink. Panic set in, until we realized we could remove the knuckles and reduce the depth with a special plumbing coupling piece. So now they come to the center of our sink. Overall they look great!",

The only issue with this purchase was that the faucet did not come with a wall mounting kit, and my contractor needed to go to a plumbing supply store to get a few more parts. I think it was worth it because any comparable wall mounted faucet cost 2 or 3x what this faucet did. I cannot speak to durability since we just put it in, but I don't expect this faucet to get a lot of heavy use in the extra bathroom.",

The water flow is much stronger than I expected. I installed it on a stainless steel utility sink. I did not use the two round back cover plates. They weren't needed and it'll be easier to clean around those spots without them. I chose this faucet (with the front facing handles) also with keeping the faucet clean in mind. My wet, or soapy, hands won't drip down onto the rest of the faucet each time I turn it on or off.",

    "title": "Kingston Brass KS213C Victorian Wall Mount Kitchen Faucet, 7\", Polished Chrome",
    "description": "Color:Polished ChromeThis double handle wall mount kitchen faucet is timeless and offers a look that attracts those who appreciate traditional and contemporary designs. The faucet is constructed in solid brass for durability and long-lasting usage. The finish is made of polished chrome for corrosion and tarnishing resistance with the handles acting as a 1/4-turn on/off water control mechanism for water volume and temperature. The faucet operates with a ceramic disc valve for drip-free functionality with a water measured 2.2 GPM (8.3 LPM) and a 60 PSI maximum rate. An integrated removable aerator is fitted beneath the spout's head piece for conserving water flow. A 10-year limited warranty is provided to the original customer.",
