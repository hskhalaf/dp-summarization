While trying to figure out what to do with it saw another father and a son trying to use it to no avail - you can probably use it as a scooter on the snow, although it is hard to keep your foot on it as it is very slippery. If you try to go downhill you will most likely fall, this nothing as a snowboard and cannot be controlled properly. Both of us (another parent from above) ended up with this board thrown under the tree, usign sleds.",
