I'm happy with them, but that matte gold color looks pretty awful in person. \"White person who smokes a lot skin color\" is a more apt name. Get a different color.",

It came to my attention that the cable had some wrinkle(?) -see picture- when I first bought them but I didn\u2019t put a lot of mind to it since they worked well. Bad choice, right earphone suddenly stopped working. I\u2019m attaching pictures of my 3.5 mm cable (I use those for my tablet) so you guys can see the difference, please avoid this product or at least the lightning cable ones (for iPhone). Might try Bose\u0301 after this... Dissapointed",

It kinks, twists, and is too stiff for earphones sensitive to movement. I gave these a few weeks of use and I would recommend just using the standard Apple earphones. Hey Beats, try making some foam ear pieces like Shure. They mold to your ear and you don\u2019t lose the seal when you move.",

      "text": "I orignally purchased this one for daily using while commute. The sound quality is pretty good as expected, but the earbuds have been falling out of my ears way too often. I have tried all different size to find the good fit, but they haven't very well on me. I even tried push little harder to avoid falling out, which is not comfortable, but it still falls out. It is very annoying for me to keep some position to avoid the earbuds falling out while driving. There are some other reviews mentioning this issue as well. If I read those one, probably won't purchase this one. Definately got to return it.",

If you like good quality sound, find something else! I didn\u2019t do proper research and assumed there was a link between these and beats by dr dre.. There isn\u2019t.. Even tried to use high quality soft plugs that normally boosts up the bass, but since the sound quality is so terrible and there is no bass at all, even this didn\u2019t help. Conclusion; Whoever signed these out and approved them.. Find something else to do! Unfortunatly I didn\u2019t try them out until the return window was closed..",

But so far so good, I like the changeable bud sizes. The ones that come on them are too big for my ears. The sound is good, cancels out much of the background noises/people while I\u2019m at work. So I would definitely buy again and recommend to anyone who wants to listen to their podcasts and not people sit and talk about themselves all day ;)",

I expected the Sony's to be of lower quality while the Beats would be nice for $60. I was very mistaken. Compared to the Sony's, these sounded like OG Apple buds for an Ipod. These sound very tinny, with no fullness at all to the sound. I was very disappointed and I love my original over-ear Beats still. Neither the Sony's nor these obviously compare to the Bose Soundsport but you also pay for the privilege with Bose. Highly disappointed!",
