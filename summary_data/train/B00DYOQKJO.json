The only difference between past purchases was that we had the neutral with the frogs, and these are more boyish with foxes. Overall... cute designs, tons of parts and the possibility of melting.",

It's not a big deal (hence my 5 stars), but I do like to know roughly how much milk is left when he finishes and if it's below the lowest mark I have no idea.",

They do seem to help with gas and luckily with diligent burping we don\u2019t have many problems with spit up. Quite please with these bottles and would say our daughter has hooked us for the next year or so.",

Basically, the bottle is not all one piece - the bottom plastic part attaches to the body of the bottle with a rubber insert in between. Therefore, leaks can occur between the bottom and the rubber insert. No matter what I do - tighten A LOT, tighten not too much, make sure all the parts are dry, etc etc - these inevitably leak. Shame because the nipples are great, but the leakage is just too annoying (plus a waste of precious pumped milk). I will be returning them.",

One negative i consistently experience is *sometimes* it is easy to not screw the top lid on the right way and results in some leakage. However, this is a user error, not necessary the company.",

He'd rather have the bottle than nurse! I took one star away because I've had them leak more than once. If the white piece in the bottom isn't exactly right, the milk runs through it. When you have a crying baby and you're trying to hurry and make a bottle, this is easy to do and super annoying.",

My son had horrible gas and would get upset stomach often. After going solely with MAM bottles his gas reduced, had less gas and he was overall much happier and comfortable. With the MAM bottles he also had less dripage and overflow when feeding. I also like how they gave the vented bottom and not all the additional parts that go into the bottle to send the air. It\u2019s easy to clean and very durable. I would recommend these bottles to anyone!!",
