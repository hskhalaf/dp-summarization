Super Sized Movies and Games With a ***short throw lens***, this projector delivers huge images in modest-sized rooms. So whether you\u2019re a movie buff or a casual gamer, this projector lets you go big at home. I have compared to my Optoma GT1080 Short Throw Gaming Projector which can do 111\" screen at 4 feet. The ViewSonic 110\" at 12-Feet. If you want a true short throw don't buy this one. If you don't care about the short throw then this projector is amazing.",

There is a zoom function and an all important digital zoom to control the picture size. However, there is a glitz that causes the projector to default back to factory settings each time you turn on the projector. Obviously, this causes the user to reset the screen size each time you turn it on. If I had known, I would have chosen a different unit to purchase. After contacting their tech folks, we were told they are aware of the issue, but have no plans for a fix.",

This appears to be the 2019 version compared to the 2018 PX700HD. It is smaller, lighter, has a different bulb, dropped support for USB mini (weird), has vertical shift, a 10W speaker (not very good), and apparently a computer controlled color tuner (that is not a very good app at all). Besides that the picture is identical. To me, unless you are looking for smaller and newer, just stick with the 700HD. Its still a nice projector though.",

Great brightness. Good bulb life. And lots of different inputs for every type of video you might need. Short throw distance allowed me to mount this very close to the ceiling and out of the way of fixtures making the installation very clean and efficient. I am using this to throw a 12 foot diagonal display and it works great. My only criticism is there isn't a side-to-side adjustment, so you basically have to center the projector on the horizontal axis of the area you're projecting to.",

Nearly all projectors have this ability because it's a basic necessity. This projector however does NOT.",

(DVD and streaming) This has also worked out great for 3D. Although I've had this project for about 1 year, I just bought 3D glasses and a couple movies. This project IS equipped with DLP-link so any DLP-Link active glasses will work. I bought these:  Loving this projector!!",

I knew this before I purchased so I can't really fault the projector, I just didn't realize how important that adjustment is because it skews the picture to the point where it is not square (not as a shape, but where each side is square with the adjacent side). Otherwise, this is a good value projector that I hope last a long time.",

Very dissapointed because of the pricepoint with these limited features. I just returned a lower end projector due to poor overall quality and picked this one up thinking it was superior.

I haven't noticed the rainbow effect others have mentioned. Seems to be a standard thing with DLPs in rooms with direct sunlight... I'm planning on getting blackout curtains. It was very easy to set up. My only complaint is that the fan gets pretty loud. Granted, I have it set to \"high altitude\" which makes the fan run faster (to compensate for thinner air above 1500 meters and avoid overheating). With high altitude turned off, I can still hear the fan if I'm thinking about it, but it is not nearly as loud.",

Strong colors and high light output worked well for rear projection using appropriate screen outdoors.

Was very easy to hook a Roku up to and pair with a 100 inch screen in the garage/studio for family movie night.

I did a lot of research and chose this over the optoma short throw because it did not have a manual zoom. Also ViewSonic has a 3 year warranty on parts and one year on the bulb. I'm very happy with it.",

Turned out great for me but I have the lens as open as it goes and as focused as it gets soooo im lucky I\u2019m good at math or it would have really pissed me off lol so just put it a foot closer than you think just to be safe and avoid a blurry picture",
