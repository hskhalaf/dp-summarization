You think you will be able to use the whole eyeliner pencil, when in fact you are paying for an inch of eyeliner (if that) You can't sharpen it, even though it has a sharpener. You have to twist it up in order to get more of the eyeliner, which after about 20 uses falls out. You are left with a full size plastic hollow tube, that will go into the landfill. The eyeliner itself is good for the waterline of your eyes, it has long staying power, however as other reviewers have said it is so thick and it can get in your eyes.",
