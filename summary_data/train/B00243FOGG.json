I don'w even wash my face with this every day and it keeps my skin clear. The only issue I have with this product is the Spot Treatment / Daily Moisturizer, it makes my skin shiny, especially during the summer months, I have combination skin, with an oily T-Zone area, and this lotion makes it even more obvious with the heat hits. Might want to add a mattifying lotion if you have the same skin type.",

Now that I've found my eureka acne product, I will never try out anything else.",
