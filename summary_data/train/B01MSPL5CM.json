I guess that is why they call it a Travel wallet. :) In any case, I love this wallet so far and am using it as my full time wallet. I am very pleased so far. Thank you!",

The metal clipthat holds cash protrudes to the outside of the wallet potentially offering a threat to scratch a phone screen if you carry one in the same pocket as I do but I have not had the issue so far. There is a ribbon mechanism to retrieve credit cards from a tight pocket that I hope will hold up for a while. If the product is durable, I will be very pleased with it.",

On the outside there is space for an id card (plastic window) and for your most used card, which can be retracted easily without opening the wallet. On the inside there are pockets for two cards, plus a hidden pocket where you can add additional credit cards. These you can reveal by pulling the cord. All cards are protected from RFID readers. The only thing you should keep in mind is that the wallet is narrow. Dollars fit nicely but \u0395uro notes over \u20ac20 will protrude. The wallet comes in a box and cloth bag. It also includes some cards with instructions and warranty.",

Don't even bother trying to store coins, who carries coins any more these days anyway? I just throw them in the car and the kids snap them up.",
