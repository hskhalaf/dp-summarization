A good quality drill for when you've got a job to get done. Thank you to \"Avid Power\" and very affordable too. The little red drill that could! Would recommend to anyone.",

It charged fine, and so far appears to work. Great customer service to make this right. And the drill is working fine!",

Bonus that you can use the battery base to charge things like your cell phone when electricity goes out. Comfortable grip and light enough in weight that it's easy to use.",
