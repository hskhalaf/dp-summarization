I had read other comments before buying, someone said they poured water on it to check it\u2019s waterproof claim, and they had no problem. I\u2019m guessing if you leave the water on it, it will eventually seep through because it didn\u2019t protect my son\u2019s mattress. Do not buy if you really need waterproof.",

I bought a very nice mattress with that feels amazing, but I only noticed this when my mattress protector was in the wash. I have to give up my mattress because of a move and missed out on really experiencing all that I paid so much for because of the protector. If you have a really nice pillow-top or foam mattress pass on this protector for something that won't change the feel of your mattress.",

I did NOT dry this in direct sunlight nor near any high temperature surfaces. Therefore, I know that my wash and care of this product did not have any negative effect on the advertised performance of this product. My child vomited water on this mattress ONCE and the vomit seeped all the way through the 'waterproof' mattress cover and onto my $700+ mattress. This cover is not waterproof and it should not be advertised as such. I will be contacting the seller for a refund immediately. Buyer beware.",

The LUCID mattress protector has a cozy Terry fabric top surface that does not change the feel or sound of the mattress while providing excellent top-of-mattress protection against liquids, dust mites and allergens. 100 percent waterproof barrier a thin, quiet polyurethane membrane repels liquids and fluids to protect your mattress and your mattress warranty from stains. Made of safe materials, this protector is safe for children and pets. This liquid-proof barrier has tiny pores that allow air to pass for breathability and a comfortable sleep temperature. Do away with dust mites every night your body sheds millions of skin flakes and loses up to one liter of body fluid through your pores and mouth. Because they survive on dead skin cells and bodily fluids, up to 2 million dust mites can live in your unprotected mattress. Exposure to dust mites has been linked to the development of asthma in young children. Additionally, dust mites have been shown to be a leading cause of allergies and eczema. LUCID mattress protectors cut off the food supply to dust mites, making it impossible for them to survive. Deep pocket design fitted sheet-style mattress protector has a fully-elasticized skirt and deep pockets that keeps the protector tightly in place on mattresses depths up to 22 inches. Easy to put on and take off for laundering, this protector works great on extra-thick memory foam and pillow top mattresses. Machine washable keep your mattress clean and fresh by washing your sleep surface. Machine wash hot water. Tumble dry low. Do not bleach, iron or dry clean.",
