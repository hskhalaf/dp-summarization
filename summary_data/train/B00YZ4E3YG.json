But I love it regarding features and hence I still wanted to buy again. Really nice support of many games with interactive light activation / deactivation of keys to show what's active / inactive in the game. Also light flow show is impressive and keyboard very good to use .... but still disappointing to see one key died after only 2 years.",

My only complaint is the black on black looks a little plane so I took the cover off the keyboard and am painting it white. DO THAT AT YOU OUR RISK.",

Second, I do not get the design choice of the space bar. The front edge of it is higher than the rest of the key, so your thumb rests on a thin edge. It is very uncomfortable after only a few minutes of game-time. Beyond that, the keyboard seems to be well built and the back lighting is quite bright. Mine went back and I'll be continuing to use my 8 year old Logitech G15.",

The software is flimsy and crashes. Please don't waste your money on this. Go buy something from Corsair or Logitech G. I find their products amazing and their software comfy to use.",

It's so frustrating since i was looking forward to playing on the weekend. Can i return this keyboard and get another one? i actually think that the keyboard i got is a factory defect cause if you try to move the keyboard and you hit the cord a little then the keyboard stops working. Can someone help me please?",
