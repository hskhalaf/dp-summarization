This was a very disappointing purchase for me. This is the first purchase from Amazon I have not been happy with. Because the Head Strap was inexpensive I am not returning it as it is too much trouble for me. I will be buying another not sure from who?",

There is a lot of wiggle room and the black plastic is less than ideal for a part that is used to exert significant torque. With a few design changes I think this could be an indispensable tool.

Only downside (but it should be obvious and not surprise anyone) is that it covers the screen so you can't see/operate the screen with this floaty. If that will be a deal breaker for you (and I understand) I'd recommend the floaty stick/handle instead.",

The foam handle makes it easy and comfortable to grip, and the lanyard will prevent you from dropping or losing your camera. It is not exclusive for water, as you can use it as a regular grip while on land. It floats, so if you do drop your camera (at a pool) it comes up to the surface so you won't have to swim down to retrieve it. Finally, it comes with the screw tool to make sure the thumbscrew is not loose when you mount your action cam, so that is an added bonus.",

While this allows for easy on-off, if one gets loose from vibration, the whole thing can come off. Ok for non-critical applications, but next time I'll get something more solid.

After all we don't want our precious camera to break or move around during filming. If anyone is interested, I make car review videos and my YouTube channel is: What We Drive.

The silver part is metal, the black part is plastic, but it seems well made (despite the plastic). I haven't used it as a bottle opener, but I guess that's a nice touch. The keychain or string loop is also nice. And for $5, to get things more secure than I can do by hand, it pretty much seems like a no-brainer.",

Locking up my bike on the streets of NYC, I worried about someone just undoing the thumb screws and walking away with the mount and housing (I obviously never keep the camera in the housing when locked up). I ultimately ended up buying a K-EDGE Pro machined metal mount for my handlebars, wish GoPro made a similar product for those of us looking for a semi-permanent mounting solution.",
