      "text": "So basically I thought my headphones were faulty. The speaker audio was working fine, however I heard way too much static and noises, and I was thinking to myself what the problem was. I then plugged in the microphone, and when I was talking to my friends, They heard a really loud noise from my mic. I thought the headset was faulty. However, I realised that i had to flip over the cable in order for the headset to work. The headset overall was good, and the microphone is also good. Worth an upgrade compared to the G530 :).",

But very disappointing sound. I baught this to replace a Medusa NX that broke in peaces after some years where it is fixed with a screw. But I blame it to the price-difference of 250 to (orig.) 100 BPS. The headset itself feels very cheapich compared to the Medusa. Looks like if you want full, warm sound and comfortable feeling you should not spent less than over 200,-",

Using them on Windows i can get 5.1 surround sound from Netflix (Awesome!) but when connecting the device to the Macbook, G Hub doesn't pick them up (they are actually disabled within GHubs devices.json file). For this reason i have to give these a low rating as i was hoping to use them as a daily driver throughout the working day and the evening, but appears they no longer care about the MacBook. TL;DR 7.1 surround sound possible on a Windows PC, anything with an audio jack is STEREO",

The headphones have superb sound quality, with logitech software you can control the 7.1 surround, however the noise cancellation could be better because while talking you can hear your own voice quite a bit. the pads could be comfier as well (if they changed the padding to something that cancels noise better, it would fix quite few smaller issues.) Overall very good headphones for gaming, for this price, you are very unlikely to find similar quality.",

The headphones are easily adjusted to your personal preference via the Logitech software. Packaging is protective and a little zippy bag is included to put the headset in after use. Microphone is great and can be removed. Only con is that they aren\u2019t good at cancelling loud background noise but still enough to most stop background noises. The sound from the headset is enough to block out most sounds. I would recommend these to anyone! I have tested the headset on Xbox, PS4, Switch and PC 9/10",

The acoustics regardless os headset G433 G430 G432 etc are the same but the emulated 7.1 performance is the biggest difference. The microphone on G433 is superb. My only issue now is that after 2 years there's a crackling noise on the right driver. Regardless of machine I plug it into or card I use. I also tried in stereo (without the card) and it's still there. So the usual warranty=when it dies. Disappointing because my previous Logitech headphones lasted me 5 years which is why I bought Logitech instead of Razer. So yeah time to go to team green.",
