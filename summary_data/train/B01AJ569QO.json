My only small gripe is that I wish there was a better way to lock it into place. For the most part it stays but sometimes when I'm trying to open it I twist it just so and the expandable portion becomes unlocked. It's not a super big deal as this doesn't happen spontaneously when I'm carrying it or anything. Overall, would recommend!",
