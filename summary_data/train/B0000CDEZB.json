If you have a lot of typing to do, this is the way to do it. It is small and takes a little adjustment, but if you are a quick typist it beats using a stylus to tap your entries in. Now if they could just get a mouse to go with it.....",

      "text": "I have the IPAQ 4150, which is limited in the accessory department. I first bought an IR keyboard to find the transmitter wouldn't work with my IPAQ due to the fact the IR port is on the bottom of the unit. So after a trip back to the store, I broke down and bought the HP brand. I wish I had bought it here, because my local electronics store was twenty dollars more. My only complaint is the keyboard wobbles while typing, because the back support rest is about half an inch to short to prevent this. One could probably fix this by weighting the back end a bit.",

      "text": "This keyboard gets the job done, compact, folds away nicely. The downside is that unlike most othe PDA keyboards it plugs in instead of using wireless or Bleutooth. It also lacks a power source (ie. battery, Ac adapter) and can drain your PDA's battery. The main positive is that it is compatible, the only keyboard compatible with this set of HP products. Oh one other thing, if you're using POCKET PC windows 2003 or newer your gonna need to download a new driver from HP's website, as what they packadge with the product is now old and no longer compatible.",
