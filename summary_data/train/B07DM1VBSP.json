If you're tired of eating stuff that tastes like dirty hippies, give these a shot. Though, I must confess I'm a little curious why they call the flavor \"Vanilla Almond\" when it would be much more accurate to describe it as \"Vanilla Cinnamon\".",

PB bar \u2013 A solid choice for anyone who loves peanut butter. It\u2019s almost like eating it out of the jar, but it\u2019s in a convenient bar-form and packs a much stronger nutritional punch. Almond bar \u2013 My personal favorite. A refreshingly smooth almond flavor with a hint of sweetness. Goes down easy.",

There are other products with more proteins and less calories, but if you want something that has great taste (I've only ever gotten the chocolate cacao one),I highly recommend this product. I eat this bar either as breakfast supplement or a pre-workout snack, and it's been working great for me. I eat heavy lunch at 12:00 (lots of carbs), and get to the gym at 5:30 usually after eating this bar; gives me enough energy to do 1 hr of heavy lifting although i get completely exhausted; I'm trying to join 1K lbs club, and i'm at around 900 lbs now.",

They\u2019re also as expensive, if not more expensive, than all of the other brands.",

This bar (chocolate cacao) has neither of those. It was wonderful. It tasted like a treat, but wasn't overly sweet and didn't taste like an industrial chemical experiment. With a busy work, school and home life, I am confident these will be a go to once a day for a quick and tasty meal. The cost is well worth the convenience and taste. Now I just need to try the peanut butter and vanilla almond!",
