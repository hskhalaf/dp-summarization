Our 13 lb cat took a few days to get used to it (he didn\u2019t like the straight alignment of holes at first) and the top platform is a bit small, but now he confidently climbs through both holes to the top. My only other feedback is that the middle platform should stick out a bit further from the top platform so they have sufficient landing space to jump from the top. Our cat currently can\u2019t do that. He hops onto the adjacent windowsill instead to get down. It is good that they sell replacement posts!",

HIGH quality construction, very solid and easy to assemble.

I haven\u2019t bothered ordering a second new one. Really a pain to have to return a heavy object. Our original one that we purchased NEW is great quality, really nice looking and the cats love it.",
