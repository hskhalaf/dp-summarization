Excellent macro mode, very good lens, terrific low-light capability, great lens range (28-300mm), fantastic AA battery life (use 2500 mah batteries), one of the best movie modes I've ever seen in a still camera. Read the manual - this thing has a lot of features to learn! If you don't want to spring another $200-$400 or more for an interchangeable lens DSLR, or if you simply you want an all-in-one package with tremendous versatility, this is your baby. However, image quality, while very good, won't quite compare to a full-fledged DSLR. The S9100 is supposed to be a little quicker and sharper. Check it out for yourself.",

I started with FinePix S7000 and upgraded to S9000 a while ago. S7000 seemed to have a more solid body, my S9000 is loosing its rubber grip which I am a little dissapointed about. The zoom on the lens gives you a professional feel - too bad you're only limited to one lens... but for the price of a compact, 'pocket' digicam, you get almost a professional SLR. I'm highly recommending it to advanced amateur photographers who are still learning photography, and are not quite into spending $800+ on a professional SLR.",

The first S9000 received from Beach Camera had a defective viewfinder circuit (both viewers) that resulted in a partially solarized view.

DON'T BUY THIS CAMERA!!! You may be sorry. If you do and get a good one, congratulations! :)",

    "title": "Fujifilm Finepix S9000 9MP Digital Camera with 10.7x Wide Optical Zoom",
    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\nFujifilm has added another \"first\" to its imaging legacy with the introduction of the SLR-styled FinePix S9000 digital camera, the world's first nine megapixel model for advanced amateur photographers.\n\n Advanced digital photographers have been eagerly awaiting this addition to Fujifilm's popular S-series line. The FinePix S9000 digital camera boasts 9.0 effective megapixels that capture up to 3,488 x 2,616 recorded pixels (9.12 million)--the highest resolution of any consumer-grade camera on the market as of Summer 2005.\n\n While these record-breaking numbers are impressive alone, Fujifilm understands there is more to a great digital picture than resolution. It is this understanding, along with its rich history of photographic excellence, which drove Fujifilm to incorporate its groundbreaking Real Photo Technology into the FinePix S9000. The company's latest innovation matches the nine megapixel, 5th Generation Super CCD HR sensor with a super-sharp Fujinon lens and the RP Processor technology found currently in the critically-acclaimed FinePix F10 digital camera.\n\n A hallmark of Fujifilm's Real Photo Technology is its ability to reduce the amount of graininess or \"noise\" in digital pictures. This noise is often apparent in high-resolution photos, particularly those shot at high ISO-equivalent sensitivities. With Real Photo Technology, the FinePix S9000 can take pictures at ISO 1600--at full resolution. Other benefits of Real Photo Technology include speed of operation (the FinePix S9000 has a high-speed start-up time of only 0.8 second with shutter lag down to 1/100 second) and longer battery life.\n\n In addition to offering low noise processing, the new FinePix S9000 is equipped with a bevy of features that will appeal to the photo hobbyist. One of those features is a world-class Fujinon 10.7x wide-angle optical zoom lens that is the equivalent of having a 28-300mm zoom on a 35mm camera. This zoom range is ideal for a wide variety shooting situations and thus makes the purchase of additional lenses unnecessary.\n\n Other features appealing to the photo hobbyist include:\n\n \n\n * Mode dial with multiple settings, including Anti-Blur that automatically adjust the camera's ISO settings to combat camera shake and blur and Natural Light for more natural looking photos, particularly in low light \n * A manual zoom that along with the auto exposure and auto focus functions, are operational during full frame (VGA-quality; 30 fps) movie capture \n * The ability to shoot in the RAW file format \n * A Super Macro Mode for pictures up to 0.4 inches \n * Hot shoe and syncronizing terminal for external flash \n * Live histogram exposure setting checks prior to shooting \n * In-camera highlight warning function that alerts the user to \"overexposed\" areas of just-taken pictures \n * Strong auto-focus assist illuminator for quicker focusing in low light \n * Tilting LCD for high and low-angle shooting; adjustable LCD and electronic viewfinder; frame rates of 30 frames per second or 60 frames per second for smoother viewing \n * Dual media slot accepts xD Picture card and CompactFlash/Microdrive\n\nFraming pictures through the FinePix S9000's LCD as well as its video features should be of particular interest to many advanced amateur digital photographers who want all the controls of a digital SLR camera but are hesitant to lose some of the convenient and useful features commonly found in point-and-shoot cameras. The FinePix S9000 offers the best of both worlds: the photographic controls of a DSLR and the movie mode and LCD framing capabilities of the point-and-shoots.",
