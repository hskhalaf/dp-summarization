This is a great product but a bit more expensive than like products purchased at Walmart or anywhere else. However, I can tell the difference after using the first bottle purchased earlier this year at a salon. My hair is fine and thin but it looks great using this product and I have actually, even at my old age, gotten a few compliments on how well my hair looks. It has to be the product as I do not curl my hair and only blow dry and finger comb in place. This is my product of choice now.",
