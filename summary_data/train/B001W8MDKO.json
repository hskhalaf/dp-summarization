Last year I purchased a cage that was by the same company and was marketed for chinchilla's and ferrets. It, however, was not comparable to this cage. The shelves and ramps were plastic so my chinchilla ate through them. I decided to get this one again and, as before, has proven perfect and indestructible!",

The door is large and easy to open and latch -- I don't have to worry about our critter pushing it open from the inside because the door didn't close all the way. When I priced cages in local pet stores, they were not only smaller, but more expensive. I'm very happy with my purchase.",

Not enough that I felt it would affect the health and safety of my rat family, but something to keep in mind. With that being said, I was satisfied enough to order another for my ever growing rat colony.",

I would recommend this cage for any rodent, but would be too small for rabbits or ferrets. Very simple to put together and the price is great.

We used other hardware and got it together. If it actually fit together properly it would be a really great cage but it's horribly done, it's a frustrating hassle that nobody needs. Very disappointed and I think with the time and effort we put into this we could have built a better cage ourselves.",

A few of the bars were a bit bent, but nothing that would allow for escape and they were easy to queeze back into place.
