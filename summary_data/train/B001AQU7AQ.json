      "text": "So...This is one tough tool. It's like the original Supertool on steroids! The blade exchanger excepts T shank standard jigsaw blades which is really handy but changing the blades can be tough and risky without gloves because you have to push the lock back TOWARDS the blade after you change it. This is definitely a heavier multitool, not as heavy as my Leatherman MUT EOD but close. Finally sheath is cheep, would like to see a nice leather or MOLLE compatible sheath included at this price point, but the sheath does have to elastic loops on the side to hole a penlight, ferro rod, etc. Over all a solid well built tool. just very heavy!",

Applied WD40 for lubrication. -- Yet another beautiful and solid product from Leatherman! I own Sidekick and Wave Plus already and really excited about the latest Surge! Unfortunately the lock for the scissors got stuck and very difficult to engage. What's more, the spring loaded part doesn't work neither after scissors is deployed. I will probably have to return it to have it replaced.",

Effective serrated knife and straight knife. Advice: Get the leather pouch with the snap closure. Do not get the nylon pouch with the velcro closure. The leather pouch is much more durable.",

I purchased the flat bit set and 1/4 inch bit extension however if I insert both flat bit holders behind the Surge, I cannot snap the cover. The pouch is good quality but it needs to be about 1/8 inch deeper to allow insertion of both flat screw bit holders and the extra files. Also, one of the elastic loops on the side should be a little tighter to prevent the 1/4 inch bit extender from falling out when the Surge is removed from the pouch. I purchased mine in Black Oxide and is holding up quite well.",

      "text": "A couple things stood out to me with this and led to my decision to buy this model. The four tools on the outside of the handle being one, and the pliers themselves. Having the knife, serrated knife, scissors, and your choice of wood saw or metal file on the outside is super convenient. It makes the most common tools accessible with one hand. The pliers are longer than most other multi-tools and also a bit thinner. In my profession, I usually need pliers for more precise work rather than brute force. Finally, it goes without saying, you get the high quality of Leatherman.",
