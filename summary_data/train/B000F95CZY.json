They were incorrect. The was nearly no weld penetration into the hairs resulting in the weakest of mechanical bonds instead of a robust weld joint. In short this tool\u2019s weld engineering is defective.",

I had been using a \"garden\" variety weeding tool for decades until our handyman let me use his Fiskars Garden Knife just this past spring. There was no comparison. This tool makes a perfect slit in the dirt and with one turn of your wrist, unearths the roots of the weed so you can pull it. Then the slit closes right back up. I had to have one of my own and I have been using it all summer. It makes such quick work of weeds. Seriously, if you have weeding to do, get one of these. You will thank me afterward. ;)",

For very light gardening, it's probably fine. But I was digging relics and coins while metal detecting and for that purpose this is no good. I see on here now a lot of reviews where owners had the same problem. I would have thought they would have redesigned it by now.",

Overall, this is a very useful tool, but whenever you apply even moderate pressure to the handle you feel it give way and bend, If you need a sturdy tool - this is not it. The low price of this item does not justify its flimsiness. I got myself steel Japanese garden knife instead.",

I have always had very good luck with the Fiskers garden tools and this one rates right up there as a serious, good tool. It is sharp,,,,does the job when you come to a root or something that needs cutting. I did a lot of gardening this year and this was always in my most important tools bucket that I carry as I move from one area to another. Word of caution... this is a knife, it is sharp and as with all knives, etc. keep out of reach of kids. I think every serious gardener needs this in their tools.",

Even a claw hammer as needed to dig out a hole. This tool is probably the best of all worlds. It should last the life of your desire to do gardening. I love it.",
