That said, I'll probably still need skin treatments to fix the red spots leftover, but the spots are slightly better looking than moles on me. My moles were about 1/8\" diameter and I previously tried killing them with garlic and vinegar. They only got angrier. Halo derm worked after 1 overnight treatment.

I highly recommend taking really hot showers for at least 15 minutes b.c it helps the skin to get soft which helped the moles come off nice and easy without it coming off prematurely or anything.

This is easy and if you follow instructions, you can avoid injuring yourself.
