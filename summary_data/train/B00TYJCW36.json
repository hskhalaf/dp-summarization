Even night photos possible. Bought one for trip to Turkey. Tour guide remarked it was really nice and he had seen many small cameras! Gave him mine and bought a second one. Just as perfect.",

      "text": "I'm very impressed with this camera overall. The telephoto lens with image stabilization takes amazing shots at a distance. The low light capabilities are better than any camera I've owned. Transferring photos with wifi is a snap. I generally like the ergonomics and operations of the camera. I might change a few things but no device is perfect. I don't like how the GPS works. A bit clunky and only saves the area where you were when you transferred the photos to your phone. Maybe I'm missing something. I'm also still debating the need for this \"travel camera\" which while good isn't an SLR or mirror less but is bigger than my smartphone camera.",

I tried several cameras before I settled on this one and it had the most pros to offer. It has great zoom and auto focus, which makes taking great, professional looking, photos easier.",
