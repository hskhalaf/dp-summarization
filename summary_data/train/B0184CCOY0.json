Not only is it fascinating to look at, but it also helps to check for any undesirable additions to my medicine (mold, bugs, hairs, etc). It's main failing is that everything not directly centered gets a very heavy bokeh (out of focus) effect. At maximum magnification, there's a slight pink tinge around the outside of the image. But again, this is a $90 USB scope, not a high end one. You get what you pay for, and this is not a bad value.",

Knobs for raising and lowering the camera are loose fitting and the clamp holding the camera itself does not snug evenly to the cylinder of the camera. This allows for a less than positive hold. The platform could also use more weight for more stability. Aside from these annoyances, the camera is fun to use. Software: The included ehe program is OK.
