I don't use them for running or working out at the gym, I use my $100 Saucony ISO Hurricanes for that. However, I bought these in size 9 and they fit perfectly. I buy the Hurricanes in 9.5 Wide because my feet expand when running. I recommend them for a casual Friday jean look and you want something different than the traditional Nike and Adidas gym shoes.",

If broken-in, could probably get some more wiggle room, but I\u2019m going to try out a half-size bigger and see if that\u2019s more comfortable. UPDATE: getting a half size bigger did the trick. Toes don\u2019t feel cramped and shoes feel better to walk around in. Would recommend for anyone with average or slightly wide feet",
