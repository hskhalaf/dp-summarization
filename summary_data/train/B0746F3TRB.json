Could cause long-term impression if not careful, but it is indeed lightweight and tight as can be to the body of the laptop.",

It did fit snug on the computer and seemed like the material would hold up okay but you can get better for $50. Especially for a simple one color case.",

It\u2019s really durable, except that it doesn\u2019t have the little grip at the bottom so it tends to slide off table, which is defied because you\u2019d think it would have grips for the price. You can just fix this by adding grips from the dollar store to the bottom. Any way the case is really nice and I definitely recommend it! Update: Seven months later and the case is going strong!!!",
