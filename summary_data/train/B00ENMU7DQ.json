I would have to say they are every bit as comfortable as my gym shoes. SIZING I wear anywhere from a size 10 to a 10.5 US in most brands. I purchased these in a size 10, because my winter pair of Asolo's is a 10.5 and I wear really thick socks with them. I plan on using this new pair as my warm weather hiking boots with thinner socks, and the fit is perfect.",

My only issue with the Restons is that I normally double tie boot laces and these are too short to do so. I have ordered longer laces from the Asolo website as a result. I have four different Asolo styles and am definitely a fan.",
