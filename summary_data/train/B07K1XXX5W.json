However, after a few days of receiving this phone and messing about with all the features and stuff, i disagree with these negative reviews as the battery life has lasted for upto 2 days which is awesome!!!!! i haven't tested out the camera fully yet so i can't comment on this but in terms of the system and using apps and stuff, the phone runs very smoothly and hasn't caused any problems regarding memory etc.",

      "text": "This phone is an absolute bargain for its price of \u00a3189. It was only released a few months ago as a mid-market (\u00a3300) phone. Lovely bright clear screem. Metal and glass - feels quality in the hand. Pure Android One so no bloatware and always up to date OS. Carl Zeiss double rear camera takes excellent pics and video. IMHO work the extra \u00a340 over the Honor Lite 9.",

Couldn't even tell me if delivery would be morning or afternoon in the 20 first century! Appalling service. The phone however is great. I love it. Works well. I have not chosen to use the fingerprint reader yet. All the other services, email, news, chrome etc.. work well and fast. Even to setup even for a pensioner like me.",
