I like the energy saving mode where it slows the fan(?) when the drive is on idle for awhile and it doesn\u02bbt get hot. Unlike some others where the device starts to get really hot even with the fan on when connected for a long period. Worth its cost. One point, though, be sure to write down the serial number that\u02bbs on the box... before throwing it away. You will not find it on the device when you register it, unless you open the casing, which would break your manufacturer\u02bbs warranty.",
