Jack Black makes a lot of gimmicky products with loads of \"all natural\" irritating, fragrant ingredients. Products with menthol, mint, and citrus seem good on paper. But in practice they make skin burn and cause redness. Luckily this Sun Guard is all performance and no gimmicks. It is a good price for the amount of product you get. In the world of high end sunscreens, this is a winner.",

It doesn't feel greasy, nor is it drying, and works with both teenage combination skin and mature dry skin. The biggest problem with sunscreens is when you sweat they run into the eyes and burn. This one is much less likely to run into the eyes (rubs in and soaks in well), although if it does get into the eyes it will sting. We've now purchased 3 tubes of this one and use it for sport and water use (kayaking & swimming).",

It's also a very faint scent, but if you're like me and only use aftershave balm to smell good, it does get in the way of the aftershave fragrance if, like my wife, someone is close enough to you to lay their chin on your neck.",

It does take a little bit more blending in than my previous sunscreen (Olay Complete Defense SPF 30), though this is likely because of the higher Zinc Oxide concentration. I don't buy many other more prestige sunscreens because you get such a small amount (typically 1.7 oz) for a high price; with this sunscreen, you get a solid 4 oz.
