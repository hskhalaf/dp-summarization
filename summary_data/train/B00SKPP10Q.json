As much as I love this mat I'm giving on 2 stars because it sheds....this is so not good. I washed it and it's still the same, my little one has the fur every where....between her toes, fingers on her clothes. I have to throw a blanket on top of it in order to use it. I have used it only 3 times and have packed it away, don't want my munchkin swallowing the fur that gets on her hand or it going in her eyes.",

I purchased the Lamb based on the product description which states \"premium soft white on white fabric\". The one I received was NOT even close to white or even cream, it's definitely YELLOW. The photo is also very deceiving. I returned it due to the color not being as advertised. I will say that everything else about it seemed to be excellent quality and it is very cute. For anyone considering the lamb - it is hard to tell from the photo and the description fails to mention it but the back side is light brown.",

However, the other reviews are accurate in that the material isn't baby friendly. Because tummy time requires little ones to practice pushing up and rolling over, they use their strong grip on this mat and easily come up with threads and plush fabric. We watch her very closely while on it, but it is a concern that she can pull out the fuzzies and keep them in her tight hand.",

The dog decided it wanted to try it out and laid on it so I had to wash it. I was concerned about how it would go, but I machine washed it as directed and laid it out to dry. Once it dried it looked brand new! Great purchase!",
