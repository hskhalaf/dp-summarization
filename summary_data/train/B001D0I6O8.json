      "text": "Camera takes fine pictures. feels solid, etc. Only problem is that it drains batteries just sitting around. Sent it back to Fuji 2x for repair, came back both times \"fixed to factory tolerances\", but still drains batteries. Charge a battery, leave it on the counter for 2 weeks, pop it into the camera, all is good. Charge a battery, put it in the camera and leave the camera off. After 3 days the battery will be dead. I think the memory management functions in the camera draw more battery power than comparable brands. Get a Canon Powershot instead.",

Even at large reprints, you will see a level of clarity you were missing from even some last generation Digital SLRs. Simple to use, outstanding picture quality, and low cost? I think you will come away impressed, and at around $200 (time of this review) this camera is a steal.",

I don't really have the need for 12MP pictures, but I like that Fuji offers the setting of 6MP Fine that gives me the quality I need without the huge file size. With image stabilization, high ISO capabilities, face detection, scene recognition, and a smart-flash, it's very hard to take a bad photo. I couldn't be happier with this great camera.",

    "description": "Fujifilm FinePix F60fd, 12MP Super CCD, 3x Optical Zoom, 3.0\" LCD, Face Detection 3.0 w/ Auto Red Eye Removal, Dual Image Stabilization, New iSR Intelligent Scene Recognition, High Sensitivity ISO 3200 at Full Resolution, xD/SD/SD-HC Compatible Media Slot.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n Succeeding the hugely popular FinePix F50fd, the FinePix F60fd features a larger 3-inch LCD screen, Face Detection 3.0, and brand new, proprietary, Intelligent Scene Recognition technology. Beneath its stylish and sleek black exterior, the FinePix F60fd utilizes the combination of high resolution and high sensitivity to produce stunning high-quality images. Loaded with a 12-megapixel Super CCD sensor, Dual Image Stabilization (CCD-Shift and Picture Stabilization technologies), ISO sensitivity of up to 1600 (or up to 6400 at 3MP), and Fujinon 3x zoom (35-105mm equivalent). For users who like to have creative control over their compact and want more than point-and-shoot photography, the FinePix F60fd has the option of full photographic control. Equally, the FinePix F60fd suits those users who are happy to rely on auto mode for simple, fuss-free photography. \n\nAuto Scene Recognition (SR-A)\nMost compact digital cameras feature scene modes where the user selects the scene they are photographing before they take the shot. In a first for Fujifilm cameras, the FinePix F60fd is equipped with Intelligent Scene Recognition technology which cleverly detects a scene without the need of pre-selecting the mode on the camera. Having identified the most commonly photographed subjects and environments, Fujifilm has developed technology to automatically identify different scene - Portrait, Night, Landscape, and Macro. Once the scene has been detected, the camera will optimize the settings accordingly to capture the photo of your chosen subject with the utmost in clarity, detail, and color.",
