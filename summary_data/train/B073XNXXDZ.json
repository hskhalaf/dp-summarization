Sleeves are about as expected in length for a Large size shirt. So, I would buy XL if you normally wear a Large dress shirt and want a Regular (i.e., loose fit) in a flannel shirt that may shrink a bit. This is not at all loose compared to 1950s Cary Grant shirts. Small buttons are another welcome reminder of popular and comfortable Patagonia shirts.",

Ordered this for my hubby in the winter to wear around the house, or over a tshirt, so for the price I was not expecting this nice feel and quality. I washed it twice so far, once prior to him wearing it and then again after his first wearing and it got softer. Going to order a few more to stockup. They may not hold up with hard use, but for what he needs them for, it it great!",

So just my usual problem of needing a shirt not designed to be tucked in and mutated super sleeve length, but otherwise besides 3 annoying tags which I immediately removed because I need clothing without tags for comfort, great lightweight material. There may be problems having the sleeves taken down because they are too close to actual sleeve length required.",

XX-Large fits me perfectly, with just a little extra room around the mid section and nice fit in the shoulders and chest. I'm going to be wearing this untucked, and it's a good length for that for me. I think it works well as a button-up shirt, or as a light jacket that you could wear a t-shirt underneath.",

When I first opened the nicely packaged shirts I thought they were kind of thin and stiff, but nicely made. But after washing, I think these shirts are much thicker and soft. Really happy with the quality. I do recommend.",

The material is soft and comfortable. While the fit is slightly loose I don't mind, it will be easy to use as an extra layer in the fall. I can't speak on the durability yet but all in all I am happy with the purchase. Enough so that I am ordering a few more.",
