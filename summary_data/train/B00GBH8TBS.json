So if you\u2019re in a healthcare field (or any field where scents are frowned on) you could still wear this and not worry about \u201cstinking\u201d. This isn\u2019t a body butter, so if your looking for that kind of product, this isn\u2019t it. It\u2019s a nice light lotion that does a great job of keeping scaly, dry skin away. I bought this at a great price on Amazon. If I would have bought it at Ulta it would have cost me double.",

Plus they advertise that there are no \u201charsh chemicals\u201d but there still are chemicals in the ingredient list that aren\u2019t good for you. This is not a \u201cclean\u201d beauty product like some other brands are - just have to do a little research to find them and choose wisely!
