The grill does pull a lot of amps when you turn it on so make sure you have a good strong electrical circuit outlet. The price is very reasonable and fair for the high quality of the grill and the features. The temperature settings are a little hard to read as they are printed very faint on the control panel.",

The plates pop out easily and go right in the dishwasher. That's always been my pet peeve: grill appliances that are a pain to clean. Not an issue with.this one. Only downside is it's a bit on the large side and takes up significant counter space. It is attractive though. Since I've been using it a couple times a week, I just keep it out. I don't have a grill, so this handy little unit will see a lot of service.",
