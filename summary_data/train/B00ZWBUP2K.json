I have two small dogs that I often check in on through the camera. I rest easy knowing I will receive updates on my iPhone and watch immediately when an alarm is triggered. Although I don't take advantage of the subscription cloud video service, I highly recommend the complete system. It's easy to install and provides the right amount of peace of mind.",

      "text": "Very nice! The Myfox system is smart looking and easy to set up. The equipment is high quality, and not cheaply made. The basic system comes with these components: siren (wireless), key fob, intellitag (sensor) and a link (wireless internet connection hub). Set up is easy, and starts first with downloading the app. There are NO WIRES to string, making it very easy to set up just about anywhere. And there are no fees associated with using the security system, so you buy it once, and that's it. This is a great starter system. I'm really toying with adding the camera (comes separately) to my setup.",

Its possible to tell Alaxa to trigger night mode and then have it auto deactivate when Alexa plays wake-up alarm in the am. The sensor is capable to detect vibrations in addition to \"open\" actions and its sensitivity can be adjusted, in other words triggering the alarm before anyone enters. The key fob and sensor worked as advertised. Design and quality is also very polished, everything has been thought through from the app experience to the hardware.",

There should be at least 2 or 3 for each door. I love the key fob idea, but it's one extra thing I don't need hanging on my keychain. And it's not needed since there is an app where you can control everything. I love all of the options and add-ons. I'll definitely be buying the camera.",

I was shocked at how easy this was to set up and get going right away. The price, for what this provides, is excellent. It may help you to sleep better or feel okay with the kids home alone after school. It's a good investment. I am going to keep playing with the system and I may buy another for a gift to someone who refuses to use any type of system!",
