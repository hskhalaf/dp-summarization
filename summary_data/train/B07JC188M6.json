The other nozzle works by pushing on the nozzle , like a helium tank. It has a cord to plug into the wall which stores inside the machine when you're not using it. If you have a bunch of kids birthdays or you need a ton of balloons, this is for you!",

I wish I had purchased one much sooner. I love that the motor doesn't turn on until you put a balloon on it which helps with noise.",
