I've seen some reviews for the G4 Samurai that say it's light on protection, but let me say for the record that even though the point of contact was mostly my head there was no concussion, and no head injury. The helmet stayed on and did it's job. For a catcher's helmet that is so lightweight and comfortable it offers excellent protection!",

      "text": "I volunteer umpire for Little league from the 10-11 age bracket all the way through Senior Division. I transitioned from the standard mask to this helmet for the added protection due to the types of backstops we sometimes encounter in youth sports (many will return a foul ball at high speed from above or behind). This helmet has been very comfortable in hot weather and I find that I am a bit more relaxed behind the plate with it. I know some will not wear a hat under the helmet but I personally wear the short bill plate hat under this helmet. It works great, easy to remove without pulling off your hat. All around good deal.",
