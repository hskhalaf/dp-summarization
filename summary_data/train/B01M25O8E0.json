Grand daughters have only used it once, for one battery charge, so it's longevity is unknown at this time, but at least Holy Stone backs up their products. Must comment on Holy Stone customer service: Reps were great. Courteous, concerned, and friendly. June especially is a wonderful customer service rep. Keep up the good work!

I'm SURE I need some practice and getting used to it but was hoping it would be easier and more stable. One thing.. be sure to install the rotor/propeller guards as they can get bent when bumping into walls. It charges well, and seems to have plenty of power to fly... I just can't get it stable inside. Maybe I'll venture out to a park and try to learn a bit more.",

Flight stability is really enhanced with altitude hold feature, let go of the sticks and this one really does just hover. Good value, and a cool package. yea - it doesn't fold up with the prop guards on it - but the prop guards are easy enough to remove - and it recovers from small errors and survives for another flight with them.

I let my five year old fly it, after I set the trim, get the direction pointed in the right way and am hovering about five feet in front of him. He can even do flips.

      "text": "Fun little drone to fly around with. You can definitely tell the differences between the speeds and how it handles. We average 6-10 minutes of flight depending on what we all do with it. The flips and spins are kind of a fun little bonus, and the trim buttons are easy access for stability in one spot. Havent done much with headless mode and not sure if it worked or does what we think it's supposed to do, still fun. Perfect little drone to play around with inside during bad weather days. If taking it outside, I'd make sure winds are 5mph or less. Charges within 45 minutes to be back up again",

It was quality, well made, and had great instructions which I used to learn how to fly the drone. They also included extra propeller blades and propeller guards which will come in handy. It took about 30 minutes of practice to become efficient in operating the drone. Honestly, I crashed it several times, but it held up great. I was so happy with the product, I purchased a bigger, more expensive drone (with a camera) from Holy Stone. No complaints, would surly purchase again as a beginner drone!",

I fly it outside in light wind with my kids. They also send you a card to get another set of stock propellers, battery charger and a few other things. It also takes a good beating indoors and out. The battery is internal and charges via usb by way of phone charger. I have had it less than a month, hoping the battery and motors holdout longer than other $30-40 drones. Nice work though Holy Stone, I will buy other models based on this one.",

Very compact and fits in the remote when not in use. Auto take off and auto land with the push of a button. Does left, right, forward and backwards flips. Rotates in a tight circle with the push of a button. White LED light in the front. Also has red and blue LEDs for low light orientation. Definitely well worth the money!!",

I bought the extra parts just in case, but so far, he's managed not to break it - and it took a few tumbles when he was learning. I also love that it folds up and can live inside the controller.",

It\u2019s so small that when it doesn\u2019t respond to the remote, it becomes very difficult to find outside. I recommend this only for inside use because of this issue. My son flew his outside, it took off and we could not find it.",

For a low-cost easy to fly drone, this one can't be beat. In addition, Holy Stone is great to work with. Though I did not have to contact them on this particular model, we've had other Holy Stone drones in the past and their technical support team is fantastic and very responsive.

The only downside is you cant charge it while it is folded in the case. Other then that you can charge it with the charger which is nice.
