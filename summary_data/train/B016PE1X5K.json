It is just too much frustration for an \"upgrade\". Possible I am unlucky enough to receive a defective modem with the dreadful Puma chip set.",

It replaced a 6120 that was still working after 6 years but was running into congestion problems in our neighborhood. I took it out of the box, hooked it up, and spent 5 minutes on the phone with Cox tech support to register the Modem's MAC Address. Been working perfectly ever since. I stream movies, play games, and pass large files. All at peak performance. Some reviewers complain about gaming performance but mine is faultless. I don't expect my hardware to compensate for poorly programmed games.",
