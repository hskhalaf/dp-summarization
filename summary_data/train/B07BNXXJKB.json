For people who look at reviews for info on watching just everyday tv with these new slim tv's the Yamaha is a must have for audio & I would recommend this unit to everyone for an intro to 5.1 surround sound at a low price for amp & speakers.l",

In all honesty, I may throw this one away or sell for cheap in a few months. Features are great but it makes your speakers sound very cheap and unbalanced.

      "text": "The quick start that comes with this product is worthless. To get it to work I had to download the manual off the net, read through many pages of circular reasoning, and when I finally got to about 170 pages they told me how to turn on the HDMI. Forcing people to go through so many pages of poorly written material to get to the most fundamental function was in my mind inexcusable. When I finally got it set up it sounded good momentarily, but would lose and rre-gain the signal about 1 time per second. No exaggeration! Back it went. I will avoid this manufacturer in the future",
