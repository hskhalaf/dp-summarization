There are 4 braces on the sides of the spine area and if you put it on tight, it will keep you upright. When sitting in an office chair with this brace, posture is remarkable. The width is what keep you nice and upright. Lumbar spondylosis is my case, this is a perfect back brace for vertebrae alignment to manage pain.",

The back part is padded perfectly where it puts pressure on your muscles to help stabilize your spine, and takes the pain away. I'm very happy with this purchase. Any back pain, sciatica sufferers out there, look no further, this is definitely worth it. I was amazed at how effective it was.",
