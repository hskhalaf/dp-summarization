As I put it away at home, I noted that the pole has about 6 dents in it where the top part of the umbrella shifted in the bottom part of the pole due to very light winds, which deformed the poorly-made, thin-walled pole. I'm calling Amazon about a refund. this is not acceptable. I would NOT buy a Tommy Bahama umbrella again. I should have listened more to the negative reviews from owners who said the company didn't make products today with the same quality it did in the past. Find something else.",

The first summer, the mechanism to put down the umbrella to fit in the carry case jammed. The second summer, the same mechanism fell completely apart - disintegrated. The umbrella randomly went into tilt position. I tried to straight it and then pieces flew everywhere. I guess for the price, I did get two summers out of it - sortof - since the daily rental rate for umbrellas at the beach is $40 and up. By the way, since I ordered it two years ago, Amazon won't do anything.",

Others have noted the lightweight materials it is made from. Yes, it is lightweight and was designed that way.

Held up great even with beach wind for five days. Make sure to point it at an angle against the wind so it doesn't flip. Anchored down in the sand fantastically and will definitely buy another for the next trip so we can set up multiple shade spots for the kids to play under. :D",
