OK! now for the safe the gap around the door is going to be easy to pry so I plan drop some metal shivs to make it difficult. It's 250 lbs I'm guessing it will hold approximately 10-12 long guns comfortably and accessibly with shelf room for other handguns :) It's well built and very sturdy..Thanks God Bless, I hope this helps.",
