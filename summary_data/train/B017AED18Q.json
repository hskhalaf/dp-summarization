      "text": "Perfect backpack for your DJI Phantom. After extensively researching several different options I chose the Manfrotto for my Phantom 4. I like that the backpack doesn't scream \"DRONE\" with its look. People are genuinely surprised when you pull out a complete flight setup. The P4 batteries are too wide to fit in the front battery compartments, but the zippered containers in the center area hold them without issue. I mainly use this for hiking into remote areas, and it's far more comfortable than other backpacks I've tried in the past. It seems well made, and likely to hold up for years to come.",

      "text": "Great backpack. A little larger than I was expecting, but very nice quality and construction. Fits my X-Star Premium drone upright in the quick release section with props attached and upside down with the props off for complete enclosure inside the bag. Plenty of room for extra batteries and anything else you'd need to bring along. The only con so far is the lack of mesh pockets on the sides for water bottles. Thinking about using my dog's water pouches from his backpack for the very tight side pockets on this backpack. Update: If bringing water along with you is important, a bike water bottle will squeeze in the zippered sides.",

In the pics you can see the relative size against a Lowepro Transit 250, and a Manfrotto 190CX; not the lightest to carry, but the only I have.",

      "text": "I love this backpack, you can fit in everything but the kitchen zinc :O), my drone feels protected inside this backpack, has a lot of compartments so you can carry your accessories and I dont feel like Im carrying a slab of concrete like with the hard cases. So why only 4 stars, I think the price is a little high, haven't used it very long but it seems like its very good quality so hopefully I'll get what I paid for and it will hold up the test of time.",

It fits my P4P perfectly and has lots of room for batteries controller, tablet, and my other camera equipment (Sony A7Sii with 2 lenes) and all the chargers I need. Was able to put a NVIDIA Shield K1 and surface 3 in the back no problem. Bought the bag for a trip to Maui next month. Only thing I would recommend is getting motor caps since the bird is upside down.",

I can fit my phantom 4 with 3 batteries, about 12 props, charger, tripod, sony a7rii, extra lens, hammock, and a few other small things all in it comfortably. I put quite a bit of stress on it too. I drop it pretty hard sometimes onto the ground when I'm in a hurry to get a shot. Protects the drone very well. I've taken it through airports and it fits great in overhead compartments even on smaller planes. Would recommend this bag to anyone looking for an awesome drone backpack!",

However, opposite to what people answered under the questions section, it does not work well with the Phantom 4. The tips of the motors are a touch longer than the Phantom 3 and they do very slightly get in the way of the zipper. I have to force it in to close. This is something can dealt with though . What cannot work is the battery holsters which are very important. They are designed for the Phantom 3 battery (understandably), The phantom 4 battery is much much wider and will not accommodate the new battery.",
