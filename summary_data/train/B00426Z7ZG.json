      "text": "I've been wanting one of these mats for ages. I was a little surprised when I first unpackaged it as it was smaller than I expected. This brand's full-size mat is about the same size as other brand's foot mats. However, I just place it on my yoga mat and lie down on it and it's still the right size to cover my entire back and shoulders. I love using it and don't find it too sharp. My husband and kids all want to use it, too. The quality seems excellent. I chose this brand as it was one of the best-known and recommended, and had a high ratio of plastic points (better quality, less pain).",

Maybe i am overlooking it but I cant seem to find ANYTHING anywhere on the whole page that says it cannot be returned. I am beyond pissed right now. So now im stuck with this 80$ p.o.s.

While it is protected from the cover, it is still somewhat concerning since it claims to be free of toxic chemicals (what else is lurking around?). Additionally, it looks pretty gross as you can see the newly turned yellow foam thru the top where the cover closes with Velcro tabs. Otherwise an excellent product.",
