Installation was simple--took less than 30 minutes to swap out the old 154 heater and install the 157. As expected, this heater takes about 2 minutes to warm up, but it gets my 160 sqft (15 sqm) bathroom toasty in under 10 minutes.",

      "text": "There's nothing amazing to report, but if you are looking for a quality brand replacement of an old broken, worn out surface mount (bathroom) heater, this is the one to get. It's a bit pricey for what you get, but I reckon they don't make these in huge quantities like they did in the 1970's, plus they know you can't find a bunch of competing products. Nevertheless, it's better to get one of these and swap it directly in than start with a new type of heater, unless you have time and money to burn to get a better system e.g. Cadet wall heater.",

As for installation, it's pretty straightforward except they placed the screwhole that you need to access from the bottom right above the small motor box so I had a heck of a time trying to angle a screw in from my ladder up into the bottom and through the fan blades. Once in, the heater/fan looks good (silver). Just a pain to install and no heat. So, pretty much you are paying for something to fill the hole of an old ceiling heater but in my opinion not a good product.",

It replace a previous \"heater\" which was just a conduit for cold air in spite of all care and insulating we could provide. This model has a small footprint, as it just takes an 4in? box to be wired into. Great heat for our small bathroom, too.",

Install LED bulbs (low wattage and lots of light) and you have a home run. Most other similar heaters are either 1500 watts, requiring a 20 amp circuit or dedicated line, or are much weaker and don't provide much useful heat at all.",

It's about as inefficient as it gets. Spot heating solves that problem. No longer will you heat an entire home when you simply need a bit of comfort in the bath or dressing room, or any other room.\n\nEFFICIENT HEATING ELEMENT\nEven the most efficient central heating systems send heat up the chimney. But Broan spot heaters deliver every bit of energy back into your home. There's no external venting, so the electricity you convert to heat is delivered directly where you want it. \n\nSIMPLE, SAFE, AND EFFICIENT.\nPermanently lubricated motors are quiet and require no maintenance. They can be operated by a built-in adjustable thermostat or an optional wall-mount controller. Heaters may be converted in the field to a choice of wattages/voltages. And for safety, heaters are thermal overload protected and the complete heater assembly conveniently removes from the housing for cleaning.\n\nABOUT BROAN-NUTONE\nIn 1932, Henry Broan developed and manufactured a kitchen fan called the Motordor Fan that provided quiet and efficient kitchen ventilation.
