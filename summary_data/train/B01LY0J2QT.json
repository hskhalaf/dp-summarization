      "text": "we ordered a total of 3 of these chairs for the office. ALL of these chairs have issues with the wheels. I am not sure what the issue is other than when you try to actually move in the chair you almost flip over because the bottom half of the chair is working against the top half. There is a flaw somewhere in the rolling mechanisms. for this reason i would not recomend the purchase of these chairs. They all need to be replaced. They are comfy is the only reason it has two stars.",

The wheel base is ok, unless you have a teenager who likes to lean way back when the chair is int he upright locked position, then the wheel arms bend and it is hard to push back to get up. This only happened to one, But both suffer from cheap arm rests covers and staples popping up. I have since recovered with real cowhide to cover the staples.",

The screws work themselves loose even after extreme tightening, the padding starts to wear pretty quickly, and the chair's back leans far too much backward and puts undue stress on the cheap plastic in the arms (along with those aforementioned screws) so that it's beginning to fall apart after only a couple months of use. I'm not a big person either, 175 pounds and 5' 11\" so it's not like I'm putting too much stress on the thing. It just sucks. Spend more the first time and get something worth having or have to replace it again in a few months and spend even more cash, the choice is yours.",
