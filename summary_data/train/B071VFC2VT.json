She's an adult indoor Ginger Tabby and I've tried every conceivable food. She likes very few. For whatever reasons, this was a hit, so it will be a regular on our shelves.",

I took him for a sonogram and he had no anomalies on the scan. The vet recommended that I purchase a dry food high in protein, I purchased Crave dry food and not only does my cat love it, he also stopped throwing up. I swear by Crave food and highly recommend it for discerning cat owners.",

They absolutely love the flavor, and the larger kibbles force them to chew more and not eat as fast. I can tell a noticeable difference in their coats, and the occasional hairball has all but stopped. If you love your kitties, they'll love CRAVE.",
