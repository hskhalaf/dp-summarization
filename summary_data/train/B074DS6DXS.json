If these two problem are fixed I would give it five stars. It's a very good product. UPDATE: Almost immediately after posting my review, I got an email from the manufacturer with a PDF version of the product manual that answered all of my questions. Thank you, thank you for your quick response! I have adjusted my review to give you five stars.",

The camera quality is poor -- Mars it is not. However, again, I believe it's as good as some security cameras.
