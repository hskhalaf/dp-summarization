      "text": "I'm a fishing lover and I used a lot fishing cameras. The price performance ratio of this one is much higher than others. The main advantages are as followings: 1) Good waterproof performance resistant to cold temperatures 2) Durable camera with high quality videos 3) LED light applied to help with capture clear videos in dark water area 4) Highly adept at capturing footage without spooking fish because of its cute fish-shape. A tip: I find out it will have a highest quality video when I place the hook 5 to 20 inches away from the camera lens:) The product is so fantastic and perfect. I cannot wait to share this with all of my friends and families.",

If you use this device normally the video clips are cut off every 3 minutes. The clips that the camera stops automatically at the end of three minutes are not viewable. Only the clips that you manually stop by pressing the button can be viewed. Since you have to unscrew the back and expose the inside to press this button, it's just not practical. I have tried it in potplayer and VLC along with several other less known video players and I have updated codecs. It could have been very cool but for this major issue.",

I was hoping to use this to troll for tuna and wahoo, but its not worth losing a lure. Guarantee the ends will break off on the first strike. This is more suited for bass and small fish. Planning to make a wire leader as a safety line between my 2 swivels so I can at least use it one time, after that it will be broken 100% Also it only allows you to record 3 minutes at a time, which is not long enough.",

Make sure you read reviews... putting a lube or silicon grease on o'rings is a must to avoid water leakage. Cons, you can not control which way the camera is pointed which results in 90% of them containing nothing and you have to view countless hours of footage. Once you have a strike, the camera will point toward the fish (see video).",
