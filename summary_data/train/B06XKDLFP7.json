      "text": "Im so pleased with this pots and pans set! I washed , dried and seasoned with oil (per manufacturers instructions) once I got them. The pots came with lids which have a venting hole in them. It makes it easy to drain grease or water from your pasta. The lid handles have a material over them that doesnt get hot . I cooked eggs this morning and was able to fry them without oil so the nonstick coating is really good! Also liked the spoons and spatulas that came with them. Great set for the money!",

Although it is non-stick, it is not ceramic coated and the pans are small. A good set for a college kids, a vacation condo or novice cooks. Great value, small fry pan arrived scratched sadly. Thus the 3 star rating. Feeling fairly conflicted about this purchase and would like to return it but my return window closed with no response from the seller.",

With this set I always hand wash everything after letting it cool down. Do not put water in pots or pans when they are hot it can damage the pans coating. It holds heat so well you never should cook over medium once given the time to heat up the pan cooks so nicely. I usually use a few drops of oil or a small pat of butter and I never have an issue with sticking.",
