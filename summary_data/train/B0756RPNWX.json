In the picture attached, you'll see the product actually DOES include SLS, which is one of the ingredients you should try your hardest to avoid. If you don't know why, do some research. Very disappointed. This will be getting returned.",

It has a minty taste but not really overpowering like other charcoal toothpastes I've used. My 10 year old has also started using it, which is amazing because\"adult\" toothpaste usually is too \"spicy\" for her. I feel like my teeth are whiter from using this. The texture is the same as regular toothpaste. Activated charcoal is a superfine powder and not gritty at all",

It doesn\u2019t have a strong flavor like regular toothpaste so it doesn\u2019t have that slightly burning feeling. My teeth feel much more cleaner than when I use regular toothpaste feels like I just got my teeth cleaned by the dentist! The size of the product is great I feel like it will last me a while! I will definitely repurchase when I run out. Highly recommend this product. \ud83d\ude0a",
