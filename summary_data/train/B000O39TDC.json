These dogs need to be groomed each day if you allow their hair to grow out naturally to where they have a topnotch, mustache and beard as well as the long, fluffy body coat. I use this comb for her face for combing the beard, mustache and topnotch. This is a perfect tool to comb up near the eyes in order to keep the mustache clean around the eyes. I simply love and recommend this great tool to people who own double coated dogs, particularly dogs that have a mustache that is allowed to grow.",

The only flaw is that it is truly miniature...and while our dogs may be miniature, that doesn't mean our hands are, and even the handle is quite tiny (and I have little hands), so this would probably be difficult for someone with larger, or even average-sized, hands to use.",

So, she tolerates her grooming because she knows she will be rewarded afterward by allowing her to indulge in \"comb\" hide and seek. (She is a pro at hiding.) The comb is great; good price.",

The size of the teeth and the overall comb are large enough to work on the hair around the eyes and mouth, but small enough so that your dog won't be alarmed or flinch as he might do, if you tried to use a larger comb on his face. It is a tool that I will be happily using every single day.",

I usually use a larger comb to comb her body, a dematting comb to comb through the worst of the mats and use this comb to fine tune.",
