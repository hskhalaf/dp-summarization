It is USB 2.0 speed, has a wall wart (plenty of extension as well) and my mac (Sierra and El Capitan) and Windows machine (wants additional driver) recognize it immediately. It plays CD's, DVD's, and HD-DVD's. It will mainly sit upon a shelf as a backup process for all my HD-DVD's. Software that works with HD-DVD's is very limited. It does NOT read/play Blu-ray media.",

Those who want high definition movies on their Xbox will have to download off the market or just shoot off $60 for this and accept that it is dead technology.

Know this: much as the PS2 wasn't the most technologically advanced player out there, but it was cheap, convenient, and brought you into the next generation of movie entertainment (i.e. DVD), so the Xbox 360 is to HD movies. It, just like the PS2, \"just works.\" The setup took all of 45 seconds. As for the HD DVD format itself: awesome. Well worth the $200 you spend. Of course, you'll want to upgrade your current library once you see the difference, so it will end up costing far more than that... :-)",

I can only do 1080i or 720p on my 42\" DLP but I am not complaining at all. In the end I will have gotten 7 free HD-DVD movies with this drive. Well worth $179 considering it also includes the universal 360 remote. I also have a PS3 and I personally feel that HD-DVD is just as good as Bluray in picture and audio quality... better with the HD-DVD/DVD combo discs since I can play the content on normal dvd players.",

Gamming was already stunning but adding this HD DVD drive for only $200 has resulted in a fantastic movie experience. If you already have XBOX, a receiver that already upconverts to 1080p, why pay $1,000 or more for a seperate HD DVD player? (Most HD DVD players only provide 1080i anyway.)",

With the Xbox 360 Elite, all you have to do is plug in the HD DVD player, no install disc needed (if your connected to Xbox Live). And, if your Xbox is connected to the TV via HDMI, you get full 1080p picture! The Xbox HD DVD Player is one item all High Def and Video Gaming enthusiasts should have. Highly Recommend!",

I would have given it five stars, but it does not support some of the lossless audio. Which at this point is not a big problem, since I don't have a receiver that supports them.

If your DVD has scratches on it, it won't read the disc at all. When I moved it to the regular DVD player on the Xbox 360, it skipped, but continued past the bad spot, whereas the HD DVD player seemed to freeze. 2. The Xbox 360 has to be running while the HD DVD player is running. This can be rather noisy during the quiet scenes in a movie.
