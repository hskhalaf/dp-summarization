I would advise you NOT purchase this product as it has the potential to literally ruin your life. I had transferred childhood videos on there. Gone. Now Seagate tells me it costs $550 to recover lost data when it was their faulty piece of hardware that shot itself in the foot. Will NEVER buy this product again. If you are set on a Seagate External Hard drive, do yourself a favor and buy the 2 or 4 year recovery plan. I should have done that.",

This Seagate USB drive contains a SATA inside, unlike such drives from WD and Toshiba, which are exclusively USB. That means if the USB portion fails, with the Seagate I can simply remove the internal drive and recover its data by connecting to a common SATA port, at a cost of no more than about $35, rather than pay a data recovery company hundreds or thousands. That may not seem important, but all of my drive failures over the past 20 years have been related to failure of the USB connector or USB-SATA adapter electronics.",

      "text": "Need a personal home backup? You can not find one much, if any better then this. It's easy to use and has a lot of space. The device, itself takes up very little space, itself! I use it, have it set for automatic backup, and it can be set to replicate the backup, even to one of several sites on the web. Much cheaper then paying for a \"dedicated\" on-line backup with a monthly fee. . .and you don't even control your own data, once you send it off! Wonderful little device, if you do backups, and you should, you really need one of these.",
