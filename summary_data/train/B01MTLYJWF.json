They are comfortable and the the little pocket in front is a nice touch. There are two hook straps in the front. A long strap that goes under and across the bottom and two rear straps that tuck between the seat and backrest and secure themselves underneath. In my case I secured them to straps that were under there. Requires a bit of effort to get underneath your seat from the rear but not a biggy. Took about 10 minutes or so to install them.",

Being on leather seats it did slide a little even when new. This was not a significant problem though. As with anything elastic, especially in hot southern sun, the strength of the elastic has started to weaken. This has caused more slippage and it is probably time to replace it. I will be purchasing another one of these soon.",

To compensate, I slid the straps down the seat as far as they would go, and attached the hooks under the seat. So far the seat has moved very little, if at all. Nice to have adequate protection without having to stand on your head while struggling to cover the entire seat.",

Fit: a bit large for Tesla X row 2 and 3. It would also block the seatbelt as it\u2019s in the seat itself. So not safe or practical. I\u2019m now using for front row seats. Still a little large by 1/2 inch all around. Will keep anyway.",

It's particularly bad on the right side where the loose/bulge interferes with the middle console and media buttons. It's too much of a hassle to return, so I'll donate to someone who has huge seats.

I decided that I wanted full seat covers instead so I can't comment on how they held up, how they moved when in use, or how they feel. But 4 stars for what I got. The only reason for missing one star is because the color of the brand new seat covers was a bit 'bright' compared to the color of my leather seats, but I still recommend.",

This second point is probably true with any seat cover, but is something to think about before buying.",

I will say that i am 340lbs and this plays a significant role in the short life of elastic. I am considering replacing them with nylon straps to see how that",

      "text": "Very impressed! Fit my 2017 Dodge Journey perfectly. Can hardly tell it is a cover. I went with the Ultra-luxury version and it paid off. Fabric with thick padding has a memory foam feel. I purchased these to protect my leather seat bottoms, and they look and feel great. Only negative is they ship from China so it took a month to arrive. But it is worth it, if you can wait.",

So good we're not even considering reupholstering the leather. We've only had them for a few weeks, so we can't speak to their lasting quality yet. But if they do last even a year, we would be very happy and would surely buy them again.",

[The wrinkles were gone on the second day.] The touch feeling of the seat cover is very good and comfortable. Still can adjust seats. Haven't tried seat heater yet. Great customer service!
