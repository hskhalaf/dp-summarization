But, since it is used only to keep small items locked away from those that aren't hardened criminals or looking to access darker intent, it's use is practical, sterdy, and a good price.

I have every reason to believe that the prior (several years ago) reports of picking the lock with a paper clip have been corrected and those issues are no longer applicable to this safe.",

Removed it from the box and right away I could see, two corners (inside) welds were broken. Tried the keys and found the bolts would not fully retract--hence the door would not open. Swapped keys, multiple times, and with the same result. Never could get the door opened. So, combine the broken welds with a door that won't open = not a product you'd want to try.",

Does what it is designed for (at least for me)... keeps children and visitors away from loaded guns (that can be quickly accessed by the owner with an easy to remember code or key). Keep in mind that a thief could take the box and break in by applying tools / hammers / etc. with properly located brute force or even pick the lock. Again... I want quick access to guns that can be used urgently if needed while protecting any curious children or visitors to my house.",

I was also looking at more expensive high quality safes and would have happily spent the money for them if this one didn't really live up to its rep. But, son-of-a-gun, this incredibly reasonably priced product totally delivers on its promise. I'm genuinely delighted that you can get such a rock-solid, functional product at this price-point. I could keep on raving, but I'll cut to the chase: If you want a high quality, heavy-duty, user-friendly safe for valuables or super-secure home-defense handgun storage, this product really lives up to its reviews. Exceeds expectations, period. Glad I bought it!",

The electronic lock includes a dashboard faceplate that makes it easy to view the status of your safe. The key pad will \"beep\" when a button is touched- letting you know you have pressed a key. The \"beeps\" can be turned off or on with the press of the megaphone button. There is a time out period after 3 incorrect combination attempts. Your safe includes a backup key should your batteries lose power or if you forget your combination. Combinations can be changed easily by pressing a button located on the back of the door and entering a new combination. There are pre-drilled holes for mounting the safe to the floor/shelf and wall. Fastening hardware is included. Safes should be mounted to a solid surface to ensure the security of their contents.
