However, there were those who had problems with the quality as many of the parts easily deteriorated after a few months. The wearers also had clashing views on the fit. While the model was praised for its good fit, some users experienced inconsistencies. It was also deemed uncomfortable during the first couple of uses. Overall, the trainer\u2019s positive qualities still outweighed the negatives, and it was generally considered a good training companion.",

It turned out that in those places in the shoes there is a very hard plastic frame. During the use of his shoes, he broke through the fabric and began to cut the leg.
