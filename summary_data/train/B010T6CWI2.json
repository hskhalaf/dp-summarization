The stock fan is meh, better than expected, but an aftermarket fan would obviously be better. It is not unlocked, so don't bother if you're trying to overclock. I've had this for about a year, and I have yet to run into anything wrong with it.",

It's just as good and I don't miss the milliseconds I could've gotten from the others. I did use the heatsink this processor came with (The higher end processors come with the chip alone) and it seemed to work out well. It was very easy to snap on the motherboard and was adequate cooling. For anyone who knows what they're doing though, it's always better to go with an aftermarket heatsink to keep your investment cooler. If you're on a budget and want to put the money elsewhere, I would recommend this processor.",
