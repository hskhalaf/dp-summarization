Even once positioned right, you can't really relax when using it as if you try leaning back into it, this can quickly go from deep massage to potentially bruising.

There isn't much to the operation... comes in two speeds, you can reverse the directions of the rollers (but it reverses on it's own after 60 seconds), and the choice to select with our without heat. No other functions or massage types, so it's a very simple massager but effective once you find the right position of the pillow. I like that it turns off after 20 minutes.

I broke the blue wand massager after 3 uses by using it. Anyway, I don't know how long this one will last but the quality of the massage is what you body is asking for regarding relief!",

This has helped him get rid of some of his knots and helps him relax his neck. Most definetly worth your money, I use it as well and it has the right amount of pressure for your neck, upper back or lumbaric. This is a great way to get a massage without spending to much $$$$ each time you want to get a massage. Although, massages are great but this is a quick at home massage. We use it as needed, and would definitely recommend to everyone. Always use in moderation.",
