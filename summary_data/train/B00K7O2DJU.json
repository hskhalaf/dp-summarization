I'm returning the camera I bought for a replacement in hopes of getting one without the defect.",

My only complaints with this camera is that it sometimes has issue finding focus and, so far, it tends to drop the ball when trying to capture moving targets (the result is usually a blur). However I'm fairly its my own inexperience at work there, given that I've only used the camera presets so far.",

The absolute best feature of this camera is looking through the viewfinder. I forgot how different the feeling was. It's been like 15 years since my Canon Rebel II. And the best part of technology is that when you snap the picture, you can see what you shot in the viewfinder a second later so you don't have to pull the camera away and look down at the screen...

This camera seems to have struck the perfect balance between quality and form. It is worth noting, as another reviewer mentioned, that the zoom is down to 24-70. IMO this is absolutely fine because most of my photos are scene-based or easily close enough for 70 to be sufficient. Perhaps less suitable if you're bird watching.",

I'm sure I could think of some very minor annoyances to mention, but to be honest this revision literally has everything I could ask for and more. It also *looks* beautiful, which is more than can be said for some other cameras competing on size.",

Lastly, the ultra-fast BIONZ X processor adds speed and accuracy for stills as well as beautiful HD video. WI-FI - Yes (IEEE802.11 b/g/n (2.4 GHz band))\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely stunning picture quality, compact enough to take anywhere. Now your photos maintain soft background defocus even when zoomed in with the improved f1.8-2.8 24-70mm Zeiss lens. There's even a pop-up electronic viewfinder for eye-level framing and a 180\uff70degree tiltable screen for 20.1MP4 selfies. Lastly, the ultra-fast BIONZ X processor adds speed and accuracy for stills as well as beautiful HD video. \n\n\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY\n\n\n20.1MP4 1-INCH EXMOR R SENSOR\nFeaturing a large 1.0\u201d Exmor R CMOS image sensor. The back-illuminated technology doubles light sensitivity and combines with Sony\u2019s Column A/D Conversion to reduce noise levels \u2014 a great help when photographing in dimly lit environments. Markedly reduced noise is evident even when high-sensitivity settings are used for capturing night landscapes or indoor scenes.\n\nZEISS VARIO-SONNAR T* 24-70MM F1.8-2.8 LENS\nThe DSC-RX100 III sports an all new bright F1.8-2.8 Zeiss Vario-Sonnar T* lens with 24-70mm zoom. The lens is perfect for portraits and macro shots with beautiful defocused - bokeh backgrounds. A premium multi-layered T* coating also dramatically reduces ghost and flare caused by light reflection.\n\nBUILT-IN SVGA OLED VIEWFINDER W/ ZEISS T* COATING\nView every scene in rich detail with the bright and retractable SVGA OLED Tru-Finder. The viewfinder faithfully displays what will appear in your recording, including the effects of your camera settings, so you can accurately monitor the results. The Zeiss T* coating enhances clarity and reduces flare and reflection in the eyepiece optics.\n\n\n\n\nSELFIE-READY MULTI-ANGLE 3\" XTRA FINE LCD DISPLAY\nSelfies have never been easier with a beautiful 3\u201d (1,229k dots) Xtra Fine LCD Display that rotates in multiple angles.

The large display delivers brilliant-quality still images and movies while enabling easy focusing operation.\n\nVERSATILE SHOOTING W/ XAVC S2, AVCHD AND MP4 CODECS1\nThe DSC-RX100 III records HD movies1 in the XAVC S2 format, which uses MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 for video compression and linear PCM for audio compression, while saving files in a MP4 wrapper. The highly compressed files allow extensive record times. With 50Mbps Full HD (1920x1080) 60p high quality video recording, XAVC S enables beautiful video recording with minimal compression noise even in scenes with a lot of movement. Linear PCM is adopted for audio compression. The camera also records in AVCHD, ideal for quality video for HDTV and Blu-ray Disc burning. Additionally, users can shoot the easily shareable MP4 HD video, ideal for web.\n\nBUILT-IN ND FILTER FOR WIDER-RANGING PHOTOGRAPHIC EXPRESSION\nRealize a wider range of photographic expression with built-in 1/8 (3 EV steps) ND filter that allows exposure adjustment in bright scenes.\n\n\n\n\nHDMI CLEAR OUTPUT FOR UNCOMPRESSED VIDEO RECORDINGS3\nClear, uncompressed digital movie signal output can be transferred to an external monitor/recorder (connected via the HDMI terminal) simultaneously in real time from the RX100 III3. The shooting info display can be turned off for even cleaner views of such movies on an external monitor/recorder. Frame rates include 24p, 60p and 60i.\n\nCOMFORTABLE CONTROL RING FOR MANUAL OPERATION\nA unique control ring around the lens works in combination with an intuitive, displayed user interface for meticulous SLR-type control over settings that satisfies even the most fastidious users. The control ring can be assigned to adjust various features (at various values) from basics like zooming and aperture to creative functions like Picture Effect. Moreover, it turns smoothly and seamlessly, allowing quiet, click-free usage while shooting movies including a new step-zoom function that enables instant selection of commonly used focal lengths.\n\nSIMPLE CONNECTIVITY TO SMARTPHONES VIA WI-FI W/ NFC\nConnectivity with smartphones for One-touch sharing/One-touch remote has been simplified with Wi-Fi/NFC control. In addition to Wi-Fi support for connecting to smartphones, the DSC-RX100 III also supports NFC (near field communication) - providing \u201ctouch connection\u201d convenience when transferring images to compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Users need only touch devices to connect; no complex set-up is required. Moreover, when using Smart Remote Control \u2014 a feature that allows shutter release to be controlled by a smartphone \u2014 connection between DSC-RX100 III and the smartphone can be established by simply touching devices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nENHANCE YOUR CAMERA WITH PLAYMEMORIES CAMERA APPS11\nPersonalize your camera by adding new features of your choice with PlayMemories Camera Apps.
