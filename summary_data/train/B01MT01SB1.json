I decided to buy a second one and it stopped working within 4 months. I am assuming it the same charging issue I had from the first one I got. This model is horrible. Garmin should be embarrassed by this model.",

After a few months of not figuring it out, we contacted Garmin. We sent our newly purchased Garmin in and recieved a refurbished garmin back in the mail. I purchased a new Garmin and I expect a new one in return, not a refurbished Garmin that has been used. If I wanted a refurbished one, I would have bought a refurbished one to begin with. I have purchased over 20 Garmin products in the past and I refuse to purchase another Garmin if this is their customer service policy. Bye bye Garmin.",

For some reason, when there is no destination set, instead of showing the upcoming cross streets it shows the distance to some random saved destination. It's difficult to set the volume precisely.
