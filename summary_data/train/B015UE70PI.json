Her fur would get so matted, I would bring her to the vet so they could sedate her for grooming and cut her undercoat. We did this every 6 weeks ($140-) each time. This was not healthy for her or my wallet. I was seeking a better way. This brush, so far is working. If I move slowly with it she's ok. It is gently and her coat is in much better shape. We are very pleased- this product is the answer.",
