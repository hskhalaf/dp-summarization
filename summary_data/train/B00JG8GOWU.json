(2) The back-light is kind of blueish and ugly and always on (even when you turn it off, it is slightly on still). Battery life is excellent, however.

The screen is amazing in the sunshine and really looks like you're reading paper instead of a screen which is so much more relaxing for the eyes. The backlight is great for night time or dark rooms. Overall I would highly recommend the paperwhite to others!",
