      "text": "Great Monitor for the Money, the HDR is a nice touch in certain games.. It can be tough getting the HDR to work correctly and the panel is fairly dim. the color accuracy is on par and for the money I can't complain but if I had paid more for this I would have sent it back. Its not a bad monitor and I t was priced just right, but I would have liked a bit of a brighter panel on this screen.",

I tried plugging DP and HDMI ports, restarted the monitor a couple of time with no success of fixing the sound. I would really appreacite if someone can provide me with a solution to this, because it's a shame for such a beatiful monitor to have such a silly malfuntion ruining it and of course I'd like to have my money's worth work with this.",

I love that the monitor can pulse its backlight at 100, 120, and 144hz. My monitor has no stuck pixels and no obvious imperfections in the contrast or brightness. Im not aware of a monitor with a better and more complete balance of features. I got mine for $500 and would highly recommend this monitor at that price.",

The stand makes the height and angle easily adjustable and it stays were you put it. In short, this is a great gaming monitor.",
