Actually opening is even larger than my bathroom commode. Lots of thought went into this. Bonus? Matches my bedroom suite perfectly!",

I bought this because of the plastic skirt that hides bucket AND for the plastic platform that prevents the metal bar in front from touching one's thighs when seated. My feet cannot touch the floor on the absolute lowest seat height which is 20 inches from the foor!!! This is ridiculously HIGH for a toilet/commode. So-called right height ADA toilet seats are only 17 inches high. A person under 6 feet tall would like to be able to rest their feet on the floor while eliminating. VERY BAD DESIGN FLAW -- I WOULD NEVER BUY ONE OF THESE AGAIN. WHAT was Medline thinking??",

Also, previous reviewer \u2018Bob Bragg\u2019 (12/18/16) has claimed he had to take it to a car wash to wash it and it was too big to fit in a car. This is nonsense.

Going into my research the quality and stability were at the top on my list. The Medline model was a little more expensive, but worth it to keep my Mom on the road to healing.",

But the real reason to purchase is it looks much better than most bedside commodes. This was purchased for a 80 plus woman who is still quite active but has issues sometimes at night. This chair does not give off as much of a \"sick room\" vibe as some do. Extremely easy to put together.",

Using it with pail liners makes an easy disposing of the waste. Definitely would recommend!",
