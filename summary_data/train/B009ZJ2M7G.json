Several months ago, I threw it in the trash because when my husband took it apart to see why it wasn't working anymore, all of the parts were rusted! Are you kidding me... it's a carpet cleaner. I use it alot. I had a more advanced Hoover product before this and used it for about 3 years before it stopped working. I decided to get this because I thought I would spend a little less money and still get the quality. Forget it.... what a piece of trash. Completely wasted my money. I'm done with Hoover.",

However be careful when using the hose and connections. As you squeeze the nozzle to clean upholstery or stairs, the water sprays all over. So it would pool up on the couch when I turned it sideways.

The clean water tank isn\u2019t super big but being able to rinse the carpet without using an entire tank with solution and then refilling the clean tank with fresh water...wow.

      "text": "Here is a quick review. Plus 1. Its not expensive 2. It works great. I mean really really good removing dirt. 3. Sucks up the water pretty good Bad 1. It should be one tank to empty dirty water and fill clean water. 2. When your new, you have to lower the handle to install/remove the tank. If you get really familiar with it, you could avoid lowering the handle. But you have to align the lower tabs and latch it which is kinda overkill. This is a perfect carpet cleaner if you do not want to spend a lot of money but want great results.",

      "text": "I was very pleased with the design and function of this machine initially. I felt it was well engineered and performed exactly as it should. Unfortunately, after 20 months and approximately (10) uses, a small interior plastic housing piece broke and after identifying the problem, I find the part is not available from Hoover or any of the major parts warehouses. Without this part, the brushes will not turn and the machine is useless. There are numerous youtube videos which address issues with brush failures and the fixes are straight forward but without the ability to purchase parts for a machine that is currently being sold, I cannot recommend this machine.",
