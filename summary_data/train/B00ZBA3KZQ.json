The base of the drawer isn\u2019t strong enough to hold clothing. Because of it\u2019s flinsiness, the bottom drops out. The drawers are designed with a \u201csafety\u201d catch thay makes them difficult to open. Because of this, the front of the drawers are popping off. For $200, you\u2019d think you\u2019d have a dresser that lasted longer than a couple months!",

      "text": "It is a nice looking dresser. Unfortunately, there is a poor element of the design where screws that are set into the cheap particle board that comprise the sides of the drawers do not have any nuts/pintels, etc. holding them in place. So when, in my case, even very little and gentle use happens, it is just a matter of time before the threading on the particle board wears out, and the drawers (except for the outside face) fall apart. that includes drawers that have only been open maybe half a dozen times in thecouple years we've had it. The product should last at least a few years as sold without falling apart.",

Thankfully the company sent new front panels free of charge, but those all had dents and chipped paint as well. The dresser is very cheaply made and thin. I am extremely disappointed in the quality of this dresser.",

It was damaged in the exact same spot as the one I had bought prior. Not only that, there is a huge gap as you can see in the picture. To put it short.. this dresser is not worth it, do not buy.",
