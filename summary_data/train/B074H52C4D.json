I might go to the hardware store and get the fitting they offer with this wand; the double headed spout the let's you have a normal sink without unscrewing everything. Other than that I love this! This was the perfect size for my frenchies too.",

I did not like the fact that I had to buy a black washer that was placed into the neck connector of the tubing as the washer that came with it was very thin and caused the leak. I had to spend my own extra money to fix the leak. Also the sprayer has no shut off valve and the minimum when paused too much water is coming out not as shown on the video. Overall I would not buy it again. The only good thing is the spray when turned on fully works well.",

However, I did find a work around and purchased a shut-off adapter on Amazon for $11 and it works GREAT so now I can stop the water whenever I want. :0) ( Problem solved!!",

I can give her a quick underside rinse several times a day without having to get her whole body wet. The water pressure has two settings and it's really good.

I would gladly pay more for a flexible steel hose like they sell for the garden. I've got one and it works wonderful! Never kinks and lays down nicely, wouldn't hit the tummy. Easier to store also!

      "text": "This was easy to install and a life-changer! also, somehow it has made the water pressure stronger. It's a breeze to use and the ability to turn off the water at the end makes bathing my dog so much easier. It's also surprisingly quiet, so my dog doesn't get as scared of being bathed. Excellent! highly recommend it for pet owners. It is also great for when I dye my hair and have to wash it in the tub. Just an added bonus ;)",
