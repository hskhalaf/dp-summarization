So impressed that I will buy another one for my irrigation system. I get charged for a lot of water usage so now i have a way to compare and complain, if needed. Thanks Moen... great product!",

Designed by plumbing and tech industry professionals, Flo by Moen is installed on the main water supply line of the Home. Through the Flo by Moen mobile app or your web browser, you can see live water use, including water flow rates, pressure and even temperature.
