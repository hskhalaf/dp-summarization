      "text": "I'm so in love with Birkenstock but have never been able to swing paying almost $200 for a pair. Well this is the best deal ever. I've purchases off brand Birks but the piece between the toes is normally made of fabric which wears out fast. This perfect pair has a plastic piece in between the toes. Probably the best purchase I've ever made. NOT ON SIZING: After reading some reviews on sizing I went against the recommended size. I wear an 8 or 8 /12 (9 in boots) so I ordered a 38M and they fit perfectly. Keep in mind Birks will mould to your foot so if it's too big it'll just flap around.",

I had to tighten the straps to the first hole for extra support & Im hoping they don\u2019t stretch. Wear them around the house for an hour & they will begin to mould to the shape of your foot.",

    "description": "FEATURES of the Birkenstock Women's Gizeh Sandal Cork and latex footbed designed to mirror the shape of a healthy foot and provide a natural walking environment More toe room allowing toes to move naturally, which promotes better balance and correct foot alignment from toe to heel Raised toe bar encourages natural gripping motion of your feet, exercises the legs and stimulates circulation Contoured footbed ensures even weight distribution and proper posture Deep heel cup cradles the heel and keeps natural cushioning right under the calcaneous (also known as the heel bone) Shock absorbing sole is flexible, durable, lightweight, repairable and replaceable, like almost every part of our shoes Jute fibers made of two layers - one wicks away moisture, the other adds strength Cork footbed is firm and resilient for maximum support Footbed Liner made of soft suede keeps your feet comfortable and dry\n\nThis is the real deal. Cork, leather, a buckle or two: these are the simple ideas that have made feet happy for over two hundred years, and that's the original Birkenstock. These shoes are made in Germany since 1774. No smoke, no mirrors, and no gizmos are needed. You walk, the shoe molds to your foot. The shape of the Original Birkenstock Footbed enables body weight to be distributed evenly over the whole foot, providing it with optimal support.",
