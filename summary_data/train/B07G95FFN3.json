All names, groups, everything is gone once a WiFi change is made. How can companies in today\u2019s age of cyber security and IoT be allowed to still release such a flawed product?

Hardware wise they function the same, however for me (as a developer) the controlling apps show how much effort a company puts into its products.

After 3 months of use I can confirm that the Kasa works as expected, unlike some others in the market where the manufacturer pushes out alpha ware (yes I've seen ridiculously bad apps). The cheap ones will be okay if you just want to turn your lights on while on vacation, but not when lives depend on it.",

Absolutely love the ability to switch plugs on and off and schedule them to all turn on or off at specific times each day. Paired with WiFi video cameras I can monitor and switch off problematic hardware while traveling. My only negative comment would be that scheduling temporal resolution is minutes so the closest two separate things can be scheduled to turn on/off is 1 minute apart.",
