They made ME jump through hours and hours of hoops to get the computer replaced. They send me a refurbished piece of junk. Again I have to spend hours and hours on it as their technition. They say there is a home service warranty... Don't believe that for a minute. Everything to Dell is a software problem. Their solution to everything is to reimage the hard drive and reload the operating system. Naturally all your programs have to be reloaded. When they transfer you the call gets dropped. Don't ever buy a Dell computer.",

Read about capacitor whine, which if is high-pitched like graphics card squealing, is not the sound I am hearing from this unit.

A few weeks later, after testing several games on it, I must say that I am happy with the purchase, though it can be a bit slow to start up or load games due to there not being a SSD in the system. Overall, I am happy with this system and would recommend it for the money if you are a gamer on a moderate budget.",
