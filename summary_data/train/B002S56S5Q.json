He has had this stereo for almost 6 years now- and plays like a newer quality stereo that you would go out and purchase today. The ability to use it to charge items and plug other items in was certainly a plus. The accessibility of a docking station when your in the middle of nowhere or the radio is merely talk shows at too early am was a selling point and is used frequently. Dewalt never disappoints.",

Yet if you are really blasting the music then it will only last a few hours. NOTE: that is with an 18 volt battery. The base isn\u2019t anything to get excited about; I typically have it turned off.

I would be careful of the small connector port for the ipod or other music source because it is a fragile point and can be easily damaged.

Works as a cordless device with a battery plugged in and when the unit is plugged into 120 Volts, it is a great charger. When on 120 V. doubles as a power strip as well. Plenty of presets and it has the ability to pick up stations my previous radio struggled with. Rugged construciton and well protected with the roll bars! I will use it with my travel trailer for outside music while camping. I hate I waited so long to buy one.",
