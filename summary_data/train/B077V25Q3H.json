It has a very fine mill to it and works great for everything I've tried so far (pancakes and cookies). I've made several batches of pumpkin pancakes using a recipe I found on the Flour Farm website... absolutely the best pancakes I've made so far using gluten-free flours. I believe it's their flour formula that gives it superior flavor and results in baking and griddling. This flour is a keeper!",

You\u2019re never lacking in the flavor department when cooking/baking with Flour Farm. Find a flour that makes you grateful to be GF. This one will do just that for you! Truly amazing!
