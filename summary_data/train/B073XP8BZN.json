But, once you have a palette of colors you like to use, it probably makes more sense to buy larger spools of those colors. I'm almost out of the silver and the blue. I love that there were several tinted clear options as well as the silver/gold. Really is a nice range - which was why I bought this as a starter set. I made this bug using these PLA filaments - and an old sample shampoo bottle.",

I really like the Mika PLA spools--whether matte, translucent, or shiny, they're consistently of the highest quality--and I was happy with these for my prints.

Bed adhesion was perfect, extrusion was consistent, no jams, and even the solid colors come out with almost a satin look. I've only gone through the pink so far and I'm already in love.

Due to the distance from the feed rollers to the print head, about 18\" of the overall length can not be used (measure length of the feed tube on your machine then subtract from 10' to determine the total usable filament for printing).
