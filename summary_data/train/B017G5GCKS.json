This is due to the manufacturer thinking that a smaller set with more power would be better, when in reality it is a overheating mess. The drill now generates more heat, with less material/air flow to cool it. Make certain you are getting the set that you ask for, as I was shipped a 2997-22 as the seller stated \"since they are the smaller, stronger, and better tools\", good on him checking specs, but the reviews on Milwaukee's own website spell out the disdain most customers have for this \"upgrade.\"",

Shortly after using the impact drill machine oil began to leak out of the tip. Now, about 2 years light use of the drill, the gears have stripped out rendering it useless. Previously had a Craftsman for about half the price that held on nearly a decade. It was a lot more money for the Milwaukee but it had great reviews online and I could afford a more expensive set, so a made the purchase. Very disappointed. Can't recommend this product.",
