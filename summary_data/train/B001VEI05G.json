Unfortunately the flaw appeared after I baked a cake in it, so returning it was out of the question. The seal where the ends meet is not a precise and the batter leaked onto the outside of the pan and after baked batter got in there, it was next to impossible to remove all the cake, even after soaking in hot water. While I probably can make a clean crusted cheesecake, I was under the impression any cake could be baked in this pan.",

The cake looked lovely on the bottom of the pan after releasing ring, but I would not recommend ever cutting on it. It is not flimsy like some cake pans and I expect I will never have to buy another one, unless it is for a gift or different size, since I only occasionally cook cheese cakes. Love It!",

It may work just fine for more dense items like cheesecake and lasagnas.",
