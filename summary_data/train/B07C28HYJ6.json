The cloth diapers were leaking, and I was getting frustrated cleaning crib sheet multiple times a day. I heard great things about these inserts, and I see why. They're soft, thick, and very absorbent. This means I can go an hour and a half or two hours before needing to change the diaper. Unfortunately 2/4 I have bought have formed small holes. They are all less than two months old. This isn't acceptable, and I am on the search for ones that are equally as absorbent, but don't get holes",

I\u2019m mad that I haven\u2019t used these until now. They\u2019re easy to clean and don\u2019t stain easily. They\u2019re amazingly absorbent. For as thin as they are I didn\u2019t expect them to be as absorbent, but they are the most absorbent inserts I have ever used! They do shrink a little bit after washing, but they START big, so they took shrinkage into account. I am including pictures of the before the wash/dry and after.

One thing that annoys me greatly and thus I only rated this with a 3 stars is that taking the tags off was a pain. You have to be very careful with it, or you'll easily snip the fabric off. Then, after you have spent a good 5+ minutes snipping off the tag, you realize there's a hole left behind still. I'm very sure that after about a dozen of washings, that hole will be much bigger. I just don't understand what's the need for tagging the insert the way they do?",

Side note: these are also great for travel, when you are in situations when you can't change a diaper right away. We have to travel for hours to see my family, and using these liners makes it so easy to go a little longer between diaper changes (stops).",

The inserts are not as absorbent as I hoped they would be and have to be changed frequently. In addition, the two piece system makes it slightly difficult because you have to get the cover positioned correctly and then add the insert which can be tricky. If you want to use cloth diapers I would try another brand that offers a one piece option or maybe one that has a slot for the insert so that it becomes a one piece at changing time.",
