Great price. Only thing I was a little, eh, on was one of the rubber mounts was missing and two looked like it was coated in sand. I looked in the pouch and found a bag with 4 more rubbers so no complaints. Highly recommend",

Even though the longer length wasn't much more expensive, it left me with the following challenges: - Harder to transport - Less room in tight spaces - Harder to keep the rails out of the camera's field of view for shorter zoom-in pans",

Right away this performed well with my GH5/Speedbooster/Sigma 18-35 setup. the 31\" is was the right choice as it's much easier to actually work with and I can get away with mounting it to a single tripod. I was tempted to buy the longer model, but glad I didn't as this gives me the looks I'm after. Used a knock-off quick connect plate on the tripod and can easily remove it when not needed and it's still rigid enough with only a little dip on the end isn't bad for my rig.",

The *only* negative I could find is that the slider binds just a tad near the center, where the metal brace is attached, but not enough to make much difference.

So big that it absolutely requires two tripods to get even the slightest use out of it unless you're only 2 inches off the ground with the legs that it comes with. Because of he design of the fluid head that I use with it, I had to buy a spacer to go below the fluid head, above the mount on the slider. I couldn't tighten down the nut otherwise. Its okay for what it is and pretty great for the price. But we all know that when buying Neewer, we're getting what we pay for.",

I don't know what I was thinking putting it on a ball head tripod. It wobbled like it was deliberately defying me. That being said, great slide the bigger one I bought here is going to be a part of my filmmaking arsenal for sure.",
