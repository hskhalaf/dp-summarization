The Vizio offers nearly identical picture quality at half the price. I purchased the Samsung less than a month ago and I feel like I got cheated. Oh well....",

Perfect picture, very easy to setup and VERY high quality product...especially since the price dropped recently to $1499!

The only issue I have is when you turn on the tv it starts playing one of Samsung's apps. I haven't looked into shutting it off yet, so hopefully it's possible. If you have $1500 sitting around definitely buy this tv. If that's too rich for ya get the Sony 900f (my bedroom tv is the 900f and it's great).",
