      "text": "Fantastic camera. For video enthusiasts, it's worth mentioning that it ships with the firmware update which includes XAVC-S codec (420 8bit) - a nice surprise, I'd expected AVCHD only. Combined with it's Super 16mm sensor (1'') the results in terms of picture quality are frankly as good as a Canon 5D Mark III. The other nice surprise was discovering auto-iso with noise reduction. You can point the camera at a pitch black room and it will produce a fairly good photo without flash. Amazing. The single down-side for me is that the battery doesn't last long and takes ages to charge in-camera. You need to get an external charger (charges at normal speed) and an extra battery.",

    "description": "Style Name:CameraSony DSC-RX10 Camera Black 20.2 MP 8.3 x Zoom 3.0 LCD FHD 24 mm wide lens wi-fi - black. There are a few reasons why the camera may not take a picture immediately when pressing the shutter button. Make sure your camera is not using the 2 second self-timer mode. If the camera is not set to use the 2 second self-timer, then the camera is may be having difficulty focusing on the subject. There should be enough light in your surroundings for the camera to achieve proper focus. If it is not possible to shoot in a well-lit environment, make sure the Auto Focus Illuminator option is set to On or Auto in the camera menu. Additionally, make sure you are not too close to the subject. If you are real close to your subject, then you might be beyond the minimum focus distance of the lens and should try moving back slightly. Before the camera will take a picture, it needs to focus. Press and hold the shutter button halfway down prior to taking a picture so the camera can achieve proper focus. When you are ready to take the picture, press the shutter button all the way down.\n\nREVIEW\n\nFrom dpreview.com:\n\nSony have a long history of making interesting cameras and have, in recent years, produced some of the most innovative products and technologies. Not all of these developments have caught on but we've admired their pioneering spirit, even when we haven't always loved the products.\n\nThe RX10 combines aspects of two of the company's most imagination-catching cameras - the newly announced RX100 II and the near-legendary R1 from 2005. It revives the large-sensor, long-zoom concept of the R1, but utilizing the same 1\"-type BSI CMOS sensor, meaning it can offer a balance of high image quality and long zoom in a sensibly sized package. In this case it means the RX10 is able to offer a 24-200mm equivalent F2.8 lens.\n\nThat relatively big sensor means the RX10 is not a small camera - it's about the height and width of a small DSLR and, though its body is slimmer than that, its 8.3x lens adds a stout, weighty bulk to the proceedings.\n\nSony Cyber-shot DSC-RX10 key features\n\n\n\n\n * 20MP 1\"-type BSI CMOS sensor (13.2 x 8.8mm)\n * 24-200mm equivalent stabilized F2.8 lens\n * Built-in 3-EV Neutral Density filter\n * Flip-out, 1.3m dot (VGA resolution) rear LCD\n * 1.14m dot OLED viewfinder\n * ISO 125 - 12,800 (expandable down to ISO 80)\n * Approx 10fps continuous shooting in 'Speed Priority mode'\n * Wi-Fi with NFC for easier connection (with compatible devices)\n\nOf course a lot of time has passed since the R1 was launched, so it's no surprise that the RX10 is a more capable camera - but Sony says it has added a lot over even the RX100 II launched earlier this year. By using the same Bionz X processor as the Alpha 7 and 7R, it gains more sophisticated image processing but, significantly, it also gains a built-in 3EV neutral density filter, meaning you can make use of that F2.8 maximum aperture, even in bright light.\n\nThe RX10 also becomes the first Sony to feature a 'Direct Drive SSM' focus motor, which uses piezoelectric materials to position the focus element, rather than linear motors. The company says this allows the lens to be both moved and stopped more accurately - reducing focus times. The lens also has a pretty reasonable close-focus distance, that increases from 3cm at the wide-angle end to 30cm at the other extreme (giving magnification ratio of 0.45x and 0.38x respectively).\n\nThe more powerful processor not only promises more detailed JPEGs, it also allows the camera to use every pixel to create its video, rather than having to sub-sample the sensor as most DSLRs do (the line-skipping method is a major source of moir\u00e9).\n\nAnd Sony appears to have been thinking about more than just stills when it made this cameras - the RX10 offers one of the most extensive lists of features for videographers we've seen on any camera. This includes stepless aperture control, headphone and mic sockets, focus peaking, zebra exposure warning and uncompressed video output.\n\nThe only problem is likely to be trying to convince anyone to spend so much on a compact camera. Because, while it was relatively easy to make the argument that the RX100 was worth nearly twice as much as a Canon S110 (given it had a sensor three times larger) it's a little harder to explain to people why they should pay $1299 for a zoom compact - no matter how capable.\nSo what's the big deal?\n\nPart of the problem with trying to explain why the RX10 costs so much (and we're not sure why it cost quite so much), is that it requires you to understand not just the equivalent focal length range and aperture, but also the effect of sensor size.\n\nThis understanding isn't helped by the use of F-numbers to describe aperture. In terms of exposure (and by definition), F2.8 = F2.8 = F2.8. However, that doesn't tell the whole story. In terms of depth-of-field and total light on the sensor (which is a major determinant of image quality), you also need to consider sensor size - otherwise the 24-200mm equivalent F2.8 lens on this camera doesn't sound any more impressive than a camera half the size or, more importantly, less than half the price.\n\nSo, while the Panasonic DMC-FZ200 at first glance looks most impressive, the equivalent aperture figures tell a very different story. Equivalent apertures tell you how the lens compares to a full frame lens with similar characteristics - much as the more familiar 'equivalent focal length' does. However, rather than telling you which lens has a comparable field-of-view, it tells you which full frame lens would provide the same control over depth-of-field and the total light hitting the sensor.\n\nSo, while it might initially appear that the Nikon Coolpix P7800 offers a comparable lens in a much smaller body (and for much less money), the RX10's actual peers are rather different.\n\nHere you can see that the RX100 can receive around 0.7EV more light at the wide-angle end of its zoom and almost 2.7EV more at the long end of the zoom. In fact, its wide maximum aperture means it's able to receive more light than Canon's larger-sensored G1 X from around 39mm equivalent and more than a Canon DSLR with 18-135mm F3.5-5.6 from 65mm equivalent onwards. And that gives the RX10 greater control over depth-of-field and the potential for better low light performance than any of these cameras.\n\nBOX CONTAINS\nLens cap\nEyepiece Cup\nShoe cap\nShoulder strap\nLens hood\nRechargeable battery Pack NP-FW50\nAC Adaptor AC-UB10\nInstruction manual\nMicro USB cable\n\nSee more",
