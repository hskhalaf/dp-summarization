It remained matte ALL NIGHT (6+ hours). Could've lasted longer if i didnt have to wash it off. FIVE STARS!!",

      "text": "I\u2019m very surprised and pleased with this product and I\u2019m a touch critic. I have very oily/shiny skin. No acne, but just always oily and usually have to blot my face multiple times throughout the day. I just tried this product for the first time and it\u2019s great! Have had it on for about 5hrs now and am much more matte and noticeably less shiny than ever. I highly recommend. I don\u2019t think this should substitute your face lotion but I think applying it with an oil free moisturizer is a win win. Definitely incorporating this into my daily routine. Thanks!",

I love it as a primer before i decide to put makeup on and it makes the makeup cling better to my face. I also like to wear it as a setting spray as well. It leaves my face feeling as if i just applied my make up but its been hours after ive done so. I have bought 3 bottles so far and will continuously do so cause its amazing! Thank u!",

The pore reducing factor I am not sold on and fortunately at this point I don't have wrinkles to try it on either. I will buy again.",
