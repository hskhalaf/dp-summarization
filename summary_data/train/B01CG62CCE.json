What I did not expect was that the only instructions included were very unsatisfactory cursory instructions on how to set up the camera. I had to go online to find the full instructions, then print them off. I know this is quite the current style, but it is annoying to say the least. Also, the camera has the disturbing habit of slipping into video mode for no apparent reason. Other than that, I like it and it does produce good photos.",
