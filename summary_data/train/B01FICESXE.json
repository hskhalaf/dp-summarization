These are called bacteriophage. \"phage means to devour\", bacteriophages are viruses that devour bad bacteria and make room for good ones, so you probably want to add a probiotic after you take these by themselves to see how your body reacts first. I have histamine intolerance, and had no side effects. Probiotics usually cause histamine, so this works well by itself. I have been able to eat some carbs without bad reaction I had in the past. Very happy and will reorder.",

      "text": "I recently started stacking this with Renew Life Ultimate Flora and it has been a very welcomed addition to my probiotic regime. Immediately in the morning, on an empty stomach I take one of each and within minutes they start to work. I have not tried any other prebiotic before, so as far as I can tell, it works great. I don't have any other brand to compare it to. If you experience digestion / movement issues, I would recommend trying out a prebiotic.",

I tried this product on recommendation from a family member and noticed a huge difference within a few days. My stomach does not gurgle as much throughout the day, I do not feel bloated after eating my meals, and my acid reflux has improved greatly. I take these with the probiotic from DR Tobias as well and the combo cannot be recommended more highly. It's a tad pricey, but worth a shot if you experience stomach discomfort.",

Foods that used to make my stomach uneasy, no longer have that effect. I feel better overall, as well, and I've only been using this product for two weeks. I am excited to see how I feel after using it for a longer period of time. Highly recommend.",
