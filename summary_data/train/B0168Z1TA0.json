I also like that it's low enough that I can keep it under the bed, so it's out of the way. Yes, I know that sounds sketchy, but it's a built-in wooden bed and the heater remains a foot away from the wood. You have to bake wood well over 400 degrees to start it on fire. You might possibly melt some synthetic cloths if you got them near this thing, but you're not going to start any fires with it.",

Add switches and a case to keep you from touching hot or electric stuff and you're done. There is no fan which is a major plus as far as I'm concerned because it allows the unit to operate silently. It is only 1000 watts so good for taking the chill off without blowing circuit breakers. If you're looking for something to kick ass, you'll want a 1500 watt unit.",

Of course then I'd wake up later freezing. I was trying to get away from using the noisy furnace in the trailer. I ended up tossing this heater along the route of a trip I took earlier this year.",
