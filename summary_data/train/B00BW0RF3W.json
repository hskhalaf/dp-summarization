There was a little dirt or like black glue between the face and hair, but it is nothing that will make me loose interest. I am not really a funko pop collector, so I do not know the going rate of the ones they most sell in stores, but it came on time, it is so pretty, and I suprisingly like the design more than the modern catwoman. If you like catwoman, I really would recommend this!",
