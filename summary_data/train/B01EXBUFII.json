Needless to say, I'm happy because she is happy - this is a stellar product, quality ingredients and quite unique (the cherry almond, for example, seems to have bits of dehydrated cherry in it!)",

They fizz and turn the water a beautiful color and best of all, leave your skin feeling very soft and smooth with no residue. I will purchase again. So much more affordable than the Lush bombs. While I'm sure I'l buy a Lush bomb here and there, these are so affordable that they can be used frequently without breaking the bank.",

      "text": "LOVE the price! (You can't beat $2.00/bath bomb!) LOVE the way my skin feels after using the product! So hydrated and smooth. :) Like the scents! (Lotion Fast gets a point for providing a balanced variety of bombs that smell great, though buyers may find themselves habituating to scents after roughly 10-15 minutes) Buyers should know that the bath coloring is quite transparent, and for the most part your bath water will not change to any deep colors. This isn't an important factor to me, but for others this may be disappointing. Will definitely be buying these again!",

They smell amazing, not too artificial at all, but very strong. The color change is amazing, the pink and warm colored ones stain your fingers if you hold onto them while they are fizzing though but don't be alarmed, it scrubs off. And my skin is so soft and hydrated after wards! I will be buying these again",

Some of my favorites have been lavender, grape soda, wakami, and cherry almond. A few of them do contain glitter, but I found those aren't so bad if you rub the extra glitter off the outside before putting it in your bath. For this price you can't complain. Bath bombs average about $4-$6 each everywhere else, even more from Lush. These are fun and inexpensive, and they smell great and turn your bath water bright colors.",
