If you put a custom screen background image this will cause it take longer to boot up and turn on when you start your car. Also weird fact, you cannot adjust volume while the backup camera is on the display.",

I have noticed that it could be updated but it also gives directions how to do so on the NDRIVE website. Streaming music, phone calls are work great. Built in equalizer is awesome and allows you to customize sound to your car. I have a 2015 Jeep Wrangler with sound bar and sub-woofer. This unit distributes the sound and it thumps. So far very impressed.",
