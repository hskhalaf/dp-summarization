I had trouble trying to get Photoshop to open the raw files from this camera, so I had to download some software from Canon. The Auto white balance is not that good and you have to set it tungsten when you are indoors, which is a bit sad really as most cameras can cope reasonably well without doing that. Getting it to talk to my phone is not as easy as the instructions would have you believe.",

Really love the remote photo taking, so you can set the camera up and take photos from a distance using your phone. Really quick and easy to get photos onto your phone as well for easy uploads to your social media of choice. Some fun filters, but perhaps not necessary as a lot of photo editing is best done afterwards. It also looks really great! I just need my photography skills to match the cameras abilities now.",
