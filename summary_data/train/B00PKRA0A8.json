This is the second time I ordered this because I lost almost all of his clothes in a move. I love it. I am huge Mr. Rogers fan and this is so much fun. Sturdy. Some little pieces that can get lost so beware if you have pets or small children. Other than that, if it went beyond five stars, I would select higher.",
