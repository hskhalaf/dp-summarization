I was stunned that it held up so nicely. There were no rips, jammed zippers, or broken parts. Even the rubber feet on the bottom were still in tact. I purchased this bag on the cheap because expecting to throw it away after one or two uses. Much to my pleasant surprise, I think this bag will hold it's own for many years to come.
