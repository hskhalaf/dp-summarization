      "text": "These shoes look great. They fit as expected, and they are fairly comfy. There's only one problem and it's a major one - the collar above the ankle digs into the back of you leg. I received the shoe yesterday and went on a 4 mile walk. It was one of the worst walking experiences of my life. The pain kept me distracted from the errands I was running. I was bleeding and am now sore from the weird gait I had to adopt in order to limit the pain. I'll be getting thicker socks to see if they work. Overall, I'm disappointed in New Balance for their poorly designed product. I wish I spent the $100 elsewhere.",

Saw these on a shoe sight and they were supposedly similar to the kayanos. Paid like 59$ for the white with yellow and just gave them their first run. 5 miles. Felt good. Felt like they have less cushion than I\u2019m used to and less stability but honestly I have no complaints. Especially at the price.",

      "text": "Fantastic comfort. Like a well fitted slipper. Very flexible, light feeling (although not crazy light on the scale) and breathe well. Coming from Hokas, there is a LOT more ground contact feel which makes sense given the reduced stack height. I would say that the increased ground feel encourages me to stay on my toes/mid foot and avoid a heel strike. Like other commenters have mentioned, the heel cup rises high in the back so half sock wearers may feel a rub on their Achilles. seems to be all the rage these days across multiple brands to have high heel cups. Looks snazzy but too often doesn\u2019t fit the foot and Achilles very well.",
