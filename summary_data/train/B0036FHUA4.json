It has no odor and the consistency of it makes it easy to spread on your face with your fingertips. I also like that it gives your skin a little bit of glow. If parts of your face are looking a little dark, blot with a piece of tissue or toilet paper and it smooths right out. It seems small, but my last tube has lasted me over a year with almost daily application.",
