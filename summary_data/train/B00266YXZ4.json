Took it out on a hike in 90 degree heat over the weekend and it remained comfortably cool. Size-wise, I'm at about 23 1/4 inches and the large fit me snugly but comfortably. Just what I was looking for. The only caveat I have is that the brim is pretty wide - good for protecting you from the sun but you may look a little goofy unless you curl/shape the edges a little.",

I was looking for something more flexible and perhaps just a tiny bit shorter in it\u2019s height. Decided finally to keep it for yard working. Because of its size in crown height and brim, I think it would look better on a tall person. The size offers good Sun protection but might somewhat dwarf a shorter person.",
