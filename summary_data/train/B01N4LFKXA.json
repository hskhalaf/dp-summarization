      "text": "I have ruddy skin with rosacea at 51 y.o.. Got a little sample tube of this stuff, fell in love, and ordered a full size. I have stopped wearing foundation with this, and my rosacea is slowly going away. It gives the skin a dewy look, and am getting compliments on my skin for the first time in a while. Going on 52, that's a nice feeling. It's very viscous and putting it on you might think it would just sit there, but it slowly gets absorbed. I think it's a wonderful product and the ingredients are beautiful with nothing harmful or fake in them. Picture taken in full sunlight - no filters, foundation, editing or botox.",

The cons it does not have the redness correction and skin tone evening effect that I was hoping for and that the other version of this product that is in the glass jar. It is also little greasy when first applied but absorbs well on my dry skin but doesn't last all day. It smells good without being too perfumie or over powering but somewhat medicinal. Probably won't buy it again since I wanted it mainly for the redness correcting aspect.",
