      "text": "Would not recommend this as a dental chew if your dog is an aggressive chewer. Dental chews are supposed to last awhile (they should provide your dog with a good amount of chewing, during which time your dog is scraping their teeth against the chew and removing bacteria/tarter). This Zuke Z-bone lasted my English bulldog less than 2 minutes. There are better dental chews out there like whimzees & himalayan dog chews, but I like to switch up her chews as a health measure, and these zuke bones just didn't do the job. Poor price point in my opinion since they really didn't last.",

Going to order more now because nothing has made his breath fresher than these. My dog (70lb Pitbull) was really excited for these treats when I first gave them to him and he was enjoying them immensely for 3 days. I watched him as he ate them so he didn't choke and he loved them and his breath was smelling much better. I did notice, however, that in those 3 days he threw up every single day. This was the only change in his diet. He won't even get anywhere near it anymore :(",
