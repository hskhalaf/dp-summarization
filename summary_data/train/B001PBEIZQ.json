The only odd thing is that while the length states 26 inches, it seems more like a 23-24 inch length when worn. It may be 26\" if stretched but in actual use it seems shorter, but still more than long enough unless you're going armpit deep. The nitrile material seems to want to stick to itself when fresh out of the package but no problems with that since. I haven't noticed any interior stink yet either but I don't keep them on for very long at a time.",

I read other reviews that they stink over time and judging from the way they smelled after the first time I used them, they will stink in the near future. But, this type of product has a limited availability, so if smell doesn't annoy you, the product works good and the gloves go up almost to my armpits. I am 5'5.",

It doesn't hurt, but its always starting to have your hand under water & feel a slight pinch. Anyways, if you're making meth like Walter White I dunno how these would do..........but if you have curious cichlids that like to nibble.......these are great!",
