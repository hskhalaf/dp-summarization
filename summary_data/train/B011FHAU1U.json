    "description": "Many of todays most common household cleaning products, hand soaps, and detergents contain anti-bacterial and anti-septic chemicals. These products interfere with the natural process that occurs in your septic tank. Bio-Tab is an environmentally friendly septic tank additive that ensures your tank stays in proper working order.. WHAT MAKES BIO-TAB SUPERIOR:: ADVANCED FORMULA: Bio- Tab is a highly concentrated tablet of bacteria (both aerobic and anaerobic) and enzymes that acts as a biological activator for septic tanks. In short, Bio-Tab helps septic systems work like they were intended. EASY TO USE: Unlike most competitors dusty powders or messy liquids, Bio-Tab is in an easy to use tablet form. Theres also a handy tracking sticker on the top of each bottle to track the tablets used per month. Professionally packaged in a small jar (one jar contains a full years supply), you can easily store Bio-Tab without fear of spilling harsh chemicals in your home.. SAFE: Composed by organisms deemed safe by the EPA, Bio-Tab is non-toxic to humans and animals. It is a non-corrosive and non-poisonous product that will not harm plumbing or septic systems. THE BIO-TAB CONCEPT has been designed with you in mind. The combination of tablet form and technologically advanced chemistry assures you of consistent product performance and dosage. These concentrated, time release tablets allow you to easily treat your septic system without the inconvenience of messy liquids or dusty powders.. HOW BIO-TAB WORKS: Bio-Tabs carefully constructed tablet form sinks to the bottom of your septic tank where build-up problems begin. While powders and liquids can wash over the surface with little effect, Bio-Tabs composition of enzymes and bacteria allows it to gradually dissolve to create a growing area of activity at the bottom of the tank that digests and liquefies organic waste.. One Year Supply will treat up to a 1000 US gallon septic tank.",
