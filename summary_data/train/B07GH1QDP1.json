      "verdict": "In the area of comfort, the Salewa Wildfire Edge approach shoe does not disappoint. It is also a shoe that excels in the durability and fit categories.That said, its rather stellar resume is marred by criticisms, the most worrying of which has to be its uninspiring grip performance on damp surfaces. Nonetheless, the Wildfire Edge is an impeccable Salewa piece in which adventurers can hike, climb, and look well all at the same time.",

    "description": "Salewa Wildfire Edge Walking Shoes Designed to keep you in firm control on the mountainside, the Salewa Wildfire Edge Walking Shoes will provide a technical approach to provide a premium and outstanding performance. Switchfit System Upper Using Salewa's developed Switchfit System, the shoe can be easily adjusted to match the terrain that you are on, making the shoe the perfect adaptive walking shoe. As you begin to climb, a precise fit is required for complete control and to enhance the performance. Once you have finished ascending, the laces can be loosened at the rear eyelet. This will mean that the toebox will become roomier, making it perfect for hiking in supreme comfort. On the side of the shoe, there is an Exa Shell, which will enhance torsional stability. This will wrap around the midfoot, providing it with greater flexibility, fit and support. Air is able to flow in and out of the shoes, which will improve breathability with a constant airflow for ventilation. The material covering the toes and heel is extremely thick, which will provide protection from shocks and bumps as well as holding your feet in a firm, upright and healthy position. Climbing Lacing extends from the toes all the way up the foot for a precise and easily adjustable fit. A flat lying tongue and padded collar will improve the comfort, whilst also reducing the risk of irritation by rubbing and chafing. MFF+ Midsole The midsole is developed with the innovative multi-layer MFF+ which allows for more customisation on the forefoot by using two interchangeable layers to accommodate a greater range of foot shapes and sizes. The trademark of SALEWA 3F System connects the instep area of the shoe with the sole and heel; ensuring flexibility, support and the correct fit where it's needed. Beneficial microbes, which are found all around us and are naturally occurring, are selected and bonded to the surface of the fabric. This innovative process of applying live micro-organisms to fibres r",
