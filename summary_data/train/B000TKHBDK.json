      "title": "Killer portable mouse, WAY better than BT",
      "text": "I tried (and own) 3 highly-rated Bluetooth mice with my 17\" PowerBook and recently my 17\" MacBookPro. All had frustrating \"jumpy, unpredictable cursor\" too often. Then I got a USB Logitech VX Revolution for home use and LOVED it. So got a VX Nano for portable use...it's FABULOUS! Both these wireless USB mice connect instantly and there is NO connection instability during use (as long as USB transmitter has reasonable line-of-sight to the mouse). The scroll wheel works well in both modes. Sideways scrolling is good (altho I like the Apple Mighty Mouse 360deg ball better). Overall, I'd say: nice feel, good ergonomics, excellent function. Worth the price!",

Good range, too - I've had it up to five feet away with no issues. Love the tiny receiver! My only gripe if I had one is that it tends to chew through rechargeable batteries a little faster than I'd prefer. Not that it's unreasonable by any stretch! I still get a good couple of months out of rechargeables, but I get 3-5 months from alkalines. go figure.",

Mouse is good size for me and the small areas I often must work within. Great feature is the ability to program an action with a button on the Mouse. I have it set for desktop - get quick access to it. Deltas: The scroller seems loose and often spins through a document if I am not attentive. This is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. Overall: I am pleased with it it. If you are considering this moose - I suggest evaluating the newer Logitech Mouse - Revolution?",

If you would like a small, extremely lightweight mouse that responds lightening-fast to the merest touch, the Logitech VX Nano is worth every penny. Give yourself a couple days to adjust \"your\" touch, as it really does respond instantly. Though advertised primarily for notebooks, I use mine at my desktop, where I do most of my work (and play), and my hand never gets fatigued anymore. With use at least six days a week, my cheap batteries are lasting six weeks and two days. I would highly recommend this mouse, especially for women, but also for younger children with little hands.",

I had a wired smaller laser mouse before, but the Logitech Nano is a lot nicer ergonomically. We use the laptops mainly as desktop PC, but we both like the size, the fact that you can turn it off to save the batteries, and should we go mobile, we can leave the receiver plugged in. What I liked the best: plug the receiver in, add 2 AAA batteries, turn the mouse on and you're in business!! Even a total neophyte like me (nano techology!) can do it!!! So far so good, if it changes, I'll be back to update!",

It would be perfect if I needed a dedicated mouse strictly for traveling and was very short on luggage space. However, I prefer a mouse that's a bit larger, that I can cup my hand over. I have medium size hands. Since the Nano is also designed to be ambidexterous, it's also a bit less ergonomic than one specifically designed for right handers (of left handers, if those are available). I'm exchanging the Nano for the VX Revolution, which is a bit larger, but still small enough for travel.",

One other review had given me pause by saying that it was too small for large hands, but there have been no issues whatsoever with my large right hand using it daily for maybe on average, 3-4 hours. Its compactness remains nothing but a virtue in my experience. Thank you, Logitech for a phenomenal addition to the world.",

I really didn't use the wheel features of mice before now but this device has changed this.

It's nice to be able to scroll quickly through a document -- in fact, you can easily spin it too fast for your computer to handle it :). On the downside, reception might be a bit weak since I noticed that when the nano receiver is plugged in the back of my laptop away from the mouse, mouse movements are not transmitted precisely. I don't have that problem when I plug it in in the back of my laptop but closer to the mouse. I suppose the laptop screen might be creating a sufficient barrier to weaken the signal.",

      "text": "This mouse is by far the best device to navigate your PC with. I have always been a trackball type of guy, but decided that I needed something a little smaller and wireless. It's small enough for travel, but not too small for a mouse; it fits well in the hand. With it's almost nonexistent USB wireless plug-in (that you never have to remove), quick laser movement that works well on most surfaces (except my glass desk), and the free flowing scrolling wheel, the Nano definately is an essential tool for your computer. All thumbs up.",

It's straight up plug & play, although you can use Logitech's software for greater customization. I currently have it plugged into my desktop and use it (with Input Director) for both the desktop and laptop together. It works better than my gaming mouse.",

He carries his laptop in a bag and a larger mouse would have been inconvenient and too bulky. The small USB can be left attached permanently to a port and the size of the mouse turned out to be its best asset. After installing and customizing it to his needs, he had absolutely no problem adjusting to navigating with it. This one's a keeper!!!",

Great movement and control. (Replaced an earlier model Logitech wireless notebook mouse - bought for the NANO receiver, but the movement and ergonomics were an improvement as well).",

The build quality of the VX Nano is impressive from the piano black accents, the scroll wheel, size and shape, to the carry bag that comes with it. The mouse pointer always feels accurate with no latency - have not used for any games but will certainly give it a try (I'm not a serious gamer obviously). Two thumbs up...can't go wrong.",

I just bought 3 more of them from Amazon when price drops under $20. They all work well. Thank you Amazon for selling very good products with unbelievable price!",

The driver for this mouse is not compatible with the driver for the Logitech DiNovo Edge keyboard. This is a known issue that Logitech is apparently working to correct, but as of 12-Feb-2008 it is not yet fixed. So be aware of this issue if you use this particular wireless keyboard.",
