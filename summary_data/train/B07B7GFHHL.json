Might work for the occasional hobbiest using ultra thin glass; otherwise it's a clear pass.",

They leave out the fact that it comes empty with no oil at all. After finally buying oil at the store I used it once and broke. Even before it broke it barely scratched the surface of the glass and definitely didn't go through deep enough to cut anything. Save your money and buy one that actually works.",
