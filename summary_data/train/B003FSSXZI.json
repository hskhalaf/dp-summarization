Its not extreme, but when I rubbed different material over the bed rest fine pink strands were left behind. I clearly saw it when I rubbed a black top over it. The last thing I want to be bothered with is the need to use a lint brush on my clothing to wipe away fine pink fibers. My search continues....",

Dry cleaners won't take it, and there is no way it will go in the washer/dryer, so I guess spot cleaning is the only way. This wouldn't be an issue, but the back rest is very shag like, making it a little harder to clean than a more traditional, smoother felt backrest. Overall, decent product.",

We were very pleased that amazon took care of exchanging the first one and the second one came very quickly. As soon as we took it out of the box, we noticed a place on the seam where it was not sewn correctly. It is really too bad because it is a really cute product. We have a different material and color from this same company also, and it seems to be fine. (It is the poodle material instead of the shag.)",
