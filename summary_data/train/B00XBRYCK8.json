I've noticed that I don't have to dust as often, I do exercise Bob every other day and he has really made a difference in keeping things more tidy. I find that keeping Bob clean keeps him running well. I do empty the dustbin on a regular basis after every use. I had a concern regarding Bob's behavior so I called the support team and I was extremely impressed with their efficiency. What a refreshing surprise!!!",

It does not fit under any of my furniture or in between because it is so large. It seems confused and just goes in circles in the same room and gets stuck on everything! It doesnt transistion from our tile to carpet so we can only run it on 1/3 on my single story house. I went to return it so I can get the $250.00+ back and now they want me to pay for return shipping too!!!!",

I really really wanted to love this vacuum but I truly believe there is a major flaw in its design. In order for it to clean properly my husband has to take it apart at least once a week to clean it, which kind of takes all the fun out of having a robot that vacuums.",

      "text": "I haved owned two Roombas and now this Bobsweep. The two Roombas each lasted about three years, then the batteries died. I have had the Bobsweep for two months and I'm happy with it. It is quieter than Roomba. I don't think it does quite as good a job removing dirt as Roomba, but more than adequate. It has uv light cleaning to kill bacteria, Roomba did not. It is a good deal cheaper than a Roomba. I rated it five stars because I got it on sale for $199 and for the reasons listed above.",

I don't live in US and cant find generic brand to fit either, so a waste of money. Check on parts availability BEFORE you buy. Lesson learned. and yes, I checked the manufacturer, where one brush is ridiculously expensive as often as it needs to be replaced., and they won't ship intl.",
