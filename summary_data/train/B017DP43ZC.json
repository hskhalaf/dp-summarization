Found this on Amazon but it was labeled MS.12106 ... Lots of warnings on line about mixing the wrong coolant and gumming up the system... Was concerned if this was the correct stuff... A little poking around on line found the Mopar Dealers Chemical Catalog... Turns out the MS.90032 is the concentrated product, the MS.12106 is the 50/50 premixed... Interchangeable with no problem... Bought it, poured it... no problem. No problem other than thinking that $25 is way too much for a jug of coolant... Oh well... Got the right OEM stuff...",
