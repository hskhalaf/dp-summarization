Not sure if there was a firmware upgrade or something but for the last few days the extender has been randomly disconnecting. After resetting and reconfiguring multiple times with no change I'll be back in the market for a product that can last a bit longer. Before these issues started I'd have given this 4-5 stars. I get between 250-300 mbps down off of my AC access point and this extender would usually test around 70mbps on the other side of the house. I had the range pretty maxed as far as placement goes so I'm sure that caused the latency.",

From there, you set up this range extender's SSID and security key and voila. Your connection has been extended and you'll even retain your network speeds.",

      "text": "I've tried plenty of solutions for boosting signals, and this is probably the best that I've had. Setup is easy, but as others have mentioned, expect to halve your speed. You'll have a great signal strength, but you won't have the same speed as with your router. No problem me as my main reason for purchasing is the ethernet port that I use to wirelessly hook up my VoIP phone (Ooma). I've tried powerline solutions (pushing internet through your electric wiring) to achieve this before, and the speeds were MUCH slower. This is about the best solution you could hope for. I recommend this product.",

I don't think our new router is the issue, as the phones/tablets can connect to it, but this amplifier just wouldn't stay connected. I only went up one floor, was I too close to the existing router? It didn't say. Just not impressed.",
