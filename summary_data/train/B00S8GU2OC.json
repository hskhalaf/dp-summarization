Now, when I connect the cable between my external drive and my windows pc, i get and error in the windows tray, 'usb device not recognised'. The cable appears in great condition, but is no longer working. I don't know why, maybe it didn't tolerate the constant bending. Also, not the cables fault, but transfer speed via my usb3.0 slot maxed out around 40MB/s. That is my fault for not buying a gen-2 cable, but this isn't even usb3.0 speed. My rating is based on the cable totally failing, not on the speed. Other other cable is working just fine, so maybe I got unlucky?",

One thing that's surprisingly overlooked and not detailed in descriptions is the cord. It's very thin, which means you can wind this tight and it'll bend easily. I've very pleased with that! So many cords are too thick and don't wrap well. This does. This is great. I've only had it for a few days so I can't comment on its durability, but it looks and functions very well.",

These cables are plenty durable (never had one fail, yet), but are noticeably slimmer. We have small ready-to-go travel kit that has chargers and cables. These are the only ones we take in that bag. And we use others around the house. Very happy with them.",

I am happy with my purchase as this cable is just exactly what I needed to charge my new phone on the go while driving.

Then cable failed without warning by shorting out near the cable-to-connector transition (cable had no visible damage prior to failure). Cable Matter's cable is noticeably thinner than other manufacturers, suggesting durability may be substandard. While Cable Matters did not specify its cable would meet a minimum number of bending cycles like some other manufacturers, the cable should've lasted longer in my opinion. Replaced with an AmazonBasics cable - seems thicker and more robust, but only time will tell. I recommend purchasing the AmazonBasics cable over this one.",

However, after receiving the cable I tested it with the CheckR app, which flunked it. I e-mailed CableMatters with the issue and they immediately responded, apologized for the old stock on Amazon, and sent me a new cable w/ tracking number the same day. The new cable came today, passed CheckR, and works perfectly for both charging and data transfer. The cable appears to be high quality as well. Will definitely keep these guys in mind for future purchases.",

Couldn't be happier with the cables or the customer service. These guys have won me over.",

Primarily purchased for a day of Poke\u0301mon Go, She spent about 6 hrs of use (she stayed plugged in the whole time) and the power bar was around 75% full by the end of the day. It's a great size, as she can still fit it in her back pocket. She also has informed me that it charges her phone (galaxy s6 edge) faster than a wall charger or car charger. Unfortunately I do not know how long it takes to top off as I plug it in at the end when we go to bed. All in all its a great product and she highly recommends it.",
