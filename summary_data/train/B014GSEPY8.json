      "text": "Most of my home speakers are Klipsch, but I needed a profile that would hug closer to the wall. I took a chance on ELAC based on reviews and the smaller footprint I needed. The sound is great, at least rivaling my Klipsch at an equivalent price. Be sure your receiver can handle 6 ohms speakers...most can. Some, like my Yamaha, have a menu switch to change from the default 8 ohm setting. One Year Update: They still sound great after one year. I can hear things in some tracks that I've missed with other speakers. I would buy another pair if I need to replace more Klipsch's.",
