This jack seems as well built as any consumer level jack in its capacity range. No care was given to the finish of the parts. That is, they're cut/stamped and welded with no finish grinding at all. splatters and funny angles. Ugly, but it works. Imagine its so heavy because they'd rather spend their money on shipping and over build it, than pay for qc and building it lighter. you get what you pay for.",

It's also a very low profile so if you want to raise a car that sits low to the ground this is the jack for you. I could have spent several hundred dollars on a jack but I didn't because this one does more for me and if I get 5-8 years out of it, I'll just buy another.",
