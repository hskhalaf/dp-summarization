I can adjust the opening so that the bread can let out some moisture but still be protected from too much drying. Also it expands and collapses, potentially saving room in the fridge. The cutting board inside is something I didn't think I would use but I do use it every day.",

It is the right height, width and depth for the breads from my bread machine. Right now I have 1/2 loaf of 9 grain and 1/2 loaf of banana bread in the box. I have no complaints and would recommend this bread keeper.",
