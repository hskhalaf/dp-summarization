      "text": "I was actually really surprised at the quality of this knife when I got it. But the sheath is terrible! They use a small bump in the plastic for retention instead of molding the plastic around the hand guard part of the knife. Problem is... that bump wears down after after few times in and out of the sheath and then it won't hold the knife. If you want a great knife for a great price and you don't care about the sheath... thus us a great purchase. But to buy this and then have to purchase a better sheath... well... why not just spring for the real thing and buy an Esee 3.",

Used this knife to baton an entire bundle of firewood into kindling and fuel wood, make some feather sticks, and then used a ferro rod firestarter on the spine of the knife. Made a great fire with this knife and ferro rod alone. Edge still very sharp after an afternoon of batoning wood. Only wear was paint rubbing off the high points on the blade. Sheath clip is junk, but easily removed. Going to get some leather to make a belt loop and a firestarter loop. After getting this knife, I don't think I need to get a more expensive knife. This one does it all.",

Since then I've had quality knives,cheap knives,name brand knives, and of course, name brand knives that were disappointing.... This knife is great. Especial for the price. The only reason it's not more expensive is BECAUSE it's NOT name brand. It has a beefy quality you can feel. I have a ESEE IZULA and I love it. The only difference between this knife and an izula; it's a fraction of the price. I would trust this knife in the woods any day and would buy it a million times over!",

The blade finish is well done, the scales fit perfectly, and the sheath is decent enough considering the price. 7cr17mov may not be a premium stainless but I've been using it for about a month now and it's holding up fine. I liked the knife so much I bought two more.",

The belt clip doesn't fit securely, so trying to draw the knife just results in the whole thing coming off the belt. I just took off the metal belt clip and wove paracord through the screwholes. Works fine now. Sheath itself retains the knife well.",

Have one as a car/truck knife and another in your pack. you won\u2019t regret it.",
