Head/neck is same size as earlier purchase but hole it fits in is at least 3/4\" too small. Spent an hour or so with box cutter making it work. Even worse, the finish is glossy-older one is flat grey. Scared the sh... out of the first two bucks to see it. NOT downwind , so scent was not the issue. They just ran off snorting as soon as they got within good visual range on two different setups. First shiny deer they ever saw, I guess.",

I buy a large one and a small 1 but as you can see turn hot very small you could easily put them outside in the yard for the holidays. I want to buy more to put them on my front door area. You won't be disappointed. If I could I would give them a 10 star.",

One buck-2.5 yr old came with feet of it challenging the decoy. Shortly after a 3.5 yr buck came running from across a cut bean field and circled downwind of the decoy. He took a good look at it and spooked. I can blame it on the decoy; the buck could\u2019ve been scared and didn\u2019t want the fight or could\u2019ve caught my wind slightly, not sure. Either way it does the job. It will def take some experience for proper placement during archery hunts tho",

The directions said you could place scent directly on the tail; but I put a zip tie on the support rod just under the decoy's belly. This let me hang a pad there and keep the decoy \"sent free\" for next year. Looking forward to bow season next year!",

      "text": "Works good at drawing in rutting bucks, The only negative thing i have to say is about he manufacturing, had to trim alot of material to get the head to move some what freely. I seen other reviews with the same problem. To put all the pieces in the body even with the instructed order is a joke, you may get them in but you will fight and work up a sweat getting them back out. For the price the manufacture could have done alot better job.",

      "text": "The decoy seems to be durable and well constructed. It is light weight and well made. It is very difficult to fit all of the parts back inside the torso, but they all fit back in the carrying bag with ease. It does have to be perfectly level for the head to move and give it the realistic look, achieving this can be very difficult in the hills here in mississippi. However even without the movement from a distance it should be good enough to fool a deer. Overall I like the decoy very much, now I just have to find a big buck to see how he feels about it :)",

You can then twitch the tail by flicking the line. If the head doesn't move try trimming the plastic around the head. I suppose you could try the fishing line with the head as well if you wanted.",
