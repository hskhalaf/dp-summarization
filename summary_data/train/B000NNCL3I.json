The paper feed sounds like a trap door opening, its very loud. The size is small, this will make a great companion to my laptop for travel. No page catcher. seems this would be and easy item to include. I like the fact that all the color ink is in 1 cartridge. I would not use the unit as my main every day printer, I think you need to spend a little more money and get a better unit.",

Streaky, substandard printing, even with Canon carts. In short, the hassle factor of owning this printer FAR exceeds the savings you might get. In simple terms, STAY AWAY!",

The print head eventually seems to go bad on all of them and they stop printing correctly. But this ip1800 is in a different league altogether. It's noisey, it doesn't feed paper straight, it burns through ink incredibly fast, and the print quality is not as good as the aformentioned. Don't waste your money.
