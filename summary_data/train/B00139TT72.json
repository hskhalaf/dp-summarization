As soon as I filled his bowl with a combo of this and the Iams he gobbled it up. The size of the kibble is great for him and he seems to be enjoying the flavor. He already has perked up and is more playful and loving than ever. I have one happy pup!",

Get this on Amazon Subscribe and save and never think about dog food again. I get one bag per month and manually order a separate bag once every 3-4 months.",

On top of that, he loves it. Love it!",

What I have noticed is there business is allot more controlled and any problems such as regurgitation which I had in past products have gone away.
