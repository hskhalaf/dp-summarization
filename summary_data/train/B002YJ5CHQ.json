After just one use, my type 2c/3a hair went nearly straight and felt like a weird straw/plastic hybrid. It has taken 3 washings, 2 deep conditionings, a protein treatment, and over a week for my hair to even begin bouncing back (I'm finally getting some loose waves) from this disaster. I do not recommend purchasing this product at this time. I had to toss the bottle because I was afraid they'd resale it if returned. I wouldn't dare allow this to ruin someone else's curls!

      "text": "This is a great conditioner. I've been using the Devacurl One Condition for a couple years now and it's been okay, but this one is much richer and leaves my hair silky and strong. The one problem? It's expensive, and like most conditioners, I have to use much more than a \"quarter-sized dollop\" to give my hair the moisture it needs. This bottle will last me about 2 weeks... and $40 a month is a lot to spend on conditioner. If you can afford it, though, go for it! It's worth it.",
