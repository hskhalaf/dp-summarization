I like that Invicta made the watch in both gloss gold and a brushed gold look, almost like a brass finish but gold tone (if that makes any sense). Definitely a stunning watch, classy and sophisticated yet not presumptuous! A perfect dress watch, but would work in almost any situation!",

EDIT: I finally re-sized the watch to the point where it fits my wrist just right, not too loose and not to tight but, the watch does get uncomfortable at times.",
