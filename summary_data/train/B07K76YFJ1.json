It looked beautiful for my baby's birthday party. I set everything up the day before. It took about half and hour to put the balloons together, using a fishing string and needle. Most stayed inflated for about 48 hrs. I have a backdrop stand for photography, so I taped the string and balloons to the poles. When it was time to bring it down, you can either go popping crazy, or stretch the bottom of each balloon to cut a small hole in it to deflate.",

I made the mistake of blowing up the balloons Friday morning for a Sunday afternoon shower. Most of the big and medium balloons did fine, but over half the small balloons shriveled. Fortunately I hadn\u2019t added them to the garland yet. So wait as long as you can for the small balloons. Overall it was very user friendly and really beautiful. JUNIBEL was a delight to work with as well. Would 100% buy from them again",

None of the balloons popped that day. However, none of the small white ballons would inflate. I tried blowing, using helium tank, and my balloon pump and the balloon would not inflate at all.",

It did come with gray balloons but I didn\u2019t use them since the theme were gold and white, I did buy few more white balloons from party city to add. But overall extremely satisfied and would buy again. And shipping was super fast as well.",

Definitely watch the video and follow Junibel\u2019s tips! Also, it is so easy to customize. I added some soft yellow balloons and paper flowers. It is a MUST to have a balloon pump which you can get the automatic one on amazon for $20. This is a lifesaver! Also suggest clear zip ties if you are mounting to staircase.

We blew up the balloons the night before, put them in extra large garbage bags to transport to our venue. Once at the event location it too us about 45 mins to assemble and another 15 minutes or so to hang up in the proper location. I will be purchasing again for future events.",

Many guests asked where I purchased this :) definitely worth investing in an electric pump. Assembly took me about an hour start to finish. The only problem I encountered was that the confetti balloons seemed a bit thin (especially compared to the other balloons) and a few popped, so I ended up not using these. I had about 10 balloons leftover. Be careful not to overfill the balloons and you\u2019ll be just fine. Would definitely order again!",
