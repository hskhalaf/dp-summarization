I've had them for nearly 4 years now, unfortunately the speaker fronts have been cracked by skis and such however, they still work like new. I've had to reconnect several different wires nearly 10 times over the years, but only due to carelessness tossing skis and other things into the back, and possibly due to a cheap wiring kit I purchased.",

This unit fills out the low end so that I can hear kick drums, bass instruments (string bass, electric bass guitar, etc.). I have not yet used the nylon straps and don't know if I will actually need to. I am considering adding a speaker grill for protection but have not yet decided which one to buy (or how to fasten it).",

You dont need much power to run these loud either! 200 watts RMS is plenty for the vented/ported model! I'm only running at 50 watts RMS! They flex quite a bit at 20hz and below!",

After I tuned them with the multimeter and made slight adjustment via the remote these speakers slam!

      "text": "What can u say really? Great setup for a noob. Had it installed professionally and wasn\u2019t expecting much. The bass dang near took my breath away ( literally) was not expecting the big booms and my bass knob is at minimum. Partied it with a pioneer mono block amp ( GM-D9701 ). Will be upgrading next year but for now my wife greets me with a welcome home text before I\u2019m in the house she can hear me come up the street lol.",

There was screws and random cardboard everywhere when i looked inside the box like it was messed with before I got it, but I kept it only because it all still worked and nothing was broken.",

    "description": "Style:Dual 10\" Subwoofer Enclosure + Amplifier| Pattern Name:Subwoofer\n\nMB210SP Amp and EnclosureView larger MB210SP Enclosure SIMPLE AND EASY BASS\nThe Magnum MB210SP is a simple and easy way to add bass to any vehicle system. This amplifier and enclosure package from the makers of MTX Audio is designed to offer excellent price and performance so that anyone can add bass to their music.\n\nENGINEERED FOR BASS\nThe MB210SP enclosure is a dual 10\" vented enclosure that is capable of handling up to 400 watts RMS power. The subwoofers themselves utilize a lightweight polypropylene dustcap and a large rubber surround to generate excellent SPL on any power. The large port on the front of the enclosure adds additional SPL especially when listening to music like Rap or Hip-Hop where a deeper more resonating bass sound is preferred. The enclosure is constructed using 5/8\" MDF (medium density fiberboard) which means it is designed to handle excessive bass with no fear of failure.\n\nPOWER INCLUDED\nOne of the best things about the MB210SP is that it includes an amplifier that is designed specifically for the enclosure. Two advantages, you don't need to worry about finding an amplifier to use with it and you don't have to worry about over or under driving the subwoofers because the amplifier is made specifically for it. All you need is some speaker wire and an amp kit and you are ready to go.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n * Dual 10\" Vented Enclosure\n * 1200W Max Power, 800W Peak Power, 400W RMS Power\n * Included Amplifier\n * Embroidered Magnum Logo\n * Large Rubber Subwoofer Surrounds\n * Tuned for High Output",
