I recently had to stop taking it due to a low iodine diet prior to radiation, but when that's all over, I plan on starting it again! I highly recommend.",

Still losing a bunch in the shower and doesn't seem any thicker. Maybe in time this will change... Update... it's been a couple more months now. My hair is slightly thicker but hasn't grown any faster. My nails still break easily. Some people have trouble with breakouts when taking biotin but I did not with this product.",

My hair is growing back at the rate of 1/2 inch a month which is about normal for me and I am not losing anymore hair. I have never taken extra Biotin but my hairdresser told me I needed to take 10,000 mcg a day to see results. Some days I only take 5,000 mcg because I forget to take it. Overall I am satisfied with the product.",
