Bright and colorful levels, fantastically cute and well designed characters, and engaging fun gameplay make this a must have for any XBox owner. The framerate on the XBox One X is smooth and locked at 60FPS. And after all that, the message of the game, one of perseverance, positive action, and just plain fun is something that we need a lot more of in this world. I got 2, one for us and one for gifting this Christmas. I have a feeling, I am going to need a couple more copies. Do yourself and your family a favor and give this game a try, you won't be disappointed.",

It is very similar to early 3D platformers like Banjo Kazooie and Super Mario 64 and is performs just as well. It follows Lucky, a fox who has dreamed about becoming a hero, as he accidently gets sucked into a book and needs to stop a family of cats from destroying it. The art style and characters are cute and cartoony and the gameplay is easy, so this is game is great for the whole family. The mailing process was great and the game is a lot of fun.",

Compared to Ratchet and Clank, or Jak & Daxter, or really any AAA platformer, this game just doesn't deliver. It's confusing in layout, derivative in design, and just doesn't try hard enough. The camera stinks, too. Buy this and maybe your kids will like it, but if they've played other better platformers, then they will try it and drop it pretty quickly in my opinion.",

The story is okay nothing too exciting but what can you expect from a game geared towards kids. Don't expect a triple \"A\" narrative with intricate character development. The story is cute to say the least. The controls are easy for a child to understand and super quick to pick up. Gameplay is okay you're standard platformer formula. Not complaining as I gave a 5 star rating. Mainly because nephew loved and since he was the intended audience I'd be wrong to not give that rating.",
