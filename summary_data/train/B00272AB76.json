Makes washing the dog much easier and then washing down the tub afterwards too.",

The adapter however was not cracked, but still hemorrhaged water even on pressures as low as a trickle. The nozzle's ring is very thin and made of the same smooth plastic so it is genuinely impossible to adjust once you've begun washing your soapy, greasy, dirty, wiggling dog.",

No major concern just a drizzle. Again. You should probably still buy this if you like to keep dogs clean. Or humans",

There are settings on the nozzle too that make it suitable for a dog with hair (thin) or with a double coat (very thick). The hose comes with an adapter so you can easy snap on the hose for a puppy bath and then unplug it and take a shower yourself. Love the product!",

I used this sprayer tonight and it saturated my pet\u2019s fur with water almost instantly with impressive water pressure. Shampoo lather was quick and the rinse seemed very comprehensive, allowing for a complete (and clean) rinse of both shampoo and conditioner. I highly recommend this sprayer for pet owners looking for a home solution for pet baths.",

There was a pinhole leak where the head attaches to the cord but he was able to fix that fairly easily. After the bath my husband exclaimed \"I can't imaging having a dog and not having this now that I've tried it!\" High praise indeed. Less hassle, less mess, and our dog handled it better not being forced to move around in the tub!!",
