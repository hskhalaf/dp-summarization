My friend has the same product and the surface is completely flat with more cushion It is very uncomfortable to step on and you can easily lose your balance . I have tried to get in contact with the manufacture but no response . I\u2019m not sure if this is the original or a knock off...either way I am returning it. Hopefully the manufacture will get in contact with me if so I will update this review until then I give it a thumbs down!!!",

I know it's important to watch your step but at times when your leaping from one foot to the other, you might step on the edge and you need a step that will not move. Maybe that's just me.

So I bought this step bench out of frustration with the smaller step bench. This was a great investment, since I am in a state that has an extended COVID home quarantine. The quality is solid, strong, the steps lock in place, the tread is smooth, provides good grip. I'm happy with this purchase.",

So, I wear cushioned sneakers inside. A little disappointed.",

This step deck is by far superior to any of the others I tried! Initially I didn't want to fork over so much moolah for a deck, but now that I have, I wish I would have bought it sooner! It's the same one used in gyms. Loving it! If you are debating on other ones because of price, just save yourself some trouble and returns and buy this one. Happy stepping!",
