I replaced my stock PC fan today with the Noctua and all I hear is nothing - sweet silence. Had to remove the brown corner pads on one half to fit the snap in Dell design but easily done. If you're a geek like me, check out the Noctua website. You'll get a great background in understanding how and why their fans are so quiet. Little more money - a lot more quiet. Very Pleased !",

It generally runs at about medium speed (1800 rpm), but my making a special effort to load up my system, I can get it step up to 2200 rpm- and it's still silent. In fact, it's so quiet (compared to my old Cooler Master) that I got out a flashlight and crawled under the desk to make sure it was actually running!",

And things run the risk of looking gimmicky, but then you read the reviews and it seems that the construction detail actually does convert to performance. So, I get it now. I'll never place one where it can be seen. But I'll try to hide as many as I can.",

I don't think it's just the rubber mounting attachments that are on the fan, but the fan itself is just really quiet. I am using 2 of them for LEDS and neither one is housed in any enclosure that would dampen the sound. They are both open, visible and super quiet. Highly recommended!",

The mounting options that come with this fan are impressive for the flexibility they allow - good move by the manufacturer. I'm very satisfied!

I added these to my Rosewill LSV-4412 Hot swap case because the fans included with that case were sub-par. However, these fans brought my case temps down ~5C and they don't add any noticeable noise to my server case. Highly recommend Noctua to anyone who wants professional fans that work great...despite the color",

I would also bump up the \"value\" for the money from 3 to 4 stars if they did include one or two more silicone mounting pegs.

      "text": "Just a great set of fans that really do the job. PWM fans can be controlled with the motherboard and have near silent operation at maximum power. The Fans are just built great and keep the system more than cool. I would highly recommend them. They come with splitters so you can add more than one of these to one fan header. Just be aware the splitter only measures the RPM of one fan and inputs voltage into both.",
