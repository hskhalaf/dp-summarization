      "text": "I've used multiple grinders so far. Including a manual one (as a backup). Good espresso = fresh beans + precise grind + precise portion. While you can always measure beans before grinding every other electric grinder has a simple option to set the timer. I was shocked to realize that 2x expensive Breville doesn't provide this option. Noise level is high (not a deal-breaker though). The grinder is quite bulky (I can live with that). But not having a timer is a bummer",

We had set it at 15 to get an acceptable grind for espresso and it would not grind at all below ten on the scale (0-5 is the listed espresso range). I don't buy extended warranties because I don't like to deal with BS trying to get support. Instead I buy products I expect to last and write reviews when they don't. Breville, you let me down.",

For some reason it\u2019s messier than my other grinder but for the price it\u2019s a great setup. Pretty quiet. One gripe is the bean hopper is small, maybe 8 ounces of beans will fit. My other machine holds at least 12 but it\u2019s slightly taller.",

Perfect for me because I don't want a digital screen and bells and whistles, its stupid unless you have a coffee shop You just push to start and push to stop.",

This means, every morning when I wake up and grind my beans fresh, I\u2019m getting old stale coffee. In order to clear the whole thing out you have to remove the bottom burner and poke around in there and then tap it upside down. This is impractical and not worth the money. Old: So far so good.
