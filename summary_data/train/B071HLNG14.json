If you cut it a quarter inch oversized you'd kill even that little bit of light leakage. It's literally cave spelunking dark. Huge quality of life improvement for anyone that works the night shift.",

I\u2019m not 100% on this but the window was fine before it and it\u2019s not even a window that can open or close and get damaged that way.

By accident we discovered that our baby needed a pitch black room to sleep during the day and this was the solution. A little dodgy to put up if you\u2019re trying to make the edges perfectly nice, and it does shift slightly over time after application, but I would do it again if it meant 2-3x\u2019s as long for naps.

Would recommend if you are looking for complete black out! As for durability, I have only had it on for a few days and so I can\u2019t speak for it as much. It does seem to peel off easily as they mention so I added a small border of black tape to it which helped cover the imperfections in cutting it down to size where it allowed light to come through. Definitely would purchase again!",

It also seem to be peeling a little at the edges, but that is probably because the windows get exposed to the sun several hours a day. A good workaround would be to cover it completely with those large/wide shipping tapes, after the film is applied properly. This will prevent the peeling on the edges over time, and it'll help minimize the rubbery smell",

However, you have to be precise and I would suggest being very generous with amount of paper going over your edges of the window (you can always just use an exacto knife on the edges once the paper is placed). Anyway, I have no complaints and I am happy with how my windows turned out. I would definitely recommend this if you need more of a blackout than curtains can provide.",
