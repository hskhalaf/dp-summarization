However, I find it necessary to remove the cover when working at night (in the dark). You cannot see the keyboard light through this cover. This cover will also make the closing of the laptop a bit odd. Initially, I noticed that I could not close the MacBook all the way but after a while, it is no longer an issue.",

Also, I like that it's thin. My keyboard cover for my old (2011) macbook was really thick, which was okay since that one had really loud keys and the cover softened the noise. But I never really liked how thick it was. Since the new macbook doesn't have loud keys it's really not necessary to have a thick keyboard cover. Great product! Definitely recommend.",

This cover does its job, but at a cost- it becomes difficult to type. The silicon grips your fingers so you cannot slide your fingers on the keys like you might do normally touch typing. For this reason, i will not be using this product, only in situations where it is likely crumbs will be getting on the laptop ( eating while working, on a airplane eating snacks, etc) . I really dont see how this could be practical in a day to day setting.",

It has a nice soft feel and supplements the feeling of the original keyboard very well. I had originally hoped it would dull or dampen the sound of the keys on my Mac and it did! That\u2019s not an advertised feature just a bonus imo. The keyboard cover is remarkably good at staying in place and only comes off when turned to ridiculous angles. All in all it\u2019s exactly what I wanted.",
