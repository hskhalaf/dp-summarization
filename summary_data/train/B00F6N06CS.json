Off of the track we do have to help him navigate it because he doesn't understand turning. But on the track he goes all by himself! The best part is, I haven't had to charge it since Christmas! That is over a month now that it's run on the same charge. Great price for a really great product. Very satisfied!",

We charged it for 18 hrs on Christmas day, its four days later and we haven't had to charge it since and the kids play with this throughout the day, even took it outside. The tires could be made a tad better. Other than that two thumbs up.",

I'm glad that there is the option to extend the tracks by purchasing additional track pieces. The sounds that Thomas makes totally delight my son. He just loves pressing the button over and over again. He even dances to one of the songs. This will bring smiles to any child. Installation was a breeze. The quality is great.",

He is an average sized boy and he fits perfectly on the train. I think he will probably be able to ride this for at least another year.

      "text": "I got this for my 13 month old son. He loves it. He figured out how to keep it going by pressing the button on the handle bar. If you show your kid enough, I'm sure they'll be able to figure it out. Before he did though, we were getting dizzy pushing the button for him and going around in circles. I don't know if it's just my son, but I don't think this will keep your kid's attention occupied for that long. I think maybe 5 min tops. Then he's off playing with something else.",

The track in nice because he doesn't yet understand how to steer but soon he will outgrow the need for the track so it's a nice option that's it works on and off the track. Ours came without the sound box but it was easy to contact Fisher Price and have then send it to us. The only thing I would say bad is that it's pretty loud and the child has to keep the bottom held down to move which keeps the from crashing obviously but can be confusing for them when on the track.",

Best of all, this is something that is fun and appropriate for a good couple of years. If you're thinking about this as a gift for a little one, DO IT! You will be a hero.",

I was so nervous because I assumed (not sure why) that the battery would be a quick charge (like 8 hours), but then noticed that it's advertised to charge for 18 hours, and his bday party was that next morning! But to anyone facing the same, don't worry. After charging for 9-10 hours, I tested it, and it worked! Even lasted 2 weeks!! I ordered 2 sets of the extra tracks to give him a huge oval. He loves it!!!",

I'm sure that when he figures that out, he will spend all day on it. The train has 5 or 6 little recorded sounds.
