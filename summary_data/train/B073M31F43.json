      "text": "A lot of people have been complaining about the 20th anniversary mini Tamagotchis, but honestly, I love them. This is my first one, and I immediately ordered another after playing with it. As an adult, taking care of a full Tamagotchi is a bit much. This one is definitely more my speed these days. Functionality includes: feeding (meal & snack), cleaning, taking care of it when it's sick, and turning on & off its light when it goes to sleep. You can also toggle the sound as well. I think it's a really fun remake of the original, and worth the money.",

It can't be that hard to re release the original so why not do that?",

It won't even do that. Don't waste your money.",

You can basically only feed it and pick up its poop. There are no games. It is basically a pretty watch that you occasionally have to feed and look after. Do not get. Ps: I just took the battery out of it and just revived my old V1 connection and that made this buy someone worth it.",

The owner has very few options as to how to care for the tomagotchi making the whole thing somewhat of a gimmick and very bleak.",

For those who remember, there were was to play with and discipline your Tamagotchi. I just feel like this added to the interest of owning one. This newer version is seriously missing out on that factor by not having the capability to do such. If they remade it again with the capability of play and discipline I would definitely buy it again to give it a try.",
