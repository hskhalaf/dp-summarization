So you have the Amazon box, then inside that box is another box, which is EXTREMELY difficult to open because it is glued on all sides. No pull tab, no tape you can cut. I am a 4'11 130 lb lady, and to get 5 of these opened and stored is very tedious, I wish they would just go back to one box, or make the second inner box easier to open.",

Even better, I know that this has to be safer for our kitty to use than the dusty af litter that we were using before. Bonus points: the clumps stay together, and her box never smells anymore!!!",

This cat litter worked perfectly to harden the old paint so that I could properly dispose of it. Cat litter works the same way as paint hardener products, but is more economical in price. To harden the paint properly do the following: 1. Add equal amount of cat litter to the paint. 2. Stir the cat litter in well. 3. Allow it to absorb the paint and harden, preferably outside in the sunlight. With one 40 pound bag of cat litter, I was able to harden 22 gallon cans of paint.",

      "text": "We tend to only use Dr. Elsey's Cat Litter and Arm & Hammer Clump & Seal Platinum Litter. After comparing the two, there are certainly some differences. For starters, we find that both Dr. Elsey's Dr. Elsey's and Arm & Hammer do a great job in clumping. However, cat litter tracks significantly less with Dr. Elsey's than Arm & Hammer's. The only trade-off between the two is that Arm & Hammer definitely has the leg-up in the smell department. But we have found that if you use Nature's Miracle Just for Cats Odor Destroyer Litter Powderyou can have the best of both worlds!",

The clay granules are larger in Dr. Elsey's, so now I have to wait longer to sift out the feces and urine clumps for the good litter granules to sift through the lifter. Like any litter, the urine clumps need time to set up. Overall, not a bad litter and no better or worse than Tidy Cats, but do not label as less tracking when it tracks as badly or more than other clay litters.",
