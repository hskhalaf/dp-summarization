Results are perfect and he was particular about it being even everywhere he placed the pieces. I'm not quite sure how I feel about the microwave there but it gave me so much room on my counters as well as putting my crockpots in the cabinets. I live in an apartment and my dining area is small. The photo gives an idea of the room it takes and how much is still left on the ends. Love this cart!!!!!!",

I admit, I was cursing all along the way while assembling, but I have to say, it's a beautiful cabinet! It's very sturdy and it holds a lot. The wheels roll very smoothly. It's everything I was looking for in a kitchen cart/island. Just take deep breaths, and a few breaks, maybe a glass or 2 of wine while assembling, but, to me, it was worth it.",

Prior to adjusting, the hinge position put a small amount of tension on the door frame, which was stronger than the door closer magnets could handle. Each time we rolled the cart, the doors would pop open. All in all, it's an attractive, functional cart for a small amount of money.",

      "text": "This was really difficult to put together. (I had to hire a mechanic) But it was worth it! This is a lovely piece of furniture and extremely useful. You can store small items in the 2 drawers and you can fit a lot of larger items beneath in the storage space below the drawers. It is pretty good quality and sturdy. I put a microwave and a coffee maker on top and it still has room for cups. I recommend this one.",
