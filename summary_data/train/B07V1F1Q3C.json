      "text": "This sink is beautiful. I have a small bathroom. I had to make the cabinet and counter top to maximize space and they don't make stock cabinets and counter tops for what I needed. I also needed a smaller sink. The ones I was finding in the store were a bit large; 15 x 15. I went on line and found this. Not only was the price right, but it really exceeded my expectations when it arrived. I had no problem installing the sink. It all came together and really makes the bathroom.",

      "text": "Note bowl is 12.5\" diameter, not 13. Nice smooth porcelain finish, lip of bowl is a little thinner than expected, but should be durable enough. Drain hole easily fits standard pop-up assy. Flat base sits directly on counter, but needs minor sanding to remove glaze splatters & debris before installing.",
