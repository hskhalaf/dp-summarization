      "text": "Want to trim a few branches ? Half a dozen? Then this is great. Really great. Easy to use, not too heavy. Quick jobs 20 minutes - great. If you want to do more, then this is not the right tool. This will not cut for an hour, probably not 30 minutes. I cut about eight branches big as my arm. It was done. I am \"OK\" with that. Far less hassle than cranking a gas chain saw. Convenient. There are times when this is the right tool. If it had a stronger battery I would have given it a FIVE STAR. I definitely have more powerful lithium battery tools. Perfect for hitting my palm tree now and then.",

All work off the same batter 24V lithium battery which is very convenient. I will likely buy another 24v battery in the future and possibly the chainsaw. However the chainsaw is 40V. Although this product is made in China, it has worked very well for me. Easy to assemble and received quickly. Too bad this is not a made in the USA company.",

A 3 hour job took me 15 minutes, which left me hours to go on the battery life. I decided to keep cutting to see how long the battery would last - and it turned out a lot longer than me.
