Other reviews said the weave was not as tight and too much light came through. I think it's just perfect, and lights up the room in a very homey way when it's the only light on.",

It is also a loose weave so it allows a lot of light to get through the burlap. The price compared to other shades I look at is very reasonable. It was packed well and is very sturdy. I would highly recommend this product to anyone needing a good quality shade at a competitive price.",
