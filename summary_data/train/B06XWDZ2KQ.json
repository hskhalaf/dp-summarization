Unfortunately I didn\u2019t use it as much during the winter so the battery went dead. Anyway, it was easy to use, the attachments (clamps) were small enough to fit down into the battery area and were hefty enough to grab the battery terminals. I set it up waited for 30 minutes or so and bada bing bada boom she started right up. I\u2019m very happy so far with the charger and glad people gave good reviews so I\u2019ll add mine to it. Thank you",

It seems there is a creep of bad descriptions on Amazon these days. I switched to Amazon a couple of years ago because of my past concern with this at eBay.

If you need to just float charge a car that is stored for a while, this should do the job as well. It's smaller than I expected, but well made.",
