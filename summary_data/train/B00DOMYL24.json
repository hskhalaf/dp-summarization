As a result, this 6-outlet power strip can turn quickly into a three outlet strip, or four if you are lucky (see picture).",

Either way, they work as intended. Please note that the outlets are not designed to swivel themselves...they only rotate to allow opening/closing. You cannot adjust the prong direction to account for oddly shaped plugs. There is a blue light that indicates whether the surge protector is on/off. It is bright but not too intense that it becomes obnoxious or annoying.",

      "text": "I like the extension chord as it mainly meets my needs. As described, it's 6 feet long, it has the locking outlets, and it is flat. The one thing the ad doesn't mention is that although the chord is flat, the chord angles to the right, which may be issue depending on your application. In my case I needed the chord to angle left, (or down) so that I could have a cleaner look. Not a major issue in the greater scheme of things, but it would have been nice to have the information, and/or to have the option to select the return angel.",

After just over a year of use, one of the sockets failed when I inserted a plug slightly crooked. This is just a symptom of its overall inexpensive design. The supposed safety caps that twist to cover the outlets don't lock into place, as noted by another reviewer. The cord is a relatively stiff PVC, but is functional enough. The blue light when it has power is annoying, as noted by a different reviewer, but not intolerably so in the day. Overall, if you need an inexpensive, probably not very good at surge protection, power strip, then this is for you!",

It is a lapse on my part not to check the voltage rating thinking most of these items are on auto voltage rating (110V~240V / 50~60Hz). Upon plugging mine \"boom\"! Gone not even in 60 seconds. I can still probably use it replacing the the fuse inside but would not bother considering the purchase price. Product description / specification should at least mention the power specs. Probably a good product but future buyers please take note before clicking \"Order\".",
