The coverage is great, it can be built upon for days that your face hates you. It doesn't break me out more. It covers up the redness. It goes on smoothly. While it doesn't come off just by looking at something it will rub off a smidge. Nothing like NARS (my god!) but it does have a bit of rub off so keep that in mind when trying on clothes. Overall this is the best foundation I've found that matches my pale self, gives good coverage and doesn't look cakey.",
