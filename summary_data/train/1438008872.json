I feel this book shows you good vocabulary in different contexts to analyze the correct meaning, it has new vocabulary for preparing a good writing text, I wouldn\u2019t say this works as a training for reading, because the examples are not according with the complexity of TOEFL. I feel TOEFL reading has an academic vocabulary which I can\u2019t find completely in this book.",

However, as a student, don't expect to read this book in a week or two and have memorized all words. It takes a lot of practice and repetition to remember and use these words naturally.",
