      "verdict": "The Skechers GOmeb Speed 3 is lightweight and offers a little cushioning, which is good for neutral runners. Some of the materials used are just the same as the previous versions, yet this one was able to provide a better running performance. Although there were downsides like its high price and its stiffness, many testers found the features of this shoe worth the cost.",
      "pros": [
        "The newer DuPont Delrin stability plate provides rigidity to the mid-foot",
        "The construction is kept simple, with no added material, according to many testers",
        "Most testers noted that the forefoot is a little wider than the previous versions, making it great for many types of feet",
        "The foot is pinned closer to the mid-sole, which provide a snappier feel and an enhanced push off",
        "Great for speed works and track sessions",
        "An improved tongue consists of a thin fabric and thin foam for better comfort",
        "Roomier upfront yet snug fit is felt around the middle section, according to testers"

      "cons": [
        "Some runners were hesitant to buy it because of its slightly expensive price",
        "Some runners found it a little too stiff",

Qualitywise they were good and i do feel a bit faster in them, but can't run sustained distances.",

    "description": "The next generation of Skechers' Meb's signature racing shoe is better than ever: A sleek synthetic and mesh upper combined with a high impact shock absorbing midsole that utilises Dupont Delrin stability material Resalyte\u2122 material fuses to a running shoe with minimal weight and maximal shock absorption. Upper Coming with a nearly seamless GOknit upper, the Go Meb Speed 3 features an improved fit and comfort with a wider forefoot for a more natural feel, comfortability and breathability as well as an aesthetic, colourful knit-in look whilst hotmelt synthetic overlay details help keeping the foot stable and secure. While the seamless interior is made of microfibre lining that maximises comfort, the laces come with nearly weightless reinforced eyelets which overall contributes to the shoe's ultimate lightweight. Midsole Radically lightweight with just enough integrated, enhanced Resalyte\u2122 midsole cushioning to protect on practically any surface the Go Meb Speed 3 features a proprietary lightweight injection-molded compound with memory retention that helps absorb impact and protect the foot from additional impact during the initial heel contact phase and enhanced response during the toe off whilst bringing you closer to a barefoot experience and providing sufficient impact protection at the same time. The incorporated mid-foot M-Strike Technology promotes a fluid transition and efficiency in each stride while the applied Dupont Delrin material Stability Plate in the mid foot provides support and security when out on the run while keeping weight to a minimum. Outsole The Go Meb Speed 3 comes with independent circular GOimpulse sensors that offer flexibility and feedback for a more responsive and optimised running experience as well as a smoother transition through the gait cycle. Impulse sensors isolate points of contact to deliver sensory feedback.",
