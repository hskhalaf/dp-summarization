Until I just got my second order opened it up and tasted it with my husband...disgusting. Not the same packaging as before, not the same color as before and certainly not the same taste as before. Not sure what happened here. It was almost like we tasted chemicals",

It's more reminiscent of peanut butter than, say, almond butter but it has a unique and sophisticated sunflower/chia/pumpkin seed flavor that makes it much more exciting. This would be great on any kind of bread, in a smoothie or in baked goods and would make an excellent peanut butter and jelly sandwich for a more precocious (or allergy prone) child. DELICIOUS.",

Next, I put it in the refrigerator hoping to solidify it some...no luck. I will say with the soupy consistency, and the dark green pea color it was quite unappetizing to look at.
