For nearly 2 years I have struggled with where to put items that I was so accustomed to having handy in my old Explorer. In the Subaru access to the console is located under my elbow and is a struggle to open. The glove box is totally unreachable. These holders work for a book, call phone, hand cream or sanitizer, a small box of tissues, gloves. LOVE them!!",

Sometimes it could be almost impossible to reach for it while driving. This gap filler fits between the gap perfectly. It doesn't take any space of the seating side so it doesn't decrease sitting comfort. now I can easily put my phone and handy tools inside.",
