      "text": "I have owned these for over 10 years and they are still some of the best IEMs that I have. The only downside is the wires will wear so you have to buy new cables. The cables are typically cheap and there are lots of third-party options that go amazing with these. For the price, these IEMs are great for a first pair and eventually, you can upgrade to the $1000+ range once you can afford them. These outperform a lot of what there is on the market.",

This is the third pair of UE IEM's I've used and all have shorted out to one ear or both. If I bend the cable a little the volume goes way up, then does way down when the cable flexes back. Crappy construction going on at UE, and I do not suggest this brand. On the bright side, these have removable cables and it's easy enough to get better replacements.",

I've had to replace the audio cable just once, but since these are built to detach, I didn't have to throw the whole thing out. Word of note: these work best with an audio amplifier - audio amps built into most phones and other portables just don't have the juice to drive these 100%. And get the comply foam tips (I get the wax guard version) - they're fantastic.",

These are not \"lean\"... simply *neutral*. - The cable feels insubstantial and cheap. I only use them in my office, and so far so good, but they do not feel particularly robust for the outdoors.",

They sounded pretty amazing for $40 headphones. They provided a lot more bass than the Triple-Fi's do, but the clarity the Triple-Fis give completely destroy the CX500s.

I expect their new line, highlighted by the high-end UE 900 earbuds, are similarly in quality. The latter set has new technology including quad-armature design, where as the triplefi 10's only have 3 speakers.

I found if you store them in an air-tight container with some silica packets or similar anti-moisture thingies from medicine bottles, it\u2019ll keep the ear stink away. Update: the left ear stopped working for whatever reason and I received a refund rather than a replacement because they were no longer being made.

Mids, on the other hand, are not the best with the TripleFi 10's. They are too recessed for my liking in indie and folk songs. Build quality is very sturdy for the wire and also the actual housing.

I hear every single instrument, every single background sound , EVERYTHING IS CLEAR like never before! it's like what i was doing before was listening to my music from behind a thick wall. at the beginning i was thinking of going with BOSE IE2 (read many positive reviews about it) but when I saw amazon's 58% offer on those I thought that spending extra 68 bucks to get luxurious $400-worthy earbuds may be a good idea, and it was the right decision. I really LOVE those great earbuds and strongly recommend them to any music lover who want to rediscover the sweetness of his/her music.",

      "text": "I would not have bought it without Black Friday sale. I am sure the earphones cost their $300 but I was not going to pay so much for them. Now I can say that the sound is the best among all in-ear headsets that I have heard. That's not surprising because they all were below $100. The sound is not quite armature-like, it's more like produced by dynamic driver earphones. Noise isolation is quite good - enough for noisy Russian subway. The fit is a little strange - they stick out of your ears for about 2cm. It's much more convenient to change right and left one with each other and wear them this way.",

However, the foam tips are excellent. They take a while to master and fit properly, and with the cable over your ear, they are not the most attractive earphone. However, with the foam tips on, the sound is excellent!! Massive bass when you turn the volume up, yet no one around can hear your music. I paid $194 for them, and would not pay a cent more. But have not regretted my purchase. Note, $20 for 2 pairs of foam tips if you want to buy extras.",

These headphones have great fidelity and fit very snug in the ear. I recommend getting Comply wax-guard foam tips to protect the headphones from getting waxed, as it will happen to these if you do not use wax-guards. They hold up very well.
