My 6 year old likes to make the daily activity challenge and even competes for steps through the app with family. It gives a little firework notification when you meet 60 minutes of daily activity. It motivates her to keep active and helps give an idea of if we are being to lazy or not throughout the day. It doesn\u2019t automatically sync with my phone but it\u2019s easy to just push the button and sync that way.",

I told her I wanted to return it . She said she would rather wear it on her wrist and not be able to do anything with it then struggle to take it off. ( no exaggeration from me or her)",
