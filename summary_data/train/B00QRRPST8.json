I chose this one because it appeared to have a softer cover than those described as covered in \"canvas\", a firm but comfortable feel, and an 8\" thickness so that guests sleeping on it would feel like they were in a bed, not on a couch. All of these things are very true about the Artiva 8\" futon mattress. I am 100% thrilled with this mattress; and, in fact, I bought two.",

It\u2019s made with good quality material and is much more comfortable than any other futon mattresses I\u2019ve had to sleep on before.

Maybe this one got through the inspectors, I don't know but it was just horrible.",

The tacking to pull it in, is left rather unfinished on the underside, that without a cover would be very alluring to a cat. No idea how it will hold up over time as I've just received it today",
