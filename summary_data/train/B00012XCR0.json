      "text": "I was tired of feeding my generic, digital calipers batteries and so the hunt began for an analogue (Dial) caliper. They say a picture is worth a 1000 words and so I will keep this review short and upload lots of photos instead. The weight feels good in hand. Needed no calibration out of the box but recalibration takes 2 seconds. The locking feature is nice for repeat measurements. Dial reads out in 1/16ths of an inch with hash marks every 32nd and 64th in between. Max measurement is 6 1/4\". OAL is 9 7/64\" collapsed. Very happy with this purchase and I expect it will be a part of my wood shop for a long time to come.",

It has good heft and feels sturdy, but naturally wouldn\u2019t take kindly to droppage. The gears mesh well and don\u2019t skip, and it reliably returns to zero. It aligns correctly with a quality ruler. The dial run along the stick could be smoother. This may be a function of lubrication. In any event, it does not appear to affect accuracy. The dial markings are clear and crisp. I really don\u2019t see anything not to like about it. First unit arrived in cracked case, and Amazon replaced it immediately.",

Also, batteries have a way of going bad when needed, so it's nice to have one that, though not quite as accurate, is reliable and doesn't keep shutting off.",

Accuracy is superb: once adjusted to zero, the tool returns to it exactly every time. My only quibble is that the second scale on the tool is marked in tenths of an inch.

If actual thousandths was wanted, the company should swap the locations of the fractional and decimal scales (which would be a reasonable thing to do regardless, considering the decimal scale has greater accuracy than the fractional 1/64ths). Swapping the scale locations would give the caliper accuracy to .001 instead of a mere .01(5). Still, not bad for the price.",
