      "text": "That's important, if you plan on giving your yoga straps a regular, vigorous workout. Another plus for, as a person who appreciates minimalism and simplicity, is the plain white color. I don't go for all the bright colors of many similar products. Who are we trying to impress? Yoga is for practice, not for external appearances, and as such, external distractions such as focusing on popular styles, are in opposition to the philosophy behind yoga's practice, which is about getting beyond identification with the changing, impermanent nature of such externals. These are simply functional and well made. For the practice of authentic yoga, that is all that should be required.",

I've tested them out plenty. Great product, highly recommended!",
