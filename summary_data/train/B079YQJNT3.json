The hot tub is 34\" high and with it on its side, it is very easy to go through a 36\" gate opening. Setup is easy if you follow the instructions. I am using the 15 amp GFCI Cord and will change it to the 40 Amp 240 Volts Service before Winter. I called Strong Spas several times before my purchase to verify dimensions, features, and warranty information. Their customer service is awesome. I am very pleased with the quality and it looks great.",

Due to code requirements, working with outside outlets needs a modification - so GFI cords are not plugged into GFI outlets. Also, the panels are not easy to remove and re-install; but with a little patience and strength, the panels can be reinstalled. The is sue we currently have is that one of the jets in the leg area of the recliner position does not work properly. Despite adjusting the water flow pressure, and turning the jet on & off, the water does not flow through the jet. Overall, for the price and the performance we have seen so far, we would buy it again.",

    "description": "Step into the Essential Hot Tubs Adelaide and step into your own personal oasis. Our Adelaide model features 30 stainless steel, fully adjustable jets distributed among the ergonomic seating for up to six. Powered by an energy efficient two-speed, 2 Peak HP pump, the Adelaide delivers the power to melt away stress and leave your muscles feeling soothed and refreshed. Whether your place is in the Lounger or one of two Captain\u2019s Chairs, you can customize your experience in the Adelaide from a soothing soak to a full hydrotherapy massage. The choice is at your fingertips in the state of the art command center with digital, backlit display. With the addition of fabulous amenities like 3 headrests, 2 LED lit water columns and a convenient built-in ice bucket with a lid and tray, the Adelaide has everything. Plug into any standard 120V/15A household outlet and you\u2019re ready to entertain. You also have the option to convert to a 240V electrical unit allowing your heater to perform at its maximum on the coldest days, which we recommend having professionally installed by an electrician. The finishing touch to the Adelaide by Essential Hot Tubs is its custom designed cabinet that houses an all-season, stainless steel Balboa heater, and the heavy-duty insulated cover that comes standard. You\u2019ll be ready to slip into relaxation and comfort anytime, all year long. This product is delivered using a curbside delivery service.",
