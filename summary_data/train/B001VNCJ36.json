We just bought another pair, so we'd have a total of four. The first pair has held up so well over the past five years that it's almost impossible to tell which chairs are the new ones and which are the old ones, when sitting side-by-side.

Wood ones just don't hold a candle to these and wood chairs require restaining every other year plus the rot and eventual stripping of screws and the inevitable splinter.

So far these chairs have held up well in the rain and in the summer heat, They were built really well, a breeze to put together and feel sturdy for a big 300 pound guy like me.

The main thing I disliked was the sitting position was too upright to make it relaxing and comfortable to sit for more than a few minutes. I had to return it and unfortunately pay for the return shipping. I wouldn't recommend and won't buy furniture online where I can't try before I buy.",

      "text": "We bought two of these chairs in a bright blue and we think they're beautiful. They seem to be sturdy and they fold up nicely. The only downside is that they are not very comfortable. The backs are flats. After sitting a while, our back started hurting. We eventually bought some upholstered covers and all is fine with the comfort, but now you can't see the the nice chairs. We recently bought the Polywood classic oversized adirondack with curved back and it is much more comfortable with the same pluses as these. If we were to do it over, we'd have bought all three chairs with curved backs.",
