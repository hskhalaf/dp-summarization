It's lightweight but sturdy and very easy to clean. Large enough but not so large that it takes up a lot of room to store. I can just put it in the dishwasher if I want but I usually hand wash because it's so easy to clean. I really hated getting out my Cuisinart for chopping an onion so I usually just bought them already chopped rather than to do that. This little gadget is cute and I swear you will actually enjoy using it! Great product!!!!!",

But see that's a flaw that's really a plus cause if you only slightly close it, it's locked tight for sure and after you finish you can unlock it easily. Easy on, easy off!",

We have used this to make Salsa, chop tomatoes (roma) for bruschetta, chop carrots up fine to add to dogs food, cut up mixed raw veggies to make veggie cream cheese, and the list goes on. It works great for chopping up anything you would spend time cutting with a knife. The pull is not hard to do. Just owning this we have helped sell more when i pull this out in preparing dinner. People marvel at how well it chops and does not puree things unless you want it to! Love it!",

I thought that the stringy texture might prove a challenge, but this little thing totally chopped it up fine and did not leave any \"strings\" from the celery. I have only had this chopped for a couple of days, but it is hands down the best I've seen. Very few parts to clean, simple to assemble, and does the job. I only hope the blade does not dull with a lot of use, because I think this will get a lot of use in my kitchen.",

I just made 2 appetizers this morning for a church luncheon and it chopped up the veggies perfectly.",
