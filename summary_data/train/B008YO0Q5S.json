I\u2019ve had it a few months now and I have been very pleased with this purchase. The case is an excellent fit and holds the iPad snugly. The keyboard connected quickly and I haven\u2019t experienced any drops or delays in the connection. As many have noted, the only con is that the groove for holding the tablet up could be deeper so there is occasionally some slipping - but this is very seldom in my usage and not an issue for me. Highly recommended if you\u2019re looking for a well-made, secure case for your iPad 4.",

In addition to good product performance the mark of a company is highest based upon support.

      "text": "So far, this is a great keyboard and case. I only opened it tonight, but it connected to my iPad almost immediately. It charged very quickly and has worked perfectly with everything I have tried it with (internet, email, Notability, etc.). I can see the concern about the keyboard slipping out of the case, but since I know that can happen, I will just make sure I carry it correctly. I wish it had a spot for me to put some identification. My last case had a small slot for ID, but that's all I could see to improve so far. Glad there were so many good reviews! That's what swayed me, and so far so good.",

Overall I am satisfied with the unit and don't think you can go wrong with it. It is the one I picked out of quite a research on iPad covers/carriers.",

The replacement case fit perfectly. In the meantime I had purchased a case with a fixed keyboard. This one has a removeable keyboard which allows more flexibility in positioning of the keyboard and angle of the iPad when standing. Keyboard size is really nice for typing. The fixed keyboard case allowed rotation of the iPad which this does not. But overall, I think I like this one better.",

      "text": "Alpatronix keyboard case combo for the iPad 1-4 is attractive and solidly built. The stand works as shown to hold the iPad at an effective viewing angle. The keyboard (which is separate from the case) supplies enough friction to keep the iPad in place. (Without the keyboard, the iPad and case will sometimes slide flat.) Drawbacks--there is no storage sleeve or slot, so power cords and adapters must be packed separately. The space bar does not always register a touch, forcing you to watch your typing carefully to ensure spaces are inserted. And the case only comes in black. Still, I would buy it again.",

The main issue I have with the case is that my iPad doesn't completely fit in place so the home button isn't always perfectly aligned with the notch. I think if they added some foam or fillers to be added in preferentially along with the case it would be perfect. Maybe some foam could help keep the iPad perfectly still within the case",

The touch of the keyboard is very good, with slightly raised keys that give good tactile feedback, much better than using the screen. The case closes for protection. The keyboard goes a long time without recharging, then it connects via USB/Android cable. Overall, it was a very good choice, glad I got it! The price was quite fair, too.",
