An attempted upgrade from a Belkin Pre-N card cut my throughput in half (from 108mbps to 54). The N1 will not uninstall and Belkin customer service cannot fix the problem without an engineer going into the System Registry on my computer. I've spent hours on this and am worse off than before the \"upgrade.\" Belkin indicated it would be 2 days before an engineer can call me back to attempt a work around so the card can be uninstalled without crashing my wireless network. The product should never have been released. STAY AWAY.",

      "text": "Over the years I have had several wireless notebook cards. The Belkin N1 card is the worst I have ever had. With my laptop on my lap in the living room about 15 feet from my Belkin N1 wireless router it gets only a fair signal and can't connect at full speed. 50 feet away in my home office it gets no signal at all. My older pre-N notebook card gets a very good signal in my office so this the one I use even though it can't take advantage of full N1 connection speeds. Don't buy the N1 wireless notebook card, the pre-N is a much better device.",

I could never connect it to the laptop and it took 99% of the resources, so it basically locked it up. It worked great for about a month but then it took a nose dive. I tried to update the drivers from belkin but it locked up my computer and I had to reinstall windows and all my other programs. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!",

The USB card didn't support wireless N, and this card does. Installation was hassle-free, and range is better than that of a USB card. Be careful, as it doesn't work on some IBM computers.",
