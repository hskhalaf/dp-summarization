I loaded my giant miter saw on top, loose tools in the middle, and cases on the bottom. This cart handles the weight easily and is easy to push, even on carpet. It was easy to assemble and very sturdy. I'm going to buy another one for my hand tools and toolboxes. This makes wheeling out my power tools easy and makes me want to use them more often. So I'm running out of excuses.",

There is a \"NSF\" marking on corners of the shelves that must be right-side up or the shelves won't slide over the sleeves properly. As long as you pay attention to the orientation assembly will be easy.",

I placed the piece of plywood along the top of it and placed the saw on top of the plywood. I\u2019m able to use the lower shelves to store other items.

An added bonus is that the packaging is as good as the product, and protects the product during shipping without resorting to styrofoam.",
