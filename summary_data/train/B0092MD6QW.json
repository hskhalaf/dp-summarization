    "title": "Fujifilm X-E1 16.3 MP Compact System Digital Camera with 2.8-Inch LCD and 18-55mm Lens (Silver) (OLD MODEL)",
    "description": "The compact X-E1 is engineered to deliver extraordinary image quality. It starts with FUJIFILM's proprietary 16.3 APS-C X-Trans 2/3-Inch CMOS sensor whose unique pixel array is designed to deliver unsurpassed image resolution and color accuracy. Choose from the newly expanded XF Lens lineup with two new bright, high-definition FUJINON X-Mount lenses including a 14mm F2.8 and an 18-55mm F2.8-F4 lens. The 18-55mm allows photographic flexibility, optimizes low-light shooting and coupled with the EXR Processor Pro, the X-E1 delivers high performance auto - focusing. Everything you need in one compact, beautiful camera system.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nINTRODUCING THE X-E1 FROM FUJIFILM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX-Trans CMOS Sensor - Enabling high quality imaging\n\nEquipped with a large APS-C size sensor the resolving and descriptive power of the Fujinon lens can be maximized thereby enabling high resolution over the entire screen. \n\n\nAchievement of Superb High Resolution, High Sensitivity & Impressive \u201cBokeh\u201d Effect\n\n\nThe X-E1's sensor adopts the same high-performance 16M X-Trans CMOS found in the X Series flagship X-Pro1 model. Featuring an originally developed color filter array with ahighly random pixel arrangement, its X-Trans CMOS sensor eliminates the need for an optical low-pass filter, which is used in conventional systems to inhibit moir\u00e9 at the expense of resolution. The innovative array lets the X-Trans CMOS sensor capture unfiltered light from the lens and produce unprecedented resolution. The unique random arrangement of the color filter array is also highly effective in enhancing noise separation in high-sensitivity photography. Another advantage of the large APS-C sensor is the ability to create a beautiful \u201cbokeh\u201d effect - the aesthetic out-of-focus effect created when shooting with a shallow depth of field.\n\n\nStandard Range to ISO6400 and Extended Range to ISO25600 Featuring a large APS-C sensor and with the elimination of an optical low-pass filter, Fujifilm's X-Trans CMOS takes advantage of its high-sensitivity performance to deliver a standard range up to ISO6400. No matter when or where the shutter opportunity arises, you can depend on its high-sensitivity image quality to defeat blur caused by camera shake or subject motion. The X-E1's low-light capabilities are guaranteed to capture the moment beautifully.\n\n * High Resolution\n\nIn bright scenes, every detail from the leaves of the trees to a wisp of hair in a portrait is captured with exceptionally high resolution.\n\n * Wide Dynamic Range\n\nIn high contrast scenes, for example when shooting landscapes with a strong contrast between bright and dark areas, this technology reproduces the natural tonality in both highlights and shadow.\n\nFILM SIMULATION - Explore the Nuances of Color.\n\nJust like choosing the perfect film to match your creative direction, the X-E1 can simulate the color and tonal qualities of acclaimed film brands including the true-to-scene natural look of PROVIA, the vibrant tonality and saturated colors of Velvia and the silky soft look and beautiful skin tones of ASTIA. Film Simulation mode makes it simple to capture the expressive color quality of the rich legacy of Fujifilm photo film technology. \n\n\n\n\nHigh-definition and high-luminance 2.36 M-dot \u201cOLED electronic viewfinder\u201d\n\nBy combining the best \u201cOLED electronic viewfinder\u201d in its class with FUJIFILM's original optical technology the X-E1 offers a bright, wide field of vision of which its entirety can be seen at a glance.\n\n\u201cNatural Look\u201d Electronic Viewfinder Debuts \n\n * The Fusion of FUJIFILM Optical Technology and a new 2.36M-dot Organic EL\n\nAdopting an optical structure of two glass lenses and a double aspherical lens, the viewfinder provides a comfortable and natural view of the entire scene with an horizontal apparent field of view of 25\u00b0. FUJIFILM's optical engineers have achieved a distortion-free view with astounding edge-to-edge clarity and maintained an excellent field of vision even if the photographer's eye position shifts.\n\n * Diopter Adjustment Dial\n\n\n\n\nThe X-E1 offers a diopter correction dial that enables users to adjust the strength of the viewfinder in accordance with their eyesight. The dial is located on the side of the viewfinder and can be adjusted from -4m-1 - +2m-1 (dtp).\n\n * 2.36 M-dot Organic EL Panel\n\nWith approx. 2.36M dots of resolution and 100% coverage, the X-E1 display panel provides incredible detail to perfectly frame and focus your shots. The rich color expression of OLED technology and high contrast ratio of 1:5000* reflect exposure, white balance and film simulation settings with high fidelity, letting you confirm changes in real time.\n\n* Depending on the shooting conditions. \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAn analog interface allowing you to check settings at a glance.\n\n\n\n\n * Settings can be checked even when the camera is off.\n * High precision parts provide just the right amount of torque and resistance when clicking the dials thereby allowing you to get suitable response when photographing.\n * Interface enabling settings to be changed while looking through the viewfinder.\n * With the exposure dial and shutter speed controlled with the right hand and the aperture ring controlled with the left, the X-E1 enables you to change settings instinctively by feel without looking up from the viewfinder.\n * Being able to change settings in an instant means you won't miss that \u201cperfect shot\u201d.\n * High-rank, high quality design.\n * Beautiful Magnesium Die-Cast Top and Front Cover - Stylish Yet Stron\n * \u201cMade in Japan\u201d Premium Quality\n\n\n\nThe built-in flash corresponds to GN7*.\n\nYou can make your subject stand out using the flash, such as the daytime synchro when the sun is in front of you or the capture light when photographing people.\n\nBy combining the superior highly sensitive performance of the X-E1 with highly sensitive settings you can achieve high resolution with little noise by compensating for the amount of light present.\n\nFrom assist lamps to full flash the X-E1 will broaden the horizon of your photography.\n\n* ISO200 \u00b7 m\n\n\n\n\nQuick Response\n\nThe X-E1 achieves quick response compatible with DSLR cameras thereby enabling you to never miss a shot. \n\n\n \n\nOther Features of X-E1\n\nUse the \u201cDrive\u201d button to switch to photography modes you use often. \nYou can smoothly change to the following settings using the DRIVE button.\n\n *  Recording High-Definition (HD) Movies\n * Bracketing \n * AE Bracketing\n * ISO Bracketing\n * Film Simulations Bracketing\n * Dynamic Range Bracketing\n * Continuous Shooting (Burst Mode)\n * Panoramas\n\n\nFull HD Movies with Cinema-like Image Quality\n\nShoot Full HD movies (1920 x 1080) at 24fps, the same frame rate used for cinema films. In addition to using Monochrome or other Film Simulation modes to enhance your artistic expression, you can take full advantage of the combination of X-E1's large sensor and bright XF lenses to capture movies with a large and beautiful defocused \u201cbokeh\u201d background. Connect stereo microphones (commercially sold) to the microphone connector to record audio with enhanced clarity and presence.\n\nFilm Simulation modes for Movie shooting\n\nPROVIA - True-to-life natural tonality and color reproduction.\n\nVelvia - Shoot HD Movies in the vibrant colors of Velvia.\n\nMONOCHROME - Capture the action in richly expressive monochrome tones.\n\n\nCustomization Function\n\nAssign Frequently Used Functions to the Fn Button\n\nAssign any one of the following frequently used functions to the Fn (Function) button and enjoy smooth one-touch controls during shooting.\n\nMULTIPLE EXPOSURE / PREVIEW DEPTH OF FIELD / ISO / SELF-TIMER / IMAGE SIZE / IMAGE QUALITY / DYNAMIC RANGE / FILM SIMULATION / WHITE BALANCE / AF MODE / SELECT CUSTOM SETTING / MOVIE / RAW\n\nSave Custom Settings\n\nCreate, save and instantly recall up to 7 sets of user-defined settings covering all parameters from ISO sensitivity to white balance.\n\nFocusing\n\nSelectable AF with a 49-point Metering Matrix\n\nWithin the screen, the auto focus area is divided into a 49-point matrix. AF accurately and swiftly recognizes the primary subject and brings it into crystal clear focus, and also lets you freely select the position of the AF frame. You can also change the AF frame size and pinpoint the focusing.\n\n0.05-sec Shutter Time Lag\n\nThe shutter time lag is only 0.05 sec, so you can capture the precise instant you wish to and enjoy a comfortable shooting experience.\n\nHigh-speed Auto Focus with Lens-Sensor Contrast Detection\n\nThe highly agile linear motor in the XF18-55mm lens combined with the high-speed signal readout of the CMOS sensor and the EXR Processor Pro, achieves a huge leap in AF speed and precision performance. Contrast detection AF in the X-E1 brings your subject into sharp focus in as little as 0.1 sec* so you'll never miss a shot.\n\n* Fujifilm research \n\n\nManual Focusing Methods\n\nIn the viewfinder, the distance index bar is displayed together with the depth of field scale and aperture value, providing helpful guides for focusing. For pinpoint precision in manual focus mode, just press the Command Dial and confirm sharpness with a zoom view of the focus point. This helpful function also features selectable zoom display ratios. And at a touch of the AE/AF Lock button, you activate the built-in Focus Aid function for automatic focusing of the subject in the focus frame.*\n\n* Available only when using XF lenses.\n\nAF Assist Lamp for Low-Light Scenes\n\nIn low-light settings where even the subject is hard to see through the viewfinder, the AF Assist Lamp illuminates the subject and assists Auto Focus.\n\nMultiple Exposure\n\nAdd Artistry to Your Photographic Expression\n\nIn film cameras, multiple exposure is the photographic technique of superimposing one image on another by double exposing a single frame of film. Through advanced digital processing, X-E1 can simulate this technique, expanding your creative expression. Just select Multiple Exposure mode and take your first shot using either the EVF or LCD monitor. Next, while viewing the first image, you can frame and shoot the second exposure. This ability to precisely position and focus the second shot lets you not only \u201csee\u201d how the finished Multiple Exposure image will look, but also explore other creative photographic possibilities.\n\n4:3 Aspect Ratio The LCD's 4:3 aspect ratio provides a large screen to view the complete 3:2 image with ample room for display of shooting information outside the image frame.\n\n\nQ (Quick Menu) Button Fast Shortcut to Shooting Menu Settings\n\nSkip directly to frequently used shooting menus with the Q (Quick Menu) button. ISO sensitivity setting, White Balance, Film Simulation and other frequently used shooting settings are displayed in a list. Just use the 4-way controller to select the item and the command dial to change settings for speedy operation while shooting. \n\n\nIn-camera RAW Converter\n\nThe built-in RAW data converter lets you view results in the field without first transferring the data to a PC. This easy-to-use feature not only takes into account exposure compensation, white balance and other in-camera image quality settings, but also lets you apply Film Simulation modes in the converter mode.\n\nISO100-25600 Sensitivity Setting Range\n\nExpand the normal sensitivity range from ISO200-6400 to ISO100, 12800 or even ISO25600. In dynamic lighting conditions, you can now set a sensitivity ceiling within the range of ISO400-6400 and keep the camera on ISO Auto.\n\nExceptionally low noise even at high sensitivity.\n\n\nFrom SLEEP to ON in 0.5 sec.\n\nAfter turning OFF the power, the X-E1 enters a \u201csleep\u201d mode (for a maximum of 24 minutes). If the power is turned ON during this time, the X-E1 \u201cwakes up\u201d instantly, reducing the normal startup time from 1.0 sec. to approx. 0.5 sec. ready for you to frame and capture the moment.\n\nExposure Control\n\nEasy-to-use AE/AF Lock Button\n\nLock both exposure and focus for the subject by touching the special AE/AF Lock button conveniently placed in the upper area of the rear control panel. Using the setup menu, you can also set the button to lock only AE or AF.\n\nSelectable Metering Modes\n\nSwiftly select the best metering for your shot: \u201cMULTI\u201d for accurate response to a variety of lighting conditions, \u201cSPOT\u201d for precise reading of approximately 2% of the viewfinder area in the center of the screen, and \u201cAVERAGE\u201d for an average exposure setting for the entire scene.\n\n\n\n\nFUJIFILM is pleased to announce the launch of two new models to the FUJINON XF Lens range bringing the total number of lenses available to five, offering much broader photographic appeal.\n\nAnother unique five lenses will be added in the line-up in early 2013, making the total to 10 lenses.",
