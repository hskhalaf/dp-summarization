It comes completely unassembled and there are approximately 26 screws that have to be installed. Yes, this is a cat house and no, they don't know the difference but I do. This was an expensive purchase in my opinion for feral cats and if I had to do it all over again I would not.",

There's no doubt the wood is thin, and I don't know how many years this will last especially in our harsh winters. But for the $90-some I paid for it, I'm happy. Also, be sure to note the dimensions. These are EXTERIOR dimension, including the roof overhang, front \"porch\" overhang, etc. In the end, the interior dimension are about 12\"x12\" on 3 separate floors.",

My cats are not huge, but it wasn't a place they were willing to hide which I think was due to the tight interior. I've included pictures of the house (check the window kitty is peeking) and one kitty laying in the dogs bed to show you her size. Sadly I ended up returning this house due to the size.",
