Everything works good and the screen is hidden really well being the mirror, when I'm driving I can't even tell that there is a screen there. However, the only reason I gave this 2 stars is because when driving the glass mirror price vibrates a ton to where you can't tell what is behind you, aslo it sounds like a screw is loose inside.",

Connected camera via t-taps to backup light wires. Connected monitor via fuse tap to fuse in engine compartment. This connection only delivers power to the monitor when in reverse. This is fine if you only have the one camera installed. Found out through previous experience that the monitor if continuosly on will draw your battery down if you don't drive much. The connection I described above avoids that battery draw-down. Overall, pleased with the unit (so far).",

When you are in reverse at night, the LCD is very bright, making it impossible to see anything in the other part of the mirror.",
