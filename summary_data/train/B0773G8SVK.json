      "text": "So I immediately used this per-shave oil as soon as I got it out of the box that it was sent in. My shave was 25% closer and smoother! Afterwords there was not a hint of stubble or razor rash! Completely awesome!!! Well worth the price without question. I'm bummed now that I didn't purchase the bigger bottle. My only criticism is the scent could be a little more pronounced. Its smells great out of the bottle but it diminishes completely once the shave is over. Still a 5 star product!!!",

I wash my face with a mild soap, rinse, squeeze out a tiny, dime size squirt of oil into my palm, rub over my beard, than apply any shave cream over it. I get an effortless shave, no scrapes no nicks, even with multiple passes, which I need because my beard grows every which way. The result is a very close, smooth shave, skin feels moisturized, not raw, glows. The fragrance is barely noticeable, not attractive, not obnoxious, just irrelevant. Great Stuff!",
