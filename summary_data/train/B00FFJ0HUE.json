Made drive images as more software was installed, used System Image Backup (search File History). Tested Recovery of the images and recovery was successful Tested the built in recovery stuff (F9 on boot) also successful Got bored and installed Windows 8.1 Pro x86. (Drivers are available from ASUS) Much better now. No wireless drop, connects to NAS and shared folders instantly! Both speakers sound perfect. Out the box 4 stars, after fresh install Windows 8.1 Pro, 5 stars!",

However, this model is 5 years old now and showing it's age. For one thing, it's freaking heavy (for a tablet). I would definitely look at alternatives before paying any more than $300 for this.",

      "text": "I hated this thing. The keyboard keys offset after about two months of use. My friend had the same issue. The touchscreen is nice but the tablet doesn't have very much power to play many games in apps or personal ones. If all you do is watch movies then this would probably be ok. Also has a long battery life. I realize this is a rather cheap one but I hate this one so much I will never buy a ASUS again.",
