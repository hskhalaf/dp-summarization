I usually wear a size 12 (shoes in photo are 12) in my normal shoes because I like a more \"snug fit\" but for these I ordered a 13 and good thing I did! They are definitely an upgrade from the rentals and seem to take into consideration the \"downsizing\" people always say you should do. Seems to be a great beginner shoe!",

We returned the 13 and got the 14s. He is not really a beginner climber...maybe 6 months into it and found these to work great for him. These do not have any support but climbing shoes are really just to climb not walk around in. The rubber and the material seem to be holding up great and he loved the color combo.",

    "description": "Black Diamond Momentum Climbing Shoes While the Momentum climbing shoe was built with ultimate comfort in mind; it excels in performance. With Engineered Knit Technology for exceptional breathability; and innovative proprietary molded rubber, the Momentum is the perfect entry-level climbing shoe for all-day comfort at the gym or crag. Engineered Knit Technology Constructed using an engineered knit upper, the Black Diamond Momentum Climbing Shoes provide exceptional breathability and comfort. Designed to provide the right amount of stretch with the right amount of support, the knit technology sits comfortably against the skin and moves as you do. The fabric conforms to the shape of the foot to provide a perfect fit that minimises in shoe-slippage; because a precise fit is necessary when climbing. The knit upper also ensure exceptional breathability by allowing cool air to circulate within the shoe on hot and humid days. Completing the upper are two velcro straps which pull in opposite directions to ensure added midfoot support. Soft Flex Midsole The midsole of the Black Diamond Momentum Climbing Shoes is built to ensure all-day comfort. Low in profile, the midsole is minimal to reduce weight whilst still provide an abundance of comfort and cushioning. Soft-flex combines both underfoot cushioning and sensitivity to bring you a midsole that is perfect for climbing. Sensitivity is important in climbing as it allows you to feel the rocks and boulders beneath your feet before you commit to climbing on them. The Momentum Climbing Shoes have been built for all-day comfort on moderate routes, boulders or gym sessions. Durable Rubber Outsole Developed using a 4.3mm the Momentum is built for durability and moulded for optimal consistency and performance. The stiff rubber is effective on terrain where small crevices and edging is a priority. The rigid nature of the outsole supports you during any climb by adapting to the ground below you and bearing your weight as",
