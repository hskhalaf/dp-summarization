About a month after my granddaughter using it the toy with the sun/mirror on it broke. I was disappointed but she didn't mind and would still lift it up. After a while the metal rod inside poked out of the fabric. Not good. Currently we are trying to remove this toy from the body of the center. If we can't, she is not going back in it.",

See included pictures, I have contacted the company by email and still awaiting response... this seems like a long and lengthy process and I hope to see this issue get resolved.",
