I no longer have much use for a flash. If I can see what I want to shoot, the camera can get a pretty good shot of it with ISO up to 25600. In fact, my one small annoyance is that portrait mode comes up with the flash enabled by default, so you have to manually turn that off each time. That gets old quickly. I would rather just have the flash stay off unless I push the button to pop it open. Otherwise, I love it.",

Im still figuring out a lot of the spec but it's been relatively easy to navigate. The rode microphone is great as well. Fairly sensitive mic.
