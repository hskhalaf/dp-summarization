The larger bags come with additional shoulder straps which is a nice bonus. These bags have the best warranty in the industry which is well worth it when considering they are not any more expensive than any of their competitors products. Based on their construction I highly doubt I will need to use the warranty. Everything is kept nice and dry!",

It does float though if you close it right. On a side note I learned that ice cold water bottles can penetrate the waterproofness of the bag if they are leaned against the outside of it. The condensation builds up and seeps through. Design flaw? Or just science? Either way, it's kind of cool.",

The color is nice, the material is sturdy and it doesn't look like it's prone to fine cracking because the material is too thick to fold over too far. All in all very happy with the purchase.",
