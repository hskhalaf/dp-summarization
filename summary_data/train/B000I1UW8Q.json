I prefer the metal mug that had to be heated in a pot of boiling water. It had twice the amount of wax in it and was a substantial cut. This new version is a cheap plastic cup with half the wax. And you have to microwave it an constantly check on it to make sure you don't scald your skin.",

Make the wax layer thick enough to pull. Do not wait until its completely dry or it will crack and make a mess (wait til it is tacky). If there is residual don't pluck away at it since that hurts- put oil on a towel and simply wipe the stuff off.",

Then doing the 30 second intervals to get it the right consistency. You will most likely need to reheat it during the process. That\u2019s the worst part. The wax is great. Smells great. It does get crumbly on you if you\u2019re not reheating as needed. Make sure you\u2019re applying a thick, honey like consistency. Twirl the wand after dipping in the wax and after you\u2019ve applied it to get the wax to stop stretching. The quantity provided was enough for me to do a Brazilian.",

Definitely use the pre and post waxing oil. This is a great alternative during the pandemic (at least).",

So now I have to shave anyways because my wax is almost out. I would not recommend this wax try something else.",
