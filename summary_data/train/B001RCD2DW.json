I also have a pair of the Adx 500s which feel cheap. Literally no metal on these, I hope to the creators put all the money in the internals.

They're great if you're trying to pick apart vocals and separation but I couldn't tolerate them sucking any fun out of listening. I've read that these are more \"bassy\" than the 701/702...and my response is \"just how awful are those then if even the 712 has nothing?\" Also the build quality is very mediocre. It's pretty much the same as their low end <$100 models with a lot of plastic. On the plus side all the plastic makes them very lightweight.",

I bought them for my home studio mainly for mixing the tracks I compose and record, and they have been superlative for that purpose. The only reason I rated them four instead of five stars is their comfort level.

Sony 7506 has all the details that can be heard from AKGs, but the way the AKGs deliver those details are FAR more enjoyable. Bass is slightly stronger on the AKGs (due to 3 db boost), but the soundstage, clarity and the \"lifelike\" sound of the AKGs is definitely worth more than 3 times the price of the Sony 7506s. The velour memory pads are also very comfortable and it doesn't get my ears sweaty unlike the 7506s.",

For a wide range of listening these cans will not disappoint. Did I say very balanced? They are very revealing however, so consider your source material. I highly recommend these phones.",
