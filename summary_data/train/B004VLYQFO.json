      "text": "I loved this egg beater and bought some as a gift for relatives. However, they all befell the same fate after a few months if light use due to a structural weakness in the design. See photo that shows where these all eventually break. I tried repairing with some Testors plastic glue, but the point that the break occurs is too thin to adequately repair. It is a shame that these all have this design flaw, because it is otherwise the best egg beater there is. I look forward to a newer model where Oxo works out this issue.",

The main issue is the beaters are wires, not blades, so they work more like a whip rather than like beaters. It takes a lot of rotations to beat eggs because the beaters don't grab the egg yolks and pull them through, like a beater would. The quality of the material is not great, it's adequate. For the price, I was expecting more.",

    "title": "OXO Good Grips Egg Beater, Standard Packaging",
    "description": "Product Packaging:Standard PackagingOld-fashioned egg beaters have long been relied on for perfectly aerated egg whites and fluffy whipped cream. Now the OXO Good Grips Egg Beater combines the same dependable results with innovation and ease. The smoothly rotating gears are enclosed in the upright handle for protection and easy clean-up. The turning knob and contoured handle have a soft, comfortable, non-slip grip for easy operation even with wet hands. The two stainless steel Beaters can be removed for individual cleaning or to offer a taste of whipped confections. The base detaches by simply pressing two side buttons and can be tossed into the dishwasher. A stainless steel bridge extends slightly longer than the Beaters to rest against the bottom of the mixing bowl to reduce arm strain. Eggs, light batters, whipped cream and more are now such a breeze to whip up that even the next generation may want to take a turn.",
