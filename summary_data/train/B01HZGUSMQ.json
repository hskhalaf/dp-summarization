Especially like that you can purchase extra curlers in the exact size necessary for length of hair. I use 6 additional curlers and the \u201csecond\u201d round heats up fast. As soon as I use the first curler I add the second for heating immediately. They heat up so fast for my additional 6. Probably leave in 5 minutes. That\u2019s all it takes for a perfect curl!!!!!I I will say the clips are bad. I throw them away and use a similar clip that\u2019s white from a different company. But that\u2019s a small inconvenience for a great set of curlers.",
