      "text": "This is easy to put on and adjust for all different body types. (Note that it does not fit all sizes). When I first put it on , it was not the most comfortable thing to wear as it is forcing you to be aligned -however after wearing for several hours, you stop noticing the awkwardness. It felt so natural, that when I was ready to go out, I forgot that I still had it on! Easy day following it has become a little less awkward to first put on - with similar results. I can not see in the mirror if my posture is improving yet, but it sure feels that way. Looking forward to more results soon!",

The straps rubbed under my arms and overall, it just wasn't good enough to get 5 stars. On a side note, I did however, end up buying this little posture correcting device, , as my posture has gotten pretty bad. It has definitely helped correct it without the headache of wearing a support brace. Maybe worth a try if this doesn't work for you.",

      "text": "I just started using it yesterday afternoon and already feeling some relief. Hoping it keeps working so that my back can fully heal. Update: used it for a week and a half and the excruciating upper back pain is now completely gone. I still use it when I\u2019m at my desk at work to prevent the pain from returning. Added bonus if worn under a jacket or cardigan it gives great posture. I got so many compliments when I wore it and coworkers couldn\u2019t pin point what it was (a haircut? New outfit?) so that\u2019s great.",
