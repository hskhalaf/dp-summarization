I had two florescent lights at the end of the driveway they burned out every week? and they only come on at night, so I replaced them with LED's if you are like me and hate changing bulbs switch to led!",

It uses only 40 watts which is half the power consumption and if it lasts the thousands of hours it's supposed to, should pay for itself in a few years by energy savings and not having to replace 4 foot bulbs. The LED's are also apparently sturdy because it arrived in the original manufacturer's cardboard box with no padding or packaging material.",

Color is \"daylight\" range but not a blue or green cast. Lightweight and easy to install. Would like to have a longer cord for plug in. Before I installed these had three fluorescent lights that did not work well in the cold. LEDs light come on bright right away. Had them only a few weeks. Hope they last a long time",

As far as the lights are concerned, these are good quality units with pull chain on-off switches and good quality 5 foot long cords. They also come with a couple of pieces of light gage chain & hooks for hanging them. They do not weigh much because they do not have ballasts and are rated at 50,000 hours of use. They are also rated to -20 degrees so unlike fluorescent lights these come on instantly and are very bright.",

It's fine but I am 6ft tall and hanging from the garage ceiling I have to reach up to grab them, not a big deal for me, but if you have a taller ceiling or are shorter this will be an issue.
