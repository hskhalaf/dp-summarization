Once I learned how a bungee strap worked I began my journey down the current dusty trail of straps and tie downs and convenient and secure loads of mostly junk on my truck. Thanks mr . bungee man, this was the best of the ones I've had in the last few years. The colors are striking. The snap is for real. It's the real thing.",

These would probably be fine if you are just going to use them to hold together sleeping bags that are just sitting in storage or something, but would not recommend for heavy-duty tasks.",

So far the squirrels have not figured out how to open them. There is a nice selection of sizes and they stretch and hold very well.",

When one wasn\u2019t long enough two together was perfect. They are very durable and they hold up very well",

So I would suggest finding another way to carry them, that would make them easier to pull apart. But the actual tie downs have worked well.",
