      "text": "I LOVE THIS BIKE! I purchased this bike a week ago, with the FREE assembly they offer! I got it shipped directly to the bike store, and picked it up two days later! It was professionally assembled. I have nothing but good things to say about this bike! I have been riding all kinds of bikes for years. This bike is as good as it gets for the money. Its a hybrid but more of a road bike dominant. However it still handled pretty well off road. When its all said and done this bike gets the job done and its in first place for the money!",

      "text": "I am delighted with this bike after several weeks of ownership. I have put about 85 miles on the bike so far and am very pleased with the operation of the disc brakes and derailers. Was able to make some adjustments to the front derailer when the chain was slipping off; no more issues. The only \"surprise\" on this bike was the presta air valves. Wasn't able to use my air compressor to fill the tires but quickly solved the problem with a very inexpensive adapter from my local sporting goods store. Looking forward to enjoying many miles on this bike. Very pleased at this point.",

    "description": "Our insight line have long been rider favorites due to their versatility and ease of use. The insight 2 continues this tradition of great performance Hybrids stacked with features. This year's bike still has its light and stable aluminum frame and fork, efficient 700C road wheels, a comfortable flat-bar cockpit for an upright riding stance, and quality Shimano drivetrain components. We don't like to tinker too much with success, but for this year we did make a significant upgrade: disc brakes! the braking duties are now taken care of by powerful Tektro mechanical disc with 160mm rotors. This enhances the insight 2's performance even more, allowing one-finger modulation and more control in wet conditions. For charity riders, commuters, and just tooling around the neighborhood, the insight 2 is a proven performer.",
