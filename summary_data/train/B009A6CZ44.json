The only reason I gave four stars is that the high end can sometimes be a little \"tinny\" sometimes is just a little \"shrill\" on some songs. I read about this before purchasing on some Amazon reviews and got an equalizer app which is great. I found the Noise Cancelling feature was better than Bose and the Sony headphones were more comfortable as well. Sony also had a better build quality. The Bose put pressure on the ear drum, the Sony's did not. These are great for airplanes! A nice bonus is the carrying case. Sturdy.",

It was as if I was listening to a different album. There is no doubt they will be an important part of my traveling gear. Thanks Amazon!!!!",

      "text": "Maybe great headphones, strangely the inside of the ear cups have a piece (part of the noise canceling mic) that sticks out a little. My wife & her family couldn't feel the protruding piece much, if at all. But for me at first it tickled a little, but the tickle quickly grew to discomfort, eventually creating soreness on my earlobe. Not what I want to expect from headphones at a high price point.",

      "text": "The primary purpose for choosing this headphone was for the NC. The product was received in a condition where it would work as a headphone only. when attempting to charge the battery, the charging light blinks indicating the headphones are malfuntioning. An attempt to return to seller was denied due to a 30 day rule...which works against my situation when I had it shipped 5 weeks before returning to the country. I'm sure I would be happier spending less money on the Bose QC15 and having the NC work dependably as I travel often, and have no time to follow up with any Sony dealer in US or outside.",
