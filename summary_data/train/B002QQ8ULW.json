I didn't feel comfortable with a whole size larger so I bought 1/2 size larger and they are perfect! I read a lot of reviews before picking these shoes and I'm glad I did. These got the most raves for being comfortable and after wearing them for 12 hours the first day my feet thanked me! They're also very stylish!",

I have another pair of shoes from this company and like them very much, but these are even better. I'm thinking about getting a pair in black. I was a little weary of buying these because they have a steel toe and other comments mentioned they rub on the ankle. I found neither to be a problem. These shoes are so comfortable, I actually fell asleep in them. When I woke up, my feet still felt fine.",

However, I have to return them because for some reasons, the left side of the left shoe keeps rubbing the lower part of my ankle and gets uncomfortable pretty quick. Probably it's just my strange foot anatomy :-) The right shoe is okay. Enough cushion in the insole. I like the safety features too. However, a little bit more arch support will be perfect.",
