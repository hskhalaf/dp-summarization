Found this at an airport MK store- prettiest watch but the price was $250. I was pleased to find this gorgeous watch on Amazon for much less. I have a small wrist and the biggest i can wear is 36-37mm. This 36mm face is perfect. It was a pain to remove links with household tools but I was so excited to wear it right away. I should have ordered a kit the same time I ordered the watch to save myself the headache.",

The Bradshaw is my go to classic. This dial is 30mm- perfect women's size. My 43mm dials have just become overwhelming Michael Kors are my must durable watch. I'm unintentionally tough-screen scratches appear immediately in most brands. It took two years to get a scratch on my first MK watch. Which is what sold me on their brands. This is saffino leather. That is real leather with a wax coating machine pressed into the band. They are waterproof. I will update with any unforeseen problems.",
