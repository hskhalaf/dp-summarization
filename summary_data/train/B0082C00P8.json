      "text": "Very expensive but my dogs love it. I was looking for raw alternatives to Sojos, which has very little meat. One of my ogs is 13, the other 60 pounds so I can't afford only this. It seems like astronaut food. I hydrate it and mix it with the Sojos to stretch it, otherwise one ag doesn't even last a week. The only thing I don't like is that some of the bars are crumbled into powder in the bag, resulting in even less food.",
