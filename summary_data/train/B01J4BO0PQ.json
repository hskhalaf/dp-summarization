      "text": "I love the slim, minimalist design of this adapter, but I wish the portion of the cord was a few inches longer. If you have your laptop on a stand, the adapter hangs out the port and seems to interfere with the connectivity. I realized upon the first use it was designed really for use with a laptop sitting flat on the desk, but again, a few more inches would thrilled me. Also the connector seems to be a little touchy, I constantly have to jiggle it to ensure the connection is good.",
