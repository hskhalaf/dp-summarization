The one who used to scratch and have flaky skin doesn't anymore and he sleeps more soundly during the night. I'm happy with the results of this product and also happy with the clean ingredients. My vet said that the fish oil gel tablets pretty much get passed right through before absorption so I was happy to find this chewable product.",

      "text": "I purchased this in hope that it would help my puppy with his dry winter skin and shedding. I didn't get to use it for the full 4 weeks to see if it was effective for my dog. He does have a sensitive tummy so this could just be him , but after a couple days he kept throwing up after an hour after ingesting them. I thought it was just cause they were new but we kept with them for about 2 weeks with him throwing up. He did love eating them too bad he couldn't keep them down. I wouldn't recommend if you have a dog with a sensitive tummy.",
