At normal setting, I could see no improvement in air quality over time; the filter trapped a small amount of dust over a few months. Moreover, the motor produced a huge amount of EMF that set off my detectors even at low settings from several feet away. This might work ok in a very small room with low levels of air contaminants. Impractical for any other use.",

I put this in my bedroom, which is the room she\u2019s mostly in, and within a couple days her asthma symptoms were almost non existent! I couldn\u2019t be happier! I plan on buying at least a couple more to place throughout the house. Definitely recommend for anyone (including fur babies) with breathing issues!",

      "text": "The Hamilton Beach 04384 Air Purifier is neither quiet nor an efficient animal hair filter. The small air filter on my desktop computer collects more pet hair than the Hamilton Beach (and they share the same room). The air flow passes through the odor eliminator before the HEPA filter. If it had collected any animal hair, the odor eliminator would have screened it prior to reaching the cleanable HEPA filter. Running at half speed the Hamilton Beach is far noisier than my gaming computer which has five fans. I wish that I would have known what I know now prior to purchasing this animal hair filter. Had I known, I would have never purchased it.",

So it works, but I wouldn't say it would cure all your allergy problems. *Product comes with carbon filters, which I was surprised and bought some of my own, but great bonus.",

We have 3 cats and this greatly helps reduce pet dander, odors from the litter box, and other allergens and dust. It runs quietly in the background, almost like white noise. The filters are easy to replace (I just wish they came 2 or 4 to a box instead of 3 because it takes 2 filters). This is also a great healthy option for couple and families to simply purify the air in a small space. Highly recommend.",

It's been running on high nonstop for 2 months and it sounds as smooth as on day 1, so it's probably good quality.",
