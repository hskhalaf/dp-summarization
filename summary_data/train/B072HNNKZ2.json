I enjoy the occasional glass of wine outdoors, but unfortunately so do the bees & other insects. I prefer not to share with them. This discourages them just fine. I even leave the lid slightly open sometimes, so the wine can breathe a bit. One of the glasses is slightly wobbly, but not to the point where I wouldn't use it. I may even get another set so I have an extra for guests. All in all a great product.",
