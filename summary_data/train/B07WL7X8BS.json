I installed them as close as possible to the points where cabling enters the house, in order to minimize the ground path length. Long wires act as inductors to impulse currents, like lightning surges, and are ineffective; in my case, a line to connect to the house ground would render my protective devices almost useless. These rods let me minimize the path length and get the most protection possible. The quality and finish are excellent, packaging was safe and secure, and I wouldn't hesitate to buy them again.",
