      "text": "The excellent design in both form and function make these earbuds one of the best audio purchases ever made. It is easy to see much thought has gone not only into presentation but ergonomics and sound quality as well. Beautifully packaged, they are a delight to receive. The instructions are clear and straight-forward and a choice of four sizes of ear tips make fit for the most discerning user a dream. This was important for me as earbuds do not normally fit me so well. Operation is quite intuitive while offering all the needed functions. I was amazed at how well the Earfun Air integrated into my day and brought dynamic personal sound in an elegant yet simple package.",

My only gripe is it only comes in black colour. I\u2019m hoping for the white colour to arrive soon. Pretty satisfied customer here. Highly recommended! Update: There was a little technical problem with the left earbud awhile ago but, instead of returning the item I followed the troubleshooting process and it was resolved. Now I'm a happy bunny again!",

I called my sis, and voice quality perfect and looks like it blocking the noise as well as I did not hear anything during the phone call. They are so nice to put extra Ear tips which I am quiet into hygiene. I was planing to give this to my sis but it\u2019s mine now. She has to wait for the Xmas.",

These EarFuns have been brilliant with music and call quality. Really impressed and very happy. They\u2019re comfortable in the ear and great to have a solid case too. Only negatives I can find is that they\u2019re fiddly to get out of the case, and the touch controls aren\u2019t sensitive enough. Hardly deal breaking. Would highly recommend these headphones.",

They don't have a noise cancelling feature, but I knew that before I bought them.",
