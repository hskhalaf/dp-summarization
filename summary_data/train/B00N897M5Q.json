Then let them all hang dry together on the wall above the bathtub and it's ready for next time. How easy is that?! Our bath toys aren't very heavy so I haven't used the extra suction cups for it.",

It's unfortunate it didn't work out. We already had one of the plastic bath toy holders that spans the width of the tub, but our tub doesn't have sides that will hold it up. We're kind of in between a rock and a hard place...",

      "text": "Works great - suction cups are gripping to the tile with no problem, and I like that extra suction hooks are included - nice bonus. Simple, white design is attractive and well made; mesh allows quick drying, and the pouch is nice and big. Holds a fairly large toy boat plus other floaty toys without any issues thus far. The company really stands by its product and follows up to make sure you are 100% satisfied.",

The suction cups are holding great and the two extra hooks included are an added bonus. Every other bath toy organizer I've tried either gets gross with the constant wet dry or the suction cups never hold. I love that this organizer is all mesh so that it will drain and dry easily.",

It's large sucker pads ensure that it locks securely to bath tiles and the large mesh bag is big enough to hold plenty of bath toys. I also believe this product is very competitively price so, bottom line: I highly recommend this product. Thank you Charles",
