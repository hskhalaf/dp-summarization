You can make one cup using purchased kcups or the my kcup re-usable adapter using your favorite grounds or brew a 6,8,10,12 cup carafe using your favorite grounds. It does more but takes up less room than my old keurig. It also looks great and is well made. Highly recommend!",

The water will not flow out of the reservoir through the unit. It makes boiling sounds then shuts off within 10 seconds of starting the brew. It looks great in our kitchen, and I love the reservoir idea. Disappointed that this doesn't work (twice)",

The thermal carafe keeps it hot a lot longer than it lasts around our house. Different cup sizes and the strong button provides limitless ability to control the strength. The moveable reservoir provides flexibility to fit in your space. I MacGyver'd the lid with a float valve so filling the reservoir is automatic for the added convenience. If you want full pots on some days and individual cups on others, you should give this model a look.",

I can make appt at 9am and at 8pm it's still drinkable hot. My only complaint, and reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is the reservoir. They boast the ability to make a 12cup (96oz) pot. But it only has a 60oz reservoir. I thought maybe the internal team would make up the difference but no. If you want a full pot, you have to refill the reservoir halfway thru. If it gets too low it will stop brewing and you'll be left with only an 8cup pot.",

Also, the reservoir is much easier to use than previous models. That curved reservoir, which was clearly designed for looks and not function, was always very lame and good riddance to it.",

The thermal carafe keeps the coffee hot long enough to grab a few cups of coffees, and the space savings has been very appreciated too.",

We love our k-cups when we want a quick brew and for flavor treats and hot tea or cocoa. This brewer allowed us to get rid to two machines. Another great feature is that the spot for the k-cups is on top and not slanted. The water reservoir can be placed on either side or in the back - a great option. I can find only \"pros\" about this product. It is streamlined, simple to operate and easy to clean. It is a bit pricey but well worth it.",

The coffee is hot, the water reservoir is bigger than the older model and the footprint smaller. Love the fact that you can make a single cup of carafe from the same machine. Also this machine is QUIET!!! Well done Keurig - best coffee maker yet and I have had them all, Mr Coffee, Bunn, Cuisinart......",

Simple set up, clean look, easy to operate, full carafe up to 12 cups using my choice of ground coffee and standard K-Pods for single cups any time. Keeps coffee nice and hot for a long time and the carafe is simple to clean. The only thing I would have added would be a signal when the carafe is finished brewing but still 5-star all the way.",

First, moving the water reservoir to the other side was difficult to do. Instructions were horrible on this. Secondly, the coffee comes out slower than my old machine, and is not a steady stream. A lot of splashes on my counter that requires a quick wipe down with a cloth. Used to it not so no problem.",

Took a little while to figure out the display but now it seems silly I didn't understand. Directions probably would've helped. It makes some noise though. About as loud as our old single cup that was 5 or 6 years old. That's my only complaint...and it's not worth not buying.",

Will make a cup or pot of hot water with no additional steps. Footprint is very small. It uses a single tank for both, so the remaining question is, how long will it last. That will be the deciding issue. For now it is the right pot for us.",
