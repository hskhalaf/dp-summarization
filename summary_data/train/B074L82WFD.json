Pro: Great Size Lip on the front to trap litter is a great idea Easy to use - if the snaps work Con: The inside screen slips out of place. The latch on the back is hard to keep secured and when you tip the unit litter spills.",

The grate slats are wide enough that some waste pieces get stuck, resulting in only a half-clean each time. The clasps that hold it stuck feel fragile and are hard to snap into place, so I'm scared to disassemble it for a proper cleaning for fear they'll snap. It's a neat concept, but poorly executed.",

      "text": "We bought this box hoping it would encourage our 12yr old cat to use a litter box after randomly stopping 6mo ago. The box is HUGE, but it does give our cat plenty of privacy. Cleaning has been pretty simple, with the litter staying inside when tipping it over. However, the place our cat pees makes the litter stick to the front edge of the box, not allowing the clumps to fall over and into the drawer. Which means; I still need my spotted shovel to clean that portion out. The other issue is one of the clips is extremely hard to close. I don\u2019t think the top plastic lid and bottom box line up well on that side.",

      "text": "This litter box is amazing. Not only does it save me money on bags and litter but it does what it says right on the label. I was initially extremely skeptical and it took me a minute to figure out how to get it right but when it works it works. I\u2019m no longer throwing out fresh kitty litter with the bad by the bagful and it is easy to get rid of the drawer full of waste without tedious scooping. Only ding is I wish the drawer was not as flimsy; otherwise a great idea and product.",

In addition to that the clamps to seal the lid are extremely difficult to properly latch, and the contents pour out here and there. I use a walnut shell based litter, which was apparently too light for the grate system, because the poop drawer was full to the top with the litter product. It was pricey, and neither cat will use it.",

For instance: the sifting apparatus works well. The unforeseen issue is when you have a weird cat who likes to pee THROUGH the sifter, which creates clumps on the side where there shouldn't be any. You can get them out, but you have to disassemble the sifter, which involved getting your hands dirty in the literal sense. If there was an easier way to do this, and the sifting wall was a bit sturdier, it would be 5 stars",
