It drilled through the clay like it was soft loam, ripped through tree roots and piled all the dirt next to the hole. Just keep a firm grip on the drill, preferably with two hands, because this baby rips. I had so much fun. and so much time left over, that I ended up buying 150 daffs and 200 crocus bulbs. I am looking forward to spring and using this auger to plant my vegetable seedlings.",

This tool made the job so much easier- I was done in hours, not days. Suggestions: have as many batteries charged up as possible. I went through a lot! Do be very careful of the drill spinning quickly in your hand when it hits a rock. I used my legs to anchor the drill so my wrist wouldn't snap and ended up with bruises on the inside of my lower calf. I still think this Power Planter is well worth it.",

There is less than 2 feet of clearance under the deck, so I could not bring in a traditional auger or post hole digger. Removing deck boards was also not an option. So I tried this, and it far exceeded expectations. I ended up digging 20\" deep, 9\" diameter. This allowed me to break up the dirt, then remove by hand. I used a 10mm deep socket plus extensions to get the depth I needed.",

Well worth the cost, this is a very heavy chunk of metal that drilled through my packed clay ground with ease! The trick is going slow and lifting the auger up a little to clear some dirt out before pressing down again. Otherwise, in hard packed clay, the auger will just continue to drill down into the ground like a screw, instead of kicking out evacuated dirt/clay. The only thing that will slow auger down are large rocks and roots. Other than that, it burrows easily through everything!",

Only gripe with the auger is that is sometimes spun out of the drill, but not too often. The drill is very strong and thankfully has a dial to control the torque. The 2 handles feel a bit cheap and plastic, but minor issue.",

The one caution I'd offer is if you are covering lots of ground, get the longer version (24\") so you can drill all your holes without kneeling at each site. If you have a compact planter bed, the shorter version is less cumbersome to operate while sitting or kneeling. FWIW, I use a Dewalt 20v hammer drill with the side handle and the clutch set to 11. I can drill >25 holes 12\" deep in clay on a 3ah battery with a full charge. Planting was never so easy.",

      "text": "I used the Power Planter to drill large holes for bushes I was moving to a new area and it worked great. When I angled the power planter drill bit more horizontal to the ground, I used it to clear away weeds from the surface of the ground. Both uses worked like a charm. The drill bit is very sturdy. If it gets tangled around some deep roots, just reverse the drill rotation, and the Power Planter comes right out of the ground. It saved me lots of time. Buy this and you won't regret it!!!",
