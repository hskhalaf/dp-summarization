I am sure that in due course it will work but the amount of time needed to \"try this and try that\" is more than I feel I should spend on it. I am replacing my Drobo boxes and the difference between installing those and this box is very marked. Having said that, it runs silently and is unobtrusive.",

You can see however that compared to the size of a box of matches that it is very compact. And importantly for me, it is almost silent even when it is fully active. It was also comparatively easy to set up even for me \u2013 and I\u2019m no IT expert. It\u2019s been running for about a month now and we\u2019ve had no problems whatsoever. We use it for transferring video files but it can also be helpful as an extra drive for holding archived material.",

In the six months I've had my drive I can't pretend that everything has gone without a hitch, but the minor trouble I have had has been sorted out with speed and professionalism by Terramaster's Technical Support (In particular Lingo & Gina). In summary I would certainly recommend the Terramaster F2-421 - 5 stars!",

Before that I had a Toshiba NAS, which also failed in a very short time. If you're going to buy any sort of dedicated NAS system, it needs to be Enterprise Quality hardware, otherwise you're wasting your time!
