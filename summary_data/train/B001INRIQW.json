He really enjoys being able to see out the window of our Outback and it is cozy, but he finds it quite comfortable. My dog weighs about 20lbs and has a long body but fits quite nicely in there.It also feels very stable and secure. Easy setup and break down if needed.",

This has helped so much! She is high enough where she can see out and I added some towels/padding so she feels secure and doesn't flop around. I probably shouldn't use it in the passenger seat but i do and it's great to be able to pet her and see her. Also, since the booster is elevated from the seat, the passenger airbag doesn't turn on. She curls up in the skybox and falls right to sleep now!",

It is safe with his saparate seat belt that can connects to his hardness/leash. Even though when we make short trip, we don't have to lock him there. Recently, I brought him to long 7 hr drive trip and he had wonderful time with us on the way. Love it!",

My Yorkie only weighs 11 lbs. but he tends to put his paws on the front of the seat and gradually he has pushed it down. The back stays up good, but the front is only about half the height of the back.",

He likes to rest his little head on it when he's tired, and although he's on the higher end of the weight maximum, there's still enough room for him to curl into a ball if he'd like. He tried escaping several times but the restraint firmly held him in place. Another great product, Kurgo. Thank you!",

I keep it since it seems for the price range that it was as good as others available. However, I think you should get what you pay for and not a different product.",

You can have it lower and sitting on your actual car seat or higher up if you have a small dog so they can enjoy the view. My 5 month old pup slept in it for over 3 hours! Definitely worth it!",

I will be watching my chihuahuas for safety to make sure it does not collaspe on them during trips. The bottom has a piece of cardboard under the lining which is very cheap so I will replace this with a better item. The straps and buckle are long enough which I appreciate. The tether is heavy duty. Why did the company take short cuts on the overall frame is beyond me. Will not recommend.",

He gets excited when we go through drive thrus so he repeatedly jumps on the arm rest, to the back seat, to the back window, back through and on his car seat. They eventually tear or the bottoms fall out. So I got this one. It is well made. I like the buckles . . . you flip, insert and pull. Neat take on that. My dog didn't have an adjustment period either. He knew what it was and how to lie down in it too.",

The side pocket is perfect for storing her extendable lead and \"good neighbor bags\" for potty stops. My dog weighs under 10 pounds, but I believe the carseat would comfortably hold a somewhat larger dog. I also found that I did not have to remove the carseat if I have a human passenger because the carseat folds up against the passenger seat enough that a rider can sit back and wear the seatbelt for a short distance.",

Finally, the passenger air bag turns off when he rides, probably something to do with his weight.",
