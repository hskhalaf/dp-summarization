If you are the thick sock kinda person I would size a half size up. I took off the break which came off quite easy. Replaced the axels with a shorter one and got the perfect skates. They're very comfortable and I've done several pleasant rides.......many more will come.",

Plus they have half sizes which is hard to come by. Super smooth ride, big, sturdy wheels. There is a little unnecessary piece of stretchy mesh with fishing twine in it across the tongue on the boot that I found made unlacing a bit difficult with my long nails so I clipped it out and that didn\u2019t affect the blades in any way but definitely making them easier to remove.",

It does have some ankle fatigue when first getting used to them, but I\u2019ve adapted and now can blade for hours. Definitely worth the money.",
