I ordered this recommended unit and was shocked at how unusable it is. The seat is designed to fit the toilet and not the human body. It's like sitting on an oval razor blade. The inside seat ring itself is too narrow, I ended up taking the seat off the Kohler toilet in our guest room and using it. That one came with the same toilet and it is perfect. HEY KOHLER......IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT. Your line is too high end for this foolishness.",

Both of us think the seat angle (the slope from the outer edge to the inside edge) is too step and thus puts a pressure point on the outside of your legs. It's better than sitting on a 5 gallon bucket but not a lot better. If I didn't feel stupid for returning a used toilet seat I would. I have never experienced this kind of problem on any toilet seat I have ever used in my 53 years. I mean how hard is it to design a toilet seat? Seriously, how hard is it?",
