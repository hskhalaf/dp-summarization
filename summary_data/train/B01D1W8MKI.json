I thought if I put the machine on a Rubbermaid pan it would help by catching the \"small\" amount of water, but it wasn't a small amount! The think leaks so much!

Not sure if it is worth the time and money for another piece of junk. I've bought dehumidifier after dehumidifier and they all have an early death. This one is identical to one I bought before but they changed the name of the unit so you'd buy another one. Why can't anyone make a unit that works for at least five years? Last one was an Arctic Aire but it was the same unit and also failed early.",

Pulled the plug on it at 3:30 this morning for the last time...can't carry it to the dump fast enough. Don't buy this item!!! Update: Warranty states within 6 months of purchase they will replace or issue full refund of purchase price. I purchased a GE replacement and requested the refund but am still on \"ignore\" 5 months later.",
