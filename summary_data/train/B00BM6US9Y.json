I experimented with a bunch of ingredients around the house and can now make my perfect hot sauces and something similar to lizano sauce. I didn't know it was going to be this easy. Nothing about it is hard, but set aside 30 minutes to an hour and be prepared to let it cure for a couple of weeks. It's fun, it's delicious and it will add a new skill to your cooking.",

Just a forewarning - the boiling step creates steam that may sting the eyes if yours are sensitive so I'd recommend opening a window or wearing glasses/goggles during that step. The hotsauce was delicious and even though we used all the ingredients it came with we still use the bottles, funnel & recipes because we loved them so much!",
