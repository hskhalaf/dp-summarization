Have them resoled with a Vibram sole and get some fused tip laces and they will last you years like mine. I realize these boots never claimed to be hiking or outdoor boots but thats the impression they give. If you want them for such use looks for something else. Again, still a decent boot.",

The lace up design allows me to feel secure and versatile in mobility while the lined, cushioned interior insures that my feet feel supported. This is an excellent shoe.",

The tongue is coming apart from the shoe as the stitching is poorly done (other reviews comment on the tongue as well). The sole also has worn out extremely fast, it is a very soft rubber compound. While the soft rubber makes it comfortable, its just wears down fast. I can live with the sole wearing out, but never had I purchased shoes that stitching failed before the sole. This is especially bad for a shoe that the sole wears down so fast. Would I buy these again- definitely not.",

Don't forget that with boots like this, you're supposed to wear thick socks, so that makes it a good fit for me in in the 10.5s. Overall, though, great look, good quality, and comfortable. I've only worn them twice, but I expect them to continue molding to my feet (benefit of leather).",

So far I've probably put a good 150 miles of trails on these bad boys and they are just as comfortable as the day I first put them on. They require no break in since they are already super soft. My only gripe is they wear much faster than any shoe/boot I've ever owned.",
