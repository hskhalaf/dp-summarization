Will all models, even though there is a 5 year warranty, Sunbeam charges you shipping to their warehouse and may not be able to repair the blanket or return you a blanket in a different color.

      "text": "I was skeptical about ordering this product and looked around at like blankets in local stores before deciding to trust the other customer ratings I read. The price point was also too good to pass up. I figured if it didn't work I would simply return it to Amazon. I am so glad I purchased this blanket! It is warm and layers perfectly under my existing bedding. The auto shut off feature, many levels of heat, and dual controllers are wonderful benefits. I highly recommend it. I am ready for old man winter now.",

I did lots of research before buying a heated blanket & this is the one I decided to go with and I'm glad i did! The remote wires is a bit of a pain only bcuz they get tangled easily. There are 2 remotes & each one has 2 wires coming out of it. Other then that the blanket keeps you nice and warm & the remotes don't get hot.",

This has dual temperature controllers and you can set one side to 10 and the other to 1 (or off completely) to allow for dissimilar temperature preferences. One the highest setting this thing will pump out considerable heat - unbearably hot after about 5 minutes. I usually turn it on to the medium setting (5/10) about 5-10 minutes before I get into bed to take the chill off the bed (so I'm not getting into a cold bed) and then turn it off as soon as I'm getting into bed. It's great.",
