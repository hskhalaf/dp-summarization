I'm not expecting it to last as long as other grills I've owned. But for the price it's great. I lined the drip pan with Aluminum to aid in collecting oil, salts and burn food to make the thin medal last longer. Cleaned the burner shields in the dish washer to make them last. So far so good.",

The hot fire box fell to the gas line and tank. Thankful not one was hurt. This is a deficiency of quality. Based on use and care this should not have occurred. The rest of the grill is in perfect condition. This a severe safety hazard. And should be addressed by the manufacture and it vendor who they source from.",

It holds about 8 hamburger patties on the lower grill and a dozen or so hot dogs on the top rack so it can hold a lot of food. Most of the grills this size only have 2 burners so finding this one with 3 was great and helps the food cook faster and more evenly. The drop down sides make it compact for smaller outdoor spaces and makes it really easy to cover. Well worth the price!",
