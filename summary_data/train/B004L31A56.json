In the middle of a jungle wildlife sanctuary, we could see and hear mosquitoes all around us, and walked out without a bite. Best of all, it's neither as greasy nor as smelly as most serious DEET-based products I've used previously. Two tips: a little goes a very long way; we spread it thin, and it lasted for hours. And, since it's not a spray, make sure to cover some easy-to-forget places, like the back of your hands (where I did get a couple of bites) -- remembering to reapply if you wash them!",

I have had a flea problem in my house for months, and even though I have used flea bombs 3 times now, they still show up. I kept 2 cats inside, but when I started letting them onto the screened porch, they both got fleas. My friend friend took them while he bombed the house the first time, and still has them. He says they are not biting or scratching at all there. Maybe I am bringing them inside from the yard after working in the gardens. In any case, this cream has been a godsend for me!",

The reason I know it worked is because on the day I ran out of Ultrathon, I got 20 mosquito bites almost instantly. I tried borrowing some spray deet from a friend and that did not work nearly as well as the ultrathon. From now on I will be taking double the amount I think I'll need for trips abroad and at home!",
