Soooo easy to assemble, arrived yearly, the color is amazing, and they took absolute perfect care in packaging! The only thing is the texture of the table is raw, I think. I ran my hand over it and didn\u2019t get any splinters but I\u2019m debating putting a sealer on the top. But still, 5 Stars!!",

The look is amazing, the benches are sturdy, the table moves a bit at first but once it's settles on in it's pretty sturdy. I assembled this item alone with four kids under 5 at home, so to say it's easy is an understatement. Definitely a little bulky since the benches don't fit under the table itself. Not an issue if you have the space. I ordered additional chairs for the ends, but totally not necessary. My husband and 3 of our kids can share one bench pretty easily. I would totally buy it again!",

I would have hoped that there was more care for paying customers and perhaps a faster way to send the missing part. The table though is very nice; does need a protective coat.",
