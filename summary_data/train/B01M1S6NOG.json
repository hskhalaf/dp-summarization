      "text": "We eat a lot of avocados in our house. Usually at least 1-2 a day. So I already had my avocado slicing, pitting, and scooping pretty much down to a science, and I was skeptical that this tool would make my life any easier. I was wrong. It literally slices through the avocado skin SO easily, and the pitter is super simple to use without any mess. The scooper works really well, but is maybe not as clean as doing a dice and scoop, which will still be my go to for certain instances, like a mixed salad. Overall, I'm very pleased!",

In comes this tool. The product pictures don't accurately portray the pitter. See my picture to understand the pitting tool a little better. It literally grabs it so you can just pull it out. The gap on the other side makes it so you can pop it off without worrying about cutting your finger. The slicer works perfectly, I will need some practice for scooping but it still works pretty smoothly. My mother-in-law took one look at mine and ordered one for herself!",

They are so easy to cut, so I figured that part would work. It did. The seed removal worked, too! Much safer and no worries. Slicing - well, that pretty much depends on ripeness. I\u2019ve had just perfect slices, and I\u2019ve had some that came out leaving nothing in the Shell - but better spreadable than sliceable. Holding up good so far, with a quite reasonable cost. Works for me!",

It's a little messy to use at first since, but I think that's a matter of practice. Still not 100% about how to use the pit function but here's how I do it: smack dat pit *hard* with the teeth pointing down, then twist the pit out. You can push the pit out through the opposite side of the teeth. The biggest bummer is that the \"comb\" side is hard to clean out when hand washing. Otherwise a very handy little tool.",
