It also starts to flash red once it's about to be completely drained. It charges quickly, and it holds the charge for quite some time.",

Worked as hoped and price was right. The carrying bag is nice to keep everything together. As noted, it is heavier than you might think given size; not a problem, but something to know so you aren't surprised.",

Also, a wall charging cord would probably be faster but I don't know that for sure.

The li-ion battery warrants a better life if you re-charge the device after using it for a full charge. Li-Ion batteries like to be stored at full charge, don't work like older batteries requiring full discharge. Li-Ions perform well when discharged to around 20-40% any lower and it can harm the battery. Feel free to ask me questions on battery practices if you have any!

Cons: - You can't tell how much charge is left in the device. - It seems like all of these batteries have about 30% energy losses from transmitting the power across batteries so don't expect to get 3000mAh into your device - if you want something that can charge your phone multiple times you will need a larger battery.",

I only gave it 4 stars because I have used it only once. I appreciated all the reviews and those that answered the questions I had. The only thing I didn't like was I did not receive a packing receipt, that lists the items purchased and prices which I would need to prove purchase.",

I deducted one star because the adapter it comes with has a standard USB connection which does not work with my iPhone4 even though the advertisement says it does. I purchased a compatible adapter separately that did to make it work.",
