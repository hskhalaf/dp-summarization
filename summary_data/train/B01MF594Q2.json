I keep having glitches with random shots. Could be me with banging clubs together or it could be the defibrillator Installed in my chest that is causing interference. We are sorting all that out now. Again, the support has been tremendous and I am sure we will find the solution to the problems.",

Game golf gave me a whole set of extra sensors and their product works well. I wanted this product to work well but with the driver putter and two irons not working, it's useless. Even if they are replaced, I am worried that won't last more than a few rounds. Update: I received a new set of tags and the putter tag STILL DOES NOT WORK.",

What he told me was challenging was the sensitivity of the putter. He often has to go in at the end of the round to edit the number of putts taken but apparently this is very easy to do. In my mind, this was a successful gift for my otherwise picky golf loving husband.",

    "description": "Arccos 360 is golf's first and only automatic on-course shot-tracking system, allowing golfers of all skill levels to harness the power of their data and AI to play smarter and shoot lower scores. Winner of the 2017 Golf Digest Editor's Choice Award for \"Best Game Analyzer,\" it features 14 ultralight sensors - one for every club in your bag that pair with a smartphone app. And the data doesn't lie: Arccos users improved their handicap by an average of 3.55 strokes in 2017 . USER BENEFITS: Get AI-powered Caddie Advice for every shot, on every hole . Know your exact distance to any point on the course- Learn precisely which club to use in every situation- Identify your actual strengths and weaknesses . SYSTEM FEATURES- Ultralight, low-profile sensors- Battery designed to last 5 year- Power saving mode- Enhanced shot-detection algorithm . Arccos 360 is compatible with iPhone 5S and above, and select Android devices running marshmallow and above that include a Gyroscope and accelerometer. Product usage : Our product requires that the user play golf with their phone in their front pocket and golfers often leave their phone in their cart or bag, or in their back pocket which leads to missed shots. Our system also intentionally deletes a shot if two shots are detected in the same location (to avoid false-positives) but if a user is a poor golfer and hits 2 shots from the same location because they fail to advance the ball beyond 5 yards, they may report a \"missed shot\", but the product is functioning as expected in those situations",
