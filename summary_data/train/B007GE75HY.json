Her older siblings even like them and have helped her built items. I especially like the part that comes with the wheels because you can actually use it to build a vehicle.

I purchased for the 1 year old and she immediately began to play with them however it wasn't long before the other 2 joined in to build items. It has a perfect amount of blocks and they are easy to attach. Good Buy, it keeps them busy.",

BUT I wish I had gone with the Lego Duplo because the size of the rounded tops are perfect for him to suck on and he wanders around the house trying to use them as pacifiers. As a result, a lot of the single block pieces are now slightly misshapen and don't hold well to other pieces. I've noticed the tops of the Lego Duplo blocks are different and I think he would find them less appealing as makeshift pacifiers.",

These blocks definitely help them to advance fine motor skills.These help children with hand & eye coordination as they are playing.They help children to recognize the primary colors in early age & then building different objects when they get little older I would highly recommend these blocks.

Because of the size, they are very easy to find and clean up and unlike the regular sized legos, you can't really step on them and injure yourself in the process :)",
