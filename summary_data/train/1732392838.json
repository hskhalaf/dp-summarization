At end of each chapter their are tests and vocabulary matching exercise, longer tests at end of study guide. More free tests available in front of book, after you go to link. (You will need to sign up for an account on PM Learning Website though. You will need Amazon shipping/tracking # to activate, so keep that number handy, otherwise you have to contact customer service in book). Belinda's company also provides boot camp and cram review as well. Over all, I think this is a great study tool.",

If it's not included, also get her quick study guide, it has a great recommended dump sheet that definitely helped me. I just passed the PMP on October 2018, super applicable to version 6 of the PMBOK.",
