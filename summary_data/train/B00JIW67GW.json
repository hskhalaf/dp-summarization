I bought this one, but when it arrived, I noticed two things: (1) the walls of the unit seems thinner than the one I already owned, and (2) I really disliked the screw lid on the \"Home\" series versus the one on the \"Outback.\" It's rather flimsy whereas the Outback is solid. I used it for about three days before initiating a return. I bought the comparable size from the Outback series () and haven't been happier. I do like the dimensions/footprint of the Home container I returned better than the Outback container.",

The size is actually deceiving - you wouldn't think it would hold as much. Price on Amazon was $20.00 cheaper than my local Petco.",
