We've had it 9 years and use it 10 times a day at least, so very good to have lasted so long. If you want a bean-to-cup coffee machine that basically just makes espresso and has a steam wand, then this is the machine for you. This later version of the model has an ECO setting, on by default, but otherwise is just the same as the old version. Would thoroughly recommend this machine to anyone, does the job well and is damned good value too.",
