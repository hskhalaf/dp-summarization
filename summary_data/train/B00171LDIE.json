That said, the shoe\u2019s true-to-size fit, excellent comfort, and remarkable waterproofing also deserve people\u2019s valuable attention. Unfortunately, this footgear is dogged by a few criticisms, the most objectionable of which has to be its below-average grip performance. All in all, the Siren Edge Q2 Waterproof has enough strengths to be considered a decent hiker, especially if used exclusively on well-groomed trails and non-slippery surfaces.",

        "The lightness of the Siren Edge Q2 Waterproof was given aces by a good number of reviewers, which include a footgear critic by profession",

        "This Merrell footwear was applauded by about a handful of users for its amazing ability to repel wet elements",
        "Some verified buyers expressed their deep appreciation of the hiker\u2019s immensely comfortable confines",
        "A wearer successfully broke in this shoe with very little effort and time"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "The Merrell Siren Edge Q2 Waterproof was criticized by a couple testers for its subpar surface traction",

They have lots of room around the toes, while still gripping at the heel, and not feeling sloppy. I would highly recommend these shoes, and luckily the returns were free.",
