This model DOES NOT come with a folding handle. The photo that shows handle in resting upright position is wrong. It stays horizontal and sticks way out for storage. I called customer service at Field King and spoke to a Customer Service Rep who gave me wrong information, then her supervisor who took no responsibility for this and blamed the wrong description on Amazon. Very poor customer service. This is listed as \"Amazon's Choice\". I hope they remove that recommendation. They don't deserve it.",

      "text": "Honestly, one of the stupidest designs for a handle on this backpack sprayer. Does not fold completely up or down for storage. Sticks out a good foot and a half in front the sprayer so that you cannot store the sprayer flat anywhere, definitely not hanging against a wall. Takes up a lot more space than necessary. And the handle is bolted on (not quick release) so you don\u2019t even have the option of easily removing the handle for storage. Gave 2 stars because it works well but seriously, I don\u2019t care how it works- the handle design makes it extremely inconvenient to store.",

The backpack was far better than the smaller sprayer I've used in the past. The long pump extension made it easy to keep the pressure in the tank. I am extremely happy with my purchase.",

Be warned, make sure there is no liquid in the wand when stored for winter in subfreezing areas. It will crack.",

      "text": "Over the years I have purchased many small portable pump-up sprayers at Walmart, Home Depot and other places, but I ended up throwing each one away after one or two years. I finally did some research and paid the extra $$ for this sprayer. What an amazing difference! Should have gone this route long ago, but live and learn. Now I feel like Tim Taylor on the TV series, \"Home Improvement.\" :)",

      "text": "I purchased this sprayer based on a previous review that said it could reach 20'. We have crab apple trees that need treatment, and this sprayer did a great job when used with the brass nozzle. The pump action is easy to operate, and the spray reaches to the top of the trees. I found it very comfortable to wear, and no leaks. Very easy to clean up after (hint - there is an in-line filter that needs to be cleaned inside the wand handle - easy to remove.). Very well made. This is a great tool! Highly recommend it.",
