I intend to use these are driving and commuter gloves for 3 out of 4 seasons. I will produce an update in the spring or summer to determine their reliability. Early update: these gloves will work on your smartphone for typing. Also, the leather is very soft. That's a word of caution.",

Pushing it down into my wrist is uncomfortable. Velcro may be better. 2) Not the glove's fault but it doesn't quite have the grip on my steering wheel that I would have preferred. The steering wheel is leather but very smooth so it's more difficult for the glove to grab it. Overall, still glad I bought them and will continue to use.",

If they were new, I would probably give it a 5. It fits perfectly and feels nice, doesnt get sweaty in 80 degree heat, and easy to take on and off. Just be wary before buying, I am pleased using it, just wish it didnt feel like someone else used it first.",
