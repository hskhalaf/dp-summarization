After getting plastic tubing from Menards that would bend, I put plastic PVC sections into the ground, inserted the ends of the tubing into in, and bent it into a U-shapped form over the plants. I then put this stuff over it and fastened it to the tubing, and it worked GREAT. Water and sunshine went through for good growth, but the bugs, butterflies and caterpillars couldn't get it, so the kale grew perfectly into December in Indiana. FANTASTIC. Will do this every year from now on, and with other crops!!",
