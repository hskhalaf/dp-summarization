It also fit my Dagger Halifax 17 (but was a bit looser, and easier to remove than the Tsunami). I really do like the zipper. I can enter and exit without removing the skirt from the kayak. It is also nicer to have down here in Florida, so when my legs get too hot , can unzip the skirt and air out the cockpit.",

It was a little tricky trying to attach the front while keeping the back attached as the cockpit on this kayak is long but I was able to do it. The cover kept me completely dry during my day out and made it much more enjoyable. I did not find any issues with water pooling on the cover. I would highly recommend this product.",
