I have found a refurbished scansa fuze and am replacing this item sansa clip. I will probably look for more of the old fuze to hold as back up when this refurb is worn out. If you want an FM receiver, bypass this \"clip\" and go for a refurbished Sansa Fuze. You will not go wrong.",

Further, the unit will more or less at random decide not to play certain songs, but then decide to play them once they're re-loaded. This happened on both Clips I've had. When this one broke I spent the money on a Shuffle, which is working alright so far.",

      "text": "The best thing about this product is the open formats it supports. This includes not only files like ogg, flac, and mp3 files but also the fact that it uses a standard mini-usb port for both charging and file transfer and also a mini SD card to expand the memory. That means you can charge it with many standard mobile phone chargers. The gui is good too allowing you to navigate by folder OR by artist. This is really good if you organize your files by folder. Also, it has a RADIO. Battery life appears a bit short, meaning that you may not be able to leave it on all day.",

I like that I can expand it with larger sdhc cards. The only potential cons are that it doesn't look very durable, though I haven't had it very long and haven't tested that, and it's so small I worry it will get lost. It looks a lot bigger in the pictures, but in real life it's about twice the size of a iPod shuffle.",

Sound Quality: The quality is OK at low volume but I could feel a lot of distortion when I increased the volume. Also the FM receiver doesn't seem to be of good quality. Even in open spaces mobility causes distortion in the reception. earplugs look cheap so I will try changing them and hopefully it should make some difference.",

Though I never used the player for outdoor activity gym etc, and handled it carefully, the headphone jack at the player became faulty after 4 months. However, Sandisk replaced the player immediately.",

Took me the longest time to get an MP3 player, home laptop or smart phone (kids have all 3) or a GPS (wife does). So wanted to buy an MP3 player with good recording capability for a child who is getting voice lessons (Indian classical music) -- very very easy to use (yes, an 8-year old can use it:-), transfer files to laptop, replay music. Probably a host of features I'm not using, but for what I needed, it was perfect. [Troglodyte at large]",

The software navigation is a bit counter-intuitive, and it took a while to figure out how to get a playlist installed, though. Other than these small annoyances, the MP3 player is great.",
