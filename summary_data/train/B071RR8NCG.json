However, the speed, large 5.5 screen and battery charge on this phone was a welcome upgrade. Update: December 5, 2018. Since many people rely on my opinion and subjective experience, I want to say the phone is remarkable for my purposes and is holding up beautifully! I also want to add that charging the phone is fast, really fast! I usually charge it when it's done to 50%. I suggest the same combination I purhcased IF you have have cell towers close by. I use Tracfone as my prepaid service.",

As it interfaces for charging via a small USB-2 port, its not compatible with Gear and other USB-C VR headsets. I use it with Cardboard VR, and with a drone controller, all to great effect.

The processor is snappy and the screen is bright and clear. Battery life is excellent. I use a 32 gig mini card and have thousands of songs on it with plenty of room left. The camera is not great but more than adequate for every day snapshots and it has a lot more features than the camera on the Alcatel did. I love this phone.",

I replaced an LG ultimate 2 with this Galaxy J7, It is much faster and so far I love how it responds to my touch.",
