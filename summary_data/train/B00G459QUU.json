      "title": "Excellent tablet with limited memory",
      "text": "Every think works on this tablet apart from the keyboard which often does not pop up or down requiring extra tap. The WIN 8 is different than WIN 7 and takes some getting used to. There seems to be more steps for doing the same thing which could be done much more easily on WIN 7. I am astonished by electronics pricing in EU they seem to be nearly 40-50% more than the US prices and for this at least manufacturers should put extra memory in European models. It remains beyond my understanding why the consumers in so called social welfare states of EU are ripped off more than the US.",

Hardware is a bit cheap. It's a little heavy, sound is tinny. Windows 8 needs a lot of work, but the upcoming Windows 10 looks promising. This all said, the tablet is fast with a good display. If you're looking for a cheap Windows tablets, this is a good bet, especially for work. However, most consumers would be better served by rival android tablets at this price point.

They suggested it was Amazon's fault for buying bulk and getting them cheaper?? Amazon offered me a no quibble replacement immediately (great service as usual), but don't see any point as the replacement won't have the veriface either! Apart from the aforegoing the tablet performs very well, especially with the IVSO keyboard (provided, just a shame that companies like Lenovo still get away with treating their customers with complete indifference.",
