Second and most irritating is that there are no numbers on the remote and you must use the up and down arrows to change the channel.

I run my windows with 150% UI size and that works pretty well, and it gets much better as you increase that zoom, so its a trade off clarity vs screen space. I kept a standard 1080 monitor on the side for when reading is critical... This main screen is for entertainment games and youtube, roku, etc. Works great.",

Regardless, I'm more than happy with the picture and have not noticed any motion blurring or anything like that. IMO this is a killer 50\" smart tv for an absolute steal of a price!

      "text": "I bought two of these for my artwork workstation. I don't watch TV or play video games. The screens are really good. I use one to view my artwork and the other for coding. The setup, with my somewhat old GTX960 graphics card, was tedious. I could not get one of my GTX960 cards to work but another works fine (a different brand). A pair of ACTIVE Display-Port to HDMI converters and HDMI cables are necessary. The more subtle image adjustments are on menus that are rather buried but the manufacturer responded quickly to my question and I can make the adjustments I need. I'm going to buy another pair of these for a second workstation.",

My only bone is a minor one: the remote control only works if it is pointed exactly at the TV. Gone are the days when you can just point the remote anywhere or bounce it off a wall. I'm not sure why they decided to make it so directional, but I suspect it was done on purpose. Anyway, it's quite different from most remotes and takes a little adjustment.",

The HDMI connectors are /really/ close together. I was unable to plug-in an Amazon FireStick 4k and also plug-in a regular HDMI in the adjacent port. My fix: use an HDMI extension cable for the FireStick. 2. The infrared receiver LED is located in the middle of the TV. I use a soundbar, which blocks the IR receiver and is troublesome. My solution: place blocks under the legs of the TV to raise it ~4\", so it can receive IR signals from the remote.",
