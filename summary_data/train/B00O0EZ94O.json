You do need to have the HUB in order to be able to control these lights though. If installing in any ceiling fans you do need to leave the switch on in order to be able to turn these on or off from your cell phone. These seem great for any kind of lamps that you can just leave plugged in.",

You can install it for the side lamps too but they are better off for ceiling. The install and set up didn't take that long either. I bought an extra bulb since iI have 3 ceiling fan bulbs to replace. Even though iI was hoping them to be white lights as iI consider that more over yellow, iI was really glad with this. The bridge (connecting device it comes with) can be configured to add 50 bulbs. That's pretty good",
