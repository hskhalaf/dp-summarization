I paired this product with colored spray (made for root touch ups between colors) to help camouflage the white of my scalp. It is amazing how the CUUVA hair fibers clinged onto the little bit of hair I had left and created an illusion of having a full head of hair. I just wish I would have saved the $700 I spent on a wig and found this first!",
