Unfortunately, there are NO instructions that come with the device, so you have to figure these things out on your own. That would be my only complaint. For me, this activity tracker works great.",

      "text": "Very disappointed. Good idea, crappy device. Bought in February, 2015. First battery (6 month life it says) died after 1 month. Replaced it, 2nd battery made it about 6-8 weeks. Updating firmware, resetting device on my phone, and all the other things the site recommends didn't work. It's now been through 4 \"6 month\" batteries in less than 10 months. Now it won't work correctly at all, even with a new battery. Will turn on, count that you've walked a few steps, than resets to zero. Won't pair with phone anymore, either. All the remedies their site suggested didn't help. I would not buy this again, and suggest you save your money.",

Yes, the Fitbit Zip is well priced. But they eventually get you. The rubber clip is NOT designed to last and you basically pay a recurring price of $20 every 9-12 months. I also searched all around. It zip holder costs about $18 on ebay. $14.95 at the Fitbit store but $20 plus change after shipping and tax. I can't seem to find any other cheaper seller or alternative. Other listings here in Amazon and ebay frequently priced it above $25... pretty crazy in my humble opinion.",

Today, with a full battery, I walked briskly for 60 minutes with someone whose pedometer recorded roughly 7000 steps. My Fitbit? Only 1100. Why have I bought so many? Because the older models would at least count your steps before they fell apart. This one hasn't fallen apart but it has stopped counting many of my steps. This is my last Fitbit.

If you are as busy as I am get the wrist version It's a clip on and sometimes I leave it on clothes and almost throw into the laundry ones. It can fall down (thankfully the excellent barista at Peet's found it and guessed it was mine) If I lose this, I will definitely buy the charger.",
