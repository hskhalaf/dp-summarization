Three covers come in the package; 2 side and one front rail cover. Very easy to put on, fits the rail and has a waterproof backing. They also are made of fleece and padded.

I love how thick and soft it is because it also acts as a cushion for a sleepy standing baby at night. Also the waterproof bottom layer is a nice touch.",

I do find the ties are very thick and too short to make bows so I had to tie knots to keep them in place. Overall it will do the job but they could improve the tie and holes on them.",

They also hold securely, I had to untie one of the straps and I had a difficult time doing it, I just used a standard single knot. Nice rich color, my son loves to run his little hands across it too, lets hope he doesn't start chewing on it!",

I really appreciate that the fleece is thick enough for protection but not too thick so that my boy is able to solidly grab on the rails while he's learning to stand on his own. It's also great that the wraps are washable. Overall, a great product.",

There is a very slight colour mismatch between the 1-pc long cover and the 2-pc short covers, but only the pickiest people would ever notice when it's in use. I did notice a plastic odour as other reviewers have noted, but this disappeared by the time the product had finished air-drying before first use.",

I especially like that the ties are long - the bumper ties were too short, and I was always struggling to tie and retie to change sheets. I would definitely recommend.",
