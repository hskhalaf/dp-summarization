These trainers are super light weight which is what I've been needing. I'm a size 10.5 and trainer weight is 260g. All my Nike running shoes are over 300g which is a huge difference when it comes to speed and comfort. Trainers are of course personal preference but for me these are the best I've bought in years. I've just ordered 2 more pairs now before they stop making them.",
