Also, although the packaging looked intact, there are a pair of noticeable dimples right on the front edge of the unit, almost dead center on the leading edge to the left of the buttons. Nothing was visible under the blue film, but the issue is obvious without it. Not sure if it\u2019s due to a manufacturing defect or handling during packaging.",
