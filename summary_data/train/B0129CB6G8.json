As long as there\u2019s no issue with the tip coming unglued or other manufacturing problem, this appears to be just as good, just as attractive (but different), and cheaper than the Oxo product.

It's also nice that the muddler is dishwasher safe. Also, I like saying \"muddler\"",

Professional bartenders will tell you that the muddler is one of their most indispensable tools. The muddler is essential for thoroughly blending the flavors of herbs, spices and fruits used in many popular cocktails. The Mojito, Mint Julep, old Fashioned and Capipiroska all require muddling to make them taste fabulous! This \"muddling\" of the ingredients brings forth a burst of flavor when the alcohol is poured into the glass over the mixture.\n\nTraditional muddlers are made out of lacquered wood, which often, over time, becomes difficult to clean and can lead to polluting your drinks. This new modern version is made of stainless steel which will remain beautiful and never add unwanted tastes to your drinks. It has a grooved nylon head for through mashing (muddling) of ingredients.\n\nA well-stocked bar includes fine liquor and all the bartender's tools, so don't forget your HQY muddler. It may well inspire you to open up a cocktail book and try a new drink.\n\nSatisfaction Guaranteed!\n\nTo ensure your complete satisfaction we also back our product with a 30 day replacement guarantee!\n\nBe ready for your next cocktail party and order your HQY muddler today!",
