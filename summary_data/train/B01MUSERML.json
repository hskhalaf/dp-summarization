We thought we\u2019d splurge for an expensive camera so we wouldn\u2019t have to buy another one again down the road, big mistake. Don\u2019t do it. Listen to the reviews.

When the camera cuts out the monitor beeps and SO DOES the camera! Which may wake baby! We are also disappointed that the function to speak into the monitor so baby can hear in their room does not work at all! The music function doesn\u2019t work either.",

The camera does not communicate with the display monitor (nor with the cell phone application). The pairing is no longer occuring and the blue led, that is located in the front, indicating the camera is connected is so weak, compared to what it was in the beginning. The problem appeared out of a sudden. It was working properly and, without a reason, stopped. I live in Brazil and the Technical Support Team states that this problem has no solution, and so, the infant monitor became useless withing a year.",
