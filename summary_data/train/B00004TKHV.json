There are countless attachments made for the bosch router, you won't go wrong with this one (unless you want the remote attachment too, then get the other one, but seriously it's like $80 more and unless you know what you're doing, you won't need it anyway)",

I installed it on my router table with a Smart Lift and changing the bits from the table top is so easy with the two wrenches provided. I think it has the best collet (self releasing)system. I just didn't realize how convenient the system is until I have actually experienced installing and removing bits. Got lots of power, and the variable speed control seems accurate, and has so far performed flawlessly.",

My biggest disappointment with the unit is that it does not come with a 1/8 inch collet. I did eventually manage to round up a 1/8 inch collet through a third-party seller, so in the end it all worked out-- for another $20 bucks.",
