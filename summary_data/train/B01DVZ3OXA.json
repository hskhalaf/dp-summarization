However, when this happened, I just lifted stylus manually to create a gap and split the tracks manually. For the price this is superb value for money!",

The cartridge is cheap and cheerful. In short hi fi it is not, but at the price what do you expect?",

Only weird thing was that you can hear the record ever so slightly when the needle is on the vinyl. Also once when converting a vinyl to MP3 the software may have crashed my laptop. Since then removed the software and will wait till I've finished my important work before re-installing and converting more records.",

Cons: cheap, plasticky transport (seems generic to everything in this price bracket). HOWEVER, the showstopper is that the concept of a Bluetooth vinyl player doesn\u2019t really work. The vinyl is acoustically audible at the player and the Bluetooth sound reproduction lags, meaning that you have a constant background noise of your music playing out of sync with what\u2019s coming from your speaker. Maybe OK if your speaker is in another room but needs wired speakers if you are going to listen anywhere near the deck itself.",

      "text": "been a long time since I've owned a record player - this one thankfully the cover fully encloses the record unlike my previous elcheapo deck, the only feature I find I would have liked is auto return on the stylus arm - on this turntable the arm reaches the end of the record and the deck will stop spinning and the stylus arm stays resting on the record. getting the the player to connect with my speaker took some time (as they say in the instructions) but once connected it works fine and sounds good",
