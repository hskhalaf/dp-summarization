That said, this hiking shoe is true to size BUT with a wonderful roomy toe box. It's well made, very light and I love the removable insole with great arch support. So far I only wore them on a regular/moderate hike but I'm looking forward to try them out on a more strenuous hike.",

They got 6 straight weeks of daily use, at least 8 hours a day, on a combination of trails, bush whacking, and rock climbing and are still in great shape. The insole is very comfortable and antimicrobial so you don't get any foot odor in the shoe. I'll definitely get another pair if these ever wear out.",

Although considered a hiking shoe, I wear them to town for running errands and grocery shopping. They're great for all day wear. I wear orthotics, and the insoles come right out to accommodate the orthotic. These are just the best shoes ever once you find the right size. My first pair are now \"yard shoes,\" and after several years they're a bit scuffed, but I haven't been able to wear them out.",

I suppose if I were using thick hiking socks they would have been ok, but in my opinion there is some inconsistency in how Merrell is sizing their shoes. Also they seemed a little too stiff for walking. I ended up buying some Rockports that I really like.",

I ordered a half size larger than I normally wear as was recommended, and I am glad I did. Itried hiking in them with just my normal athletic socks on and they felt okay (no exceptional pain), but with my awful feet, I bought some insoles for additional support, and now they feel much better. They are keepers and I can recommend them to anyone. Especially those ladies with normal feet!",
