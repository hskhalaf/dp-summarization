      "title": "The Best NEX IMO",
      "text": "I have owned almost every generation of the NEX cameras. I love this series of cameras from Sony. I like this better than the NEX7. It is so compact, but takes great photos. I have sold my Canon DSLR gear, and only use this now. I really wanted the WIFI capability and it works. But I think it is slow and clunky. Better than no WIFI, but I would only use in an emergency. Sony needs to hire an Apple SW engineer or something. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!!",

I bought two since the newer A6000 model came out, since you can get these for cheap now (new ones for <400) and what's the difference, a slightly slower shutter burst speed? The EVF is fantastic and has revolutionized my digital photography. I will never go back to trying to read the back of an LCD screen!",

My only caveat is that unlike the Nex-5 series or the Nex-7, this camera is mostly plastic which I was a tad disappointed about.

More often than not I will forget to turn off the camera after taking few pictures and this mistake may take half to whole battery in really short time. Camera is quite slow to focus. It's impossible to take candid shots. I'm coming from Canon SLR camp and had great hopes for small mirrorless alternative. Greatly disappointed :(",

Each is unique and each give you a new and exciting way to make your images and videos pop.\n\n6-image layering\nThe camera leverages the large, APS-C image sensor and captures six images in a fraction of a second. The camera then combines the data from the 6 different images up to ISO 25600 to create a single image. This method is used to control blur in Anti-Motion Blur mode or to get cleaner, sharper nighttime pictures in Hand-held Twilight mode.\n\n\nAccepts Sony\u00ae E-mount lenses\nCompatible with Sony\u2019s wide selection of E-mount series of smaller, lighter lenses designed specifically for \u03b1 compact interchangeable lens cameras.

Simply connect the bundled USB cable and recharge the battery without removing it from the camera, either via AC outlet or PC connection.\n\nNew Multi-Interface Shoe\nUnlike conventional cameras, the NEX-6 features a newly developed Multi-Interface Shoe that dramatically expands compatibility with Handycam\u00ae accessories, thus raising the potential for photo/movie shooting.\n\nAuto HDR built into camera\nHigh Dynamic Range (HDR) photography captures more scene contrast than a single exposure can handle by combining the best highlight detail from one shot and the best shadow detail from another for one incredible shot. Handles severe backlighting and other high-contrast scenes. Captures in a split second. (Recommended for still subjects.)\n\nSweep Panorama\u2122 Technology\nCapture expansive landscapes automatically. Press the shutter, sweep vertically or horizontally. The camera does the rest, continuously shooting images and stitching them together. Up to 23 MP image size. Up to 202 degrees maximum sweep angle (18mm focal length).\n\nFast Auto Focus\nSome cameras in this class are slow to focus. That can make you miss the shot on fast-moving subjects like sports and unpredictable subjects like pets and babies. Sony\u2019s fast Contrast Auto Focus system typically takes as little as 0.3 seconds and also offers continuous Auto Focus when shooting movies.\n\n\nPeaking AF display\nThe Peaking AF display makes precise manual focusing much easier by highlighting the edges that are in focus in your choice of three colors (white, red, or yellow). This is especially helpful during macro or portrait photography where your focal plane can make or break your shot.\n\nManual Focus Assist\nGreatly magnifies the viewfinder image when you touch the focus ring, making it easy to get razor-sharp images. Works with E-mount lenses only.\n\nEnhanced Tracking Focus\nTracking Focus continuously tracks a user-designated subject and is now more effective at tracking people. If the subject turns away from the camera, face-detection tracking automatically switches to subject tracking and continues tracking.\n\nFace Detection technology\nThe camera can automatically detect up to eight individual faces and adjust focus, exposure, white balance and flash to help deliver crisp, properly lit images of family and friends. Can prioritize children or adults. \n\nSmile Shutter\u2122 technology\nCaptures a smile the moment it happens. Simply select the Smile Shutter\u2122 mode and the camera takes the picture automatically. You can prioritize children or adults and adjust the smile sensitivity. \n\nDynamic Range Optimizer (DRO)\nImproves results with backlit subjects and recovers details hidden in shadows. Settings include Auto, Level with a choice of five operating levels and Off. \n\nSix Creative Style settings\nControl how the camera processes your images with six finishing styles: Standard, Vivid, Portrait, Landscape, Sunset and B&W. You can even fine-tune contrast, saturation, and sharpness to your personal taste. \n\nPhotoTV HD compatibility\nOptimizes compatible BRAVIA\u00ae televisions for gorgeous display of digital pictures.3 \n\nDual Format Media Card Slot\nFor cost-effective, convenient storage and sharing of your images, the camera accepts Memory Stick PRO Duo\u2122/Memory Stick PRO-HG Duo\u2122 and SD/SDHC media (Class 4 or higher recommended), (Memory card is required, all are sold separately). \n\nAnti-Dust Technology\nDust on the image sensor leads to blemishes in the picture. To protect the sensor, Sony incorporates an advanced ultrasonic system, which effectively shakes dust off the sensor surface. \n\n\n\nSony Suggested Accessories \n\n> Just-fit case for NEX-6 digital camera LCS-ELC6/B > System Soft Carrying Case LCS-SL10 > External Flash/Video Light HVL-F60M > E-mount to A-mount Lens Adaptor LA-EA2 > InfoLithium\u00ae battery for E-mount cameras NP-FW50 \n> AC Charger for NP-FW50 battery BC-VW1 \n\n\n\n1.
