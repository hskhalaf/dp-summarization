      "text": "This camera is brilliant for taking travel photos - it is lighter, less bulky than a full DSLR and you don't need to carry extra lenses. The 60 x optical zoom is great but you'll need to rest your arm on something when on maximum (I found the previous model SX50 zoom was enough). Have taken some shots in RAW format and used Canon editor which gave excellent results. Camera has many options so well worth reading the manual to get best results (or leave it on auto). Camera loses some quality in low light conditions so in this situation a DSLR camera will generally give better photos. See photos of the moon using zoom (taken 24th Feb 2018)",

With JPEGS you will have to play more with the settings to keep sharpness and exposure right particularly at full zoom. I do a lot of wildlife photography and use this camera for distance and close up shots, also carrying a dslr with 400mm zoom for the action shots as no long zoom bridge is going to find its target for fast moving objects in time.",

It worked well for a short while and then the zoom toggle became very stiff and I couldn't use the zoom smoothly at all and was unable to make fine adjustments. It eventually seized up altogether. Now back home and it appears to be working normally. I am wondering if it was affected by the hot weather,it was in the low 30sC but surely it should cope with that,it's not excessive.",

I have two criticisms 1) The usual beef about the skinflint savings made by manufacturers in having the user manual only in electronic/digital form . Nobody, absolutely nobody believes the hogwash about environmental issues, it is a simple cost saving and a great inconvenience to customers . 2) WHY OH WHY did they not include the Stitch Assist mode .I used it a lot on the SX50 and was gutted to find it missing from The SX60. For these reasons I can only give 4stars.",
