Switching power supply works just about anywhere in the world to power your unit...!\" YEA; ok- that's fine, but what they DONT tell you is that you CAN NOT adjust the clock if youre traveling \"just about anywhere in the world\". It automatically sets to one of the five U.S. timezones (Eastern, Central, Mountain, Pacific, Alaska or Hawaii). That's it! There's no option for any other timezones. So I'm overseas on a deployment and there's absolutely NO WAY to correctly set the time. I imagine it will be nice when I get back to the U.S. (in a year!). However, I'm really hoping they get their shyt together and patch a firmware update. It's outrageous!",

This device is not as functional as an Echo device. Some Alexa plug-ins go 'mute' when accessed through this device (meaning they do not speak through this device - as they do through a real Echo). This device also does not hear as well as a real Echo. You will find yourself speaking louder than usual and/or repeating yourself when addressing this device. At this price point, I would recommend you find an alternate solution. It looks exponentially better than it actually functions.",

It does odd things when beginning to play music -- stutters, delays -- which my Echo Dots don't have.

If you are going to be in the technology business, you need to support the products and customers. Very disappointed.",
