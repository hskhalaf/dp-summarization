Its clumsy but doable. Cons: - Double the price - Noisy - Stiff opening - Hard to pour milk out - Small label. No space to write quantity which is needed since it's impossible to tell how much the bag holds once frozen.",

My only issue is that I haven't figured out the best way to pour out the milk once I defrost them. So far cutting off the top, putting the bag through a bottle neck, and inverting seems to minimize loss. But the bags themselves are great for my needs as a busy student trying to keep my breast milk supply going.",

You can make a \u201cbrick\u201d of ~60oz (10x6oz bags) in a gallon ziplock usually with Lansinoh but only about a 40-50oz \u201cbrick\u201d with this one.

It is difficult sometimes to pour the milk out into the bottle, we spilled milk multiple times. That could be our error as you're sleep deprived in the beginning.

It also makes organizing them difficult because you can\u2019t see the label fully because it\u2019s curled in. I also don\u2019t like that these don\u2019t have a designated spot to write in how many ounces are in the bag because the lines on the outsides aren\u2019t accurate at all.
