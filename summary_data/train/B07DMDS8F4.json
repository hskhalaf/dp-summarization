First the protective screen fell off and then a day later they started shorting out where the wiring meets the usb-c connection. Any slight bend and the music pauses and stops playing..... extremely annoying and basically renders them useless unless you plan on not moving at all. I wish I would've just spent another ten bucks and got a pair of replacement pixel buds instead",
