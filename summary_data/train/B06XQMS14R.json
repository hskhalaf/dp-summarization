      "text": "This cover was a necessity during a recent trip to Alaska. It folds up super small and easily fit my full framed DSLR and a 24-70mm Lens. I even had a 150-600mm lens with me that would fit in the cover as long as I didn't fully zoom out. The cover keep my equipment fully dry. The only complaint was given the cold temperature outside, my warm arm/hand in the cover caused a buildup of condensation in the cover and also fogged it up. I had to remove my hand a few times and try to wipe the inside of the cover with a small cloth I had with me.",

      "text": "This is a well-made, easy to use and versatile product to fit both full frame and smaller DSLR cameras. Although I've had only two occasions to use this cover, I can say the camera itself remained dry while only the front filter of the lens received any moisture from a reasonably hard rain. So all in all, the cover does what it was intended to do and it appears it will be resilient through at least a few years of occasional use. Recommended and I will purchase again if ever required.",
