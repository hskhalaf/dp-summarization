Crafted from bead-blasted aluminium for a satin-like finish, this light and compact phone is designed to fit comfortably in your hand. A brilliant 4-inch Retina display makes everything look vibrant and sharp. And matt-chamfered edges and a colour-matched stainless steel logo finish the look.",
      "The most powerful 4\u2011inch phone ever. At the core of iPhone SE is the A9, the same advanced chip that's in iPhone 6s. With 64-bit desktop-class architecture, the A9 chip brings you spectacular speed and responsiveness. And with console-class graphics performance, your favourite games and apps are incredibly rich and immersive. Making it a mighty chip for maximum performance.",
      "The only camera you'll ever need. With a 12-megapixel iSight camera, you can be sure to capture sharp, detailed stills like the ones shot on iPhone 6s. That includes shooting - and even editing - brilliant 4K video, which is up to four times the resolution of 1080p HD video.",

In shops, just hold your iPhone near the reader with your finger on Touch ID, and you're done. Because your card details are never shared - or even stored on your device - Apple Pay is a safer, more private way to pay.",

With an easy-to-use interface, amazing features and security at its core, iOS 9 is our most advanced mobile operating system and the foundation of iPhone SE.
