I use a thin heel lift and my custom foot orthotics and they fit exactly. My heels fit low enough in the shoe as they should! Often by adding your own inserts it raises your heel up to much and you don't have the right grip from the back of your shoe on your heel. These Adel do not do that. The depth is good. Very pleased. Will buy another pair. My last pair were 9.5. this pair is 9 wide. The fit is true.",
