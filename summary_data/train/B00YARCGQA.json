I owned my first one for nearly 3 years, i frequently smashed it into things and dropped it several times. It looked and performed like day one up until it was stolen. I will recomend and use this speaker as long as they can be found.",

I like the idea of the pairing feature where you can link two of these up for surround sound. I have a feeling if this came out 5-7 years ago, it would've been a huge hit. These days, bluetooth speakers sound really, really good from makers like Anker; it's getting harder to compete, and this UE ROLL shows that. In the end, it's \"decent\", but nothing stupendous at all. I returned mine.",

There are also settings where you can daisy chain another UE Roll speaker to create a surround sound effect. The flap that covers the charge port and headphone jack seems inadequate but after reading reviews online I found that the ports are in fact, waterproof!",

Best of all is the bungee cord that lets me hang this speaker in all sorts of places. It took me a while to realize the \"design\" on the front of the speaker was actually two buttons: volume up and down. I believe this speaker is also supposed to be waterproof, although I have not tested that feature yet. I feel this is a little expensive for a bluetooth speaker, but the extra features are a huge bonus over other models.",
