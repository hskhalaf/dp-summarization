Thus, when down scuba diving, there's no way to tighten the loop around my wrist - so I was worried about them accidentally coming loose. I ended up taking the floating loop off my wrist and securing the thin camera strap onto my wrist. (Photo shows me about 50+ feet down taking photos with a GoPro attached to the floats). Not sure how to fix that, or if it's possible with this type of design, but would have been more comfortable to have the extra security.",

These floats are reasonably priced, brightly colored, smooth and comfortable, and very handy.

The flotation material appears to be neoprene so I expect it to have a good long lifespan. All in all a great little buy for me.",

I let go of my camera on a regular basis and the floater which I wore on my wrist kept my camera secure. I decided to let go of the handle at one point to see if it would indeed float and hold the weight of my camera to keep it from sinking and ......It works beautifully. When I did come in out of the water the float dried off so easily. In fact it was dry before I was. Great Item.",

I felt more confident having this on the case because if I dropped it I knew it would still be on the top of the water and not sinking to the bottom. The string that connects to the item seems very thin and weak so I am hoping it holds up over time.",

It's a nice touch that they have a snap on/off mechanism so if i'm on land, it's easy to take it off to not be so bulky. I was able to swim with sea turtles with it, and then let my camera go so i could have two hands to grab my boogie board as well. It's also super nice to have 2nd one as backup or for 2nd camera if needed.",

If you plan on using this with a Gopole or chest mount or any other mount that you plan on using that you don't directly hold the camera, you'll just have to thread the mount through the handle so it doesn't get in your shots. When I use my selfie stick, I thread the stick though the handle, or my chest mount I put my shoulder strap through the handle. I have a non floater selfie stick which probably weighs 1-2 pounds maybe more and one of these floaters brings it to the top. Must have for any time you're on or in deep water.",
