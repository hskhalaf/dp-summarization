I have one little gripe that won't cost it a star... but the containers are 1/2 full? I know manufacturers are trying to cut costs by shrinking the amounts purchased, but when you get a fairly robust plastic container that's only 1/2 full... it's getting ridiculous. It's a waste of plastic and turns an otherwise wonderful product into a scam. Come on Orgain, you are better than that.",

I can\u2019t compare this with any other protein shake mix because this is the first powdered protein mix I\u2019ve bought. However, I can tell you that the taste is great. It can be a little chalky at first, but after learning how to blend it right with Nutra Ninja bullet, there is not really any chalkiness or grit to it especially if you add a banana and a handful of ice to it. I use unsweetened vanilla almond milk as the base. The best part is I\u2019m not hungry for about 4.5 hours which was my goal. I\u2019ll be ordering more.",

Reading some of the reviews, it looks like people have experienced digestive problems with this powder, but I haven't had any issues. As a college student, I really appreciate the reasonable price and high quality. If you're looking for a quality plant-based protein but don't have $50 to spend, Orgain is a fantastic deal!",

This is the first protein powder I can have straight up with some almond milk. I love it. It's not as good as whey protein but this is the best plant based protein I have ever tried. I got this in the chocolate flavor even though I am not big chocolate protein flavor, I enjoy this one.",

Second, this stuff taste pretty darn good compared to a lot of competition, has a pretty good ingredient list, fantastic value per serving while still hitting over 20g protein per serving. There might be another product out there thats better but there is no chance someone should rate this product 1 or 2 stars.",

Additionally, it lacks BCAA's which many whey powders have, which might matter to you if you are working out. If the lack of BCAA's and inclusion of Stevia doesn't bother you, it might be worth trying but start with a smaller package before you buy bulk so you can give it a taste test.",

When I make a smoothie for myself, my 1 1/2 year old comes up smacking his lips and signing for milk. It's really nice to give him a taste of something that I don't have to feel any kind of guilty about.",
