Would definitely recommend for a home owner that isn\u2019t going to be metalworking all the time.",

Bottom line for light jobs this is ok.",

This may be a characteristic shared with more expensive grinders. Perhaps mounting with an external third-party rest is the way to go.",

Compact yet powerful, the WEN 6-Inch Bench Grinder provides reliability even in the face of the most difficult tasks.
