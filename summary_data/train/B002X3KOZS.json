I don't like those kind because they fall apart & the bristles get in the food...Yuck. But this Nylon brush is perfect! No bristles in the food, and soooo easy to clean! Thanks amazon for offering NYLON brushes for cooking!",

      "text": "Great brush, seems very well made. No loose bristles. I use it mainly for oiling bread pans, and to brush my breads with oil or butter after they've baked. The brush is stiff enough to easily spread the oil or butter thinly and without making a mess as long as you don't load the brush too heavily with oil. The brush does hold a large amount so you can a get a lot of area coated with a heavy dip. It would work great for desserts like baklava that requires a large area of pastry to be buttered at one time.",

But how they would look if you let the sauce stay on for a while, who knows, they could take on the color of the sauce. No biggie, I bought them to use!

The only caveat is that because it soaks up a lot, it can be hard to clean completely as it soaks a ton of sauce! This is the only think I\u2019ll use. I wonder if they have something with a longer handle?",

    "description": "Size:Nylon 2 InchesA pastry brush is a simple tool that can pay off big dividends. Just a quick brush of a butter glaze before baking will cause many pastries to bake with that golden-brown flaky crust that customers crave. To produce perfectly-glazed pastries Royal Industries recommends its 2\" nylon bristle pastry brush (ROY PST BR P 200). This pastry brush features nylon bristles which are more durable than their natural bristle counterparts. It has a plastic handle for an easy grip.",
