      "text": "These boots are not real Steve Madden! This is my third time buying them (The past 2 I bought at the Steve Manden store). When I first tried them on they were way too big and they felt weird. I brought out one of my old pairs and compared them and they are completely different. The sole does not have the stitching that the original ones do and the inside - where the shoe size is different and cheap looking. I was disappointed as these have always been my favorite boots. Save your time. P.S I posted a photo so you can see the difference between the original ones and these.",

Would have been better boots if made with a zipper down the side. Would have helped keep them up more.",

My thighs are on the average size and the ties in the back really help the boots to stay up. The heels are high but comfortable. Great fit - they are very slimming and look amazing!
