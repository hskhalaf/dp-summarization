The pillow was soft enough on it's own but I had to cushion the arm rest with another pillow which was perfectly fine. The only thing I didn't like is it's hard to fold back up and it folds back larger than it originally was. Which could just be me but still. This is a great product. 9",

She likes to carry it herself too so it's nice that it rolls up with velcro to hold it. My only complaint is there's no option to remove the pillow when washing like I can with her Yo Gabba Gabba mat, so the pillow can get a little clumpy after washing/drying but that's about it. Refluff the pillow, roll it up, and you're good to go.",

There is just enough padding to make the mat comfortable, the blanket is a really soft fleece. The pillow isn't super stuffed (could be stuffed tighter in my opinion) but it rolls up nicely and fits inside my son's paw patrol backpack. It isn't enormous, it's just good enough for your child for a nap at school a few times a week.",
