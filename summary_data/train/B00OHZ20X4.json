If you have the room I would get an 18' mat for assurance that all snow/water is caught.",

Cons: the mat tends to spike up at the sides and make walking beside it in a cramped space difficult. It does not lay flat against the garage floor - the wrinkles so not seem to be getting better.

Wrinkles significantly (several inches high) as a car is parked on it, but the wrinkles actually result in small \"pools\" of accumulated water water which are easily removed with a wet vac. After significant snow melt from our full-sized SUV, it takes about 15 minutes (and five vacuum canisters full of water) to clear completely.",

I will leave it down year round. I am satisfied with this product.",

    "title": "NEW Heavy Duty AutoFloorGuard Midsize/Small SUV Containment Mat 7'9\"x18'",
    "description": "Size:7'9\"x18'AutoFloorGuard has been the #1 market leader in garage containment mats for over 5 years. Yet this year, we have evolved our design and engineered the best performing containment mat ever! After a year of extensive testing, we have made subtle changes to our product design including the following. We improved the methodology for forming the containment edge that has proven in tests to outperform previous methods of design in a variety of tough conditions. Secondly, we optimized fabric weight for durability, flexibility and reducing wrinkles. Finally, we developed new way of package preparation for AutoFloorGuard that better allows the product to lay flat right out of the box (reducing wrinkles) and improved the performance of the containment edge. Our Optimized Commercial grade fabric is polyester scrim material that is treated with a coating process that allows for PVC to coat and intertwine with polyester strands, making it stronger than ever. PVC fabric is used and trusted in the trucking industry to handle the road\u2019s toughest conditions day-in and day-out. Our fabric is also mildew and rot resistant, along with being ultraviolet treated to resist fading and prevent fabric breakdown. Heat-sealed watertight seams are reinforced and thermal welded for durability and functionality. Finally, we made the product totally ready to use as soon as you receive it. This year we have included a Free Squeegee & Telescoping pole and our exclusive AutoFloorGuard design Stay-Put Corners in the box.",
