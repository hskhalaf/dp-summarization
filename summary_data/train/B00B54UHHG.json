The weight is comfortable and easy to hold. I make tomato sauce and throw them in the crockpot seeds and all with seasoning and just use this to blend it down at the end. We also used it to puree pumpkins that we grow in our yard. Perfect for soups as well. Well worth the money and have had zero problems with it. We once asked a chef what would she take if her kitchen was on fire, she said her Kitchenaid mixer and this stick blender.",

The design is good and the electrical body of the machine can be detached from the blending part (the blades) so that the blades can be washed and cleaned. This is certainly a wonderful product for small volume blending where food processor or traditional family size blender doesn't work. It looks great and working fine so far, if any problems develop I will update this review. 1. 2. 3.",

The slipping that has been mentioned by some has occurred perhaps 5 times in two years, but it easily re-engaged each time when the blender was disconnected, held upside down and gently turned by hand.

It's great for vegetable soups where you just pulverize half the vegetables if you want. It's the best for creamy soups. I also use it when I make spaghetti sauces. Cleaning it is literally a 5 second job. It couldn't be easier. It's very well made and looks as if it could last for several years.. Very good deal for the price.",
