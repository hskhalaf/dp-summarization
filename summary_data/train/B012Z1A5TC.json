      "text": "My purchase was motivated by a previously owned pair of Clarks Desert Boots with which I was very happy. Right out of the box, the color is very different to that of the picture. Once I laced up the boots and took a few steps, the leather began losing its color wherever there was even the slightest bend. After wearing them for 5 days, they look like a 2 year pair of beater boots. I'm not sure if the dramatic change in color is a feature, rather then a defect, but it does not look good. I would not buy another pair in this specific color and would not recommend that you do either.",
