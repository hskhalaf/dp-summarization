      "text": "I have always been using the HE Detergent Pods by Tide before, but ever since I tried the Tide Free and Gentle Laundry Detergent pods, I never switched. There's not really any scent in these pods, but I recommend to combine the pods with \"Downy Unstoppables in-Wash Scent Boosters\" to boost the scent. Remember to throw a couple/few pods depending on the load FIRST before putting your clothes in the washer. I have done the opposite and it didn't go well. Overall, great product!",
