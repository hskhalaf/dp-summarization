Bass is more sensible and it matters alot on how much the recording calls for the bass on these headphones, i feel the bass on these do not lack but because it has been professionally adjusted it well when the track calls for the bass as it should be. Also it matters alot on your source it could make a night or day difference with these i think but take that with a pinch of salt. That is about it with my impression of this headphone. Dan.",

In that frequency range i actually prefer these to the PM-3s. The issue i have is with the bass. It is big but loose. The bass is there but it lacks definition. If you go for that kind of sound, then these would make for headphones that are fun to listen to. For me it was a let down.",
