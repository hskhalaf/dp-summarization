It's absolutely perfect to hold my Smok Alien 220, a 60mL bottle of juice and the USB charging cable with room for more...with extra pockets as well as extra room for a larger mod which is great because I have a ModShield silicone sleeve on the way, and I'm sure I won't have an issue when that gets put on. This case is high quality and looks like it'll hold up for a long while. The belt loop and strap are also great and convenient features. There's really nothing negative I can say about this thing. It's perfect!",

It also will not stand up on its own so if you go to stand it up on a flat surface it falls over.",

I was pleasantly surprised by the extremely high quality of the construction. Very, very sturdy! Worth the price. I love being able to carry it like a purse over my shoulder if I'm wearing a dress. However, it's so well-built that I would highly recommend this case for dudes who are hard on their gear or work in construction, etc. It will hold up! The strap is detachable.",

The juice pocket is a plus; your juice can be wherever you are, in an easy-to-access spot. All in all, it does a fine job.",
