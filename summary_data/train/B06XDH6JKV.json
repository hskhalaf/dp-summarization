I tested it against a trusted under-the-tongue thermometer, and my results were as follows: Head 96.7 F Ear 97.9 F Under tongue 98.0 So I plan to use mainly the ear mode for this thermometer. I will use the forehead for times like needing to check the temperature of a sleeping child and just keep in mind that I should add 1-1.5 degrees to the reading. The instant-read is amazing! Gone are the days of having to hold my children still for a minute or longer to check temperatures. Thanks AccuMD!",

My wife and I both got the flu this flu season and started using this product while very sick. Bad time to learn the temperature readings from this product are inaccurate by both forehead and ear measurements (sometimes by 2-3 degrees or more) when you are actually burning up with fever. I would hate to rely on this product for a sick child. Had to go back to regular oral thermometer so we could track our fevers. Waste of $44 (no wonder it has since dropped to $30).",

For forehead mode, you leave the large cap on, place it on your forehead and press head. Simple as that. It beeps once and turns green if your temp is within normal range. It beeps multiple times and turns red if you are running a fever. For ear mode you take the large cap off, place the nossle into your ear and press ear. Again with the same colors and beeping.",

The duality of the product is what I love the most. A ear reading is slightly more accurate but if your child has an ear infection that won't work. Who wants to take that temperature teh old fashion way. Not I. Instead of having two different thermometers this one will handle both. Added bonus the reading takes two seconds.",

I was running a temp of 100.2 in both ears, and the head temp was 99.6. Close. The neat thing is the beep alert and light change when a temp is detected. This only occurs when the temp is 100.0+ For some reason the battery door keeps sliding off. Not completely annoying but I'm getting there.",

There aren't 20 buttons to remember what they all do. There are 2 buttons, forehead & ear. You push the corresponding button of where you want to take the temperature. Even my 3 year old grandson can sit still long enough to have his temp checked. He wasn't too fond of the other methods. There is much less arguing with a 3 year old now, which makes me even happier. I totally recommend this thermometer for everyone that has kids in their house, you will thank me later. But is great for adults as well.",

When I first received the thermometer, I immediately checked each child's ear and head temperature. The variation in degrees was either by .1 or 1 degree. I would call that accurate. My old instant read thermometer required you to slide the thermometer across their foreheads. This one requires you to just place it on the middle. I also like how it came with 2 batteries and you had to pull the green tab in order to use it. That way you know that while your thermometer is either in shipment, or at the warehouse, the batteries are not being drained.",

I also love how fast it takes an accurate temperature, no more waiting forever and hoping that the kiddo didn't push the thermometer out of their armpit or from under their tongue to mess up the reading of the temperature. I also love that the backlight changes colors according to the temperature. No more wondering if it's high or low!",

Perfect if you have small children who don't want to sit still while you're taking their temp. I didn't have a fever (knock on wood) when I received this, but I do know my normal temp and this came in very accurate. Would definitely recommend.",

I also love how quick this is. I have another infrared thermometer and it takes over 5 seconds to do a forehead reading. That doesnt work so well on a toddler. You press the head button and a second later you have a reading. It's awesome! The reading for the forehead and the ear come out to be different each time. I mostly go with the ear readings - they seem to be more accurate.",

An added bonus is that the carrying case and batteries are included. This unit is nice and compact. I love how easy it is to use, even my ten year olds were able to take each others temperatures.
