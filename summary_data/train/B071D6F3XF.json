I just ordered the Joseph compose container to put food items into so the garbage can will not smell and I can use one bag longer. Will see how this works. Will rdit this review later Updating the last review. Giving it 5 stars, works as described. Bags are staying in place. Taking trash out about once a week. Bags are sturdy and not ripping.. I am using the compost container which is working well. Now need to set up a compose outside and we should be recycling. all the way.",

      "text": "I purchased this product because I liked the idea of using less plastic with out trash. The compacting handle is a great idea. The box does recommend using specific compacter bags. I am currently using my preexisting regular trash bags and they work well, even when compacting. The only feedback I would say could use improvement is the liner clasping mechanism. When the trash bag becomes too heavy with contents, I have noticed that the edges slip out of the rubberized plastic frame that holds in it. But again, I AM using regular trash bags at this time.",

    "title": "Joseph Joseph 30030 Intelligent Waste Titan Trash Can Compactor, 8 gallon / 30 liter, Stainless Steel",
    "description": "Size:8 gallon/30 liter| Color:Stainless SteelTitan is no ordinary trash unit. It features a patented, hygienic compaction system that enables it to reduce trash volume by 66% after compaction. Because Titan compacts your waste, it doesn\u2019t need to be emptied as often, which in turn reduces the amount of liners you use and the how often you need to take out the trash.\n\nTitan features a replaceable carbon odor filter for any unpleasant smells and a fingerprint-proof stainless-steel coating. \n\nTitan is hygienic and mess-free. The unique design ensures only the inside of the plastic bag touches the trash while compacting, leaving you with clean hands and a clean bin. \n\nTitan is built to last. Its compaction system and foot pedal have been tested over 100,000 times and are engineered to withstand many years of service. We\u2019re so confident in Titan\u2019s enduring quality that we guarantee it for 10 years against manufacturing defects. \n\nTitan has an anti-tear design that won\u2019t stretch or pinch the trash bag. We carry extra-strong, IW4 custom-fit liners for added peace of mind. It\u2019s also compatible with standard plastic trash bags. A handy lid-stay feature ensures liner changes are quick and hassle-free, and it also includes a handle on the reverse to make moving easy. \n\nDimensions of Titan unit with lid closed (inches): 15.6 L x 13.4 W x 27 H \n\nBox Contains \n(1) Titan trash compactor, (3) IW4 General waste liners, (1) Odor filter, (1) Instruction booklet",
