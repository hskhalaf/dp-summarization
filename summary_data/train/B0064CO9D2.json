I looked at some less-expensive desks with similar designs, and I'm really glad I read the reviews and went with this model. The pieces fit nicely together, and it seems very sturdy/high quality. I included photos with my 15-inch laptop on it for scale, as the desk is on the small side, which may not work for a larger person. There's plenty of storage in the adjustable shelves. (The geometric shelf that the chair faces is not included with the desk; I bought it separately at Target.) Overall, I'm very pleased with this purchase.",
