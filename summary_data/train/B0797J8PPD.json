      "text": "This wok is really great. It\u2019s giant and heavy. Exactly what I was looking for. The little red silicone heat protector handles aren\u2019t perfect because they do not actually fasten to the handle, they just kind of loosely sit on the handle, but they serve their purpose. Love this thing!!! It\u2019s preseason Ed so you don\u2019t have to do the whole salt and oil and oven thing but I did anyway because it\u2019s kind of fun, right? Remember to dry it immediately after washing it because cast iron is prone to rusting. Also remember to coat it in a little bit of vegetable or canola oil after washing it. I highly recommend this wok.",

Glass lid important for steaming, and I would like to get it, but I may have to find one on my own...ugh.",
