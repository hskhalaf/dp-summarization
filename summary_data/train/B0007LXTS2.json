I'm very happy with the rake and expect to have it for years to come. Maybe by then, I'll finally get the glue off the tines. Really, they could have found a better way to attach the label. It was heavily glued to the tines - no way to pull it off. Such a silly annoyance for an otherwise great tool.",

It only takes 10 seconds or so and soon it peels right off without leaving any trace of glue or paper. This photo shows how small this rake really is and my hand is a small hand. Hoping this thing works good raking leaves from V-shaped area on my roof. It is light enough so holding up wouldn't be a problem. Will update review after trying it this weekend. Raked around a small tree and it worked very well. Raised from 3-stars to 4-stars.",

For those complaining about the labels, just soak them in WD-40 or paint thinner, cover tightly with a plastic bag, leave overnight, and the labels will peel off cleanly. WD-40 also has the benefit of leaving a rust-preventive coating.",

The tines are strong enough to be durable, flexible enough to be effective and protected with a thick powder coat. The handle is lightweight and fast handling, and although some foam on the handle might have been nice, the powder coating on the top half of the handle is not slick and easy to grip.",
