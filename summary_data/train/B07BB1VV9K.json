I will say it doesn't mix as well in cold water as some brands I have tried, but on the other hand, when I switched to putting it in coffee or a smoothie from trying it in my cold lemon water it was totally fine no issues whatsoever. The difference I have seen using this brand has been nothing short of amazing. I've noticed a huge improvement in my hair and nails. I bought this collagen looking for results and that is what I got.",

There is also no \u201cflavor\u201d. I\u2019ve tried quite a few different collagen peptides and some (even though say unflavored) have a slight flavor. I've also been learning more about collagen and it's health benefits like how it helps with muscle growth and my husband has even mentioned that it has been helping his digestive issues. I add it daily to my pre-workout drink and I also love adding it to my overnight oats, chocolate avocado protein pudding and my BCAA's. It's so easy to use and the older we get the more we need it.",

This is a big trouble area for me, but since taking this I have noticed a big difference. I have been taking for about two weeks now. This is helping my autoimmune conditions, and I am glad that I found this product to help my body. I\u2019ve noticed the difference in my legs as well. They look more toned up.",

They feel totally normal and not fragile. I\u2019ve been using it everyday for almost a month now and my hair is growing back and filling in as well. I feel great. I put 1 scoop in my morning coffee. Even though it says it\u2019s flavorless. You can definitely taste something different. To help I\u2019ve been using a hand frother in my coffee to mix it up well. And it helps with the taste a lot. I would totally recommend this product to anyone who needs help with knee pain!!",

I feel like it has helped my digestion, it remains to be seen if it helps with my skin, although it feels less dry than before, so perhaps that is a response to this supplement. It is best mixed with something warm, I put it in a barley/chicory coffee substitute I enjoy in the mornings. It doesn't dissolve well in cold water, which I've tried also. Doesn't have a weird after taste like other collagen brands I've tried before. Here's to good health! So glad we have so many options these days to offset the less options of readily available pure and clean foods.",
