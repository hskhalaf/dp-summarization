There is no carabiner or heavy D-ring, only a couple small ones that I would not trust to carry much if any load, and in a fall, the slack recovery strains the belt exponentially. I don't suggest using this harness without a substantial anchor. For a climbing wall on belay, or short rappels its works, and the price is right.",
