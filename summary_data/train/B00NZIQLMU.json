It also burns very easily so it's been difficult to find just the right setting. I didn't realize that I would miss the ability to toast different items at different settings... i.e. bagel on one side, toast on the other. Our old toaster had a different setting for each side. I can't tell you how many bagels and pieces of toast we have thrown away. Now I get to throw the toaster away, too.",

As others have indicated some times it will be toasted ones side will be fine and the other side is unevenly toasted. When the elements are observed when \"ON\" some of the elements are barely glowing when others are cherry red (creating dark or burned spots on the bread).",

So off to Amazon to find another one, and this is the one I purchased. The previous one didn't easily accommodate homemade bread. I make a lot of homemade sourdough and needed something that could accommodate a non-commercial sized slice of bread. This one is perfect!! It works great for homemade bread, bagels, frozen items etc. The warm button is an especially nice feature that we actually use more than we anticipated. It's easily cleaned and doesn't show fingerprints. Highly Recommended!",

For us, setting \"4\" is the best for toasting bread for breakfast to get a nice golden brown.

I suggest those who do not have a pair order them if intending to purchase this toaster. Other than that, very happy with our purchase, and would recommend to others!",

It takes up so much of the counter space that I could be using for other things. Second, it doesn't cook evenly, and when I add a little extra time, the bread burns. Third, It doesn't feel as heavy as the older Oster. Oster, generally, makes a great product but this toaster missed the boat.",

A toast-lift lever promotes safe removal of toasted items.
