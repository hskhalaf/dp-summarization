      "text": "Best of any of the 4/3rds, except Pany GH2. Has same sensor and electronics as EPL3 and EP3. Very compact. Smaller than my GF2. Fast. Focusing, taking photos, playback, menu operations. Initially I didn't like how the scroll wheel worked when playing back photos. But there is a menu setting (buried deep and not very intuitive), that makes it work perfectly. Put the Pany 14mm pancake, and you have a P/S package with near DSLR quality. Splenda photos, and excellent color and metering. Up to 3200 ISO, almost noise free. For the price, you can't go wrong. Much better than a P/S for not much more money.",

I bought it because it uses the same battery and can use the same viewfinder as an (even) older model. For an inexpensive camera and kit lens, it's /very/ nice. I don't care about arty filters but this camera can be driven when not used in the full-auto mode. It's easy to tweak the exposure and to exposure bracket for HDRs. It's small, and - except for the flimsy battery cover -- seems built for heavy use. I'd buy it again.",

The smallest and lightest PEN features a new and simplified user interface as well as a streamlined button structure for superior ease-of-use. Its small size and portability make it the ideal camera to document life\u2019s fun and spontaneous moments. \n\nOlympus PEN E-PM1 Highlights \n\nSimplified Control\nOperating the camera is more intuitive with the newly designed user interface. The innovative screen activates popular menu options such as Art Filters, iAuto, Scene Modes, and Movie. The on-screen graphics have also been updated with a sleeker font design and an automatic pop-up guide in the menu screen. \n\nThe E-PM1\u2019s Live Guide system allows you to preview effects as you adjust them \u2013 before the image is even captured. Simply select Live Guide and turn the wheel on the back of the camera to slide through numerous photographic effects, such as brightness, color saturation, tone, etc. \n\nExcellent Shots, Effortlessly\niAuto automatically identifies the scene you're shooting \u2013 portrait, landscape, night portrait, macro, or sport \u2013 and adjusts the settings to optimize results. The E-PM1 is also equipped with 23 Scene- Select modes for effortless picture taking, including new 3D mode, Fireworks, Sunset, Children, Macro and Panorama, to name a few. There are even three scene modes that are specific to shooting with Olympus\u2019 conversion lenses to optimize the performance of those lenses. \n\n3-Inch, Bright Widescreen LCD\nThis 460 dot high-resolution screen is big and bright enough to let you shoot and share photos and HD video with ease. \n\nGet Wireless\nNo need for cables or even a computer. Upload or email images directly from your camera with an optional PP-1 PENPAL or Eye-Fi card. The E-PM1 is also capable of recording stills and video to SD, SDHC, SDXC and UHS-I media cards. \n\n12 Megapixels\nThe new 12 megapixel sensor is optimized to maximize the performance of all mZuiko digital lenses in any shooting condition. Improvements in the sensor makes shooting in low light and Full HD movie recording possible. \n\nStabilization Technology in the Body, Not in the Lens\nSay goodbye to blurry images. Olympus\u2019 in-body image stabilization technology makes it possible to use any Micro Four Thirds lenses (or Four Thirds lens), from wide-angle to telephoto, for perfectly clear, crisp photos no matter what the shooting situation, even in low light! \n\nFace Detection with Eye Detect\nNail the focus for every portrait photo, every time. The new face detection AF employs an \"Eye Detect AF\" that adjusts focus automatically on the subject's eyes during portrait shooting and can even be adjusted to focus on the right, left or near-side eye. The Face Detection function captures up to eight faces, reducing the chance of blurred subjects when shooting several people at once. \n\nAdvanced Shadow Adjustment Technology\nYou no longer need to worry about the extreme contrast between dark and bright areas in your images. The E-PM1's Shadow Adjustment Technology corrects for extreme light variations with high-tech efficiency either before image capture or during post-capture edits. \n\nFull 1080 HD Video\nShoot up to 29 minutes of 1080 60i HD video and stereo sound in either AVCHD or AVI formats. A Direct HD Movie Button switches you from still to movie mode with just the press of a button. \n\nIn-Camera Art Filters\nSix in-camera Art Filters (Pop Art, Soft Focus, Grainy Film, Pin Hole, Diorama and Dramatic Tone) can be used in all shooting modes as well as filming HD movies. The E-PM1 also includes bracketing up to seven images, each image with a different applied Art Filter. Since they\u2019re built into the camera, these Art Filters can achieve dramatic results on the go without the need for computer or editing software. \n\nWide Variety of Lenses and Accessories\nA range of interchangeable lenses, accessories and flashes are compatible with the E-PM1 to support all different types of photography needs. \n\nNew 3D Shooting\nAdd a new dimension to your photographs in any mode from macro to landscape with Olympus\u2019 3D technology. By simply selecting the 3D Photo Mode, releasing the shutter, and slowly panning, the camera will automatically take a second image from a slightly different perspective. The 3D data is processed in-camera for easy display on 3D televisions or laptops. \n\nAF Illuminator\nThe addition of this super luminosity LED beam allows the camera to focus faster in low light up to almost 10 feet. \n\nIncreased ISO Sensitivity\nStunning low light photos are a click away with an increased ISO sensitivity to 12,800. \n\nAttachable Flash Included\nThis camera provides the flexibility to attach a flash to your camera via the accessory port, or leave it at home for maximum portability. \n\n5fps Sequential Shooting\nWith the E-PM1 you can take up to five photos a second, allowing you to easily capture that perfect shot, especially when your subject is moving. \n\nFast Auto Focus\nThe new FAST (Frequency Acceleration Sensor Technology) AF System is able to focus at an incredible speed and offers 35 separate focus points that are spread over nearly the entire sensor, which makes it possible for pin-point accurate focusing on small subjects wherever they appear in the frame. Selectable 3x3 groups within the 35-point area are especially effective when shooting active subjects. \n\nImproved Color Reproduction\nThe new TruePic VI Image Processor, designed specifically for the Olympus PEN, features Real Color Technology for improved color reproduction (especially colors such as emerald green, yellow, and gold) and color gradation. The faster processor also allows for a shorter recovery time between shots. \n\nImproved Lens Technology\nHigh-precision engineering and an improved internal focusing mechanism have allowed the Olympus MSC (Movie+Still Compatible) lenses to auto focus quickly, smoothly and silently, perfect for stills and movies.",
