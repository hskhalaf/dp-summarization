It makes shy fish like gouramis feel more secure in their environment. Other fish like plecos and snails benefit from the large surface areas of the leaves as they graze on the leftover food and algae that grow on it. Tremendous amount of functionality along with beauty.",

It was definitely worth the price, and pulling it out of the box, I was so stunned at what I got. I'll probably be ordering another one for my own tank.",
