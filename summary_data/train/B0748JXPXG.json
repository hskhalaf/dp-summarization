I'd rather use these than the plastic disc/bags from hospitals since these are more convenient and there's no spillage. They've also helped people around me who have gotten sick and weren't prepared. Keep one of these bags, some tissue, and mints as a vomit kit and you're set.",

The top closure helps contain the smell The panda image is cute and the kids think it's funny, but the printed words gross me out a little -- I mean, if you're already feeling ill, reading \"I feel the urge to vomit\" on this bag might just send you over the edge! :(",
