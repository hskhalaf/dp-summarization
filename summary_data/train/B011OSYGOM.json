I used a little female ingenuity and looped the leash through the back handle to keep it from being tangled under his front legs. I've included a picture.",

Another issue is measurement chart is off. Go atleast one size up and try, may have to go two sizes up, it depends. Otherwise it is a great product overall. Very durable, handle on the back comes in handy more than expected, D-ring (where you hook the leash) is double stitched so pulling issue is accommodated, front D-ring has double loop and works for no-pull training but D-ring on back is comparatively much more stronger.",

I am not disappointed with the purchase but I would probably get a different harness next time. Only for the sake of ensuring an accurate fit.

It is also really easy to put on, compared to past harnesses we had where he had to step into it. This one just goes over his head and clips around the sides. Have recommended it to many people!",

This harness is also nice is that our dog doesn't seem able to chew it while he's wearing it, we have had issues with other strap harnesses in the past.",
