      "text": "I bought this for a day hike, loved it so much I bought 3 more for the kids. It's small enough that it's unobtrusive when hiking or biking. But big enough for wallet, keys, a small lunch, and obviously already contains the water bladder. I'm 6'3\" 220 and kids are 9 and 10, and this is a good size for all of us... On the trail it's nice that we each have our own water and snacks, instead of 1 big hunky pack and everyone asking for their water bottle or stuff. Makes for a more pleasant family hike. I think it's perfect size for a day hike. Just enough room, not cumbersome, fits well.",

We filled the pack with about 5 bottles of water/gatorade, food, clothes, sunblock, first aid kit, and various other essentials. We used it in Yosemite, Death Valley, and the Grand Canyon for long hikes. This is a great product for the price!",

It's definitely large enough to carry a light change of clothes, first aid kit, lunch, knife, gun, flashlight, etc. The only cons is it doesn't come in FDE, and my back was soaked after a 3 hour hike (not from a leak, but from sweat).",
