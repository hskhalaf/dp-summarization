The camera attached with ease and I liked the security of the safety strap, but everything I liked about it ended there. During a short hike I had to constantly readjust the strap, because it kept slipping and going from hanging around waist to banging against my knee. I ended up using duct tape to secure it. By the end of my hike I was carrying my camera in my hand to keep it from twisting, slipping and sliding. I carry a Nikon D750, which is not a light weight camera by any means. I've since switched back to the strap that came with the my camera.",
