We tuned it up and it sounds great. We got the black and it certainly looks and sounds like a much more expensive guitar. She flies here for the summers so the case was a nice addition for her to take it on the plane with her. Very pleased with this purchase.",

      "text": "Such a great kit for a beginner. Gives them everything they need to get started. The quality of the strings isn't great, but you can replace those pretty easily. The pitch pipe also isn't super impressive, but you really don't need it when you have the electric tuner (or you can just use an online tuner). The only complaint with this is that the strap was filthy when it arrived. Threw it in the washing machine and it was fine. Also, the strap is kind of small, so if it's a bigger kiddo or a grownup using it, you might have to get a different one. Overall though, this is a great inexpensive instrument to learn/practice on.",

I have it 4 stars because the case is really cheap and thin, won't take much to rip it. I also recommend getting a set of different picks. The one included is insanely huge but GREAT for little fingers just not adult ones lol the pitch pipe is awesome and works as a second toy for the kids to play with. All in all this is a great guitar for a child learning to play and for the price!!",

The only drawback I have Is that it does go out of tune after a while a little faster than more professional guitars but then again, this is just to start up and learn and once you've gotten the hand of it, you can pay for a more professional style but for now, to start, this is definitely worth it.",

It comes with everything needed the downside is it has to be re-tuned near daily. The little auto tuner that comes with it makes that fairly easy but I think that is more due to being in a soft case than a hard case. The pins that tune each string get bumped as its transported causing it to go out of tune at least as far as I can tell that seems to be the issue so if you buy this, order a hard case for it too.",

However, what is very dissapointed is that the guitar does not hold the tune, i have to tune all the time and that it is not acceptable... i am thinking to return it asap",

For beginners because they get a lot of practice tuning their guitar, but that quickly becomes very tedious. I would give the product a 3 star for that, but what dropped it down to a 2 is the gigbag that comes with it. The first time it was worn the straps ripped clean off of it and the guitar tumbled to the ground getting damaged. This product is cheap enough to see if a young person has the discipline to practice and learn, but if they show interest you will have to replace this guitar quickly.",

The screws were installed approx. 1/4\" inch above the small block of wood. Had the screws and bridge been installed in the correct location, the nuts would not have pulled through the face of the guitar.",
