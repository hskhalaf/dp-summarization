      "text": "I have a 90 lb pit bull with pretty severe anxiety and having something for him to chew on is essential for him to be calm around my other dogs. He also has a very bad habit of swallowing the pieces of his toys that he chews off so this toy has been a life saver. It took him 8 months to chew through the toy this much and I attribute most of that to him being extra anxious over our move. Now that I know know there are other, sturdier versions of this toy I'll definitely buy that but I'm still very happy with this product because it lasted longer than any other we've had.",

They both don't chew it really...which is how it's still intact after months. They only really play with it if I initiate a tug or hide-n-seek game, otherwise, it's not interesting. 4 stars for design and durability(?).",

We play \"tug tug\" which is a game of Tug of War and she *really* pulls and yanks and there's hardly any marks at all. She really loves it. She chews on it and it bounces right back. Some people have complained about the smell and their dogs don't like it. Lily had NO problem with it and went right for it. After a month, it's an A+++ in our book.",

Our dog weighs 69 pounds and has a large mouth that can hold two toys at once. He loves tug-o-war so that's why we bought this toy. We wish this toy was longer though to allow more space between the dog's mouth/teeth and our fingers/hand. It needs three rings instead of just two for more length.

We've only played inside, but this is the type of toy a dog, 80 pounds, probably more, can chomp onto and you can spin around in circles and he'll come off the ground, until you're too dizzy to do it anymore.

Well worth the money. Some reviews complain about the rubber smell, but I didn't find that to be an issue. It does smell like rubber but it isn't overpowering.

We're going on 3 months now an she absolutely loves it, an so far to date has NOT been able to shred it or bite through it to expose the colored center they speak of. We had even tried the K--G brand dog toys....yeah spend the money and save in the long run",

Goughnuts are the toys I've been looking for! My puppy is a boxer/ husky mix and destroys every toy, even ones that are more expensive because they're made for chewers. Where all those fail these succeed, they're expensive but worth it. I've definitely saved money by not having to replace dozens of crappy stuffed toys. Also you can feel comfortable leaving your dogs unattended with these, no choking hazards etc. I can't say enough good things about them!",

They are very well made and somewhat heavy so keep away from breakable objects if your dog shakes toys or \"throws\" them.",
