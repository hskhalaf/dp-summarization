Hopefully the next pair won't have that flaw.",

I never go with a wide width, because I do not have wide feet, but these particular shoes were so narrow that I did not try walking with them out of the house. I knew, right away, that they were not going to break in. Still a great product, if you have narrow feet. They look perfect with jeans, and the blue hue to the sole was really cool",
