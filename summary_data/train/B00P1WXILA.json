The mask lacks the gray highlights or accents as seen in the picture, additionally the lense didn't come as seen in the photograph. The lense is a basic black tint not the smoke mirror like finish as seen in the photograph. this package just arrived an hour ago, and you can tell it was opened and re-taped. Lastly, there are defects in the lense Tint,right out of the box there are noticeable bubbles along the top outer edge. I'm disappointed, 100 bucks should get you a quality goggle /product",

Virtue makes a great product, the Extend is probably my favorite mask, the flexible jaw shield reduces ball break and still provides great protection. This model is good for guys who have a strong (big) jaw, covers it completely while maintaining style, ventilation and most importantly, protection. The coolest feature of this model is the ability to interchange pieces for either added protection or color swap. If youre afraid of taking a pearl necklace, maybe look for a neck guard.",

I use it primarily for taking photos of my son and his team during events, but I play woodsball occasionally.

If u have a small head/face then get the i4 because I think it looks nicer but if you have an average size head/face like mine then I suggest this mask. This comes with a mask dust bag and a lens dust bag in case you need to carry around additional lenses.",

      "text": "I do like this mask and is now my go to mask (I have a pair of eflexes and i4s). Great range of vision and very comfy. Also, it has the best/ easiest dis-assembly/ lens replacement process. However, my only issue (though very slight) is that is isn't as big as I was expecting. I'm a bigger guy with a big head/face. Seeing the description, I thought, \"Finally, a mask that will fully cover me up and then some!\" That's why I went with the Extend version. The coverage is relatively similar to Eflexes or Grillz. Which isn't bad at all. I was just expecting more.",
