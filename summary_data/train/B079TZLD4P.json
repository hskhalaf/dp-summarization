I rarely write reviews, but in the interest of saving other's time, here is the specific solution to the dark screen caused by the default energy saving feature. Once set up, go to Settings, scroll to bottom, select All Settings. The new menu will include at the top Picture. Choose that, then turn off the energy saving feature. That's it, and the picture is now of excellent quality.",

Magic Remote is pretty cool though. Buy a Samsung or a Vizio instead. Edit: Dropped to one star. This thing is the dumbest smart tv on the market. Zero WiFi reliability has made this a regular flat screen. LG is total garbage. There are TVs for $500 less that give you more than this trash.",

We are very happy with this product, the picture is very clear, I almost feel as if I can reach out and touch the people on the screen. Most important, the sound is very clear and I don't have to blast the sound in order to hear it. Set up took my son and husband less than an hour. The was a great purchase.",

Seems that the manufacturer needs to look a the packaging a bit more or don\u2019t make the TVs so flimsy it\u2019s only an inch thick. But that is true with all manufacturers. Anyway the one that finally worked had two boxes they surrounded the factory box inside another box with bubble wrap. I feel bad for the delivery people if this is a constant issue for them dealing with broken TVs",
