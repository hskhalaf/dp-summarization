I initially thought this was supposed to go around the CHEST and RIB CAGE girth, but my vet told me it is actually supposed to sling under and in front of the dog's hips. I thought this would be less secure until I tried it. So the good news is, even though I bought a size too large thinking I needed it for her Boxer-girth, it still works on my dog who has a torn ACL and hip displasia. She is able to get up with my help, and even take short walks as we prepare for her surgery. This will be a huge help after her surgery I'm sure.",

I purchase this so I could help my dog down the stairs following his ACL surgery, but it doesnt work for him. It says Vet approved... Whose Vet??

Ordered an X-large which just fits over her broad chest. Ordered another one because the first is just starting to wear at the straps. We have used it for over a year and is only now just starting to wear at the straps. The new one comes tomorrow. Highly recommend!",

Still a rough time, but this sling definitely made it much easier.",

      "text": "Item helped tremendously with the struggle of walking around after my German Shepherd had a back issue that caused him to have weak spells in his back legs and was to old for surgery, so we would go back to the vet every two weeks for checkups. It was a little hard to keep in place on him because he figured out how to get it to slide off of him. We still took smaller walks up to the day before he passed in his sleep from old age.",

We have been using a towel to help her but thought it would be easier on us and more comfortable for her to buy this product. Does not work well and slides all around when you try to use it. Also the handles are too close together so for a larger dog you have no leverage to help her stand. Would not recommend. Towel works better and they do not accept returns.",
