LED range hood light was way too dim but that was really my biggest complaint - until today, when it decided it just wasn't going to work. The microwave this replaced was almost 40 years old, and still worked fine. If this is their idea of modern reliability, well, LG will be at the bottom of my list for replacement ~this~ time :-(",
