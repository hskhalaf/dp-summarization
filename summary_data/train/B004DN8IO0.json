I might have given 5 stars, but mine arrived with a bunch of scratches in the bottom of the bowl. Sure, I'm just gonna throw firewood in there, but I should get to be the one to scratch up my new fire pit you know?",

I also had to buy a new screen in the summer for it which really looks nice on it because the other one rested away so I guess you get what you pay for",

The convince of the bag is awesome because it keeps all of the mess in a contained area. The does have a rod for covering the fire, but I have yet to use it for cooking so I don't close it. Great for festivals, fairs, and car camping. You can get 10 chairs around this and still feel the heat.",
