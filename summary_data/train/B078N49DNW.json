Works great, pretty light weight and easy to adjust the size (I alternate between sitting and standing a lot). If you want it to fit in your SUP bag thought, get the 3 piece. The two piece one is still pretty long. Thanks!",

I was initially skeptical about the way the adjustment clip works, but it has proved to be simple and reliable, and actually, the bump is in a convenient place to serve as a sort of handle for the lower hand so instead of being in the way it's sort of useful.",

My biggest complaint is the shipping. I order 12 paddles at a time, and each paddle comes with it's own box and wrapping, and was and a pain in the ass with which to deal considering the volume of cardboard.
