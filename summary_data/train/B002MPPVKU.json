      "text": "Love the boot. However, even the manufacturer rep confirms that unless you wear it at least once per week, the polyurethane mid-sole will fall apart, which we've heard a lot of complaints about. REI boot experts says this has been a problem since the company started making the Renegade, a problem the company hasn't solved yet. This doesn't happen with EVA midsoles i.e. Vasque, which are also lighter than polyurethane. Wanted to keep the boot but just can't under these circumstances since it's not exactly cheap. Last hiking boots, which New Balance doesn't make anymore, lasted over 20 years.",

The ones I had fit well, accommodated new foot beds, and then later my orthotics. So I ordered another pair, I though briefly about calling the company, but really who complains about a 14 year old boot that's walked around the world? The new ones came and the fit was perfect, they are comfortable everywhere. I have very picky feet anything that rubs or wears on my foot is an immediate rejection. I couldn't be happier. Off to trek the earth some more.",

I went a half a size up from what I normally wear in case I wanted to add socks and the boots run true to size. I had no blisters and my feet were not sore after my hike. They are lighter than my last pair of boots. I highly recommend these boots. I hike the Ozarks in Missouri and Arkansas.",

I've been able to repair them with Shoe Goo until the soles are pretty well worn down too,at which time I buy another pair just like them.",
