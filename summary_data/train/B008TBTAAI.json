Given that, this is my review. I expected them to function like regular scissors except be sharper for cutting hair. These blades do not match up like regular scissors. The two blades don't touch unless you hold them at just the right angle. It seems like they even have a metal piece to keep them from touching unless you angle your fingers in the holes just right. The blades are very sharp and will cut, if they are held properly, but that is difficult for me to do.",

They cut hair like butter. I have recommended these to my coworkers who quickly ordered theirs. These shears are a true definition of \"Never judge a book by its cover\" especially when it comes to pricing. Love these shears so much im ordering another pair along with the thinning shears.",

That just cheapens the sissies and evening though I cut a lot of hair I will not get them again. Now the get put in a drawer with all the combs and supplies. Very disappointed and will look for a different brand next time.",

My wife double checks my work so I don't have any stray hairs sticking up. She finishes with the Utopia 6.5 inch shears mostly for around the ears and cutting across the back of the head. We both have large hands so these work great. The shears are sharp and precise. We just use them for hair cutting and have used them several times. Seems like they will hold up well.",

I have normal sized hands for a man, wear a medium sized glove, and had to take the rubberized inserts out of the eye holes in order to have any hope of using these scissors. It's still a tight fit even with the inserts out, but the scissors are great otherwise, and it's not like I need a lot of leverage from them, so I'm keeping them.",
