Adjusting the unit while operational will trigger the safety tip-over switch. The tilt function is so poor it's almost 45* between clicks. Best of all! Look closely at the picture; it doesn't matter what order you manually light the burners, or whether you stand in front or behind, you have to reach across the right burner to hold down the button. It gets hot! And if it's tilted you'll be holding that button forever because the switch cuts off the supply.",
