It seems study, paint/coating is nice, all screws fit perfectly. Between the long seat tube arms and 3 locations for the height there's plenty of room for adjustment.",

One son uses the saddle bags, and the other uses just a basket that I 3D printed the clip on mounts for- but any day we can just grab a back click it in and go.. It's easy and works great. Installing the rack is pretty quick and mounts to the frame on some of my bikes and a seat post clamp on the others.. Highly recommend.. You won't be disappointed.",

Good welds. Fits my bike perfectly. Carries a heavy load no problem. Cons: The side bars makes it a little awkward to mount certain pannier styles, though that's no longer an issue for me as I'm now using Ortlieb bags with adjustable mounting points. The little clip tabs at the bottom have begun to bend from use, but nowhere near breaking so far. I would definitely recommend this rack to anyone on a budget, or just starting out in bike touring/commuting!",

Easy enough to put the whole thing together and set it up on your bike. Just a heads-up, it does NOT come with any mounting brackets and whatnot, so go ahead and order whatever fits you bike (frame hardware pack, seat post clamps etc.). Although, if you DO have a fender over your rear wheel - that might be a cumbersome task to accomplish! In my case (Electra Men's Cruiser 1), rods of the fender and the Ibera PakRak Bicycle Touring Carrier Plus+... got crossed and overlapped!!! I'm not exactly happy about that!",

They are just plastic clips and can be easily removed/replaced if you was a fully black aesthetic. The shape works very well with the panniers I've tried and at times I've just tied my messenger bag to the side without any trouble. A++",

Some big box store bikes don't have those mounting holes so you have to use brackets (usually included with bike racks) but it is more cumbersome and not quite as quickly and easily installed. Installing this one on this bike was literally a 5 minute job. It is level and secure.",

Not that I have anything against the PakRak accessories, it's just that I've had the Ortlieb panniers forever and I'm used to those - and they work well on this rack. Currently attached to my '15 Diamondback Haanjo commuter. Thanks to the seller for the quick ship.",

My only criticism is the mounting leg doesn't allow the carrier to mount as low as I would prefer on a 26\" wheel frame. An additional threaded hole in the leg 1/2 \" lower would have made this a 5 star review. Regardless, this is an excellent rack",

I guess the size it comes with is the most common size but, since there are other sizes, it would be nice for them to supply a pair of screws for other sizes as well.
