Here's a quick way to make a couple of servings: Place three of these bags in 16 to 24 oz of cold water. (I use a large mason jar.) Let steep for an hour to three hours. It will brew slowly, not get bitter and you need less ice to chill it.",

Hibiscus is so darned tart some type of sweetener has to be used, and I found agave much better than honey.

Luzianne has a great, nicely balanced flavor with no weird aftertaste and there's less packaging than some of the other brands, so less waste. Plus, I love the larger \"family\" tea bag size for brewing larger batches at once. All in all, highly recommended if you're a true iced tea lover and don't want to spend more than necessary to brew a great tea!",

I also make mine a little weak to increase the water intake and reduce the diuretic effects of caffeine (although you can get this in a decaf version,) so each of the tea bags makes a gallon pitcher for me. Because of that, this is a great value for me. For anyone without friends from Louisiana, it's pronounced \"Loo-zee-Ann\" *grin*",
