It nice, you flip it offer then, you can hang you necklaces or bracelets. This is great for your day-to-day necklaces you rotate. You hang it on a hanger making it flexible on where you can hang it! I have hangers with the hooks that rotate so, you can hang on the back of you door, cabinet, wherever! I'm going to buy one for myself. Now as I'm growing older, it seems I'm getting quite a collection of good jewelry. Wish there was a watch compartment tho. But I highly recommend this product.",

It\u2019s just sensible to be able to find all your tiny stuff in one place, disentangled and clearly visible in their own pockets. The backside comes with velcro strips for necklaces or headbands. I\u2019m very happy with my purchase and recommend everyone to buy one. Tip : you can also store piping tips, tiny gel color bottles, nail polish, sewing accessories, safety pins etc",

      "text": "Our house will soon go on the market. I needed an organizer so I could store my jewelry in a gun safe while visitors are touring my house. This is not the highest quality item you'll find, but it was an inexpensive fix for storing multiple pairs of earrings and a number of bracelets and pins, along with chain drop and pearl necklaces. The item works just as shown in the photos. One side has plastic pockets for small items like earrings and rings, while the other side has 3 rows of Velcro loops to hold necklaces and bracelets separately to keep them from tangling. There is a sleeve pocket for a coat hanger at the top of the organizer.",

I don't especially like the way my necklaces hang in the organizer. They are held by velcro loops, which does make them accessible, but also makes them hang free. One necklace scratched the wall behind it when I hung it in place. Also, I have many long necklaces that hang awkwardly below the organizer. This is very functional, but not very attractive or decorative. Good function for the price. Edited to add another star to this product because of the seller's outstanding customer service.",

The product is sturdy and attractive, easy to use and makes jewelry easy to find. I bought this two years ago, and am glad I did!",
