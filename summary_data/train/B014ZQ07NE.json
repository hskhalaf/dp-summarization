My devices are across the board from MIDI-over-USB DJ equipment, an two-bay external hard drive array, two external USB drives, and they all work perfectly! The shiny area even comes with a protective cover which I've taken off before taking this picture. The performance through the device is phenomenal as well.

I'm tempted to disassemble this thing to see why the farthest 3 ports from the power cord end stopped working in under 2 months (with VERY little use), but I think I'll just try the aluminum version.

Haven't moved any files yet, but I assume things will be a lot faster, since I had two of the hard drives plugged into 2.0 USB slots. My only complaint is the USB cable they give you is too damn short. I had to put all my hard drives and the hub on the on the floor next to each other, because the USB cable wouldn't reach from the USB slot on the computer to the top of the desk. Cable is only maybe 18 inches long. Charge a couple dollars more and provide a three foot cable.",

However, the hub kept cutting off the connection to the hard drives, and this has the same effect as pulling out the cable without disconnection the hard drive first. So after a while, this caused one of the hard drives to fail. Maybe the hub can be used for connecting a mouse or a keyboard, but be careful if you connect more sensitive items. Update: After leaving the review above, I was contacted by Anker customer service, and they gave me a full refund for the hub. Great customer service!",

Now the only slots that work on my unit are the ones my keyboard and mouse are plugged into. The 3rd slot registers when something is plugged in but for whatever reason, the hub isn't drawing enough power to make what's plugged into the slot function despite the fact the hub is plugged directly into my power strip. I've tried all the usual fixes: unplugged and plugged it back in, cleaned the ports, restarted my PC, etc. Nothing worked. In conclusion, buy something from Sabrent instead.",
