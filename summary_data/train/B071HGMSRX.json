Its a little tight for my other guns, though this can easily be adjusted for as, practically, the whole thing is made of velcro and buckles for readjusting purposes. My only complaint is the fact that the button on the strap that holds the gun in the holster is a little difficult/akward to unsnap making it hard to draw quickly",

All tie downs hold in place and haven\u2019t loosened. Weapon stays put during movements in a civilian setting. Now the drawback which isn\u2019t a dealbreaker. On most modern pistols the trigger guards are squared off. While holstering the square trigger guard will catch this holster. I\u2019m guessing it will soften the material in time. Perhaps I have it to tight but I don\u2019t want it to slide around or raddle around while moving.",

I do like it and it works fine though you'll have to take a while and get everything situated for your gun and leg. The velcro allows you to basically set it up any which way you want which is nice and the construction seems to be durable. I have no problem with the product itself and do recommend it. I just found myself more annoyed with my pants getting pulled up or the thigh straps slipping down no matter how I adjusted them. For comfort I just went back to a thigh holster.",

Harder to go much taller than that I think. Easily adapted to SR9c with crimson trace, seems like it would fit almost anything except a large optic that didn't flip down. Whole holster is basically a velcro wrap you can tighten or loosen. Good snap closure retention. You will need to drill with the snap its on the tight side for good retention.",

And the actual holster has random velcro patches everywhere, with no clue what they are for. Because it literally did not come with any instructions, just a clear plastic bag with no words at all. It is quite stiff and not in the good way. All that makes it hard to actually use. Not good for use, should spend the extra money for a solid reliable holster..",

It is strong and snug, adjustable in every important way, has plenty long leg straps, and secure in holding the pistol. Very nice product, and a very reasonable price.",

Velcro is strong stitching is done really well. Looks very sharp when your wearing it, I take mine four wheeling and keeps my gun secure",
