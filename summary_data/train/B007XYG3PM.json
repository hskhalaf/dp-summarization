It was WAY too small. In regular jackets, he's in between an XL and 2XL. We ended up trying the 4XL and we were glad we did! It was perfect for what we needed. It fit correctly, we just wished that we didn't have to play size games in order to find this out! My brother wore this for Negan cosplay and it was just perfect!",

Do buy at least one size larger I wear a XL and purchased the XXL and it fits great. If you conceal carry, I suggest 2 sizes larger as I cannot carry under the arms with the one I bought without it showing. if you carry in your waist band, your probably alright as there is adjustment there that would allow for that.",

The leather quality and workmanship are great. The prices are always reasonable. He still has the older ones but no longer fits into them. He has passed one or two down to our grandson who also rides. Just a note on sizing: they run a little small so we always go up a size from the measurements, this allows layering for winter riding and warmth. Ride to live, live to ride. PS: I also have the Ladies Element jacket for myself..",
