She had forgotten her camera and we looked online for something affordable while not wanting to compromise on quality. Having owned anything from Nikons to Panasonics, we choose this particular Canon model because of its great reviews and futures. What can I say? It did not disappoint upon arrival and as expected this Canon took some amazing pictures. For those traveling or loving to capture the moment without a bulky camera or a larger model, I would highly recommend.",

It has enough manual controls if I want to tinker with it, but the portrait setting is my regular go-to for most people photos. The low-light is quite helpful indoors. For a decent, not too fancy but useful camera, this is a great choice. I especially love love love the zoom. I took close ups of my kids' swim lessons from the other side of the (big) pool. It's nice for catching candid shots without distracting the subjects since I can take the picture from a little ways away. I would buy it again.",

This one is perfect: I even took some photos in some very, very dark catacombs on Malta and they came out beautifully. It's also good for normal lighting conditions, of course; it focuses quickly and its video capacity seemed good to me. It's got a fairly wide angle for a basic camera and I was pleased with the landscape photos I took. Very, very happy with this camera!",

The optical zoom got me close to a lioness and her cubs, a rhinoceros and her calf, and a herd of elephants. Fortunately, since the lens took me closer (and not our jeep) I lived to tell about it. Conversely, in civilized city locations, such as art museums or cathedrals, turning off the flash and letting natural light do the job grabbed some equally iconic photos. Canon is the gold standard. The 260 is my 3rd one. Totally satisfied.",

I leave it in AV mode unless I'm shooting for speed. Lens stability is good (25-500mm equiv), but even with IS I get shake at over 350mm (about 60mm in camera). Having said that, when you want to grab a l-o-n-g shot it's just a compromise you have to live with. Photo quality is still pretty good. My only quibble is it's too big for a pocket and too small for a case. Kind of an awkward size. Still worth 5 stars if you want a small, do-everything camera.",

I wanted a pocket size camera that still offered good quality and this really fits the bill. It is a good weight; sturdy but not heavy, and it will fit into my coat pocket when I want. I will recommend this camera to any novice to mid camera user.",

If you are used to using two hands to hold the camera...which I think most people are, this camera gets a little annoying because if you have your left hand in the upper right corner and you want to use the flash it won't come up. So you have to turn the camera all the way off and then turn it on again to have it re-boot. That gets a little annoying. It's not a bad camera, but for the price I was expecting something a little easier to use.",

You must remember not to put your finger on the pop flash preventing the flash from popping up. Honestly you will get used to not putting your finger on pop flash.",

Only complaint is that the software that came with the camera was useless and out of date/incompatible with my computer.

Reviews recommended this camera in the price range I wanted, so I bought it. Happy with it and very much enjoying the 20X capability. Taking mostly bird shots in good sunlight. Quality looks very good when blown up in Aperture. My goal is not for prints but for web presentations and lectures in PowerPoint or its equivalent. Using a monopod to steady the camera even though it has stabilizing software.",

    "title": "Canon PowerShot SX260 HS 12.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 20x Image Stabilized Zoom 25mm Wide-Angle Optical Lens and 1080p HD Video (Red) (OLD MODEL)",
    "description": "Color:Red| Product Packaging:Standard PackagingThe Canon 6195B100 PowerShot SX260 HS 12.1MP Compact Digital Camera, in red, is an ultra-slim camera with a powerful 20x Optical Zoom, Optical Image Stabilization and 25mm Wide-Angle lens but that is only the beginning of its attractions. You will see detail you never thought possible through the huge zoom and wide-angle lens, while the camera's 12.1 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS Sensor and DIGIC 5 Image Processor deliver the rich, clear low-light performance that is the hallmark of Canon's HS SYSTEM. 1080p Full HD video in stereo is more beautiful than ever, with new high-resolution, high-speed processing. Sophisticated advancements include improved Smart AUTO that optimizes settings for 58 predefined shooting situations, Face ID that prioritizes pre-registered faces, and GPS for tracking and recording your shooting locations.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\nCAPTURE IT ALL\nThe fact that the PowerShot SX260 HS digital camera is an ultra-slim camera with a powerful 20x Optical Zoom, Optical Image Stabilization and 25mm Wide-Angle lens is only the beginning of its attractions. You'll see detail you never thought possible through the huge zoom and wide-angle lens, while the camera's 12.1 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS Sensor and DIGIC 5 Image Processor deliver the rich, clear low-light performance that is the hallmark of Canon's HS SYSTEM. 1080p Full HD video in stereo is more beautiful than ever, with new high-resolution, high-speed processing. Sophisticated advancements include improved Smart AUTO that optimizes settings for 58 predefined shooting situations, Face ID that prioritizes pre-registered faces, and GPS for tracking and recording your shooting locations.\n\nASTONISHINGLY SLIM\nULTRA-SLIM CAMERA WITH POWERFUL 20X OPTICAL ZOOM, OPTICAL IMAGE STABILIZATION AND 25MM WIDE-ANGLE LENS \nAt just over 1-1/4 inches thick, the PowerShot SX260 HS is an ultra-slim digital camera with a powerful 20x Optical Zoom. But because its lens embodies the quality and legacy of Genuine Canon Optics, its advantages go far beyond making the camera slim enough to slip in your pocket and carry anywhere. With a range of 25mm \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 500mm (35mm equivalent), the lens gives you the power to capture the full breadth of scenes, with details you've never captured before. Images are bright and vivid with spectacular clarity thanks to Optical Image Stabilization.\n\n\n\nOPTICAL IMAGE STABILIZER\nHandheld shooting can often lead to camera shake, making photos and videos blurry. Canon\u2019s Optical Image Stabilizer is a sophisticated system that uses lens-shift technology to correct unwanted camera movement. It makes handheld photography more practical, providing excellent image quality in many difficult shooting situations: outdoors at dusk, inside without a flash, and even at the telephoto end of the zoom range without a tripod. For photos, it enables shooting at slower shutter speeds, accommodating more low-light shooting situations than ever before without having to boost ISO sensitivity. With camera shake and vibration reduced, you get a sharper, steadier image. And because it is an optical system, there is none of the image degradation typical with electronic image stabilizers.\n\nUA LENS TECHNOLOGY\nPioneered by Canon, UA Lens technology makes possible compact lenses with remarkable optical performance. By using molded glass with an ultra-high refractive index in aspherical lens elements, Canon has succeeded in reducing lens size while significantly reducing image aberrations. Another stellar example of cutting-edge Canon optics, UA Lens technology helps make PowerShot digital cameras pocket-friendly and capable of astounding image quality. EXPERIENCE THE POWER\nCANON HS SYSTEM\nThe Canon HS SYSTEM lets you take bright, clear photos in an even wider range of shooting situations. Beautiful low-light shots are possible with minimal noise and maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas. The system is the result of two technologies brought together in PowerShot cameras: a high-sensitivity imaging sensor, which is able to capture more light; and the DIGIC 5 Image Processor, which actively reduces noise with high-speed image processing. The 12.1 Megapixel Canon CMOS sensor in the PowerShot SX260 HS incorporates advanced light reception technology that enhances sensitivity. The DIGIC 5 Image Processor provides a major boost in noise reduction, expanding the usable ISO range to an amazing high of ISO 3200. The Canon HS SYSTEM thus lets you use higher shutter speeds to capture clearer images with reduced noise and blur.\n\nCANON DIGIC 5 IMAGE PROCESSOR \nThe latest-generation Canon DIGIC 5 Image Processor brings phenomenal increases in processing speed and power. Improved chip architecture and algorithms deliver greatly expanded functionality with further refinement in image quality. Improved noise reduction produces clearer images when shooting in low light at high ISO speeds. Enhanced i-Contrast performance adjusts differences between light and dark areas to achieve even more natural-looking results. The faster processing speed also results in faster continuous shooting capability while maintaining full image quality. The DIGIC 5 Image Processor also makes possible a new, highly advanced automatic white balance system. Whereas conventional white balance makes an overall adjustment based on a single type of light source, the new Canon Multi-Area White Balance analyzes several areas of the image to determine whether different adjustments are needed, for example, for the main subject and the background.\n\nMEMORABLE MOMENTS IN SPECTACULAR FULL HD\nCANON FULL HD VIDEO ADVANTAGE \nIn addition to the Canon HS SYSTEM, the combination of the advanced CMOS sensor and DIGIC 5 Image Processor in the PowerShot SX260 HS makes it possible to shoot crisp, clear high definition video. Imagine the fun and excitement of being able to shoot spectacular 1080p Full HD video with stereo sound that you can later watch on your HDTV or download to your computer to share with family and friends. In addition to being able to shoot Full HD 1080p video at 24* frames per second, the PowerShot SX260 HS can also shoot 720p HD video at 30** frames per second.\n\nDEDICATED MOVIE BUTTON, WIND FILTER FEATURE AND OPTICAL ZOOM FOR EASY VIDEO CAPTURE \nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never been easier to shoot videos with a PowerShot digital camera.

Simply take a picture of up to 12 faces you would like the camera to register, then enter names and ages. Once a person is registered, the camera will pick him or her out of a group (even against a busy background) and adjust focus and exposure to his or her face, even recognizing faces in profile. Face ID is particularly great for shots of babies and children. The system can pick your baby out of a group of children, focus on your baby when pictured with an adult, and capture her best smile by taking three successive images when the smile is detected. The flash is even disabled so as not to startle the baby and interrupt the moment. Older children in motion are tracked, with focus and exposure continually adjusted with Servo AF; with one shutter press three successive images are captured so the best shot is never missed. And because you'll identify each face you register, Face ID makes it easy to search images by name.\n\nA STEADY IMAGE IS A BEAUTIFUL IMAGE\nINTELLIGENT IS\nThe latest advance in Canon Optical Image Stabilization technology, Intelligent IS analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation. For stills, the system automatically selects among Normal, Panning, Macro (Hybrid) and Tripod IS modes. When shooting video, the system automatically selects among Dynamic, Powered, Macro and Tripod IS modes. With Intelligent IS, you can concentrate on image capture, letting the camera make the most effective IS settings to assure the steadiest possible image.\n\nNormal Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills.\n\nPanning Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement.\n\nMacro (Hybrid) Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting.\n\nDynamic Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking.\n\nPowered Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified.\n\nTripod When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed.\n\n\nTHE IDEAL TRAVELING COMPANION\nGPS TECHNOLOGY\nThe PowerShot SX260 HS digital camera is equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS)* technology.
