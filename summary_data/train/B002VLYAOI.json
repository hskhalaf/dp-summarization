I think the problem lies in the difference in test time- this test wants first morning urine which is better at detecting estrogen amounts. However, LH is highest from 10am-8pm. So my wondfo LH strips were positive at 12:30 and 8:00 pm even though this test showed only high fertility, not peak, that morning and the next morning. So although it might be good at detecting high fertility, I think you need to test more than just when you wake up to get a peak fertility sign.",

I recommend people that are having a lot more trouble figuring out their cycles to use ClearBlue Digital Ovulation test.

Clear blue is straight forward, it is yes or no. However it won't tell you or store your history to know how close ovulation is. You can look at the strips and manually detect the changes. The darker line shows you closer to peak LH. Compared to the premom, I prefer premom. Premom gives you an actual level to compare to. On peak LH, both premom and clear blue indicated peak at the same time. Premom stores history and allows you to compare every month. It is also less expensive.",

My doctor told me to wait until I had my first period after surgery and then I could try to conceive. I purchased these and used the period tracker app Flo. I looked forward the days leading up to ovulation and then started using the clear blue digital ovulation stick. I tested one day and it said there wasn\u2019t a chance to get pregnant. Tested the next day and received my flashing smiley face. Fast forward to today and I am 6 weeks pregnant! Buy these!",

CB needs to revamp their product, or relabel their accuracy rates (which are clearly misleading). On their website, CB\u2019s explanation for false positives is the possibility of a chemical pregnancy. It was not in my case, since I used CB and another reliable brand at the same time. Both yielded different results. I retested the following day with the same two brands, and both (including CB) were negative. The only explanation for this is a faulty product. This raises questions regarding the accuracy of the ovulation strips, will therefore not purchase again.",

It was my first month with this problem. I think they work well but perhaps not for people with multiple LH surges.",
