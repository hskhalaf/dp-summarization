The hygrometer is junk and can't be calibrated and the 'embedded magnetic seal' doesn't really work well, as the humidity escapes through it. Very difficult to keep the humidity inside the box. I ended up putting this box inside a large zip lock bag to keep the humidity level at 70%. The material is simply too thin to absorb any moisture and keep it there. You get what you pay for...... Looks nice though. I think I'll just keep my cutters and matches in it instead.",

At least 10 percentage points. I still use it as a reference, I just did the salt test and marked where 75% was on the face of it. Make sure you remove the clear plastic ring from around the base of it.",

Maybe I\u2019m lucky or maybe this brand makes very accurate hygrometer. Either way, I wouldn\u2019t really sweat about the hygrometer. Test it out but in my case, it\u2019s highly accurate. Also both humidifiers that came with the humidor work really well. Overall a great purchase.",

I bought another humidity generator for the box to help produce the humidity needed. One last thing, it\u2019s capacity is limited. With a digital hydrometer and a 1 inch X 3 inch humidity generator, the box only holds about ~15 medium cigars. Nevertheless, I\u2019d buy it again or get one for a friend.",
