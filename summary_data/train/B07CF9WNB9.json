The sound quality is excellent and I was honestly confused why other folks had issues with it. When I watch movies or TV shows the voices come through nice and crisp. Music sounds great as well. I was also very happy with how easy it was to setup. It literally took me 5 minutes. Very pleased with this sound bar and I would recommend it to others.",

And yes, I know it has an option to correct for this, but it does not go in the correct direction. The sound is DELAYED, and the option for fixing this only lets you increase the delay. I have a cablebox, apple tv, xbox one all connected to my TV, and from TV to soundbar I have tried both an optical cable and HDMI (arc). In ever scenario, the sound is slightly lagged behind the video. I have tried the latest updates to no avail. Very disappointed, wish I could return it, but I waited too long :(",

But using the app is easier than digging around for the remote. Also you need the app to update the soundbar anyways which you should do before even using it.",

Dialog was sometimes drowned out by background noise/music, but I cranked the center channel way up, and it\u2019s much better now. It integrates perfectly with my LG TV, so I don\u2019t need to use the sound bar remote. If you need to change the individual speaker/channel volumes, as I did, it\u2019s much easier to do using the mobile app.",

Medium size room with normal ceiling height. Having the sound bar in the correct mode makes all of the difference in the world. I think many of the negative reviews are user error.
