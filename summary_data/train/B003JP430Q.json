The case is so awkward to carry while he's riding that he often ends up walking his bike or just leaving it at home. Received this awesome mesh gear bag today and the viola case fits with room to spare for his school supplies. I couldn't be happier! He loves it and says it's very comfortable, too. Excellent craftsmanship and awesome value!!",

Mind you we keep the bags away from salt water and always hose them down with freshwater after going out. One of the zippers actually had a chunk break off. They corrode super easily. Save yourself the headache. Else you will regret it when your equipment is stuck inside your bag and you can no longer use it because the zippers are broken.",
