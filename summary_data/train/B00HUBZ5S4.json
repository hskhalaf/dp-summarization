But I only gave it 3 stars because they're hard disks, and it's hard to break off any pieces, and to take a smaller piece and break it even smaller to make it bite-sized for cat or ferret is even more difficult... granted, I'm 60 and my hands dont have the strength they used to but even so... it's a consideration that needs to be taken into account. I won't be buying anymore because of this... but my animals sure love them when I can manage! I give them Optimize instead and they love that too!",
