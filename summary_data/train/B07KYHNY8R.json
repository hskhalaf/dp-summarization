The support in this bra keeps the shape, while maintaining support, and looks great under all clothes! For me, as a slightly larger, bust woman, you do get a little 'snug' around the armpits, but it isn't noticeable under a tank top or sleeveless top.",

I\u2019m about 34/36D so to be safe I bought size 36. It\u2019s perfect. Of course it\u2019s not going to boost the girls up but definitely gives enough support where I don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re hanging down to my stomach. The material is thick and shiny, the padding is just enough for protection. The bonus is the top portion of the bra isn\u2019t the type that squeezes your underarm fat!! Cannot beat the price for the quality.",
