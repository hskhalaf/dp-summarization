I got so much hair and dirt out of him, and he smells so much better now. All his drool-matted fur came clean, and his coat is soft and smooth again. He seems happier, too!

Now it may say waterless, but your cat will be wet and won't like it. She didn't like it. It's also not foamy. You'll note the cone, I put it on her so the aloe and oils would soak in to her skin and help the itch more than if I let her automatically clean herself. I let her air dry then took the cone off to let her clean. If your cat is itchy, I'd advise the same. Now I just need a bigger bottle!",

Probably because it goes on watery, rather than foamy. Also, don't follow the instructions to let it air dry and then brush it out. If you let it air dry, the cat's fur will be glued together in sticky spikes, and not brushable without a lot of tugging. Rubbing it out with a towel and then continually brushing and ruffling until dry will keep it from ending up in spikes, but the residue of the product is pretty unpleasant as well.",

It also made her smell like an old lady wearing too much floral perfume. I wish they made this fragrance-free or more natural... the smell was so strong we could smell her just before she walked into a room. Faded a bit after a week, thankfully. In the end, we decided that in the future, we'll just stick with regular baths.",

It was rather watery, but I managed to rub what I caught onto my cat's fur and it seemed to clean and condition it fairly well. I liked the scent, but I just couldn't get it to come out as a foam and it was really messy, dripping all over the floor. I won't order it again.",

Her dander was really bad and I honestly haven't noticed it since starting this shampoo! I highly recommend!!",
