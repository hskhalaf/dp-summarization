I'd recommend to anyone who is looking for an affordable foot spa after long day to treat yourself or use before giving yourself a pedi! Only thing I wish was in a different location is extra pedi attachments, because being in the center it is sometimes difficult to feel real benefits of them. The power cord could be longer too. *Try using with Bath & Body Works Aromatherapy products. Great relaxing scents!",

Update 1/9/2019: I removed the bottom plate, added water to determine where leak was coming from. Applied silicone around orange circular light covers (source of leak). No more leaking! Also, customer service emailed me after my review. To my surprise I received a replacement spa today. Very pleased with customer service. So happy to resolve the issue because the spa is truly wonderful!",

I LOVE THIS THING !! i bought it when i was working a lot so my feet would be really sore after work. this thing is the ultimate relaxation for your feet. the water heats up very fast and it gets really hot! the only downside i would say is because it\u2019s electric you have to use it near an outlet and it\u2019s pretty heavy especially when it\u2019s full of water so it\u2019s a little difficult when you\u2019re done and gotta dump the water out. but i would 100% recommend this for anyone whose feet are exhausted",

I haven\u2019t read any other reviews complaining about it so I think it\u2019s a sensitivity issue. I usually do the massage feature only the last three to five minutes now.

And surprisingly the water heated up fairly quickly and the best part is it holds whatever temperature you set- end it also has a timer that is very useful. Tired feet your savior has arrived!",

The rollers provide good massage also. I completely recommend.",
