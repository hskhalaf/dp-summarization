The stitching is also inconsistent, And they are not even oiled leather. They are a shiny man made material",

Once broken in they are as comfortable as any shoe I\u2019ve owned. I also recommend getting the shoe polish and treating them like you would other leather boots to avoid cracking.

I never even tried the boots on because it was abundantly clear that they were not the same quality as the classic styles produced in England. It's a shame. I truly loved the pair I had years ago, and completely wore through the soles without a single complaint.

They boots themselves are awesome and that\u2019s what was important so thank you in the end everyone is happy.",

Still too stiff buy they are getting more flexible. As for the look, they are perfect. I use them with EVERYTHING.",

The color is perfect to pair with jeans and the muted flowers add a feminine detail without being obnoxiously evident. Like all Docs, they take a few wearings to soften up and reach their maximum comfort level; so give them time! My only complaint was that I found the laces too short and fat to tie tightly. I ended up buying a longer pair so I could double knot them. As sandal season approaches, I'm a little sad to put these puppies away until fall!",
