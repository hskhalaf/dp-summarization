At first I thought she just didn't like the packaging change, but comparing nutrition info they are indeed different. The old version had 70 calories and 9g sugar. New one is 60 calories and 6g sugar. Same listed ingredients so they likely cut back on the pear puree and upped the veggies. On the one hand I like that there is less sugar, however on the other hand now she doesn't eat them at all so I would call that a net loss.",
