After the 5th month though, the fabric started to come away or the glue started to wear off, specifically on the edge sidings of the phone carrier so I had to cut off the excess to keep it from flapping. Either way, I've since upgraded phones and am wary to buy this brand again. It is a stylish brand though and if I were someone who changed cases every 6 months, I'd certainly keep buying this.",

I normally don't hold credit cards in these types of wallet cases, so I can't speak to the durability of the slots. But as an elegant-looking phone cover, it gets the job done and then some. The case also comes with a screen protector to further prevent scratches on the front of your phone, which is a very nice touch. I'm only knocking off one star because the magnet strength appears to be weaker than a comparable case I had for a different phone. Otherwise, I believe it was a good buy.",

I carry about 8 cards of varying thickness, which include my AAA card and health cards, license and a little cash. This wallet does not accommodate them well. But, in fairness, it\u2019s not intended to hold as much. The magnet tab cannot wrap around and hold the wallet closed. If I could carry only 6 cards and no cash, the wallet works as it\u2019s intended!! Very nicely! Would you please consider making a newer design that will hold 1-2 additional cards and at least two bills and market it as such. Thank you for your consideration!!",

Slightly more material would allow it to close properly, hold enough cards, accommodate folding money & magnetic clasp to close. In all other aspects, fine product. Leather looks, feels good.
