The quality feels very sturdy and the black matte finish is gorgeous. I'm in the military, and wanted something I could lug around all day and not have to worry about damage or scratching a stainless steel finish. I really like that different colored bands for the cap were included. Even though I plan on keeping the black, I like that I have the option later if my wife decides to use my bottle. I added a Texas sticker cause everything is bigger, even our water bottles.",
