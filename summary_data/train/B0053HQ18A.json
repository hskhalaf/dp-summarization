It's OK and I like it for the price, $14.34 was not too high and lower than the black version. I do plan to mount it on milk cartons as do all kayakers. I have a pole light that will sit with a flag and led light on top, I made, to take up the middle position. I like it.",

My wife was against permanently attaching these, and I was on board with that due to the low use. Thus I came up with a removable design using this product, Taylor Made Pontoon Boat Rail Fender Hanger/Adjusters (also bought on Amazon), and some stainless machine screws. Made two of them. Works perfectly.",
