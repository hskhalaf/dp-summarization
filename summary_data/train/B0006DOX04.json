For the price, we will keep using until it wears out or breaks, then just get another one. RECOMMEND TO ALL.",

Sure, you have to do it in smaller batches, but we had about 25 kids wanting Sno-Cones and no one had an unreasonable wait. They came out nice and fluffy. The only issue is drying it out afterwards... the area where the ice gets shaved can't be wiped out, so I just kept shaking it and shaking it and could still hear some water drops inside. So next time we use it I'll have to remember to wash it out first in case there's mildew.",

I purchased a tube of drink cones separately, they worked well. Snow cones are a great way to get kids to consume more water, and the amount of syrup per cone isn\u2019t extensive enough to add too many empty calories. You might be able to use the slush for drinks, like daiquiris. I don\u2019t drink, but it might work.",

If it maintained it as \"snow\" then it would give u time to have a second serving. Perhaps that's a design the company can come up either next. The base is just cosmetic, so if somehow they could add something to hold insulation, that might b a good add on.",

Quick and easy, and there is a safeguard on top that won't run unless it is on. We never used consistently for 5 minutes, but it made so many snow cones at once, we never had to. Definitely would recommend!",

Works great for home use for several cones. A little loud chopping ice but so easy to clean. And it is so cute to leave sitting on the counter. This is the second one I have bought and I would recommend it.",

Although, i got worried it had came broken or something when I first saw the package because it looked a bit beaten up but nope it came perfectly fine! For me the noise does not bother me, it is a bit loud (maybe as loud as a blender) and may bother others but as long as you dont mind the noise then I suggest you get this. Will update this review if anything happens.",

I'd still say it is a great little machine for the price! *Updated review: the machine started getting jammed more frequently. It's a great idea but the design/construction is just not quite right. Because of this I am returning the machine & downgrading my 4 star to a 2. It was a good price but in the end not worth the hassle. Hopefully the company figures the kinks out because it could be a great product.",
