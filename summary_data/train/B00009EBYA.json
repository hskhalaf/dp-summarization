      "text": "I cannot speak for all devices, but this was a total failure in my case. I am a fast typist, and it seemed that about 20% of the keystrokes were not picked up by my Treo 270. This was simply unacceptable, so I immediately returned it. I cannot determine whether the problem was due to the keyboard, the software, or my old PDA. Newer, faster PDAs might have a better success rate, but the potential for problems will still be there. My suggestion is to buy this somewhere with a generous return policy so that you can return it if it is a mismatch for your PDA.",

The only problem I had was the size of the keys on the keyboard. The numbers are not exactly where a normal size keyboard dwould be. With a little patience I worked it out.",

So carry extra batteries, and any where there is vibration (Airplane, Train, etc.) you are out of luck unless you use one hand to hold everything still. If I am going to use one hand to hold the PDA, then why not just use the styli? Caution!!! Mac / Palm users you need a pc and windows to make it work!!!!!",

The cradle (rubber covered stiff wires) works best for \"squared\" PDAs (my Ipaq has a rounded bottom and can rock), and you may need to tilt the PDA for the infared bar to point into your IR reader. (If you use a flip-style case, you will have to remove it for the IR bar to beam into your IR reader.) I'm not crazy about the cursor arrow key (it's not a regular cursor \"arrow\" key), and the split-up space bar keys do sometimes have problems. As another reviewer remarked, downloading the drivers from Targus.com is much easier than using their included CD-ROM.",

The plastic is flimsy, the IR port is clever but poorly designed, and the keyboard has some funny layout aspects.

Takes a little getting used to at first. My only complaint is that it just randomly stopped working a couple times. Considering it happened only three times in two years, it's not too bad.

The adjustable arms are laughingly flimsy. As a result I can only get it to work if I hold the pda in my right hand directly above the ir arm. Then it works great but it's an utterly unworkable solution. Instead of a rotating arm which makes the angle wrong. Why not a sliding arm so that it is always at a right angle? Truly awful unworkable piece of flimsy junk",
