The quality is just as good as the one that Teavanna sells, but this one is less than half the price of the one sold there. Even with the light in it, you can easily touch the sides to move it around. Almost all of the heat is directed up into the teapot and not into the body of the warmer. So good, I will probably buy another one or two!",

The metal is very thick, and this thing is heavy! The little bits that stick up on the top are good at keeping the teapot from sliding around, and also keep the teapot warmer cool.",

Use the tealights in the little tins vs the short candles as wax can flow out of the holes in the bottom if your candle melts.",
