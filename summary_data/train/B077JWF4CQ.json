I was very surprised at the quality of this spinning real. I have compared it to my name brand, more expensive reels, and wished I would have known about this brand when I was paying three times for the same quality of gear. It is smooth with a smooth drag system. I would definitely recommend this product for people to try before spending more for a product that doesn't function as well.",

Late January we got to take a quick fishing trip and he was able able to get 3 successful casts before the line jammed up in under the reel. Luckily, we always travel with a couple spare rods ready to go. Next morning he threw away the brand new line and bought lighter weight line and restrung it. Got two casts out before the same thing happened. Now during quarantine he tried again with more new line... same results.... Total waste of $80+ Very disappointed",

All lines produced the same effect, more line at the bottom of the spool then the top. This lead to the line getting all fouled up. We call them rats nests. The kevlar lines were strung at the stores where I purchased them. The monofilament line I put on myself. I bought this reel because I wanted as light a reel as possible. I own the Kodiak 3000 made by this company and it has been one of my favorite reels. I was very disappointed with the Sharky. Reel returned.",

After years of fishing, this is by far the best rod and reel I have ever owned. Definately will recommend and buy again when I'm ready for a larger one for a big surf rod and reel..Or as a gift..Happy fishing all :)",

This one is definitely one of the best.It takes about four full turns on the knob to adjust the drag from minimum to maximum, which makes it very precise for different drag requirements. Also it starts vert smoothly under low drag settings. works well for both heavy and light tackles. One of the best improvements I preferred! The braided line ready spool is a plus.

      "text": "Heavier than expected and not quite as smooth as my Shimano NASCI, but for half the price I can't be mad. I'll update once I actually start to use it in the water, but initial impression is good. It's what you would expect from a $50 reel. Just don't expect it to match up to reels in the $100 range. Update: I tried it in the water today and it's just an ok reel. I put 15lb braided lines on it and I was surprised how much of an effort it takes to operate the reel. Like I said in my original post, don't expect the smoothness and weight of a $100 reel.",

I open it up to find brass pinion in the middle is shredded and the main cranking gear is trashed. Pay a little more, get a Shimano, a Daiwa, or an Abu Garcia.

I would say 4000 for Speckled Trout,Redfish and Flounder .if you are wanting a medium to heavy reel for Bigger or saltwater fishing or surf casting. I would go with 5000 series. Although the 38 lb drag should handle any fish I will fight, its just a smaller frame and less line capacity. Very impressed at how balanced and smooth they are.
