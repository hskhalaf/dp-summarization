These shoes definitely met those expectations. However avoid wearing these with white socks while doing a lot of walking. They will bleed blue as shown in the picture. Overall they fit true to size and would have gotten a 4th star from me if it weren't for the socks incident. A 5th star would require them to breathe a little bit better.",

I wear Size EUR-43 and UK-9, according to your size chart i was expecting that US-10 would fit me, but as i suspected from my previous experience i ordered size US-10 and still tightly narrow. I wish you improve on the wide on all kinds of shoes you make. I always buy from Aldo in UK and in South Africa but i never had problems with sizes, this is the 3rd time i by from US and i always have the same problem. I cannot go to US-11 because it will be like +1\" longer for me. Please fix this.",
