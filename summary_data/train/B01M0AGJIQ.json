      "text": "I purchased this heater in January. It had a nice imitation fireplace and put out enough heat to keep my living room warm. My problem is that it completely stopped working after only four months of use. No warning or anything. Just will not turn on. Then I check my return information and it tells me that my return window ended after only 30 days and my product support ended after only 60 days. There have been a lot of reviews on this product and most have been good. Maybe I got a lemon, but now it looks like I'm stuck with a heater that doesn't work and no support from the seller.",

There are MANY manufacturers and MANY models from each manufacturer and after hours of researching, we both picked this unit it...I was trying to surprise her and finally decided on this model and the next day she emailed me after hours of research and said that this is the model she wanted!",

We\u2019ve seen other heaters that look like wood burning stoves for 10X this price and we wouldn\u2019t trade our Duraflame purchase for any one of them.

My living room has been nicely heated, although I think think the 1000 square ft it\u2019s suppose to heat may be a stretch. It heats adequately for what we bought it for. The fan noise that some have complained about is noticeable, but not loud enough for us to complain. It\u2019s more like white noise after awhile.

With how cold it's been lately we were running into an issue with our bill for running our heat being outrageously high. Therefor we decided to purchase this item. It works great and looks amazing! The size is perfect, not too big and not too small. It runs really quiet, just a nice soft sound to the room. Easily sleep with it and not noticed when watching t.v. or listening to music.

The features are great, the auto timer is fantastic and we could not be happier with this unit.",

I am so impressed with being able to adjust the temps, the cleaner air, and the fact that it doesn't dry out the air.

It is temperature controlled and you can just see the flame if you want. That is a great feature.",

The display/remote utility is probably its biggest set back. You cannot see the display because it\u2019s covered by the door, which is nice- until you need to use the remote and you can\u2019t actually see what you\u2019re doing unless you go and open the door, which defeats the purpose of having the remote.

There is a low noise with the heater and flames on at the same time. I purchased the Cinnamon. It brightens the bedroom. Just as others stated, the beveled glass give the flames a 3-D effect. Although I have a fireplace, I will use this more and save on the propane. Just went back in and ordered the \"crackling flame effect\" part and the 70 wood-burning scent packets.
