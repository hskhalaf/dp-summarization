She figured out how to maneuver it quickly, and it has already slowed her down considerably.",

In an effort to control his weight and encourage him to let me sleep at night, I bought this interactive cat feeder. He is very good at getting food from this feeder, however I think that his stomach stretch receptors have more time to kick in (or he just gets lazy after a few bites) and no longer eats everything at once. I can sleep through the night, and he is on a much healthier \"rate of eating\" now. The only downside is that the food I use in this cat feeder is dry food.",

Overall she seems to be a lot better. I would definitely recommend this to someone worried about their pet's weight.",

The only reason i give it 4 stars is that on a non carpeted floor, it sips around as the cat digs out the food. Rubberized bottom would make more sense but perhaps that is how it is designed. But i find it sometimes as far as 6 feet from where it normally is from cat moving it to and fro. Would buy again",
