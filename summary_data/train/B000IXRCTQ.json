      "text": "Finally a volleyball my 7 year old can really enjoy! I absolutely love this ball. I have tried several different balls, including a Wilson Soft Play and they were just too heavy and hurt my daughter's arms. This ball is amazing! It's light, there is no sting when it hits your arms, and it has the feel of a regulation volleyball. I highly suggest this volleyball for kids and even adult beginners that don't like heaviness and sting of other volleyballs.",

I've used Tachikara's as well as Molten's for 12 and under balls. They have a very soft feel that is easy on their arms. It has that composite \"spongy\" feel (compared to the leather balls). My girls love it! I also ordered a blue ball, and it arrived already inflated. It is the same ball that I can tell. Can't go wrong with Tachikara's!",
