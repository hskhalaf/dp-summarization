      "text": "I ordered the Yamaha YCL-650 clarinet based on Amazon reviews and have been ecstatic with my choice. The original estimated delivery date seemed extended and, on inquiry, I was told the instrument had already been shipped from Japan. It arrived in the most beautiful packaging a mere several days later. It was wrapped like a priceless antique and the instrument inside was equally a treasure. It is so lovely that I look forward to practicing each evening and anticipate many years of dedication to justify its craftsmanship.",

Very well made, they keys are VERY responsive and you can't beat the quality especially for the price. I've had my 650 for over almost 15 years now, just got her tuned up, oiled and pads replaced and she sounds amazing. I've played Selmer and Buffets models that are \"comparable\" to this model but there is no contest. I'd pick the 650 any day over the others.",
