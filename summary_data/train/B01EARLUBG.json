The sleep mode is a life saver so you don\u2019t hear any creepy Furbys talking throughout the night. The app you can download to play digitally is fun and interactive. The little guy is kind of gross, but it\u2019s funny. If you pull his tail or shake him, he\u2019ll make a farting sound or vomit. My two year old laughs every time.",

What is disappointing is that the toy was purchased with the intention of connecting it to the Furby Connect app. Unfortunately we have been unable to connect the Bluetooth with any of our Apple devices. I have researched the issue, which appears to be quite prevalent, and tried all of the suggested fixes. Unfortunately nothing has worked. I'm at my wits end and am about ready to return my daughter's gift.",
