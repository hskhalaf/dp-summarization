      "text": "The local Disney store and the online Disney store were both out of Pooh Bears (unless you wanted a specialty version). Looking on various website showed a lot of knockoffs but this one looked good in the photos and what I received was clearly a legitimate Disney product. The bear is well made and very soft. It came with the appropriate tags and in a Disney plastic bag. The only issue was that it arrived tightly packaged in that bag and the face was smooshed. I worked it out so it looked normal; after a little bit it looked funny again. Some time and a couple of strategic squishes later and now it looks fine.",

He is perfectly adorable, high quality, and oh so very soft and squishable. This bear is done so well, from the little Pooh shirt and the embroidered name, the colors chosen are just perfect, the plush fabric of the bear itself, the details on the face, the posture he's in as he sits, to the overall cuddle factor, this little bear is going to be our great niece's best little buddy for many, many years to come. I highly recommend this sweet Winnie the Pooh. I expect nothing less from Disney, so well done, once again.",

I have had a lifelong connection with Disney (Disneyland especially). I even worked through a rigorous managerial program and worked in the park for several years as my first job after college. The characters like Winnie and the brilliance of art with joy is what this place is about forever in my mind. But along with some other Disneyland items; I have been sending my mom several gifts to remind her of my love and the memories that are still clear and magic.",
