I tested them on a bright sunny day and I could see the sun with no eye strain. Everything else was blacked out as it should be. I'm very happy with my purchase. Since these are cardboard and I have kids who will be using them, I will be poking a small hole on each end and tying a thin elastic cord to each end. Then the glasses will wrap securely around my kids' heads to ensure they stay in place. I hope this idea helps other parents too.",
