Also, it would be nice if the paper was thicker or if images were not double sided. We will probably only be able to color 50% of the pictures due to marker bleeding. However, gel pens also work well and do not bleed through. See my images for an example- I colored autumn Pusheen but summer Pusheen was sadly ruined.",

However, I'm one of those people that like to color with markers vs colored pencils/crayons. When I started seeing the pages being double sided I grew incredibly worried. And to my fears- the pages bled the color. This means if I continue to use my markers, I have to choose one side of the page over the other since I'll destroy the other one with color bleed. This upset me so greatly that I almost dont want to color in it :<",

There are a variety of larger simpler designs and smaller more intricate designs. Great for all ages of Pusheen lovers. Only bummer is that the pages are not perforated so they are not easily torn out. Which is what I usually do for my kids to make them easier to color flat and they always want to display their masterpieces.",

People have been reporting bleeding with markers - I use crayons and colored pencils with this book and haven't had problems yet. Would highly recommend for any cat or Pusheen lover, people who like to color casually, and anyone who likes cute things (Pusheen poses frequently with sweets, hearts, flowers, and mystical creatures).",

It's nice that some of the designs are very simple and can be colored in just a few minutes while some are more complex/inticrate and will take longer. Since there are designs on both sides of the page some markers will bleed through. I have found that the double-ended markers from Target and the double ended Super Markers brand I have do not bleed through. But BiC Mark-it markers do bleed through very noticeably (I have included pictures.)",

      "text": "The illustrations in this book are adorable. I bought this because the other adult coloring books out there are too intricate and pretty overwhelming to do for folks who stress easily like me. I want to relax when I color! This one has more simple pictures and easy to follow spaces. I actually bought two because I thought the pictures were too cute to ruin by my poor color choices. LOL",

For all the Pusheen fans out there, you know she has her many disguises, her taste in food, and her obsession of laziness.
