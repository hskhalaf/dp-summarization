When you put the hair brush next to it\u2019s head, it\u2019ll light up with sounds. That\u2019s about it so honestly it should be more around $20 in my opinion but our girl is happy. Gave it four stars because we had some hair come out with brushing. Hoping this is just a first use kind of thing but can see it becoming a problem if not since the whole idea is to brush the unicorn\u2019s hair. It\u2019ll make a great gift for any kid into unicorns that\u2019s for sure!",

There are three different songs, and the lights are so bright my daughter likes to sit in her room with the lights off just to watch the show. Such an incredible find, I highly recommend it!",

Not sure what the brush is supposed to do when you brush the mane or tail but this one doesn't do anything but detangle a little bit. We have more fun braiding than brushing. It plays music when you push a button and lights up pretty nicely when the music plays. That's all I see as play value. Nt really an educational/learning toy but cute for a unicorn.....",
