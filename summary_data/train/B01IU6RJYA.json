I needed a mattress for my kid cause in 2 days I'll have last minute guests over, now I wont have a mattress for my kid anymore and have 1 day to find a mattress somewhere else.

It had a \"new materials smell\" which wasn't an issue for about 3 days and now you can hardly smell it. Nothing like the Ikea mattresses which are supposed to be unbearable. 3. It's vacuum packed and pops up to full size when you open the bag. Mine was fully expanded and firm within a few minutes. I've slept on this thing for two weeks and have had restful, comfortable sleeps. No complaints! I'm glad I got this 8\" one instead of the 5\" one which would have been much too thin.",

      "text": "We got this mattress for our daughter and I wasn't expecting much from a cheap mattress, but I was very surprised by the quality. It is a spring mattress with a small layer of memory foam on top. It is surprisingly comfortable and I wouldn't mind sleeping on it. We loved it so much we got another one for our other daughter. I only wish it came in grey or a different color. Otherwise can't complain and glad we were able to save money and have our daughters sleep on a surprisingly comfortable mattress! Thanks Linen spa! Both came rolled up, nice and compact for shipping and also dissappointed they didn't come with bedbugs like others have suggested \ud83e\udd23",
