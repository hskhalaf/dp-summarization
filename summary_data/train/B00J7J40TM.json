The disc brakes are nice, this is the first bike I've had with disc brakes and they work very well. It isn't too heavy for everyday use, and handles sand and loose dirt really well. If you're looking for a decent fat tire bike that isn't going to break the bank, this is a great start.",

They were very inadequate for the bike in it's original form, and now that I have added so much weights they really do not perform at all. I will be switching to 203mm hydraulica over the winter from the 160mm mechanical that came with the bike. But for such a cheap price, how can I complain?",

Good: I\u2019m 250 pounds and these tires are so large that even the largest pot wholes are handled with ease. Bad: the seat it comes with was built for a road/speed bike, meaning it\u2019s tiny. In addition, the brakes on this bike are not large enough, so make sure you get some practice in an open space to get use to how early you need to apply the brakes based on speed. Lastly the grip handles are smaller than normal, if you have normal or large size hands, get ready to feel some discomfort.",

It definitely weighs somewhere over 40 pounds, and takes effort to get moving compared tu other bikes, but if you're using it for exercise, (like me,) I'd view that as a plus. The only downside I've encountered is that the tires are so wide that you can't lean the bike when you pedal. I'm used to standing when I ride and leaning the entire bicycle back and forth when I extend my legs, which isn't possible here. Took less than an hour to assemble, needed brakes tightened, and off I went. Would definitely recommend.",

The disk brakes could use an upgrade thats for sure.. but for the 300 I paid for the bike I say it was worth it compared to other prices around. I read some horror reviews. But honestly thats usually the person who delivers fault for mishandling packages. my bike came in great shape. I recommend \ud83d\udc4c",
