      "title": "Great monitor",
      "text": "I use this monitor with my 2018 Macbook Pro. There was an initial problem with the MBP recognising the full 5120x1200 resolution, but a recent update from Apple seems to have addressed that problem and I can now use the full resolution without having to resort to using it as two monitors. I love the fact that I only need a single cable to connect the monitor to my MBP and the monitor also powers the MBP. It makes for a very neat solution and easy docking between working at my desk and working on the move. It's a bit pricey, but I love this monitor.",

I have to touch a button to stop it sleeping. Also, the auto ambience is not so great with room lights. Other than that, lovely monitor! Dont understand why delivery takes so long though, but overall, I am happy with it so far. It's a little pricey too...",

I researched this product so much and was not sure if to spend a lot more as at \u00a3500 it seemed like it must be flawed to be cheaper than others available. I love the screen. Does exactly what I need. I don't do any gaming, I just use Sketch, Visual Studio Code, Final Cut Pro and it's brilliant. I have two MacBook Pros as one is my work machine. My work machine uses USB-C and my machine uses Thunderbolt to get 60hz instead of HDMI. If you're looking for an ultra wide for design/development then this is perfect.",
