It doesn't taste the best but you get use to it and honestly, this is how I know it's potent! It's not wrapped in sugar with other junk to make it fun to take. It's potent and quality. The occasional tasty burp is definitely not a deal breaker and for all I know, i'm the only one with this issue haha.",

The flavor itself tastes like what dog biscuits smell like and has a fowl odor, too. I wanted to try a new multi and a YouTuber i watch recommended this brand (he was not sponsored). I gave it a try and it goes without saying that I\u2019ll be sticking with my daily gummy vitamin.",
