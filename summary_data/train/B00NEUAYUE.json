This welding helmet will shut off mid weld if there is any increase in brightness of the arc. It will auto darken when you strike an arc, but any variation in the brightness of the arc will cause the auto-darkening to shut off and you'll get a nice corneal burn. I had thought it was batteries, but I changed them a couple times to brand new batteries. DO NOT USE THIS. Do not jeopardize your eyes to save 150 bucks.",

Depending on the environment (indoor/outdoor) you have to play with the settings (sensitivity and delay) a little until you get them set properly. I used shade 11 for MIG welding. Once set, the auto darkening works great. Very fast. Did not get flashed once. Helmet is very light. The headband is average compared to higher end welding helmets. It is comfortable though and seems like it will hold up. The helmet also came with extra plastic lense covers for future replacement so that is nice. Overall I give it 5 stars.
