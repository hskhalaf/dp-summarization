We are so disappointed as it seemed to be a fun product. But that it can cause serious injury is awful.",

      "text": "I'd hoped in 2018 the piano sound would be more realistic, as it sounds only like a small upgrade to the Casio keyboard piano I had in the late 80's. It's obviously not marketed or described as an instrument-quality keyboard, but even for a toy I find the key action to be very cheap and spongy -- my 1980's era Casio had higher-quality action. For the price, it's okay. I got it for my little one so she could learn hand/eye coordination, motor skills and rudimentary ear training. I expect it will take a good amount of drool and abuse, so as long as it lasts through that I'd consider it a decent purchase.",

The sound is okay, and I am able to adjust to the mini keys fairly easily. IMHO it would make a good starter keyboard for any child with some interest in the piano because of it's affordability. I suspect this little device will fit the bill for my intended purpose.",

But that keyboard costs almost thrice as much and is a lot heavier. So I give this three stars for its portability and due to the fact that I can take this with me wherever I go (just like a Junior size acoustic guitar.) This keyboard weighs like virtually nothing and it also has decent sound and volume. Don\u2019t recommend this for a beginner to learn on though.",
