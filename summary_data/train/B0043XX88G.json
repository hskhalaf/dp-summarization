It probably won't take off your lawnmower blade, but it'll take every other nut and bolt on the lawnmower right off and drive a box of 3\" wood screws after you're done with the lawn mower.

Pro: Light, feel good in my hand Strong, plenty of power for normal light construction. Don't think I'll need 18V anymore. Good LED lights Cons: The clip tends to come loose after a few use but it's not a big deal. Overall: Best 12V impact driver!",

Only complaint is that DeWalt made the battery incompatible with other Dewalt systems. Dad just fixed the old picnicking tables in advance of Wednesdays party. (3 & 3.5\" screws no problem.)",
