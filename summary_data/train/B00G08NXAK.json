As long as I don't wear wool socks, they fit fine. They do take a while to stretch naturally, which I think I am still breaking into. I am petite, so they are quite tall on me, which I don't love, but I still get a lot of compliments.",

I\u2019m used to sizing up in boots due to wide feet, so instead of my usual 8 1/2, I purchased a 10. The shoe itself was both entirely too big, yet still too narrow. I was pretty bummed; they\u2019re gorgeous boots, and I\u2019ve been lusting over them for a while now. Clearly they\u2019re not meant for me. I\u2019ll have to live! The calf was very roomy - if you run narrow but with a wide calf, these are for you. I hope you enjoy them. I wish so badly they had worked for me.",

After speaking to them I called Amazon and a new pair is coming and, once I receive it, I can return the defective ones. I was so dissapointed in the quality of these shoes and Sam Edelman's customer service. I do not recommend spending your money on this brand.",

I can wear normal width in other boots but I didn't like the snug feeling with jeans or if I wanted to wear boot liners for more style.

If the circumference is less than 14 inches DO NOT get this boot in wide (get the regular). You also must adjust the zipper flap when you first place your foot in them to keep it flush (and not rub your heel) when you zip.",
