The zipper is a little finicky. It takes me a bit of time to zip up. The color looks grey in the photo but is more of a olive green color. I dont hate it, I just have too many green jackets already. I like the waste tie. It gives the jacket just the right feminine touch. I bought this jacket for a trip coming up. I'm able to roll this jacket into it's hood for easy storage in my suit case.",

I am 5\u20198\u201d and 150 pounds and I bought a size large so that I could layer underneath without feeling constricted. I could have gone for a medium, but I\u2019m happy with the large because I can wear it over sweaters in colder temperatures or I can tie it tighter when not using heavier layers. I love the color because it helped me stand out in crowded tourist areas so my husband could see me easily. The price can\u2019t be beat! Love, love, love!",

The length helps keep the water off of your legs (which was HUGE since we did a lot of walking), and it's light enough that you can wear layers underneath and not feel stuffy. I would say that it's not made for standing in constant rain for 4-5 hours though. It will eventually leak through and your clothes will get wet. If you just need it to keep you dry going from place to place then it's perfect. It folds up very easily and dries quick so it's perfect for packing.",

What I don't like though is that when you wear the jacket with the upper portion unzipped, the inside of the jacket is white and looks rather cheap because of this.

But otherwise, it's super light weight, a great length, and a great fit. The hood is a little smaller than I would have liked too, but does adjust and has a visor-like design.

Other than the great style, which can go from running the kids around town to a night out, the weight is perfect for me, light so I can layer. The Columbia designers did a good job on this one, the zipper is not exposed when the coat is belted, so it has class without the sporty bling that calls for another coat for evening. It fits me perfectly at 5 ft 7 in and 110 lbs., plenty loose but not sloppy. A real find in my opinion.",

Too hard to work - took too much time/trouble to get it started, to use the bottom-up zipper, etc. That, and the belt was just designed poorly - after tying it the ends stuck right out straight and had to be wound around and tucked.

It does not breath well though (which is to be expected because it's waterproof), so I sweat kind of easily if I am anywhere that is somewhat warm when wearing it. I really like the color and I like the belt as well. I have not actually warn it in the rain yet, so I cannot speak to how well it keeps you dry. If it's terrible, I will update my review.",

I figured this size should work perfectly for me. The 1X barely goes all the way around my middle. I will keep it as I'm still dropping pounds. I recommend ordering at least 1 size larger than you normally wear.",

The two way zipper is my favorite feature and the belt gave it that \"finished\" look. I do wish the belt were removable though. Also, be aware that it is fitted, so if you are planning to wear it with a thick sweater or a sweatshirt it will be tight in the waist.",

However, when a thin wind-breaker or rain jacket won\u2019t do the job either, Columbia offers a perfect women\u2019s parka that keeps you warm, dry, and comfortable. This rain jacket is that perfect in-between coat to wear when it\u2019s rainy, but not too cold. This comfortable women\u2019s parka has been designed with a back-venting system that helps to improve breathability. It also features a water-resistant outer shell for added protection against the elements. Whether it\u2019s raining, sprinkling, or even snowing, this jacket will keep you warm and dry \u2013 regardless of the weather.\n\nColumbia has infused a lot of advanced technology materials in the construction of this ladies\u2019 all-weather parka. The outer shell is made from 100% nylon, the lining core is 100% polyester, and the sleeves are 100% nylon 210T taffeta. Professionally sewn, this advanced technology works together to keep you comfortable and dry. Columbia has also added a few extra features that improve comfort, such as zippered hand pockets, an adjustable belt, cuff tabs, and a weather-resistant hood. The superior materials that make up this women\u2019s winter parka are both water and stain repellent. The jacket is machine washable for easy cleaning when you need it.\n\nThis winter jacket is made with a modern classic fit, which is a universal easy fit for a comfortable range of motion. The built-in adjustable belt tightens securely for a precise fit. To ensure the perfect fit, follow these steps for measuring and refer to the size chart. To determine the neck size, measure at the base or thickest part of your neck. For the sleeves, start at the center back of your neck and measure across the shoulder and down to the wrist. Round up to the next even number. For the chest, measure at the fullest part of the chest, under the armpits and over the shoulder blades, keeping the tape measure firm and level.",
