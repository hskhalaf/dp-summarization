I found that when the unit is not pointing directly at me it sounded somewhat muffled. I am an older buyer, which may account for some sound degradation. I like using this unit because both hands are always on the steering wheel and with the new laws requiring no handheld devices, this is a perfect solution. I see people struggling to use their phones and drive and wonder why they are not using a unit like the SuperTooth.",

The voice command software on my LG Optimus G PRO does not work very well with this device and that is a disappointment,.

Having fun learning though. If you don't have it already installed in your car, I do recommend this one. Love it!",

      "text": "Bought this unit because of the good reviews. Connected it to my HTC Sensation and everyone complained about the muffled sound and road noise. I thought it was because of the old phone so just put this car kit aside. I finally got an iPhone 5 recently which voice quality is great by itself, and yet when I connect it to this bluetooth car kit, people still complain about the muffled sound, road noise, and sometimes disconnection. Unfortunately the return deadline already passed and there is no recourse, so this unit is a piece of junk to me now. Therefore, one star.",
