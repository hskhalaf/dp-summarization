It can be snug, but I was wearing it for fashion vs. comfort. I\u2019m going to return the large,",

One thing I didn't expect - those white 'fur balls' (not made of fur, lol, just look like it) are everywhere, even on the back and under the arms of the sweater. Crazy! I wore it a few times, and several balls have fallen off through natural wear, but I actually don't mind, because there are so many balls to begin with. In fact, the balls on the sides and under the arms made it just a wee bit awkward to move around. So, I don't mind at all the balls falling off. Highly recommend.",
