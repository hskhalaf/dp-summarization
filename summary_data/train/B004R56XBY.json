I had to rub hydrocortisone cream onto his skin and it seemed like it helped but he laid there panting and trying to scratch and then one hind leg started twitching like it was trying to scratch something. I finally gave him 5mg of diazepam and he's starting to calm down. This is the ONLY thing that is different from what he's been accustomed to.",

I was going though bottles so fast I explored other options like Omega supplements, Coconut oil and food changes. I am back to purchase more. This is so nice because once it's rubbed in it is not greasy. After about 2 days, the decrease in scratching is noticeable. Again, it smells so good that I don't mind it on my hands when I rub it on. I just wish I could buy bigger bottles.",

I simply put a dollop in my hands, dab it on her, and then massage it in. She's in heaven. Thank you for this great product!",

If you want to go longer between baths, I don't recommend using this. Or at least just use it as spot treatment (like dry elbows and feet) rather than all over.",

      "text": "I have two fur babies that use this product after every bath. It makes their fur smell really nice and soft. A little goes a long way so it is worth the price. The smell is a little overwhelming though, even to me, and one of my dogs resists a bit when I apply it on him. If your dog has a sensitive nose or doesn't like strong smells, maybe you should look for something else - otherwise this is great!",
