      "text": "Why did it take 49 years to find the perfect eyeliner!! For starters I suck at putting eyeliner on so I normally would only use it when I went out socially. I\u2019d have to bring Qtips with me to constantly clean under my eyes and wipe away at the smudges at the corners. This eyeliner is amazing! I\u2019m still not the greatest at applying it but this goes on so smooth and precise that it\u2019s almost perfect. It doesn\u2019t smudge or melt like any other eyeliner I have used. I keep waiting to pull the Qtip out but I haven\u2019t had to. I wear it everyday! Sooooo happy!",

A friend recommended this line to me and I am never going back. I wore this for a full work day and it didnt budge. On top of that, I went on an almost THREE MILE RUN, too lazy to take it off before, and it was still perfect afterwards! If you're looking for a lasting liner, look no further.",

I find that application is a little bit awkward, the pen doesn't draw as smoothly as I would like and the felt tip occasionally gets some stray fibers that can muck up the line. However, on the formula alone this is still a good eyeliner for the price.",
