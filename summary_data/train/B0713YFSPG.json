Sound from these units is great, along with the multiple features available through them, such as various inputs and types. Picture not great unless viewed from correct angle. However, when using SD card, would only play avi; mp4 videos came up as a \"codec not compatible\" with this player. The audio would play, but no video. Disappointing, because I then had to convert everything, which is very time consuming, and description states that mp4, one of the most popular formats, plays on this device.",

We strapped them on the seat in front of each child and gave them the remote. We recharged before the trip home. The remote was easy for all to figure out and use except the 3 year old. Shipped promptly, easy to set up, sound and picture quality great. I also purchased headphones so each child could watch their own movie. They made the long driving trip so much more enjoyable for everyone. I recommend them to anyone who needs a portable DVD.",

If you want this player to watch pre made DVDs then I think you'll be alright, but if you want this to watch movies or videos you have downloaded or made then they probably won't be viewable without conversion.",

      "text": "I purchased this product for a long trip with a toddler It works great! Very easy setup and has been a wonderful addition to our vehicle to help keep our little one entertained on long road trips. Only complaint is that the remote is hard to use when the player is in the seatback case but can still be used when pointed at the top of the player. I'm happy with my purchase and actually just ordered another one as a gift to a family member.",
