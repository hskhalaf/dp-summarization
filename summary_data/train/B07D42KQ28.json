Not the easiest to get on, but I've been using a shoe horn and that makes it doable. Within a week, I am now able to pull the shoe on using loop on the heel (with a lot of tugging). Once fitted, I feel like a high performance race car and quickly forget about the great effort putting them on. Only bought them because of the incredible deal one of the colors had; isn't the most attractive (prolly the reason). But that too is easily forgotten when I'm in motion wearing them. Money well spent.",
