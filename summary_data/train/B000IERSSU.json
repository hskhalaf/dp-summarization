The reviews said they were comfortable, but I didn't find their comfort that great. I couldn't wear them all day. However, when I returned to the States, these were awesome. I'm not sure what the difference is, but I think flooring materials may be a factor in their comfort. In Korea, marble is common and.. the surfaces are just different. Carpeting of any sort is rare. Anyway, I gave it three stars for that reason, but I think most people in the States will find these very comfortable.",

Don't know what it is - I just let the cuts heel, then tighten the strap to see if it helps. Any suggestions?",

I have trouble wearing them all day because they tend to get a little hot and the straps bother me after a few hours. I usually wear Birkenstocks, but wanted something that could look a little dressier while still comfortable enough for my foot pain. Pros: Sturdy and well constructed, available in widths Cons: Straps irritate my feet sometimes, not very fashionable",

It is just wonderful; it has good arch support so I can wear them all day long and have no foot fatigue. And they wear forever. I have been wearing my favorite ones, dark blue, for three years and no wear is evident. I took them to my podiatrist thinking he might want to suggest them to people having foot troubles. He was very impressed with them. I have three pairs, in different colors.",

Since this was not an SAS sandal I was a little disappointed and the fit could be a little bit better - also the construction of the shoe. But I cannot complain about the price and plan to wear the shoe, maybe with socks to start so I will not get any blisters. If they break in and are comfortable I will be sure to buy more of the same brand.",

The only complaint I have is I wish the connecting strap were also velcro. I started buying this shoe because my old favorite shoe called \"Valley Lane\" stopped being manufactured.",
