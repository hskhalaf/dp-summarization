      "text": "Update: Canon will now repair the faulty board free of charge. I just got mine back from Canon service and it's working like it used to. I have since given the 70D deserved 5 stars. I've had this camera just 4 years and absolutely loved it. I would've given it 5 stars a month ago, but since then, I got the dreaded error 80. $500 to fix a defect Canon is well aware of. Why has this not been recalled? Do a little research on error 80 or focus issues on the 70d and you will find both are common. So disappointed and just...heartbroken. I have a small fortune invested in Canon glass and no camera!",

The wifi is a little quirky but does allow you to transfer pictures to an iPad, iPhone or other pretty easily if you don't have an SD slot. Make sure you get a FAST SDXC card (90MB/sec) otherwise you will have caching problems when taking video. Get a large (>32GB) card as well. And get a second battery or battery grip or you'll be out of battery in no time. And of course, there's nothing like pairing this with great lenses from canon. If you go cheap in those you diminish this camera's capabilities.",

If you are ready to take your photography to the next level I would Highly recommend this camera. It is leaps and bounds better than the Rebel line (which are really nice cameras, but limited).",

I had used a Panasonic HC-770 camcorder for about 3 years before taking the DLSR route and I'm kicking myself for not having done it earlier. If you are a video content creator, then this is probably on the better values of money in terms of the ROI. There are a few other decent cameras from Sony, Nikon and Panasonic that are available for a cheaper price, but I'd take the 70D over those any day.",

We did not get a chance to compare this side by side with the more expensive professional models before buying it, so really can't speak to how it stacks up. But compared to our old DSLR, it is an order of magnitude nicer in picture quality and functionality. Shooting our son's wedding with rapid fire allowed us to capture just the right moment time and time again.",

      "text": "Replaced my Canon T1i and this is superior in nearly every way. Particularly useful is low light performance and fast focusing speed, not to mention speed for rapid photo sequences. The touchscreen grows on you. Expensive, but worth it if you are upgrading from earlier canon bodies and already have APS-c lenses so don't want to go to full frame.",

The EOS 70D camera\u2019s AF modes can be customized to suit the situation, helping ensure reliable focus.\n\nSOPHISTICATED COMPOSITION, SIMPLY.\nINTELLIGENT VIEWFINDER WITH SUPERIMPOSED LCD DISPLAY PROVIDES APPROXIMATELY 98% FIELD OF VIEW\nThe EOS 70D camera\u2019s Intelligent Viewfinder offers a sharp, bright, approximately 98% field of view with an approximate magnification of 0.95x, a viewing angle of 27.9\u00b0 and a 22mm eyepoint. Featuring a new coating that reduces reflections and new construction that improves response in cold environments, the EOS 70D\u2019s Intelligent Viewfinder makes it simple to adjust and confirm settings without the risk of missing a beat. The Intelligent Viewfinder uses a transparent LCD to superimpose a customizable combination of focus points and gridlines directly over the image: it displays AF mode, AF points, electronic level, grid, alerts informing when white balance is being corrected and when Spot metering is enabled, and much more. With the EOS 70D\u2019s Intelligent Viewfinder, unlike with other cameras, the photographer has the choice of seeing shooting information or looking only at the scene in front of the camera. The ability to effectively erase all shooting data and turn it back on with the touch of a button gives the photographer the opportunity to concentrate simply on looking and composing the photograph without distraction, a great advantage in numerous shooting situations.\n\nAMAZING EFFECTS FOR DRAMATIC AND GORGEOUS RESULTS.\nHIGH DYNAMIC RANGE (HDR)\nWith its High Dynamic Range (HDR) mode, the EOS 70D can merge three images of varying exposure in-camera and save them as one final image, capturing a broad range of shadow and highlight detail with stunning tonal range. Adjustable to cover a range of \u00c2\u00b13 stops, HDR recording truly expands the parameters of the light and dark detail a camera can actually record, surprising viewers with the range of tones a photograph can accurately recreate.\n\nMULTIPLE EXPOSURE CONTROL\nThe EOS 70D offers a Multiple Exposure mode for film-like image creation with the convenience of in-camera processing. It offers two different compositing methods for proper exposure and composition: additive or average. Multiple exposure shots from 2 to 9 are stored as one final image and can be taken in both RAW and JPEG shooting modes. A RAW image previously captured by the EOS 70D (3:2 aspect ratio only) can be used as a starting point, and cumulative results can be observed and corrected in real time on the camera's LCD screen.\n\nHANDHELD NIGHT SCENE MODE\nHandheld Night Scene mode captures nightscapes with bright highlights and detailed dark areas, delivering results previously difficult without the use of a tripod. By shooting and combining four consecutive shots at a shutter speed fast enough to avoid camera shake, the EOS 70D\u2019s Handheld Night Scene mode makes dramatic nighttime photography simple.\n\nHDR BACKLIGHT CONTROL MODE\nThe EOS 70D camera\u2019s HDR Backlight Control mode ensures that backlit subjects are not recorded too darkly. By automatically shooting three consecutive shots at different exposures (underexposed, correctly exposed and overexposed) and combining the images, the final result maintains detail in both the shadow and highlight areas, ensuring the backlit subject is properly exposed.\n\nSEVEN CREATIVE FILTERS THAT CAN BE DISPLAYED IN REAL TIME\nTo add to the fun and creative possibilities available with the EOS 70D, the camera has seven different Creative Filters that can dramatically alter the mood and visual effect of any particular scene. Creative Filters include Grainy Black and White, Soft Focus, Fisheye Effect, Toy Camera Effect, Miniature Effect, Art Bold Effect and Water Painting Effect. Each effect can be applied in three different levels (low, standard and strong), and easily previewed on the LCD panel in Live View. Since the filters can be applied to the image after shooting, it's easy to try several effects on the same shot during post-process.\n\nCOMPLEX FUNCTIONS MADE SIMPLE.\nSCENE INTELLIGENT AUTO MODE\nThe EOS 70D features Scene Intelligent Auto mode, which incorporates a number of Canon technologies to deliver the best possible exposure. Joining Picture Style Auto, Automatic Lighting Optimizer, Automatic White Balance, Autofocus, and Automatic Exposure, Scene Intelligent Auto mode analyzes the image, accounting for faces, colors, brightness, moving objects, contrast, even whether the camera is handheld or on a tripod, and then chooses the exposure and enhancements that bring out the best in any scene or situation.\n\nMORE FEATURES FOR INCREASED VERSATILITY.\nCOMPATIBLE WITH THE FULL LINE OF CANON EF AND EF-S LENSES\nThe EOS 70D is compatible with all Canon lenses in the EF lineup, including compact and lightweight EF-S lenses, ranging from ultra-wide angle to super telephoto lenses and including the STM series optimized for video shooting. Canon lenses employ advanced optical expertise and micron-precision engineering to deliver outstanding performance and deliver beautiful results. Special technologies like Canon\u2019s Optical Image Stabilizer help to minimize the effect of camera shake, effectively adding up to four stops of light; STM lenses even feature a stepping motor for smooth and quiet continuous autofocus while capturing video. With an array of lenses perfect for travel, sports, still life and everything in between, photographers can truly maximize the quality and performance of their EOS 70D camera.\n\nMULTI SHOT NOISE REDUCTION\nTo enhance its already admirable high ISO shooting capabilities, the EOS 70D camera features an intelligent Multi Shot Noise Reduction tool that reduces noise even further than the camera\u2019s sensor and the DIGIC 5+ Image Processor do. With Multi Shot Noise Reduction activated, the camera takes four consecutive shots, merges and aligns them. This eliminates more noise than the camera\u2019s traditional Noise Reduction filter, with little or no apparent resolution loss. Moving subjects are even optimized to minimize subject blur! Thanks to this clever feature, high ISO shooting has never looked better.\n\nLENS ABERRATION CORRECTION\nThe EOS 70D features lens correction tools that compensate for lens characteristics that can affect overall image quality. The EOS 70D camera\u2019s Peripheral Illumination Correction feature corrects light falloff in the corner of the image according to the characteristics of the lens being used. It even has correction data for a number of popular lenses stored in its memory. With the chromatic aberration correction tool, distracting color fringing can be corrected at the time of shooting.\n\nFEATURE GUIDE\nTo help explain the specific function of features found on the EOS 70D, the Feature Guide displays a simple description helpful in determining the applicability for the situation at hand. It is displayed in each shooting mode, during mode dial operations, and for Quick Control screen functions. It appears automatically when a function is selected \u2013 a lifesaver when trying to determine the best mode or function for the next picture. The feature guide works automatically by default, and can be disabled easily through the camera\u2019s menu.\n\nGPS COMPATIBLE\nWith the optional GPS Receiver GP-E2 attached to the hot shoe or the digital terminal, the EOS 70D can record location, including latitude, longitude and altitude, and has the ability to track the trajectory of movement with its logging function, perfect for photographers on the go. An electric compass records the camera\u2019s orientation during each shot, and world time information is recorded through GPS syncing.\n\nIMAGE RATING\nTo help organize images recorded to the camera\u2019s storage, the EOS 70D makes it simple to rate individual images from one star to five. Therefore, image browsing, printing and slide shows can be based upon those ratings.\n\nCOMPATIBILITY WITH SD/SDHC/SDXC MEMORY CARDS, INCLUDING ULTRA HIGH SPEED (UHS-I) CARDS\nThe EOS 70D uses popular SD, SDHC, SDXC, and is even compatible with Ultra High Speed (UHS-I), memory cards. Compact and available in large capacities, SD, SDHC and SDXC memory cards are a perfect complement to the camera\u2019s compact design.",
