The drawers are GREAT for keeping cooking and eating utensils organized, along with anything else small that you don't want to lose. The drawers latch shut, and this is small enough to fit just about anywhere you need. It was perfect for my needs. This would also be great for keeping supplies organized and portable in the home - crafting and sewing stuff, or handyman tools. I'd probably go for something bigger for garage use, though. This is compact and probably isn't all that useful if you have a lot of hand tools.",

The wheels are very nice and study but at the same time are rubber and can be wheeled inside on floors or carpet with no problem. It saves so much time bringing all of your tools in one trip compared to 4 or 5 trips and time is money. I highly recommend this product for the pros. Thank you.",

The deep box and flat top box work best for holding power tools and the organizer model works best for small parts. I would suggest favoring the organizer over either drawer model. The drawer models can be problematic if something pokes up high and prevents the drawers from opening. Note that the sidewalls on the cups can cause the organizer (TSTAK V) top to be a bit difficult to close but you get the knack for it if it does happen. The TSTAK cart is also something to consider. While limited to nice flat terrain, the cart is really nice for pushing stacks about the workshop.",

Wheels are not too hard, so it rolls smoothly. I don't understand why it needs to be that much bigger than the boxes, it adds like 2-1/2\" all around. would be nice if it would have fit flush. multiple boxes, multiple carts, stack them next to each other.",
