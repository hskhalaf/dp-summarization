    "title": "Fox Farm Big Bloom Liquid Concentrate Fertilizer, 1-Pint",
    "description": "Size:1 pint| Color:whiteBig Bloom is a Natural and Organic Blossom Builder. Our special, micro-brewed formula incorporates earthworm castings, bat guano and other high test organic ingredients that offer a full range of nutrients. Norwegian kelp improves nutrient uptake and increases yields. Rock phosphate helps transfer energy from one part of the plant to another, which means bigger buds and more fragrant flowers. Big Bloom is ideal for all flowering and fruiting plants and it's safe enough to use every time you water. You'll enjoy healthy, vigorous flowers and dramatically improved fruit and vegetable flavors. Best of all, Big Bloom will intensify flower fragrance and it will increase essential oil production, which means stronger flavors in herbs, fruits and vegetables. Use Big Bloom to extend your fruit and flowering season late into the year. And when a plant is struggling, a root drench of Big Bloom will help to perk things up.",
