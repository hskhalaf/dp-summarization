I decided to give the MIRA food jar a try after reading good reviews. The day I got it, I put it to work. I put very hot water in the container for about 15 minutes. Then I put in hot oatmeal (only because I didn't care about throwing it out). After 5 hours the oatmeal was still over 100 degrees! This is far better than the thermos containers I have. I ordered another one. I will update once we use it more and see if it holds up.",

So 3 hours and 40 minutes later, the raviolis in the thermos read almost 150\u00b0. Definitely a great thermos!",

Incidentally, it is the perfect size to fit a whole package of ramen. I would say the size might be too small for a teenage boy or a man, but for my daughter and me, it is just right. Warning: When cleaning, be sure to put the sealing ring back on the correct way. If you put it on \"upside-down,\" it forms such a tight seal that you have to pry it open. And yes, be sure you remove the sealing ring to clean the lid.",

Not scalding but hot enough that I didn't need to microwave it. The trick is to prime the container with boiling water while you are warming the dish to go in it... and make the dish slightly hotter than you normally would to eat it. Easy to clean, no leaks or spills, true to color, has not faded in 4 months of regular use. <3 Definitely recommend and will be buying more as gifts for the coming holidays.",

      "text": "This is an amazing little thermos! Perfect size. Kept my Daughters bone broth hot from 8AM until lunchtime with no problem (I did put boiling water in the thermos for a couple minutes to warm it before using it for broth storage). In fact, she said it was too hot at lunchtime, and at 5PM, it was STILL warm...wow! Plus, I put it in her lunchbox next to cold packs that were keeping other items cold. No issues whatsoever. And, my Daughter could open and close it by herself (she's 7) without difficulty. She loves it!\ud83d\ude0a So do I! We haven't used it thus far to store anything cold. I would highly recommend this little jar/thermos!",

However, open the lid slowly. The pressure may blow the lid off.",

Recently my kid broke the lids, I had to buy a new one. Since Mila\"s jar look very nice, reviews looked good too, so I gave it a try. However, after first use, my kid complained that the food were not warm at all. At first, I didn't believe it, so the next time I heated the food even hotter before I put in the jar. It didn't work, the food still cool down very soon. I had to return it.",

She is so excited to have more variety in her lunches. As far as the cleaning goes, it's not too bad. We just hske our tiny stainless straw cleaners and run it around the inside of the lid. Cleans easy and seems durable.",

You have to use a small tiny brush to get into the crevices. The mouth of the jar is a little small too. While the exterior looks great, you see greasy fingerprints on it easily.",
