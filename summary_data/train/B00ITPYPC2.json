Had one minor issue as I could not get the secure https port to detect in Blue Iris...however...did not spend much time troubleshooting as all my other cameras in Blue Iris use http ports.",

I hope that will be fixed in a future firmware upgrade, but the company was not able to provide me any details. If not for that I would give them 5 stars, as the quality is good and I really like the zoom, and the field of view is much better than my older 10W and 18W Foscams.",
