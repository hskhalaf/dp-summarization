I wore it on a mid- to upper eighty degree day, with relatively high humidity, the day started out cloudy and ended sunny. My activity level range from mild to moderate. I immediately wished I had gone with a different shirt. It is thicker than many of my sleeve t-shirt and heavier. I'm pretty heat tolerant to begin with, most people complain about the heat long before I'm uncomfortable. So, I think that says something. The shirt is generously cut, no need worrying about sizing up. My search for long sleeve summer t-shirts will continue.",

If you're looking for something tight, order a size down. It's flowy and comfortable without looking sloppy. And it's surprisingly cool to the touch! The only (very minor) thing that I don't like about it is that it takes a bit longer to dry (if you're hang-drying it) than most of my other tech-y shirts, which is only really an issue if you're hand-washing laundry while traveling. All around, it's a great shirt!",
