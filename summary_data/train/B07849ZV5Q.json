I was swinging it around the house quite a bit as I focused on my straight swing... but then thought to myself that I could probably have the same results just by swinging a regular iron with a donut weight. SO I returned it the same evening... The next afternoon I went to the golf range to hit a bucket of balls. I actually believed I was actually swinging much better at the range. My clubs felt lighter, my swing was smoother, AND my slice was 100% GONE! SOOO... I am repurchasing this item.",

Heavier than a regular club which is great but you may want to get some vet wrap or bat grip wrap to bulk up the grip. You can\u2019t regrip with normal club grips as it is a 1/4-1/3\u201d fiberglass or plastic rod where the grip sits and is firmly attached. You can really get the tempo feel with this and I find a few minutes is quite a workout. Definitely feel the muscles in my back working. Encourages proper balance due to the weight.",

With the grip off, I wrapped a piece of grip tape around the fiberglass rod. I\u2019m not sure if the tape was necessary or not. I then put gorilla glue on the fiberglass rod and slid a piece of 3/8 in PEX piping over the rod. Let it dry for a day or so, good to go. Threw 5-6 pieces of grip tape on it, progressively thicker towards the end. New grip on it like a regular club and it\u2019s been good to go!",

The 40\" size would be perfect, but the seller's page gave clear instructions that the 48\" was for individuals 5'6\" or taller... it's very clear whoever wrote that description has little to no understanding of a proper golf swing. I also think the shaft needs a stiffer \"flex.\"",
