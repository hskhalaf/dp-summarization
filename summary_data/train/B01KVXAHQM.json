      "text": "I was surprised at the poor quality speakers my 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee had. As you can tell the magnet for the stock speaker. The front and rear door speaker magnets are very small compared to the Jbl. Instead of buying the 6 by 9 component speakers for the front doors I tried the 6 by 9 coaxial and they\u2019re great. My only complaint is that the fitment was not perfect. Jbl should make the speaker holes longer. Other than that they are awesome.The new jbl speakers produce way more bass, and add more clarity without an amp. It comes with all the necessary hardware to install. It was an easy installation.",

I only ran then for a few days on the factory radio before upgrading, but they sounded crisp and clear on both the factory and my new aftermarket radio. They don't have much bass, but they aren't supposed to, these are meant to be used in conjunction with a subwoofer, as such the highs and mids from them are pretty good, specially considering the price. Plus I mean, they're JBLs! JBL has always been known for quality products!",

My last speakers only played down to 125hz and subwoofer cuts off at 50hz So there was a good gap there, mostly mid bass. These cheap speakers fixed my issue with the gap in frequencies and now I have that sound I was looking for. Im giving them around 150watts of power to each speaker +tweeter. Tight mid bass, has more bass then I thought it would",
