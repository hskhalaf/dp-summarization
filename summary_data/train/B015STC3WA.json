It is heavy though, if you are going to install it on an extender, be prepared to tighten it really-really tight, so it doesn't slip under the weight. Personally, I tried the extender first and then installed a new, longer shower arm to accommodate this head. The reason for the three stars is that it started leaking from the ball joint after only a few showers. So far the leakage is relatively minor, but it is still annoying to have it tilt and splash a bunch of water every couple of minutes.",

I renovated the bathroom in my previous home 2 years ago and spent many hundreds on a basic+ shower head/hand held combo and wished I bought this instead. I bought another 16\u201d for my 2nd bathroom today. Please make sure if you buy the 16\u201d you get an Extention arm that can hold the weight of the shower head. You can also buy a 3 way adapter to install a hand held shower head as well. If it lasts more than a year I\u2019ll update this to 5 stars.",

It's a great looking addition to our walk in shower, and the chrome finish looks clean. One of my favorite purchases I've made recently. The only downside is I do feel like it uses a significant amount more water than our previous head, but the improvement in the pressure and coverage makes this a must buy.",
