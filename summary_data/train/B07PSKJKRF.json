Setting up could not be easier, assuming that you already have a device with iOS 11 as an operating system and you have iCloud storage, it is simply a case of aligning your iPhone camera with the moving Q ? Code that appears on the new iPad and away it goes. All data etc. Is downloaded onto the new device. This takes a relatively short time, depending on the number Apps etc. that you have, and takes much less time than the old manual method.",

So far so good, big difference compared to the Samsung! The only minus would be the sound, the 4 speakers on the Samsung tab S5e are better than the iPad Air\u2019s speakers, other than that, everything is an upgrade. All in all, a great tablet at a decent price!",

Smooth as butter and slides along like a warm breeze on cold skin! I am a digital artist and made the jump to iOS for the creative opportunities on the iPad and I am very impressed. Combined with the Logitech Combo Touch keyboard the iPad Air 3 is (almost) a laptop replacement. Fabulous product, worthy of praise and adoration.",
