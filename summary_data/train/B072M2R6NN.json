My feet were numb within 10 minutes of starting the ride and no amount of strap adjustment could remedy this. The sole is also not very stiff as I had a decent pressure point in the middle of where I contact the pedal. I gave 3 stars because I feel like they might fit different people's feet better than mine giving them the benefit of the doubt and they also look really good.",
