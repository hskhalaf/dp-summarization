You have to really push it into the ground to keep it going or it just dies out. It acts like it is flat though it is fully inflated. Not the best ball to get a kid that just learning how to dribble. I would love to return it but we waited to long. He now has a Nike and a Spalding ball that he prefers using. No more over priced Under Armour balls.",
