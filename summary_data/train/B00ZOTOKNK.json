These polishes last SO LONG! I am super impressed. I can go a full week to ten days without any chipping at ALL... I've only removed my polish because the regrowth at my cuticle gets to be too much and I am ready for a new color. Definitely recommend!!!",

      "text": "I have used this gel nail polish with the light purchase from the same seller. Don't know if it's the light problem or the gel nail polish. The gel nail would start bubbly and chipped from the bottom. Then, I would start to peel them off. And it always become a disaster. Done 3 times with different colors. all the same result. I gave up. If I could ask for a refund would be great!",

The next day I had to pack up the office of a retiring doctor so my nails received a heavy beating and much to my shock and joy, there was not one chip or imperfection after that. It even continued to last over a week with some pretty hefty abuse to my nails. I will definitely be buying from them again.",
