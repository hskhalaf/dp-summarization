This is my favorite peanut butter, by far, and I picked this up rather than a regular size jar at $3 for 16 ounces. Honestly, I'm not saving much cash, but my inner hoarder is pleased, and I won't have to start scouring the grocery store ads every three weeks hoping it'll be on sale when I'm almost out of the little jar. I do use it for sandwiches, but it's mainly snacking on instead of resorting to candy...this way I at least get some solid protein rather than with straight candy. I'll actually be ordering this again sooner than I thought!",

My only complaint is that it's got a bit more sugar in it than I'm allowed to have (not diabetes), and it makes me sleepy, of all things! Most people won't react to it this way but I have a metabolic situation that makes it hard for me to handle sugars. For those who don't have such a problem, there's no issue. They can buy this, enjoy it, and purchase another one when the first one is (quickly) gone. Just read the label if you're sugar sensitive.",
