After building it, I took it apart along with my Elsa's Ice Castle, a few other Frozen sets ( I think I have them all) and used a few regular blocks to combine them all into a big large Ice Castle. It turned out lovely, though the instructions version is beautiful too. :) If you're a fan of Frozen and Legos, I'd recommend it.",
