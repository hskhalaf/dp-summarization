My kids have had the Tsum Tsum calendars in the past, which we love, but they love this one even more. Good value for the contents. I would definitely recommend this to friends with kids or any Super Mario Bro. fan. :)",

My son enjoyed the toys but was disappointed that there weren't other characters. Even asked why so many of the same. For the price you pay I would expect variety.",

The figures are sometimes a little difficult to pull out of their compartments, as the molded tray they are set in is very tightly fit. But once they're out, they're awesome. And the box has pop-up items, too, so they can build an adorable Mario Bros. diorama. Highly recommend!",

The figures are the correct scale to use with the castle, and each figure is well made. Just like the ones use can buy separately in store. My only issue is the price....yikes! Honestly though, other than the price, we have no complaints. We also price compared buying them individually and this was actually cheaper...if you want the Jakks brand that will scale correctly with the other sets.",
