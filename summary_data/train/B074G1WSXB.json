The problem with this is the bottle is completely useless without that button, the lid won\u2019t close and water would spill out. I\u2019m So disappointed, I searched through so many of these to find what I thought would be the perfect fruit infused bottle.",

Since there\u2019s a catcher at the top, the apple or lemon won\u2019t go fall directly into your mouth. I don\u2019t mind cutting it up bigger which saves me more time than cutting it into smaller pieces. The lock on the water bottle holds well and I\u2019ve dropped it a couple of times and no scratches. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!",

I have to constantly mess with it to get the lid to open. The lettering has also partially rubbed off making it look even more worn than it should. I love the sleeve and the size of the water bottle and appreciate that it's taller rather than wide, but I think I'll be looking for a more durable bottle and might just give up on the idea of a pop-top water bottle going forward.",

I refilled the bottle and tightened the cap as tight as it would go, yet water was still visibly dripping out of the sides. I am returning this bottle and finding one from a different company that is not so cheaply made and will actually hold water, like a water bottle is supposed to do. This is such a disappointment as this was a beautiful bottle.",

I get a lot of compliments and questions about it. I don\u2019t have any leakage problems. However, my one complaint is that less than a month of use and the lock that holds the lid shut broke. I was using it daily while I\u2019m at work. I still use it and have resorted to using a rubber band to help keep the lid shut when not using it.",

The bottle holds a good amount of fruit or whatever you like to add to your water. This product is definitely worth the money.",
