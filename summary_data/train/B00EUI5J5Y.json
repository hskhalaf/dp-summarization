The indention is great but the gap between the indention for the head & the rounded pillow part from indention to where it touches the shoulder is rather large even for me (6'1\"). If you sleep on your back & position your shoulders just right, it's a great pillow. If you are a side-sleeper like myself or I suspect if you have a shorter neck, this pillow would be a waste of your money.",

The pillow is a nice balance between firm and soft. The 'neck bump' is neither too high or low for me. The wings are the right height for side sleeping, though I'm not currently doing a lot of that. My neck range of motion is dramatically improved after just a short time. If you're having neck issues, this might help you.",

The pillow is very firm and not very forgiving in any position other than laying on your back. That can be frustrating if you're like me and struggle to find a comfortable position to sleep in.

True, it doesn't have the responsiveness of foam, the warmth and sinking softness of down or the amazing warranty of other brands, but you could replace this one several times over - if needed - for its low price.

I just dont know why they have to make it so firm and why there is no way to remove some of the filling without removing the stitching.",
