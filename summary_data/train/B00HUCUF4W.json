I bought this and the equivalent Milwaukee, and plan to see which I like more, but the cheapness of the Bosch kit lost it points already. They've already downgraded from hard cases (can't even find a hard case to buy separately), and now they're working to make the soft case even cheaper.",

I just spent the day hanging drywall which goes behind and above the cabinets and yep I used this \"toy\" drill. I had to try it out screwing down 3/4\" plywood subfloor to joist... yep, did that and actually set the screws flush with the plywood. This drill is truly amazing and if I had to have one drill for 90% of household chores it would be this one.",

I do repairs for a living, so a lightweight in the hand tool is a huge bonus for my arm not falling off at the end of the day. Likes: Battery charge indicator. Ergonomics. A chuck that LOCKS itself, so you can change bits and secure them very easy. BRILLIANT! 2 speed gearbox and a clutch that actually has a light setting. I have yet to need the second battery, but this little drill was definitely worth the price of admission. And... it's still strong enough as a drill. A great tool!",

For this reason, I would not recommend purchasing this tool before (as in a trial purchase) you actually try to remove the battery. I think Bosch failed if it thinks this tool would appeal to older people with less strength in their fingers. Bummer.",
