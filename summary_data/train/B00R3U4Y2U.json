And I did get a moan of pleasure from him when I used these to gently rub around his ears and under his chin. Hopefully he permits longer and longer use of them, but at least he doesn't go zipping away like he does when he sees the brush. So....based on that I give them high marks. Hair cleans off them easily as well.",

      "text": "My cats usually don't stay in one place long enough to be thoroughly brushed; but when I break these out and put them on, my cats come running and it's usually a competition to see who gets brushed the longest. They don't snag or pull, and the hair is easy to remove from the gloves once it's built up. I have small hands and my husband has large hands, so I ordered the medium thinking they could stretch. Well, they fit him perfectly and are only a little large on me. They are perfect!",
