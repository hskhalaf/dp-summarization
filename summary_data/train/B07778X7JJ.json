I received another email a few days later just checking in on the product. This is a company that stands behind their product. My son expressed interest in skimboarding but we didn't want to invest in an expensive board if he didn't like it. This is a great board especially for beginners. I love that it doesn't need to be waxed. My son used it all weekend. Very happy with our purchase and with the customer service from the company.",

I saw the high rating this product had when I bought it, and was unpleasantly surprised to see a disconnect with the quality in person. The board has marks and discolorations along the bottom as well as patchy varnish, which means the board might have \"sticky patches\" where the unvarnished portions come into contact with the sand. I may simply return it and wait for a new one, since this one may be a mistake, but I would still take into consideration that this is a very cheap skimboard, so don't expect a high quality product.",
