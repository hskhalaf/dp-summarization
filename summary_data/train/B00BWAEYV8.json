Not sure about the review claiming they received burned corneas due to the helmet not triggering. Auto darkening helmets block 100% of the UV and IR light, even when off. Edit 11/20/17: Going to add that the brightness on this helmet is variable. Here's a tip: If you see a floating spot after welding, GO DARKER.",

From grinding to welding reflective metals like aluminum or stainless steel... this helmet will protect your eyes and do it well.

Now the helmet is down and I can see where to start before I weld then it darkens immediately. And for grinding I don't have to life the colored glass. It is very light compared to the old days. Lots of adjustments for how it fits and what type of welding you are doing. I have a bad neck so for me this is fantastic!",

The booklet that comes with the mask even has the different variations of welding that can be done and their recommended settings you need for the mask. Overall this is a very well thought out welding mask and it easy to operate even for a beginner.",

      "text": "Probably the best for the price. Lost or had the first one stolen so I bought another. Only complaint I have is when walking under or through welding curtains the dimming knob tends to get rotated, it doesn't have any detent which honestly I wouldn't expect but just something that needs to be monitored so you don't start welding and can't see because it's set to max darkness, luckily I never had it rotate the other way to be light. Kinda wish I had gotten a larger viewing window but I'm a hobbyist taking a class not a real welder",

First use was today and I was amazed that it acts so quickly. Many helmets cost 300.00 bucks or more and I'm sure they are worth it but if you are using a flip type this is well worth the money. I've ordered a magnifying lens to go with it, it takes a 2 inch by 4.25 inch and has the retainer built into the helmet.",
