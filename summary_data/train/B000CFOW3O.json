My only complaint, and it's a fairly minor one, is that moisture that's collected on the lid tends to run into the box if you don't brush it away with your hand before you open the lid.

I already used it as a step stool, the thing is super sturdy. Per other reviews I read, I am going to run a bead of caulk/silicone on the inside edges to make it truly watertight. Best part? Amazon was $20 less than the local home improvement chain and they shipped it free too!",

If you live where you may get a lot of rain though I would keep it elevated as I'm sure any submersion in water would leak in. It is well strong enough to use as a bench as well, which is great since it creates less waste of useful space in my small backyard.",

I might end up replacing with a galvanized bolt and washer.",

If that's how it is supposed to be made, that's fine, but the instructions don't indicate that to be the case. There is very little clearance between the part where the hole in the lid should be, so it's tricky to make. Not worth $80, unfortunately.",
