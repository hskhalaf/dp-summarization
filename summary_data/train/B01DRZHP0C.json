Not sure how everyone else's is holding up but mine is dead. It was nice when it worked. And because it didn't break early enough I can't return this.",

My concern is that the only part on this device-the quick release plate that attaches to the camera, cannot be replaced from the seller. These plates are susceptible to being lost or additional one need for a second camera. It appears each monopod or tripod has their own proprietary design and the plates are not interchangeable.",

For example whenever I would twist from left to right while panning it would loosen the middle mount (just below where it pans). After 2 shoots one of the legs broke off. I hadn\u2019t done much of anything with it in that timeframe so I contacted the company twice hoping to resolve the issue with their warranty, and NEVER got a response.

If this were a little less expensive then it would be a greater value. Overall it's better then a lot of the competition out there which makes it worth it.",
