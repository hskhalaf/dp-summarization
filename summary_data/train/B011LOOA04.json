Because I didn't use it right away after buying it (30 days is all you have to do a return, I complained 5 days past the deadline) I couldn't return it and I'm out the money. I bought the extra mop heads too. I'm so angry. Big rip off!!!!",

I remembered I had a warranty and decided to call in and request for a replacement brush. Excellent customer service! The rep walked me through the process and told me to expect a replacement within 5 weeks. I got a whole upgraded vacuum cleaner 360 Reach Pro Corded Bagless Stick with attachments in a matter of days! The brush is bigger and it works even better on hardwood and carpet floors. Great value for money. Great customer service from manufacturer in case of a problem.",
