I have a chihuahua mix, and if anyone here is familiar with small dog breeds, they get a lot of eye goopies lol. My dog gets crusty undereyes and these wipes break that stuff down easily. I've also used these to clean his paws and ears. Granted, his paws and ears really weren't dirty when I tried it but still lol. They're just super convenient and large enough to use on larger parts of the dog. Highly recommend this product!!",
