I'm a Krav Maga student and we were training weapons defenses techniques that consisted of a lot of forearm to forearm (bone on bone) impact. Use your imagination - when trained realistically and multiple times per week, that results in a bit of bruising. These sleeves helped give me just enough cushion that I could continue to train hard without holding back. I would definitely buy them again, though I would likely order a size bigger next time as the size I chose is a little tight by the elbow.",

I've gotten to the point now where I wear them all the time during training to keep cool, not just when practicing strikes.",

It doesn't hurt her forearm when the ball hits it when she blocks. We'll try it for a game this weekend, but most likely we'll return it and keep the Champro's size large.
