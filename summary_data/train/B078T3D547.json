I have always used Samsung flagships and my wife uses Moto Force 2. Overall, for the price and the features of this phone, it is a Good Buy.",

Usually I don't see them, but when I inspected carefully the screen when it was dark, I found them. I used the phone some time without any screen protector, but I used it very carefully and I highly suspect the scratches were from the very beginning. I don't have much concern about them, but be aware if you ant a perfect product - when you peel the factory screen protector, inspect the screen carefully.",
