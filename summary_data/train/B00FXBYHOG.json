This issue is real and people all over Amazon and other review sites (CNET, Youtube, etc) are complaining about it yet LG is not recalling or supporting anyone outside of warranty or without receipt. Any bluetooth headset should work when your phone is in your pocket (minus 1 more stars for bad support of an inferior product)",

On my unit, the call answer button was the first to malfunction after wearing it while mowing the lawn. I sent the unit back to the factory for warranty repair. Next I wore the unit to the gym and experienced another similar malfunction. I wouldn't recommend this model for other than wearing indoors in the home, car, or office environment.",
