I did not realize until I went to set it up that Tivo doesn't let the \"no service pan required for a Roamio\" continue when you buy it used. I have just lost all respect for the Tivo company. I will pay the $14.99 for the month I need this one and when I have to replace the ne that is getting repaired- it probably will not be a Tivo product",

His experience was totally unlike mine as he never had a problem setting his unit up and had never encountered any of the issues I am having. I hate it when a piece of consumer electronics gets the best of me, which is extremely rare, but this TiVo Romaio 500 GB DVR seems to have accomplished precisely that.",

We use an antenna to get OTA channels and bought a lifetime subscription to TiVo programming. We can record our favorite shows effortlessly, just like before, but no high monthly bill. True I no longer see every Patriots football game, but we get a lot of them OTA. Combined with Netflix & Amazon, we still have more TV programs then we can possibly watch. We even got a TiVo for our in-laws! We are HUGE TiVo fans - thanks for providing a reasonable alternative to expensive providers!",

Basically, there is no \"I'm replacing my old Roamio with a Bolt\" option. You have to subscribe the Bolt with a new contract as if you're a new customer. Any subscription time you have left on your old Roamio is forfeit. Also it will be a couple of days before the new Bolt is fully synchronized and apps are set up so expect some downtime. You'd think Tivo would have their act together by now.",

It's a bit misleading when they show the Amazon logo but when you get the TiVo it only has Amazon Instant Video available. This only allows you to purchase stuff to watch.

      "text": "This is our first Tivo box, and we love it. The Roamio is the BEST way to record/watch over-the-air television (CBS, ABC, NBC, PBS, FOX). We chose to pay for the lifetime registration upfront, so we pay $0/month for television. The picture quality of over-the-air television is actually BETTER than cable or satellite, because there is no compression or rebroadcasting taking place. We just put a $75 antenna in the attic, plugged it into the Tivo Roamio, and VOILA!",
