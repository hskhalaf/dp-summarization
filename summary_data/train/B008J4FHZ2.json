It is very irresponsible to use such cheap material endangering the lives of our little ones. I am very disappointed and I want a REFUND.

I use them when we are on the go.... they are easy to clean I rinse with hot soapy water and then put them in my advent bottle steamer. They are a little taller then my other bottles but fit in the bottle steamer easily. They also work perfect with the Phillips avent nipples the narrow ones not the wide mouth bottle ones (if you use the Phillips bottles I\u2019m sure you understand which ones I mean). The bottles will leak if u don\u2019t tighten them enough I learned that the hard way. But once I screwed the bottom and the top on tight no leaking. Great buy!!",

None of them do. It leaks everywhere constantly, and by the time I'm done mixing and with all that leaks out as my baby is drinking, I'm lucky if she gets 2/3 of her milk. I've never used the normal nipple it comes with (my baby hates them), but hopefully it doesn't normally leak everywhere. 2 stars for the great idea, and hoping there is a sippy option soon...",

My only problem has been when I try to make more than 6 ounces of formula it doesn't mix well. When travelling in daylight, this isn't a problem, but in those middle of the night feedings when I'd rather not turn the light on and fully wake the baby up, it's disappointing to see how much gets left behind.",

With one convenient push from the bottom of the bottle, the formula is released from its little container and just shake and feed your LO. So convenient.

I purchased a few extra to keep in the diaper bag for longer trips but realized one of them was leaking water when I first started using it. I returned it though and was refunded immediately!!",
