It's a good product but I guess I got the faulty one. :((",

The product is super easy to use, much easier than the spin brush dryer I'd been using. Will be great for traveling as I won't have to bring a blow dryer and curling/flat iron.

It didn't pull at all and I was able to style it without a straightener. Im officially obsessed and would recommend this product to anyone. If you are reading this, buy it! It is phenomenal!!!!",

I was so excited to get this one. It worked great the first 5 times. Then the 6th time the engine just made a loud noise and the smell of electrical burning was so strong. I got worried and unplugged it immediately. I tried it the next day and the same strong burning smell came out of it. Super dissapointed since my old Hot Tools brush dryer was SOO good. Hopefully this was just one random faulty dryer. :(",

      "text": "This tool has reduced my hair drying and styling time significantly. I have long, thick, wavy, fine hair. I can get it dried and styled within 15-20 minutes vs 45 in the past. Onlycomplaint so far is I've only had it about a month and a half and the lettering for the settings is already wearing off and the cool shot button isn't cool. Not a deal breaker for me but just something to keep aware.",
