Our rescue dog Nell one day suddenly started limping...she's only about 3yrs old but had a hard life prior to being rescued. Its a strange thing cause she would play and run very well but then go back to limping. However, we noticed from the time we stated her on this product the limping stopped. I have to admit when i was looking for a product to help her i almost chose something else which was double the cost of this but im happy i decided to give this a try. Thumbs up. \ud83d\udc4d",

One dog is 25 lbs, and the other is 11 lbs, and I give them each 1 treat each night... I'll probably up it for the 25-lb guy as he gets older and more arthritic... but SUPER happy with these treats.",

She's an 11 year old Jack Russell and very active so it was really hard to see her hobbling around all of the time. After taking these, she has more spring in her step and is almost back to her young self. My dad now orders them regularly for her. So much easier than trying to give her pills. And as a picky dog (she is kind of a treat snob) she actually really loves the taste of them too! So glad we made this purchase.",

I love these because they are made from USA sourced ingredients and are free of soy, wheat and corn which cause our golden retriever's skin to break out. The only thing that could possibly make me like these more would be if the price were lower but I guess you have to pay for quality.",

I gave 4 stars because we began caring for our son's 7 yr old dachshund and she cannot tolerate these treats which caused her to develop full body tremors. Caution is indicated. I would recommend starting a dog on 1/2 treat for 3 days. If they show no effects, increase to a full treat.",

He responded very quickly, and started moving along really well. After two weeks, the GI problems started. I stopped the supplements and will reintroduce at only 1/2 the daily dose, and see if that helps him. They made a big improvement with his arthritis, but not so much with his tummy.",
