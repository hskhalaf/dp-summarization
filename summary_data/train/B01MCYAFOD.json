If you like really bold coffee and shots of espresso that will wake the dead, this is the machine for you. The only negative is the price for each pod and availability, you cannot find them at a grocery store and they run you about $1 a cup of coffee vs a Keurig cupbis about 50 cents",

She was very helpful and went above normal service to get us satisfied.",

      "text": "I bought this about 6 months ago to use at work. I have been very happy with it. It makes consistent tasty coffee. I have tried the espresso and 8 oz sized pods for it and in each case it makes a very frothy coffee. I personally prefer the 8oz version. Making coffee is easy. Refilling and cleaning it is also very easy. Very happy with the purchase. I am buying another for home. I used to drink 4 cups of Keurig coffee each day. From this machine I am down to 2 cups a day.",

      "text": "I was thrilled with this coffee while staying at a lovely Inn and immediately came home and ordered one for myself. I never knew there was a coffee pot that made coffee topped with crema! I absolutely love it. Another great feature is that it has the most unique way of disposing of the used pods, just open to insert a new one and the used one slides gently into it's own area for later clean up. I was also welcomed with a wonderful sample of 15 different levels of coffee for me to sample. Totally satisfied and anxious for my next cup of coffee.",

    "title": "Nespresso Vertuo Coffee and Espresso Machine by De'Longhi, Black",
    "description": "Style:Machine only| Color:BlackNespresso is constantly evolving the way you drink espresso and coffee. Offering freshly brewed coffee with crema as well as delicious, authentic Espresso, the Vertuo Evoluo machine conveniently makes two cup sizes, 7.7 fl. oz. Coffee and 1.35 fl. oz. Espresso, at the touch of a button. It uses two different capsule sizes: large capsule for Coffee and a small one for Espresso. Vertuo Evoluo coffee makers deliver a perfect cup of coffee time after time, thanks to Centrifusion, a patented extraction technology developed by Nespresso. Vertuo Evoluo uses an intelligent extraction system that recognizes each Grand Cru blend. Thanks to a barcode on the rim of the capsule, the brewing parameters are adjusted by the machine, with no need to change settings. This delivers the best in-cup result for your chosen variety - at the touch of a single button. The capsule is automatically ejected after brewing, with only 15-20 seconds of pre-heating time, while the automatic energy-saving function switches the machine off after 9 minutes of inactivity, consuming less energy. Each machine includes a welcome set with 12 VertuoLine capsules, each with varying intensities and taste profiles.",
