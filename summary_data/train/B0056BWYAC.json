I'd give this full thumbs up. Haven't marked durability as we just got this!",

Instructions were not that clear but i figured it all out. one item was a small black pouch included but with no instructions of what it was. Figured it out when the boom arm light almost fell over. Black pouch is a counter weight bag and made the less then robust stand work as needed. Had to steam out the wrinkles from the green screen but first test shot with my Sony a6500 was amazing. After effects key light worked first time with hairs and everything matted with no fringe. Pretty cool having something work out the first time trying.",

I do, however, use the third light, which is very easy to \"pop out\" and go. The green screen is made of lightweight muslin, so it's pretty thin. Don't expect any quality there. But once the lights are on it, it seems to be okay.",

I use after effects and gee, it looks pretty good for 180 bucks. I LOVE IT! THANK YOU",

      "Green screen videos can look amazing and can help any video that you produce stand out from the crowd. Videos are everywhere these days and the last thing you want to do is to spend a long time creating a very ordinary video which achieves nothing. Once you create your own green screen studio you have so much more flexibility to create great looking videos and really achieve the results that you are looking for.",
      "Benefits to a soft box is that it produces light which is more even than light coming from an umbrella. A softbox emulates the soft, directional lighting usually produced by natural window light. It softens and diffuses the lighting from the attached light source by transmitting the light through a diffusion panel."
