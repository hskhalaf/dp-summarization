It is super soft though and my kids love it. Wish that both sides were the same material. I bought the black one and the gray one to compare, and ended up keeping the gray one as the contrast of the backside was less severe and look nicer to me than the backside of the black one. Overall very soft and comfy. Please click the helpful button if anything in this review helped you.",

      "text": "I was looking for a thick, soft, and plush blanket and this worked perfectly. The faux fur isn't as soft as real fur but is still extremely soft, and the inner lining feels amazing. I was worried to order it due to some reviews stating that they found stains, but my order was stain-free and clean. The color is just as pictured, a nice fade of grey tones. It has not shed at all nor does it have any loose threads, and this blanket has already been through some rough kneading from my cats. Will probably order another one of these in a different color in the future because it's well fought-over.",
