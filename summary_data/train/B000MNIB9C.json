    "title": "Panasonic FV-08WQ1 WhisperWall 70 CFM Wall Mounted Fan",
    "description": "Designed specifically for through-the-wall mounting to provide ventilation in rooms where a ceiling mounted fan is not possible. This fan features a totally enclosed condenser motor and a large, double suction blower wheel to quietly move air. This fan is designed to give you continuous, trouble-free operation for many years thanks in part to its high-quality components and permanently lubricated motors which wear at a slower pace. This fan has a built-in damper to prevent backdraft, which helps to prevent outside air from coming through the fan. Energy Star qualified products feature super-quiet operation and high CFM-to-Watt efficiency.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nNew features and technologies make the latest generation of Panasonic ventilation fans perfect for many ventilation applications. The Panasonic FV-08WQ1 WhisperWall 70 CFM fan is designed specifically for through-the-wall mounting to provide ventilation in rooms where a ceiling mounted fan is not possible. An exterior hood with a back-draft damper is included to finish off the job. This fan has a totally enclosed condenser motor and a large, double suction blower wheel to quietly move air. The blower wheel is designed to draw air in from both sides allowing more area for the air to enter the wheel. Panasonic fans are quiet enough that you might not even know they're on. This fan is designed to give you continuous, trouble-free operation for many years due to its high-quality components and permanently lubricated motors which wear at a slower pace. We designed the electrical configuration of this model's condenser motor to allow it to operate at lower temperatures, increasing the life of the motor and bearings. And, the fan housing is made of heavy-gauge zinc galvanized steel and painted to protect it from rust. With a .8 sone level and rated 70 cubic feet per minute, this fan is Energy Star qualified. The Panasonic FV-08WQ1 WhisperWall 70 CFM Wall Mounted Fan is covered by a manufacturer warranty for period of three years from the date of the original purchase and is sold one item per package.",
