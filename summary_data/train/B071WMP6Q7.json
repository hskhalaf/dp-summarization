A big issue was that there was not a single piece of instruction for use with respect to how long to keep the product on, how often it can be used, or ingredients. For these reasons I couldn't give more than 3 stars.",

Makes the fine lines and wrinkles around your mouth less visible so you do get that lip plumping look but not to extreme, very natural. Your lips and surrounding skin feels like silk. The longer you can wear, the better the outcome. Very impressed and will order again!!",

I waited a week to do this again. The top photo was taken 8/14, the bottom 8/15 after using the mask overnight. My normal lips are very dry. I'll definitely purchase again.",
