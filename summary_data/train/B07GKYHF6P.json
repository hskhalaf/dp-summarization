I verified I purchased it from amazon and no response. So I am certain amazon will post my one star review here. Do not but this case! Poor design of volume and lock button. You have to press the side of the phone so hard in order lock your phone or turn up the volume. Say good bye to trying to take a screen shot of something as well.",

      "text": "Overall ok product. It\u2019s required for the Rokform bike mount so I had to get it. It feels bulky but acceptable. Harder to put phone in and out. The apple logo is in center so that\u2019s good. The buttons are actually hard to press. Maybe they need to be breaking in. The most annoying part is the magnet. First of all compass will be rendered useless but gps will work. Second when try to click onto the mount the magnet is so strong that I always miss the joint. Maybe in the future I will take the magnet off.",

The case is so sturdy and stiff it\u2019s hard to tell if your pressing the buttons. But the biggest negative for me is that you can\u2019t use the wireless charging function of your phone. The powerful magnet on the back of the case prevents you from it. Decent case for the price if you can live without wireless charging and hoping the case will break in a little and the buttons soften up some.",

If a rugged case is what works for you all means get this case. The only ding I have on the case is the side buttons. They work just fine just not a lot of tactical feedback.",
