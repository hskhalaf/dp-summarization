I wanted this little knife for my husband because of the screwdriver attachment. He loves knives, particularly Spyderco, so this made a great little gift for him. The knife is small and easy to carry. Plus, the price on Amazon, with free shipping even, is great! On the Spyderco website where I usually buy knives for him, this cost $39.95 plus shipping! Great deal on Amazon!",

I have carried other larger sized pocket knifes in the past and looked for something smaller. This was the answer. As with any Spyderco knife, the blade itself is extremely high quality. The only draw back of this knife is the flathead screw driver. I have tried to use it for several things, but can never seem to use it very effectively at all. If you're looking for a small, high quality everyday carry knife, this is a fantastic option.",

      "text": "This is a solid knife at a great price. The slightly brushed stainless steel is very aesthetically pleasing and holds up well against scratches while its in your pocket. Both the knife and the bottle opener/screwdriver utilize a friction lock which means you'll have to use two hands to open it, but that hasn't been a problem so far and the lock does a great job keeping the tools locked in place while you're using them. The screwdriver is a flat head and its pretty narrow a so it will probably be reserved for smaller screws but its sturdy none the less. And of course its incredibly sharp even before sharpening it.",
