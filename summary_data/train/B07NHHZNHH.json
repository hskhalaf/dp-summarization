We are using this with amazon fire 8 inches but it will easily fit a larger size table like the iPad. We are very pleased, the materials are very good quality. I have to just say I didn\u2019t receive anything for free or in a discount to write a review, I am just a very pleased costumer .",

Super strong velcro held everything in place no problem, even the kid kicking the seat.",
