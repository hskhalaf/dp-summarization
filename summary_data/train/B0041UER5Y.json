I blend some in my coffee with a little heavy whipping cream in the mornings and it gives me such great focus and really warms me up on cold mornings. I totally recommend it, it really enhances your energy levels. Also great for doing Keto and feeling full. I wish that it didn't have palm oil simply because of the environmental impact of the palm industry but all in all it's still a great product.",

There are no side effects. Really cheap MCT oil has properties and the taste of coconut oil.. This one didnt. MCT oil may reduce lactate buildup in athletes and help use fat for energy.
