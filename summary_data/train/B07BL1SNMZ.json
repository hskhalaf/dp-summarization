The weight is so much lighter vs the framed 3D glasses layered over your prescription eyewear. These lenses also seem a bit brighter vs the 3D glasses brought home from a movie theatre. If, like me, you have frameless eyeglasses, these lenses also remove that tunnel vision you can get with the thick-framed movie theatre 3D glasses. I consider these a must have.",

I've used these in two recent movies and they are so much better than the oversized ones.

These clip on glasses are very well made, plastic lens as opposed to those other types, they never slip, I don't have to readjust my head, and they fit snug to my glasses, come in a nice little case and are better made, which makes for a fantastic view, and no more eye strain, I can't believe I put up with those old ones for so long.

Not subtracting any star for that as it's as deacribed - just a little strange, and may be inconvenient if you want to give out the 4 pairs to 4 individuals.",

      "\u3010Learn about 3D lenses\u3011We have no use and comparison. It is difficult to know whether the 3D lens effect is the best. In fact, our manufacturers use the monomer transmittance to determine the pros and cons of 3D lens effects. Most manufacturers believe that they only need to provide users with parameters not exceeding 42%,but this parameter can't be clear and bright, AoHeng's lens has the highest parameter of 43.5%, so our lenses are clearer and brighter.",

Even if the weight is increased by 1g, we will feel stronger pressure.Our product weight is only less than half of other 3D clips,which greatly improves our happiness of watching movies.Our clips and glasses are connected in the same way and fit perfectly, so there is no reflection or glare from other clips.Profession is to focus on any detail you care about.",
