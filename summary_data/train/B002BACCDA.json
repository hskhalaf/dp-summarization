The rechargable battery is great - I can get through both dogs' nails before the battery life is exhausted and it needs another charge. Also it's constructed really well so it feels sturdy in your hand. Would highly recommend if you have a fidgety anxious dog that doesn't like having their nails clipped!",

First off the battery doesn't stay charged long so I couldn't get projects done without the delay of recharging the battery. Secondly, since the dremel lives in a box the charger isn't always plugged in and keeping the battery topped off so all projects needing a Dremel always required charging the battery first, usually overnight, then remembering to do the project the next day (yes this is user error). Thirdly, the battery has now died a year or so after purchase, and so now the dremel is useless. Buy the corded, plug in version!",

The problem is that who ever designed this had about half a brain because the lock doesn't prevent the inner portion of the shaft from spinning only the outside. Which makes removing bits that fit into that middle shaft impossible to remove without having to grab an extra set of pliers to clamp the inner shaft and prevent it from spinning along with you when you remove a screw topped bit....",

I've never encountered a power tool that was so difficult to turn off. 3) Since the power switch protrudes outward when in the OFF position, it is easy to bump it so that it turns back on. The act of setting it down on the work bench frequently turns it on. Frustrating tool to use.",

Accordingly, check often when applying even the least coarse grinding stone or what have you, as you'll otherwise find you've taken away more material than you'd wanted. Beyond that, everything else with regard to a Dremel and action figures is self-explanatory I should think, and if not, this isn't really the place to cover it.",
