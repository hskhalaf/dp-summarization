I am just amazed at how a 27 inch monitor makes such a difference from a 24 inch, also the 144hz refresh rate makes things extremely smooth and the curve allows me to see everything easier. The headphone slot at the side of the monitor is also handy to keep the desk clean. Only thing I would be a bit critical of though is that the stand does stick out a bit too much for my liking. Other than that it is an excellent product by MSI.",

Note, I have a gtx1080 and tried this on another machine and at different resolutions. There was definitely a reason why I got it for the price it was sold. It's all a gimmick. Not worth a purchase.

Update: This has only gotten worse as time went on so I attempted to get a refund and send this back as a monitor should not do this and I have never experienced this before. AO will not refund you all of your money only 70% of it so I would stay away from this product and from this company in the event that you are provided with a faulty/unsatisfactory product.",
