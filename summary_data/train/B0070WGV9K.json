The design to have it rotate is the issue. One piece doesn't stay in place or dislodges when I try to fold it down and then I wind up fighting/struggling to get it back in place for the next few minutes. It's a good product, just don't buy it if you really want it for the fold down option.",

If your using on a box spring where a bed side board isn\u2019t in the way then it\u2019ll work much better.",
