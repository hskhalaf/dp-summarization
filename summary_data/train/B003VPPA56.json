It took a couple practice runs to get the hang of it, but once I go t the hang of it, everything went smoothly, somewhat tediously, but smoothly. At 4 scans per page, it took a while, but it was well worth the trouble for the quality of the final output. The stitching logic it uses to create a single image per page is really phenomenal. I didn't see any artifacts. Every page looked like it had been scanned in a single pass. Highly recommended.",

Two, I know this is meant to be portable, which is great, but it would be nice to have the option to plug it into an outlet to save on batteries. I have a ton of photos that are out of albums so I want to just sit at the table and scan but it uses batteries fairly quickly.",

Because the scanner is fragile and is meant to carry to relatives' homes for scanning photos right out of their albums (without needing to tear them loose for conventional feed scanning ) it's important to have the device well protected for packing and traveling, and the deluxe case works perfectly for that (it cost another $15). I expect is is fragile, but I've handled it carefully and have gotten a lot of good use from it. It's easier to manipulate without a cord, so I don't mind replacing the batteries after every 200 scans or so. Highly recommended.",

Second, it works as advertised but will be a little cumbersome for large images. The active scanner portion is about the size of a postcard, which is of course expected because the unit is meant to travel with you. That means you may have to run it 3 times each way for an A4 size image. Finally, the software that stitches the images together isn't, say, Apple-simple but it absolutely does the job. I strongly recommend this product and feel it's worth the money.",

The clear paper in the photo album posed a problem if it was wrinkled; otherwise, it did not appear to affect the quality of the scan. If you need something for professional presentations, there are better options; however, I would probably buy it again for my stated purpose.",

Have yet to get it to work. Even downloaded the update. However, we took the mosaic scans and imported them into Photoshop Elements, they stitched together flawlessly. For a travel scanner, when visiting relatives or gathering genealogical records, I would highly recommend Filp-Pal!",

Take it to the family reunions to scan others photos (no computer or electricity needed). Got a relative that won't let the family album out of their site--scan right there while the photos are still in the album, no need to remove. Got a photo in a frame--no need to remove--scan right there on the wall. This is a GREAT little machine",

    "description": "The Flip-Pal mobile scanner enables you to effortlessly collect precious photos, important documents, fragile records of personal and family history, detailed coins, jewelry, medals, hand-drawn art, and other keepsakes. Now they can be safely stored digitally rather than scattered, lost or unable to be found. Then create your story and connect with family and friends. Take advantage of the patented flip-and-scan technology to scan photos while still in the album or frame, treating fragile personal records gently. The Easy Stitch software quickly and automatically reassembles multiple scans into their larger original. Unlike alternative solutions that don't have the combination of mobility, simplicity, accuracy, versatility, and keeping the original safe, the Flip-Pal mobile scanner is compact, simple to operate, has high resolution, quick scan time, battery power, SD memory, and a computer is not required to scan. When it really matters, like your children's early years of precious memories, preparing for natural disaster, creating a high quality scrapbook, or collecting one-of-a-kind fragile documents for your family history, Flip-Pal produces the accurate image quality you will need in the future. With 600 and 300 dpi resolutions and colors and textures that are true to original, your important documents and images are safeguarded forever in digital format, protected from loss from disasters and misfortune.",
