Her only complaint is that she doesn't want to get out of bed once she is warm. Note that the matt doesn't feel very warm to the touch as the heat dissipates quickly. If it is covered with a heavy blanket while warming it holds in heat better. When you lay on it your body will gradually get warmer.",

They are able to flip the mat to get the more comfortable granule side for better sleeping on overnight or the disk side to better dig into problem areas like tension knots in their back or hips. While this mat won't fully replace visits to chiropractors and massage therapists, it does reduce the necessary frequency of those visits while maintaining a high-speed heavy-stress lifestyle.",
