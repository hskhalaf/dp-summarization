They are just the right level for all 3 kids...some easy, some more challenging which is what I wanted. It enables them to be successful while still learning some new material. Since it is not a \"game\" with a start and finish, we can grab the cards and spend 5 minutes or half an hour depending on the situation (and attention span at the moment!). I will most certainly buy the higher age levels as they grow.",

I purchased this for my niece who was 3.5 during Christmas 2017 but opted to not give it to her. I'll wait until next year to give it to her, as it will be more beneficial at that time.",
