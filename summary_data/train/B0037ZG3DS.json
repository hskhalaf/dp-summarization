Edit: Did that and the reservoir still smells like brand newly minted Chinese plastic manufacturing. Yum. I hope someone at Mr Coffee sees all these reviews about this. I wonder if they cheapened the manufacturing process. Because if they are all like this, and you don't smell or taste the plastic, there is something wrong with your olfactory senses.",

The \u201cfilter\u201d that comes with the unit isn\u2019t a coffee filter, but instead is a water diffuser needed to spread the water over the coffee. It\u2019s clearly intended as a profit-producing consumable part, and ours was coming apart after just a few days. Our carafe developed a rattle on day two that indicated a loose part in the lid. We sent it back. Too many problems.",

It did take several uses before the strong plastic smell started to dissipate, but once it did I loved this coffee pot and it was just what I was looking for. However, the automatic cleaning timer/feature stopped working a few months ago and then last week my coffee started to taste like crap and the carafe wasn't keeping the coffee hot. Not sure what is wrong with it, but I suppose I'll have to send it in to be serviced. At this price point it should have lasted longer. I HATE putting things in the landfill!!",

Brew time is only 5 minutes, and is very hot when first brewed. Paper filters seem to work best, and make the most robust flavored pot of coffee for the amount of grinds used.",

Easy to set up, but not the easiest to 'load'. The tank is too tall to fit under the filtered water dispenser on my fridge, and the coffee basket (which has to be completely removed to load) doesn't sit level when it's on the counter. Small details, but worth noting. Biggest downside is that it brews weak coffee. I attribute it to the basket filter (as opposed to a cone-type). I've started using 20% extra coffee and it still isn't as full-bodied or flavorful as my previous, cone-type brewer.",

      "text": "I really wanted to give this 5 stars but it has a major problem - it leaks from the bottom. I went to the Mr. Coffee website and A LOT of people were complaining of the same thing. It doesn\u2019t leak every single time, maybe 1 in 3, but it\u2019s enough to make it a pain. It does keep the coffee hot for a long time and makes great coffee so I\u2019ll be keeping the coffee pot, just really annoying that I have to clean the counter after almost every pot.",
