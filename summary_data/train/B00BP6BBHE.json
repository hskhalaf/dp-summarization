They hold up well to chasing criminals down. LOL He loves the way the memory foam feels. These sneakers are the most comfortable sneakers he has ever owned. Never any rubbing or blisters and they hold up well. He also wears these on his days off too. They are true to size and fit perfect each time.

      "text": "Previously wore same shoe in size 11 which was fine for the first few weeks but as the shoe stretched the size became a bit loose and I had to keep tying it tighter. This time I went with 10.5; while they are snug out of the box I expect them to stretch and fit perfectly within a week or two of use. The memory foam is nice but enjoy it while it lasts, if you are on your feet all day it will lose its rebound within several months. This shoe does stand up to a fair amount of abuse. I'd recommend using for long days in retail environments, walking on hard concrete for 8 hours a day.",

Outside, walking, they're okay, but a little warm. During a gym workout, they were downright balmy. Wicking, wool-blend socks help keep from getting slippy-sweaty, but once done, I was ready to take them off. I think I'd rather have a cheap insole and replace it with Sorbothane inserts. I've only had these a week, so it's too early to see how these will wear. I'm a heavy guy, so usually, my everyday shoes last no more than 18 months.",

I like to purchase mid-range products for most things because I find they often last just as long as the higher-end products without the extra price, and don't fall a part like cheaply made products. This shoe really fits that description to a T. The stitches seem tight, the rubber is thick and adhered well, the insole is comfortable, and the sole has defined ridges without falling into the boot range. So far I've only had the shoes for a few weeks, but as long as I can get a year out of them I'll keep my rating at 5 stars.",

These shoes did the trick for me. I had some other Sketchers that I never used because there had a rocking-chair type of sole. I was pleased to find the sole on these new shoes to be standard form. I bought 1/2 size larger than normal due to reviews and found these to be instant relief. Highly recommend.",

I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because they got wet over and over or just overworked the shoes, but after 1 month of using these shoes 5 days a week, the bottom of the shoe began to peel off. I\u2019ve had to use shoe goo to glue it back for now but I won\u2019t be repurchasing. A great looking and comfortable work shoe but it just isn\u2019t made to withstand what I need it too",
