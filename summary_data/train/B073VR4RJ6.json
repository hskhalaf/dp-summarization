Sure, if you have 300 quid or more to spend you can get a tablet that's faster and slicker, but I just wanted something that I could use to watch YouTube and Amazon Prime videos and read e-Books, and this fits the bill perfectly. After a month of fairly heavy use I can't find any real faults. It has a nice clear display, though I'm afraid I can't speak for the sound as I always wear headphones when using it. It's quite thin and seems a bit fragile so I would recommend putting a case on it, especially if a child will be using it.",

I never turn it off completely, just into standby mode and still, it only needs a charge a week. (My train journey is an hour each way) but I do keep the brightness down quite low which helps. Also, it has a memory card slot which many of the 'better' tablets do not. Bonus",
