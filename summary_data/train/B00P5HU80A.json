      "text": "Worthless out of the box due to zero support for Linux. Trezor provides no support for Mint, Ubuntu, Debian, or Arch environments. You will be frustrated to learn that there are only two interfaces to this product; one is using a Chrome extension that is being phased out in a few weeks. The replacement software, the Trezor Bridge, is quite difficult to install on Linux - steer clear unless you are an expert-level Python programmer. The average user will not be able to get the wallet to function in Linux.",
