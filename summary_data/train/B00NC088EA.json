I went and did research on it after to see if it was an external issue but other reviews and help sites also mentioned similar issues with this specific model. I would not recommend this chromebook to anyone, even for basic surfing and google docs work. If you have more than 8 tabs open it is slow and you have to wait like it was windows all over again. Original chromebooks by Acer were very good machines now they seem to cut costs on quality even with all the so called upgrades.",

The processor is fast enough to do everything a chromebook can handle, and the computer runs silently due to it being fanless, which is a big plus.

The only factor that might improve the experience is the fact that the charger is the same size and weight as the older Samsung. But most often because of increased battery life, I can leave the charger at home.",

She loves it. Shes up til 11:30 on work nights playing words with friends. The speed is noticeably great, even for someone who's not tech savvy, so it definitely takes away from that impatience of waiting for things to load. Screen quality is good for someone who doesn't really care, and the matte screen is really nice.",

I watch a lot of videos on it & it still gets me at least 9 hours of battery life with heavy video watching. The only thing I can say that I wish was better is the viewing angles of the screen. It has a narrow angle of visibility, but I have adjusted to it now.",
