Even in endurance mode, I have to change battery like every 8-10 days, comparing to around 1 month or even more for my first one. By the time I realized this, the return window already passed. So I leave this review just to remind others that if you found this issue, return it as soon as possible.",

The middle click button on these mice constantly, repeatedly go out. 6 months to 1 year in, the G602 will begin to require very hard presses to register a middle click. Each of my two G602's have been replaced twice under warranty for this issue (6 mice total!), until they have no more warranty, leaving me with a dud of a mouse since I heavily rely on the middle click button.

      "text": "So Ive owned this mouse for about 5 months and I have been having nothing but issues with it, My PC is less than 2 feet away from the mouse and the cursor repeatedly cuts out and jerks around all over the screen for no reason at all. This is on my main gaming PC with a GTX 1070. It is so frustrating to use and clicking anything with precision is impossible due to the tracking issues. Ive debated on returning it but wanted to see if it was a driver or USB issue, But I tested it on my laptop and it has the same lag and jerky cursor. I dont understand what is going on here.",

So I ended-up uninstalling all the software, and using it like a plain 2-button mouse. All its bells and whistles are wasted because of the battery drain and incompatible software.",

Still trying to figure out all the function but after downloading the logitech customizer online it has some customizability, at least enough for me. Not sure what the difference in performance when toggling the performance/longevity button. All in all good purchase just beware shipping.",

For work, I programmed the side keys for copy, paste and enter, which has made productivity smoothe. For games, I have mapped the essential hotkeys, which has helped. My experience has been overwhelmingly positive, yet there are a few issues. This device uses batteries very quickly. It additionally is a bit on the big size and takes some time to get used to. This mouse was purchased in September 2014, and I am currently searching for a replacement. The cursor is freezing, and the lights are lighting up afterward on the mouse.",

You have the option to use just one, it felt better that way. I ended up buying a different mouse, a Logitech - G502 Proteus Core Optical Gaming Mouse which worked better for me.",
