Prior to buying, I read reviews criticizing plastic parts. They are plenty strong and durable, as long as you don't abuse it... which brings me back to my first sentence... I highly recommend this saw. I love everything about it, no criticism, and I have used it a lot.",

The saw portion assembles and disassembles from the pole easily, and the pole also extends and retracts safely and easily.

Even though the saw is not particularly heavy, when it is extended away from you, it can be much harder to lift and control. Be sure you have adequate strength and balance, and that you are working from solid ground. When the saw is removed from the pole, it works very well to cut up small branches.",

Note that I did NOT use the pole in its extended position as it becomes quite heavy and harder to control. Its easy to use otherwise.",

    "description": "Color:GreenSAW WHAT YOU SEE - WITH THE ONE SAW THAT DOES DOUBLE DUTY! Tackle those hard-to-reach branches with ease. The Sun Joe SWJ807E 2-in-1 convertible electric pole chain + saw takes the danger and difficulty out of trimming your overgrown trees. Stand safely on solid ground and simply adjust the telescoping pole to gain up to 15 feet of overhead reach. Later, when the limbs are down and there's wood to be cut, the SWJ807E quickly converts to a hand-held chainsaw to make light work of loads of logs. Powered by a robust 8-amp motor, the SWJ807E can handle the most stubborn tree limbs up to 7-inches thick. It features a durable, 10-inch Sun Joe bar and chain with an auto-oiler to keep the bar and chain fully lubricated during use. Unlike gas-powered tools, SWJ807E is powered electrically, so you'll power up reliably every time with the push of a button, without having to deal with smoke, fumes, spark plugs or costly tune-ups. Plus the SWJ807E comes equipped with a built-in safety switch to prevent accidental starting. The Sun Joe SWJ807E convertible electric pole chain + saw carries a full two-year warranty.",
