Even that small amount it leaks, will soak the sheet AND this mattress protector. When I lift the protector his mattress is wet below. I\u2019m incredibly annoyed as his mattress is brand new. This has happened multiple times, and now we layer several different waterproof pads on top of it. We even had a vomiting episode and this cover helped zero. Don\u2019t waste your money!",

It was absolutely our first time experience for the past 2 years and I went crazy! Then I also found out that the protector had gotten so thinner after 2 year use and had some small holes which are hardly seen with eyes. It is in the washer now but I think I will try a different brand this time. (The store has offered a replacement or a refund under the 10-year warranty)",

I say this to emphasize how completely the protector worked: none of the pee got through to the next layer, 2\" memory foam on top of the mattress.

This cover fit the bill. It is lightweight, soft, and fit the mattress beautifully. It had good, big pockets. We haven't had to test the waterproof qualities and hopefully we never will, but I was pleased enough with it for this bed that I think I may get another when I have to replace our mattress cover.",

(for all i know they're better) it seems like it's deep enough to accommodate a mattress topper as well. i hope you have enjoyed this mattress protector review, citizen. carry on.",

    "description": "Package Quantity:1| Size:KingGet a restful night's sleep and prolong the life of your mattress by keeping it sanitary and safe from liquids, skin cells, mold, dust and other allergy triggers. Blocks Liquid Spills Once a liquid stain reaches your mattress, it is extremely difficult to remove, will probably void your mattress warranty, and may even make the mattress unusable. The Hanna Kay Mattress Protector can absorb up to 1 liter of urine, perspiration, water or any other fluid, thanks to a 100% cotton terrycloth top bonded onto a hypoallergenic polyurethane membrane. This safe, ultra-thin, noiseless material contains no PVCs or phthalates. Relieves Allergy, Asthma and Eczema Sufferers While you sleep, your body sheds skin cells and perspiration through the sheets and into your mattress. These substances become food for dust mites, bacteria, mold and fungus, all of which are a common causes of allergic and asthmatic reactions, as well as bed bugs. Dust mites are also known to cause eczema. The Hanna Kay Mattress Protector traps all those body particles on the surface, where they can be easily washed away. Breathable Comfort Microscopic holes in the membrane layer allow the mattress protector to circulate air, while still blocking out liquids and particles. This breathability helps dissipate body heat and maintain a comfortable sleeping temperature. The Hanna Kay Mattress Protector's advanced technology allows it to be as thin as a non-protective mattress cover, so the familiar feel of your bed won't change. Easy to Live With With elasticized mesh sides, the Hanna Kay Mattress Protector slips on as easily as a fitted sheet, and adapts to any mattress depth from 6\" to 18\". To clean it, simply toss it into the washing machine as you would any other mattress cover or sheet. The Hanna Kay Mattress Protector is made with premium quality materials and construction, and comes with a full replacement 10 year warranty.",
