Neither of these things are true. Each of these pans have the slide finish. The Calphalon packaging for this double set makes it sound as if you are getting one of each, so I can understand why the Amazon description is confusing. The quality of the pans is excellent and the sear feature isn't a top priority for me. The four stars instead of five is because of the confusion created by the description.",

They are super easy to clean, have a solid weight but aren't too heavy, and have lasted well. They have some small scratches in the pan from times when I have foolishly used a metal tool to get something out, but that's on me. You should stick to silicone spatulas or wooden tools with these pans. 10/10 would reccomend!",

Heat them on low settings and they quickly become very hot. Calphalon pans hold the heat extremely well and you will find it easy to cook with them. My impression is that they cook food at lower heat settings than other types of frying pans. As with all nonstick pans, it is best to use only nylon or wooden utensils or they will become scratched. These pans can quickly become indispensable. They are fairly heavy, but lighter than cast iron. I hang mine on hooks near the stove.",

Very sturdy build without being excessively heavy, and has excellent heat distribution across the surface especially compared to the ceramic coated ones I was using before. My only complaint is that the 8\" and 10\" is measured across the top, while the actual working surface area is only about 6\" and 8\", which is somewhat limiting. The performance is exceptional, though, and I intend to buy a 12\" separately.",
