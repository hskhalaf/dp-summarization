This is OUTSTANDING customer service. The very fact that they took the initiative and contacted me says a lot. That alone was worth the cost of the flashlight. The new one works great!! Worked great first time. Followed instructions, put silicone on the seals, dried it, stored it in cool dry place, charged battery.......AND.......second time I tried to use it............nothing!!! Doesn\u2019t turn on. Don\u2019t waste your money.",

      "text": "Spent a week of day and night diving in Cozumel Mexico using this light. Nice bright white light which beats all the other divers older style lights. Bright mode is great for illuminating under the coral and rocks during the daytime and the mid and dim modes worked great for night diving. I did have some issues with corrosion developing in the salt air (in the hotel) on the internal battery compartment contacts when charging the battery over night, which required cleaning all the contacts with alcohol and a q-tip every morning to keep the light working but otherwise it was a great primary dive light and I couldn't be more pleased!",

I wanted to see over a larger area and could not because the beam was too focused and straight out. I missed a lot of things in my surroundings because of it. Other divers with cone shaped beams lit up more area. This is a great backup light or day diving light otherwise, good for look under crevices where fish hide.",

I should have used this one as the primary! Less than half the size and much brighter. I picked this model over cheaper lights because of the push button activation.

Considering the price! 2018 - Really really really bright! Don't use out of water for very long. The LED needs to be cool. It will begin flashing once it heats up. Under water this is NOT an issue. Easy to recharge. The switch is easy to access. Used it for a wreck dive. Can't wait to use it for a night dive.",

I never recharged the battery, it really lasts. I like the magnetic switch. It is very easy to use. I put silicone grease on the o-rings. I am glad it comes with an extra set of rings.

The light at maximum setting is nice and bright. Love the rear switch, especially in my wrist mount for the dive light. Love that it comes with its own battery and single charger- couldn't ask for anything more for a single dive. Great value, I'll probably get another as a backup before my next extended dive trip.",
