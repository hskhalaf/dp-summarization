I have a pair of speakers with a sub woofer hooked up to it and it sounds fantastic. Without the added speakers the sound is very good for soft music, not to be cranked up loud. The lights are great. Bluetooth hooked up with no problems to my phone. For the price and features I give it 5 stars. The features I was looking for were USB, Bluetooth and external audio output connection. It's not a fine piece of cabinetry but it's great for the price.",

The radio and USB feature works well. I used the Bluetooth with my tablet to stream music and that worked perfectly also. This baby is going on my 50's dinette table to give off that diner feel and since I can Bluetooth the music it will be like a little wallbox like the diner's had. You should really get one if you're into the retro era or even if you just want something fun.I recommend it.",
