I bought two pastel units and divided the colors between my 4 year old boy/girl twins. Very happy!",

Before, I was using those drawer storage boxes, which rapidly fell apart, & they were simply too small for the amount of toys that she had. It took me about 10 minutes to assemble, nothing special needed, just a Phillips screwdriver. The wood seems durable enough, & the bins are thick plastic, so they haven't cracked or broke or anything yet. This is by far the best purchase that I have made in a long time, across all spectrums.",

Highly recommend these for any kids room.",

This product offered the perfect solution to giving her the ability to have all of her toys at an arms reach. Its a great teaching tool too for sorting and color coding. My only complaint is that the screws don't fit completely on one side so they stick out. The piece is sturdy but I recommend placing it against a wall for extra support.",
