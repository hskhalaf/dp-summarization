She would eat the entire bag in one sitting if I would let her, which I won't, and I am firmly convinced she would sell me off in a heartbeat for a lifetime supply. As a previous reviewer said, it is very dry and crumbly - but my cat licks it all up eagerly. This stuff is outrageously pricey at 5.99 for a one ounce bag (over 95 dollars a pound- what kind of nonsense is that?), But the cat is addicted, so . . . By the way she does not care at all for the cod fish - she just loves the turkey.",

When I tried to break or cut them into small pieces, I could get some smaller pieces but I also got a lot of crumbs and powder. Maybe for a larger dog where you only break it in half it might be okay, but for the price there was a lot of waste for me trying break up. I guess you could soak them in water to rehydrate them, but it's kind of expensive for just giving regular turkey. This was true for both the chicken and turkey, I'll be opening up the beef soon and will review that one.",
