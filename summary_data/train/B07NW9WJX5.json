The oil that comes with it ruptured in the box and coated the entire mower. After cleanup i began assembly and found the rear height adjusting lever was bent and twisted so bad it wouldn't work properly I had to disassemble the whole rear axle to straighten out the lever. Thankful it didn't snap when straightening it. A lot of people would have probably just returned it.",

Its easier to go to the store find what you want and leave and its easy to return a product then sending it off.",

(2) Packaging - the boxed lawnmower will have oil everywhere. I mean everywhere. Very hard to clean up. (3) Parts - impossible finding parts for this particular model using the model number or the serial number of this lawnmower.",
