      "text": "I have been using Moom for over a year now and use nothing else. Although waxing is going to hurt regardless of what product you use, waxing with Moom really does hurt alot less than conventional wax. It does require a bit of a skill but after a couple of waxings you get the hang of it. I very much recommend this product.",
