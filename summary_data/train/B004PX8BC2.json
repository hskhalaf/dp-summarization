When I tried lifting the wagon, it kept slipping back down with a clunk clunk, and it appears the large \"nut\" that does the work of lifting opposite the handle hole is stripped out partially and doesn't lift reliably.

The jack seemed sturdy enough, altho I had a lot of trouble with the handle - it was difficult to tun, as the grip is a bit too short to get a good grasp of it while turning.. I think a pump type handle would be much easier. For the price though, I think it's pretty good, and would suffice.",

Worked like any other scissor jack I've used, but remember that these things can be dangerous and tip easily if not used carefully. This one had a very light coat of grease on the threaded rod. Almost like oil alone. In light of some of the other reviews mentioning massive thread wear, I gave it a good coat of thick grease and the improvement in ease of operation, even under no load, was profound. Hopefully that rod will hold up now.",
