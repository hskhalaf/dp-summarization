Problem is it was a knock off. Comparing it side by side with the real nighthawk (the one my boyfriend had) even the citizen box it came in looked cheap, not to mention the watch itself. Now I\u2019m purchasing one for my brother for Christmas this year and I\u2019m trying a different retailer that amazon offers so fingers crossed this one is actually real when it shows up in the mail.",

Yes, you have to study it a little more carefully to discern the time but that is to be expected with a watch that is all one color and it is not difficult. If you didn't want an all black watch, why did you buy it? This is my 5th Citizen Eco-Drive and it is as great as the rest of them. I find no issues with the finish or durability. I can only suspect that those who had problems got a fake.",

      "text": "My boyfriend loved this watch that I bought for him, it matches his truck:) I'm curious to see how the crystal holds up to scratches and how the black wears on the band. I read a review about the crystal scratching easily so I will update this when I find out. Being that myself and my boyfriend have three citizen's eco-drive watches together, I'm wondering if we will have to switch brands eventually due to poor quality of crystal. Mine has scratched easily and his older one has also. But I do love the look of this watch and it's one he can wear every day.",

First, the luminescent hands and dial do not show for more than 4 hours - this is bad, especially in winter when the days are very short. Second, the Eco-Drive is great, however, I did not take into account that I wear long sleeves that cover the dial face meaning I have to be careful to leave my watch out when I get home so the watch can recharge. Finally, what this watch really needs is some sort of illumination. Other than those three issues, this is a great watch.",
