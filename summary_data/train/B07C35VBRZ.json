I put enough water to cover the clothes, turn it on and go mind my business. I did have to start taping the outlet hose to the sink it was emptying in. It just wouldn\u2019t stay as is. I have small complains but using this still beats the hell out of having to go to the laundromat. I get my clothes done and push this thing into a closet when I\u2019m done.",
