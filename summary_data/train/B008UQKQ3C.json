This is my second purchase and although it is a bit cheaply built in the back in looks good from the front. I added some led strip lights plugged into a timer to regulate lighting times for about 22 bucks and mirror stick on squares inside to give it a reflective ability which makes it look deeper and helps with the visual display of my models. Overall I am very happy with it. Pictures are of both of my cabinets. Took my wife and myself about two hours total to do.",

I had to use picture hangers crosswise on the door corners just to hold them together. Also, there is no magnet on the doors to hold them closed, but the lid of the cabinet has a magnet, so it appear someone forgot to put the door magnets in the package.

It was easy to assemble and I was able to put most of it together with only a little help attaching the door fronts. The back screws on instead of nailing and I think it will hold up beautifully.

However, after I glued the backboard fast to the frame and glued the seam up the back, it became sturdy and now I am happy with it. My daughter got 3 splinters putting it together for me and I didn't think that was very good, but I did not expect super high quality for the price. All considered, I am glad I got it. It is very nice looking and will hold my books. I love the glass doors.",
