Rather than trying to buy some kind of fancy connector to mate up with the original harness connector, I just cut the connector off the original harness and spliced the wires together with a couple small twist on electrical wire nuts. If they're good enough for high voltage connections, they're good enough for 12 volts. The job was easy, directions were good and came with extra hardware for different mounting applications. I reused the original speaker screws that held the old speakers in the doors. Good quality sound for her stock stereo system.",

The front doors installed without any aftermarket plastic insert. All I did was use 4 drywall track screws to install them with my battery drill. I did use the Metra 72-4568 to connect to the factory wiring. They sounded great with my stock radio. Two of my stock ones did not work and the other two were blown. They are not the best speakers, but they improved the sound 100% or back to what it sounded like 140,000 miles ago. Mine is a 2000 model.",

I used mine with the Kenwood DNX571HD which has a 7 band graphic equalizer. The low frequency response is adequate but if you require some punchy bass you will need to get a separate subwoofer. The tweeter delivers smooth highs but lacks the sharp details. As with many speakers out there, the sound will distort when the speakers played too loud. They earn 3 stars because even though they are affordable and sound better than stock, both of them blew out in less than 9 months.",
