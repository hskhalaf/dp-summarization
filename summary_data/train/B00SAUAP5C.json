More stable and the altitude hold makes it much simpler compared to 100% manual flying. This drone is super fun and super easy compared to what were useto. If you can fly a very basic totally manual drone that does nothing automatically, you can fly this one easily. The auto land is really neat and works very well. You can cancel auto land during the sequence by moving the throttle stick. Holy Stone did a good job on this one BIG FUN!",

The other issue is the battery compartment. when you plug in a different battery, the connecting wire can be a pain to get the battery door closed.

      "text": "I bought this drone for my kids, both fairly young. With just a little bit of coaching and practice, both have been able to successfully fly this successfully. It flies well and fairly easily and the charge lasts for a good amount of time. I did order extra batteries and a charger, which helps to extend playing time. Pros: - easy to learn to fly - takes video and photos - easy to assemble - lightweight Cons - video and photo has to be downloaded to view (easy to do with supplied USB)-- - Propeller guards could be a little bit more sturdy",

It was refreshing. The product itself is great. I've been flying smaller/cheaper quad copters for a while, and I've owned quite a few. The flight stabilization of this device makes it great for recording videos and a lot easier to fly than the others I own. I think this quad will shine the most when you want to record video inexpensively and beginners will really appreciate the landing assist and hovering features.",

If you're willing to spend the money just to learn how to fly a drone, it's a great buy. I would not encourage the buy for any sort of advanced usage.",

He loves it and once he got it all together and charged he had it flying in no time. We live in the Northeast and had snow on the ground so he hasn't had a chance to fly it outside yet.

I've contacted Holy Stone and talked with Martina about getting the missing battery. She was very, very nice and after taking some information from me she said she would ship me the battery right away. So far I'm thrilled with the drone and the Holy Stone Customer Service.

The motors burn up quick and had to buy a new set. --Update-- Not exactly sure what made me crash, but like a lot of other reviews Holy Stone reached out after my review and they sent me a replacement drone... I have to admit their customer service is amazing. I'm speechless! Thank you! I definitely will buy Holy Stone products in the future.",

He loves the turning feature so you can rotate the drone while you fly to make it easier to control. Goes super high and does FLIPS! Very well lit up and easy to spot in the sky. We bough the Holy Stone 2x 3.7 V 750 mAh batteries and the 4 in 1 drone Battery charger. Highly recommend them as a much have with this purchase.",

Many of your problems will be solved that way. Holy Stone has been very supportive with emails checking to make sure all was going well. I\u2019ve had no problems which required calling them but I would not hesitate if I needed extra help. For the money, I am well pleased.",
