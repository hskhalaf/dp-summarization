When I received it, it's nothing but a \"cheap 55 cent collar\" with \"overstitched\" embroidery: there is very poor stitching on the collar, and it had to ALL be snipped with scissors so that the phone number could be read. Also, when properly fitted, the adjustment loop piece of plastic covers the phone number. That should be taken into consideration BEFORE embroidering the collar. At the price? It's not worth it, and the timeliness of the delivery was unreal. Slow boat to China? I suppose. I'd recommend you get your collars locally at your nearest Petco or PetSmart.

You basically don't have to put a tag on the collar because your name and number is already on there. It snaps off if it gets caught on something so your cat doesn't choke. There are two cons though. Sometimes the adjusting strap covers a number or letter on the collar. If you're lucky it gets between the spaces but most of the time it's on a number. Second con is someone tried to steal the collar because it was nice and put it on their cat. I guess you can't have something too nice~",

Maybe my cat's necks are on the smallish side?",

I wanted a collar with my information in case my cat managed to escape from home but didn't want to burden it with heavy and/or large metal tags on his neck. This product solved that dilemma rather nicely. I would also like to note that despite this collar coming with a bell already attached, it wasn't too hard to detach it from the collar as I always found it silly and somewhat cruel to put a bell on your cat(indoor only cat that is). Overall, 5/5, would recommend any and all cat butlers.",

I used to buy embroidered cat collars that were of a heavier and denser material with an elastic section, no slide adjuster, and with regular buckle rather than breakaway buckle. Length was adjusted by cutting off the end. But I can't seem to find a cat collar of that quality anymore.",
