Started out with Asics about 7 years ago and stuck with then for about 5 years, then moved to Nike and then New Balance (both top end models). Went back to Asics with this purchase and was a great decision. These feel like a supportive shoe with cushioning - the Nike and New Balance just didn't absorb shocks that great or give support enough. I am a heavy runner too. Probably best running trainers I have had (recognising I am a part timer and acknowledging there are other quality running shoes out there).",

These provide the level of cushioning that feel good for me while generally being a good fit and being pretty robust. I can't fault the quality of these, they are the same as the others I've purchased but my only complaint is that they seem a little narrow compared to others I've had so I can't really wear them for more than a couple of hours at a time. Not too much of a problem but annoying as I wish they'd fit like the others.",
