The fabric is heavy duty, the zipper at the top is great, and there is a nice size pocket on the front you could fit a cell phone, wallet, and keys. The inside space is huge. It is just 1 large open compartment, no inside pockets. In my bag I was able to fit 4 pairs of sweat pants (medium thickness), 5 shirts, under garments, a pair of flip flops and slippers, a bathroom bag (10x6x4in), and a small bag filled with snacks. I still have space left in it! This bag is exactly as advertised, nothing fancy but works great.",
