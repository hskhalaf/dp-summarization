The monitor cannot display a black, not even a uniform grey, and the viewing angle is very limited. Two stars because it was cheap and worked straightaway with my Raspberry Pi. Had to return it as I knew I would feel sorry for purchasing it every time I turn it on. Bought instead a Benq GW2406Z for \u00a345 more, which I am very happy with so far, deep blacks, very wide viewing angle, stable metal stand.",

I have one screen working in VGA and the other in HDMI as that is what my docking station can support. The HDMI connection is vastly better with these screens. I haven't ever noticed that with the Dell monitors I use in work. It will do and value for money wasn't bad, but I know it will irk me in time.",

The ports available are: 1 x HDMI, 1 x DVI, 1 x D-SUB (DE-15/VGA), Audio In & Headphone Jack The presence of only 1 HDMI output may be a problem for some but is manageable for me. The inbuilt stereo speakers are a nice bonus. Included in the box: UK plug, US plug, DE-15 cable, 3.5mm audio cable. HDMI cable not included.",
