I use these because they don't distort, are comfortable, sturdy, and look great. I do prefer the slightly smaller lens as the larger can get a bit heavy, but either way, they look wonderful.",

If you are coming from a pair of New Wayfarers (as I was) you should note that 1) In the same eye size (49) the overall lens size of these is a bit bigger, primarily from the lenses being \"taller\" than the NW. Also these are a fair bit heavier and have a tendency to slide down your nose (though proper adjustment of the bridge pads and ear hooks will correct this. Overall these are excellent glasses and I've received multiple compliments on them since I started wearing them.",

The adjustable nose pads were a great relief compared to the plastic glasses/sunglass frames I'm used to wearing. I have dark hair and olive skin, and the havana/tortoiseshell color with green lenses seems to be the best match for me. I would definitely recommend this pair to anyone looking for a nice pair of glasses.",

All of the products I have seen recently have been made in China. I have compared an American made pair of Wayfarers to the China Wayfarers and the quality seems to be very close. Enough of that. The Clubmaster is still a high quality product. If you like the style they are an excellent value.",

So I might as well get a proper pair, a pair that opticians would happily fix for you if something is wrong, but highly doubt so because it comes with a decent case, the arms are nicely attached not too tight not too loose.
