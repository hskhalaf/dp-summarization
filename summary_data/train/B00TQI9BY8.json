The biggest advantage for me of cube cases is having a flat motherboard plane so that you don't have to worry about GPU sag. The EATX compatibility is also a huge plus, and its really roomy to build in. My biggest downsides of this case are: 1. The lack of USB-C ports 2. The location of the existing USB ports -- rather than having 4 on one side, it would have been nice to have 2 on both sides.",

Fairly flexible in USB panel placement. Sturdy construction. Screws for add in cards don't fit as well as those from other cases I own. They strip out pretty easily. Plastic parts can easily break if not careful, but the overall 5.25\" and 3.5\" rail system for drives works.",

      "text": "Pros: Awesome case! Huge with plenty of room for creativity. Cons: 1) Cable management. Although not really a con, but if you are sort of a \"neat freak\" that likes to hide cables away for a cleaner look then, it might get a little difficult, but not impossible. 2) Did I say huge? Be sure to have enough space for this beast. I added a pic. It may not be the cleanest build, but I Iike it. The case is definitely worth it.",

This case is comparable to entry Case Labs cases for a much lower price.",
