The right and left arm covers cover the middle seat great. The puppy already had a small accident and it beaded up for easy cleanup!",

It is MUCH better than some of the couch covers we have had, but it still moves around and you are always tucking it in. It has a no-slip backing which is nice, but that also means you have to line-dry it (read: NO dryer heat), and when I take it off the couch to wash it, it leaves behind several of the little rubber nubbies - every single time.",

My dog loves to pull down the couch covers and make a nest with traditional couch covers, however these are very secure with elastic band that goes under the cushions and behind the top of the couch, making it pull-down proof. Machine washable.. some of the gripper nubs peeled off (maybe like 50 of the zillion nubs) after the first wash with a commercial washer on the gentle cycle... but with the lifetime warranty, it is a good investment so far. Not sure how many washes they can stand.. but after 1 week no complaints!",
