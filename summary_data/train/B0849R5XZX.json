We love the ambiance mode feature - see the picture. Check the quality of the colors in the video attached. Also, get the right screws if you are mounting the tv on the wall.

The other TV doubles as a computer monitor and works great. Putting it into perspective, the Q60T is a mid-tier QLED, edge lit TV. It doesn't quite compare to my 65\" top of the line Samsung 4K/HDR tv in my family room - but it was 1/5 of the price and 1/3 of size - and used differently.",
