I called amazon support, the person was no help and told me she couldn\u2019t do anything because I couldn\u2019t return it. The only thing she did that was helpful was call google support for me and they were helpful. I told them my problem and told me that my phone couldn\u2019t be fixed and they asked me for the IMEI # to see if I was under warranty. Thank goodness I was now I have to send the phone to them and they should send me a replacement.",

Excellent support and super fast to receive software upgrades. Battery last all day on a full charge with \"moderate\" use. I have small feminine hands and the phone is easy to use one handed. Fits perfectly in a back pocket. Excellent night pics with the camera. Seller (Edge Cellular) shipped the phone out quickly and even though it was rated \"good\" condition the phone came nearly flawless. Very happy with my purchase.",

A couple of small scratches, to be expected thanks to the photos and the fact that it's half of what you'd pay new, and otherwise a perfect phone.
