They provided me with a certificate of testing and with the proper labels to apply to the helmet to bring it into compliance. Now my wife can use this helmet and look stylish and feel safe, as well as being able to use it in her competitions. *Original review*Bought for cycling, as advertised, shocked to see it missing safety labeling and instructions required by US code. Unfortunate, because my wife loved the fit, magnetic buckle function, looks and everything else about this helmet. Without the proper testing and labeling it is also illegal for use in her upcoming triathlon.",

The magnetic straps took a while to get used to, but they're amazingly convenient. They're a great replacement to the Abus Gamechanger and an eyecatching helmet for any kit. However, despite the high quality, I do feel it's more of a $50 dollar item. There's not enough features to justify $60, I don't think.",

Also, the tightened in the back tends to rub the back of my head and actually cut into my head when I look to the left. I was able to rearrange the pads to minimize the irritation. I suggest you only consider helmets with MIPS! UPDATE: (10/11/20). When the vendor read my review, they immediately contacted me via email. They offered a free replacement in a large size. The new helmet arrived today and fits comfortably. I appreciate companies that go a step above to make things right. Thank you!",

I neither need nor want the light. Love the color. I like the adjustment band. Going to return it.",
