I do wish that the pieces would not go flying out of their spots if you opened it upside down, however that would mean it would need some sort of clipping system to keep them in and that would slow you down if you were trying to get things out of the box quicker, so I guess it just depends on what is important to you.",

Very organized and the case stays locked when closed.",

If I changed anything, I'd ask for a little better case, as one tip can mix them up, but I'm sure a piece of tape across the top of them on each side would fix the problem. The outside of the case is nice and it's compact. Would choose to purchase this set again.",
