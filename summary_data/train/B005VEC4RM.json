Of course we (well my husband) reads all the directions. Take your time when you get to the roof, all the rest is very simple.",

You need almost perfect level where you assembling or plan to put this shed otherwise you will have problems with door closing. The thing Rubbermaid could have done better is the doors. Door keeps coming out. But I found a solution on Youtube about the doors. So its all good now. I will recommend this shed.",

If you've put together one of those metal sheds (like 500 screws), this is easier by any comparison. Yes, I cut out the bottom, but good luck finding a bottomless plastic shed.

      "text": "Before buying this Rubbermaid outdoor shed, we had another Rubbermaid shed (almost 15 years). The previous shed and this shed are very similar in appearance. The previous shed had no screws or nails. It was easy to put together and to take apart. Though this shed has parts which do not require screws, bolts and other hardware, it has hardware. Putting the roof together was not easy. There were holes for the screws on one side, but there was no connection (holes) on the other side. So, the screws cut in to the plastic roof. Would I recommend this product to someone else? No. We were a bit disappointed. We do like its look, though.",

It looks very attractive and just hope it keeps all items inside dry.",
