Want to control the shutter or lens opening you can do that too. With its included softwear and website support you can make the most of every shot you take. The bad: no optical viewfinder & no optional add-ons to enhance picture taking ability. What you see is what you get! For anyone like me who doesn't care about all the bells & whistles but just want's easy to make great pix in most situations, this camera would be hard to beat.",

All that aside, this camera has every feature a casual user might want. For me, I take HQ photos of products for data sheets and its F number of up to 8 has given me a very decent depth of field on macro mode for these shots. Other great features are its 8mp and 5x optical zoom which makes it even more versatile. Overall this camera is outstanding for its low price.",

The reviewer who stated that photos look better when you use the specific lighting/action settings was absolutely right, which can be frustrating when you want to just point and shoot. I also wish I had realized that the batteries have a very limited life in this camera, even when you buy the lithium. We bought rechargable AA's for digital cameras and that took care of that problem for the most part.",

I was disappointed at first but like it overall. The two things I do not like are 1. It can only take a 2 Gigabyte card max. @. You have to reset the date every time when you change the batteries. Its not hard to do but does get old. It was very inexpensive, and overall a good little camera.",

For younger people who didn't grow up using 35mm range finder and SLR camera's I am sure they won't mind. It does take great pictures and it is easy to use but because there is no view finder I put the camera in the back of my sock drawer and bought a Canon A630 which I really enjoy using.",
