Runs a lot of electricity and water. When you go down the tail slide, it can scratch you on the hip bc it turns and your leg rubs the seam. Fun for the kids but I probably wouldn\u2019t buy it again.",

Hours of entertainment and he sleeps really well those nights! Easy set up, it can take awhile to drain so give yourself about an hour to properly drain, dry, and put away.",

As soon as you turn off the blower pump it starts deflating and dumping all the water. If you want to use it again the next day you have to waste the same amount of water all over again. Huge waste of water. There should be a sperate closable chamber to hold all of that water until you choose to drain it.",
