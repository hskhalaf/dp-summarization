      "text": "It's hard to say because it depends so much on the cat. Appearance wise it's adorable. However my cat seems very uncomfortable walking in it. The issue is that when it's tight enough that I feel safe that he's secure, it seems to bug him under his arms. However when I losen it enough that he walks comfortable, I can tell he could slip out too easily. For now, it works for carrying him to the car with the extra security of having it on in case I need to set him down briefly. Better than nothing.",

      "text": "This is my second time ordering this because their size chart was off. My cat's measurement according to their chart should be a really tight medium which is what I got the first time. It was so big that within 10 steps of walking, one of his front paw would be out of the sleeve/hole already. Another 10 steps the whole vest became a belt on his waist and fall off in 3 seconds. The size small fits him really good now and it's pretty cute with the little theme going on. Now I walk my cat everyday and the harness works pretty well even with him pulling.",
