We took the battery to a Battery store and they'd never seen a battery like it. They didn't know where to even get one. We paid ~$200 for a unit that got limited use. There appears to be only a one year manufacturers warranty and no information about who to contact for assistance or to find out where to get another battery. I will be looking for another brand, with a replaceable battery, to replace the unit for my Dad.",
