Apparently the regular size Sawyer filter does not have the same problem. Sawyer company- fix your O rings on the mini and you go from a 1 star to a 5!",

      "text": "My new favorite hiking tool. Works great, is very light and takes up very little space. I use it as a gravity filter most of the time. I cut off most of the bottom of a 1.5 liter essentia water bottle, poked a hole for a carabiner to hang it. Screw it on and use a length of tubing from the hardware store, works like a charm. Now it's a squeeze and gravity sawyer. ;) Update: Upon back flushing my syringe broke, I don't see this much! Currently trying to find a replacement. Within 24 hours of emailing sawyer a cs rep contacted me and is sending me a replacement syringe. Very cool! Thanks Ms J.",

All seemed to be well then, except that it was still difficult to push through to filter. I backflushed some more in case that was the problem. After that, I tried drinking through it again and TASTED lake water. There were also some dirty chunks coming through. Since I can't seem to return this item, I'm stuck with a faulty filtration system.",

Only issue is that the flow rate is a bit anemic, even when new, and forget about it after a few gallons. Seeing I was going to need a filter for an extended period on a trip to the Sierras, I decided to try both the Sawyer Mini and the Squeeze. Trust me, dear UL hiker, the Squeeze is worth the extra ounces. It will flow better for longer and save you the hassle and annoyance.",

    "description": "A lightweight, versatile personal filtration system, the second-generation Sawyer MINI Water Filter fits in the palm of your hand and has a total field weight of just 2 ounces. Perfect for everything from camping with the kids to traveling abroad where tap and bottle water can't be trusted, the tiny MINI provides 0.1 micron absolute filtration for clean drinking water on the go \u2014 filtering out bacteria, protozoa, and microplastics. The MINI filter removes 7 log (99.99999%) of all bacteria (like salmonella) as well as other harmful bacteria which causes cholera and E. coli and 6 log (99.9999%) of all protozoa such as giardia and cryptosporidium. These removal rates equal or exceed other filter options. EPA guidelines allow ten times more protozoa left in the water than Sawyer MINI filters allow. The MINI also filters out 100% of microplastics. The MINI 0.1 micron absolute filter houses a cluster of micro-fibrous tubes which use similar technology found in medical dialysis. As water passes through the side walls of the tubes, harmful bacteria and protozoa are trapped on the outer walls so you can be confident your water is safe to drink. Great for outdoor recreation, hiking, camping, scouting, domestic and international travel, and emergency prepping, the Sawyer MINI gives you a number of ways to access clean water. Attach it to the included drinking pouch, use the included straw to drink directly from your water source, connect it to hydration pack tubing (sold separately), or screw it onto standard disposable bottles (28mm thread). Since 1984, Sawyer Products has offered the best, most technologically advanced solutions for protection against sun, bugs, water, and injuries \u2014 everything from first aid kits developed for wilderness to point-of-use water filters that filter contaminated water to levels cleaner than U.S. bottled water.",
