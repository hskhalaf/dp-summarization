But the person for whom I bought it just can't get used to it and feels like it still pushes the mask and creates leaks. Maybe the placement of the indentations just doesn't work for everyone?

Now while the market extra pillow cases for their pillows with two contours, I am unaware of a spare pillow case for the four contour pillow.

The effect is to significantly increase my therapy time with my BIPAP machine, similar to a CPAP device, increasing it from roughly 4.5 hours per night to approximately 6.5 hours every time I sleep (8-9 hours total). This leaves me much more energetic and clear-headed, functional and productive, enabling me to be much more successful and efficient during the day in completing my work and social responsibilities. It also leaves me meaningfully less irritable and more happy. Even if the price is somewhat too high, I do highly recommend this quality product.",
