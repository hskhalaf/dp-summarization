It was hard to manipulate the screwdriver inside the box which you have to do. For the most part the screws lined with the holes but the plastic feet screwing them into those holes was really hard and I don\u2019t think the holes were large enough it created a big mess. The cube stack but they don\u2019t lock into place at all so it is wobbly. I will put this near the TV because I\u2019m afraid it could fall into it in Cause some real damage .",

Instead the divider is white and it looks a bit odd. You can't notice it much if you filled the entire shelf with discs but I think most people would add accent items in addition to their disc collection and the white backing will show. I like the size, not too tall nor too small, just right to sit next to the TV stand.",

It holds a reasonable amount of dvds, about 18-19 per shelf per side for an approximate total of 144 movies depending how fat the boxes are. It would probably hold more blue rays because they are slim lined and all ones size. It doesn't take up too much space and fits in a corner.",
