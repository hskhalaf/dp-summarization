This vest has plenty of storage I had two bottles, bladder, keys and found a bonus pocket for my iPhone8 and in this pocket the phone stayed dry when my vest was wet! There is still extra storage for gel packets, salt tablets or whatever, and in with the bladder there is storage also if needed . I would recommend this for all distance runners that are looking to stay hydrated, or light runs when needing to carry items. Would definitely purchase this again.",

The sheer adjustability of this vest is awesome. I'm big but lean\u2014230 pounds of muscle\u2014which means I have some interesting contours to work with, and I can get this to fit perfectly. My iPhone 8+ in an Otterbox Defender fits in one of the front pockets (it sticks out, but it's not going anywhere) and there's ample room upfront for another bottle (with a hand strap), my wallet, keys, and other small items. The rear storage is big enough for a backup bottle, headlamp, and a buff. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.",

Doesn't ride neck. The bottles aren't the softest out there, but have a canoed fuller on the flat side to naturally ride your Infrasternal Angle (I looked that up, I think that's the spot).

However, it's way too bouncy to run with until there isn't much water left. I even tried packing the pocket with towels to reduce the bounce but to no avail. The vest might be okay running with only bottles in the front pockets, but that's not what I need it for. It just doesn't work for me.",

Before I used a backpack which always felt heavy on my back but with this I feel so lightweight and not dragged down by what feels like extra weight. Straps are easy to tighten. My chest is 43 inches and this is a bit snug for the larger size but the top strap is stretchy which helps it fit perfect. For running I just tighten the straps a bit more for more durability. Highly recommend for those always outside in the outdoors.",

Only inconvenience I've encountered is the slightly small front bottle pockets/pouches. Just a tad too tight to fit a hand bottle (oval/oblong shape) in the pocket so I had to buy new round bottles to fit the pockets. I'll update periodically to discuss durability. But so far, great product and would absolutely recommend.",

My issues with that day had nothing to do with my triwonder pack! The fit was fine, but I am glad I'm not any smaller for it ( 38 jacket), but I also like equipment to not be loose. Hope this helps :)",
