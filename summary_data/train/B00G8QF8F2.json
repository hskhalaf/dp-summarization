Nicequality as always from Conti, and easy to install.",

They do not weigh much and can be converted to tubeless. The reason why I'm giving this product a four star rating is because the tire bead is very hard to set and it is a really tight fit. Other than than that, this is a great product.",

It lasted about six months, mounted on the rear, before going completely wobbly (I thought I'd bent my rim, it rubbed the chainstay so badly). I tried remounting/reseating it about a half dozen times before a net search revealed others' reports of the inner cords breaking on this model, which seems like that's what's happened with mine: the bead is evenly seated but one section of the tire is offset about 30%. It was good while it lasted (and once I repressed the anguish of mounting it tubeless the first time), so still 3 stars.",
