I would like my money back but by the time I went to the doctor and was feeling better Amazon said my window closed July 6th. Its now July 19th. Yes, it took me over a month to get better and get back to my job.",

Wish they also made a model with softer tips and a shorter one for the back. As a myoskeletal therapist I would buy both. Anyone who has deep neck work knows that is an extremely sensitive area.
