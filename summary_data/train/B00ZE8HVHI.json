There is a better operating system and after a few software updates, it is just as good as the S7 Active. The only downside between the S7 Active and the S6 Active is the S7 has a speaker in the front and it gives you better sound...naturally. Other than that, this thing is a work horse! I have bought several more S6 Actives for the different lines I have with AT&T and for the rest of the family.",

In the case, it's a little bigger than I was anticipating but after 4 ruined phones in a row, it's time for safer over more convenient.
