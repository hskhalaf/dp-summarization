      "text": "Things I love about doing laps in this mask: - Not having to turn my head to breath when I'm doing freestyle. - Breathing at my own natural pace, instead of having to gasp every three strokes. - Not getting pool water in my mouth. - The quiet of staying under the water. - It doesn't fog up anywhere near as much as my goggles. - I don't need to rest as often to catch my breath. I do breath all my air out, and a deep breath in, every breath, to clear the used air. It's good exercise for my lungs. If you're unable to take deep breaths, a full face mask is not for you.",

      "text": "My husband and I each bought one for our ten day trip to Maui, Hawai'i. We snorkeled everyday. They are amazing. We had a slight issue with fogging but the locals taught us that we were wearing them too high. They need to basically press the bridge of your nose to get the best usage out of them. Once we started wearing them as such we had zero issues. I absolutely loved the unobstructed view that these provide. It was also nice having my snorkel breathing tube close up when we dove under the water. No worries about clearing the tube or inhaling water. All in all I have zero complaints and highly recommend them.",

No leaks, easy breathing and a full view. Most surprising is that you can breathe completely normally through nose and mouth, not possible with a conventional snorkel. Once I have a chance to try it for real snorkeling, I will update my review, but initial trial was a great success.",
