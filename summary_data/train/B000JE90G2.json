The up and down adjustment is not intuitive at all which is frustrating. My primary issue was the mouse platform adjustment. Despite using the dial underneath, my platform would not tilt or adjust in any way. Called 3M tech support and they said \"yeah, that piece can be difficult to work with.\" Zero suggestions on how to get it to operate properly",

There is no A,B,C instruction, so unless you are handy at figuring things out on your own or paying someone else to do it for you, I would find something else.",

      "text": "3M Easy Adjust Keyboard Tray is convenient and out of the way of my desktop. Not only can you adjust its height but it is also possible to adjust the tilt and can shift the tray from one side to the other. The mouse pad is adjustable as to the tilt and the height but is a bit too short and not quite wide enough for my liking. I gave this a four star only because of the mouse pad being too short and not quite wide enough. Otherwise, I think you'll really like the 3M Easy Adjust Keyboard Tray.",

When moving the tray back under the desk, you have to push hard to start the slide.",
