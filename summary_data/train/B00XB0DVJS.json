      "text": "This is more user friendly than the manduka straps I have (not as pretty)---the manduka seem to not hold the loop and constantly are sliding. I think the material in this is also more stiff and uncomfortable on this skin- but the buckle makes it the most functional. Who cares about soft cotton straps, if the strap doesn't stay where you need? Bottom line, it works and is a great deal. The best thing would be this hardware design in the soft manduka straps.",

A week later, my temp instructor found a bag of straps our normal instructor had left and they were all this brand! Like most workout equipment, I wish they had more color options, but understand that it's not always possible. I bought the dark grey which is about a shade darker than my mat and towel. Great to support the little guy over the mass produced Gaiam brand I think ;)",

I'm sure there will be a need for such length at some point but for someone who can (sometimes) reach their toes, there's a lot of extra length for basic use.",
