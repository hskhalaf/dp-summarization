I didn't want to shred any of my nice shoes on grip tape, and these Osiris looked nice and fit the bill price-wise. I followed other posters' advice and bought them larger than I needed and that was the right call, they're pretty snug. That said, they're very comfortable and I consider them a good buy.",
