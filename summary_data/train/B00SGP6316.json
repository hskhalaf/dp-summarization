This went on for a month before my husband realized it coincided with when we started using the shampoo. So I stopped. The bumps went away!!! I didn't use this soap for 5 days and all 5 days, no bumps. I used it again on the 6 day and my son's bumps are back, so it's for sure the shampoo.",

There is zero residue after rinsing. Also smells nice. The squirt nozzle is a nice bonus, very easy to use with the bottle on a shelf in the shower.

It either doesn't pop up so we can pump soap or the head falls off. It's not a huge deal since we usually just use the pump from a previous empty bottle but it's pretty annoying. And they break pretty easily. If i drop the shampoo into the shower the cap usually breaks off. But as a liquid the soap is great",

And, it doesn't smell like lavender. For me, that is HUGE. So far, my scalp hurts less. I also use Ava's Diaper/Dream Cream (no comparable brand elsewhere in that format). I also got some of the adult Puracy Body Wash- and the scent in that is also nice.",

My baby feels clean and soft afterwards. I do not notice any soapy residue on his skin after and the smell is pleasant. He just smells clean not fragrant. Feel much better using this over Johnson and Johnson. I couldn't bare using that on his new skin. Will probably continue to buy this product as long as he needs it.",
