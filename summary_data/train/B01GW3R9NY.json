After a few days of use the hair gets thicker & has more volume. Dont expect miracles but you can definitively see a difference.

Free product never came, I tried to contact them but nobody respond. About product itself shampoo is too watery and dry your hair out especially if it's bleached. I got conditioner as well but it's not moisturize hair at all. After using the product my hair remind of a straw. Not gonna buy it again, waste of money. And it doesn't help for growing hair try Hair La Vie - awesome product (vitamin blend) hair start regrow within a week and it's 100% organic!",

So I'm sticking with Pronexa. Definitely use the conditioner too, it helps keep the hair out of the comb too. I also use Minoxidil 5% foam that I buy at Costco to regrow hair and I have tons of hair sprouts all over my head, so that's working as well.",

      "text": "I have been suffering some hair loss with age, and have been unhappy about it - so tried this product a while back and have made several repeat orders. I find that it seems to work to, at the least, slow hair loss if not stopping it in its tracks. After several months of using it, my hair seemed fuller. I stopped using it for a while and found that my hairbrush was showing signs of more hair loss again, so recently bought another month's supply and intend not to let it lapse anymore. There are no miracle cures for hair loss, but this product does what it claims to and is safe to use. I recommend it.",

I've only been on this regimen for a couple of months - too soon to notice any drastic results yet! What I have noticed, since I started using Pronexa Clinical Strength Hair Growth & Regrowth Therapy Hair Loss Shampoo With Biotin, Collagen, and DHT Blockers for Thinning Hair is that my hair and scalp feels noticeably cleaner. And two nice side benefits I've enjoyed are the pleasant citrusy aroma and the softness which the hair is left with! Add the biotin, collagen, and DHT Blockers, all of which are proven in aiding the regrowth of health hair, and this shampoo should be a winner!",

My ONLY issue was that it made my ends feel dry, so now I'm only using it on my scalp.",

Moreover, my scalp feels very comfortable after using it. It sometimes feels itchy to non-organic products, so I think this product is organic as it claimed.

    "description": "Pronexa Clinical Strength Hair Regrowth Therapy Hair Loss Shampoo uses a powerful combination of cutting edge ingredients that work synergistically to create the ideal conditions for hair growth and regrowth while at the same time preventing hair loss by fortifying and strengthening your existing hair and follicles.\n\nOur enriching formula includes aloe vera and seaweed extracts to deeply moisturize and heal your scalp while reducing hair thinning and shedding, and adding body, thickness, and volume to your hair. Pronexa DHT Blocker Shampoo also nourishes hair with vitamins and proteins, and it contains Biotin to help strengthen weak and brittle hair. Biotin is a B Vitamin that produces keratin, increases hair elasticity (minimizing breakage), and wraps your hair in a protective layer to prevent it from becoming brittle and weak. Biotin helps to induce growth of both your hair and new skin cells, making them healthy and vibrant. Ideal for all types of hair and the perfect choice for both men and women.\n\nClinical studies on hair loss have shown that the number one factor in hair loss is the production of dihydrotestosterone or DHT. DHT is a molecule inside of your body that's responsible for hair loss, so prohibiting the production of this hormone is key to preventing hair loss. Pronexa Biotin Shampoo contains Saw Palmetto and other powerful DHT blockers that help prevent DHT production. The result is that hair loss is stopped and hair growth and regrowth is thicker and healthier.\n\nFor the best results, use for at least 3 months with Pronexa Hair Loss Pills, Serum and Conditioner to stop hair loss, thicken hair, and see significant hair growth and regrowth. 100% money back guarantee! We want you to try and love our product risk free! If you do not see results from our product, send it back, and we will refund every penny of your purchase price.",
