I did a 3 day bike camping trip on Pine Creek in PA over the last weekend and it rained every day - heavily at times - with temperatures only in the mid 50's. The trail was saturated and camp was soaked but these socks kept my feet dry and warm for 3 days straight under a pair of open Keen cycling sandals. I can HIGHLY recommend them!",

They are a tight fit, perhaps because I have wider feet and in turn made my feet sore the first few times I wore them. However, they kept my feet dry and it made all the difference when working a 10 hour shift. I have also worn them hiking when it was pouring. They kept my feet fairly warm and once again, dry. These socks are waterproof not water resistant. When washing make sure you flip them inside out or the water will stay inside.",

If others have had better results I can only conclude that the product quality is very inconsistent. At nearly $40/pair these were a waste of money.",
