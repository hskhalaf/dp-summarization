I wouldn't want to sleep on, and wouldn't want to sleep on if I were a guest in a home. Loved the gray blue hue of the comforter and pillow shams. Are they durable? Yes.

The sheets I got for my mom's full-size bed are way too big; they are definitely queen sheets. My mom had already washed them before she realized that, so they're not in \"new and unused\" condition anymore, which means I can't return them. As for quality, I'd say they're comparable to similar bedding you can buy at a retail store, but there you'll know exactly what you're getting :-)",

The pillow cases fit my regular pillows fine, the comforter was larger than the bed space but that was okay with me, but the fitted sheet was much larger than expected even when I pulled the edges as far under the side of the bed as I could. It was fine the first nice but by the 3rd night, the sheets were pulled up and way too loose for me to not be annoyed. I probably won't be buying this again unless it came in the full size specifically, but for the price it's fine.",

The colors of the sheets are beautiful. It\u2019s lightweight but feels like it will be warm enough as well. I think it\u2019s more of an orangey coral than a pink coral, but that is fine with me. I wanted a peachy colored bed set and it\u2019s close enough and I think it\u2019s gorgeous. My bed is a full and this set is supposed to fit a full/queen. So it\u2019s a little bit big for my bed, but some strategic tucks and it fits just fine. My cats both love it.",

I am giving 4 stars because the only flaw was that there were little spot stains after the first wash on one of the sheets. They are small specks that look like oil stains. But for the price, it is still worth it. Would recommend for guest bedroom in any home. Pattern is very nice and modern too!",

I ordered the metallic grey one. In the ad, it appears as more on the brownish side. However it metallic grey. The design and quality are really good. It is easy to wash and dry. It fits my queen size mattress perfectly. The packaging was pretty good. The entire set comes packaged in a plastic case with a zipper. I would definitely recommend this product.",

I'm very impressed by how soft and sateen-like they are. The sheets held up great to their first wash/dry. I have not washed the comforter just yet. Overall - really happy with the quality of set just wished the simple navy had white sheets and white stripes instead of grey.",
