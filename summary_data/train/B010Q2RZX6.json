Give ur users something they want to use. Not things that you want them to use. Your hardwares are your major strengths, dont load them with useless software & bring urself disrepute.",

ZenUI is actually very good, definitely a significant improvement on stock android and very customisable; Lots of bloat on initial startup but it can all be either uninstalled or disabled. Needed to invest 30 mins in setting up properly. Feels like a premium device; feels a lot better than the plasticy Tab S2 to me. Getting about 6 hours screen-on time of continued web browsing. Overall unrivalled at this price. Battery life could be better but am happy with the trade off in terms of performance and slim design. Great stuff.",

Nice screen clarity, good battery and nice designed. Especially like the dual speakers which give a nice sound to my music. I mostly use it to read but having moved from a 7\" to an 8\" tablet I find it nice and light. Would recommend to those wanting a nice quality tablet at a reasonable price.",

Such a shame, in total i have 8 other devices all happy on the internet but this tablet just refused to stay connected. It will be going back unfortunately.",
