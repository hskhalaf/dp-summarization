The description of the item says 3 dozen, but the title says 1 dozen. My mistake for thinking $130 would be 3 dozen baseballs. The next issue is that that the balls themselves are 3mm smaller then a regulation ball. This was measured up to a Cal Ripken ball. Even if the price was correct or they could send me a replacement package with the 3 dozen balls I wouldn't keep these due to size any way.",

After a month of infield and BP twice a week in dry conditions they are still white and hardly show any wear (nothing major). They still pop off the bat like they did new. I've used the other major name brand for a while, and they were good, but they seemed to soften up a lot after about a month of heavy use. These balls keep on trucking. Very satisfied and have found my new practice balls from here on out.",

Flat seams and synthetic cover does not allow for a good grip and working on breaking pitches. I bought a dozen of Wilson 1030s for him to try and he really likes them. Pretty durable practice ball. (Note: Pitching is far less abusive to baseballs than hitting.) He really likes the way they feel. He caught a Rawlings Pro ball at a MLB game a couple years, he compares the feel to that. Will purchase more when these wear out.",
