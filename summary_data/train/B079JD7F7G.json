We thought the new router was defective so Amazon replaced it very promptly. Unfortunately the replacement performed exactly as the previous so we had to return it. Perhaps there was a comparability issue with the modem or other gear but we could not identify the problem even with the expert assistance of the T-Link hone techs.

So I know it is not our service that is being spotty, and it is not the wifi connection itself, but the router which is randomly failing to connect devices through to the internet. Even another router that is daisy chained via patch cable to this one. This has been happening over and over for several days. Wife restarted this router 5 times today. Have to replace. Good luck!",

However, with some elbow grease, and creating a linux VM to build the firmware on, I did get OpenWRT installed on this Archer A7 and put some very detailed instructions on how to do it on a GitHub pull request (1462). I think you would need to search for that so that this review isn't deleted. Very happy with the product now that I have OpenWRT installed.",

The main difference with this router is that you cannot name the two different bands (5G & 2.4) differently so if you have smart devices and other users connecting to the different bands, even if you name the new router the same as the old, some devices may have to be reconfigured.

The other important feature for me is that it is a 2 network router. It has a guest network with it's own password. This is useful for multiple users like roommates, etc. It has a lot of other features like Alexa compatibility, integrated USB port to act as Media Server, upgradable, and has app allowing easy management of network. It has good range and can reconfigured to add One Mesh extender for even more range. Best of all not ridiculously expensive.",
