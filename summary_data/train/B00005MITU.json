      "text": "5 stars! This is the best touch-tone landline desktop landline telephone that I have seen on the market in the past 18 years! I have now purchased at least four of these phones. It is well-designed, well-built, and best of all, it is robust enough and heavy enough that it sits in a stable fashion on a desktop or other surface. Even better, unlike so many of the competing models of desktop touch tone phones, this phone does NOT need any batteries, which are so common on other phones because they are needed to enable al sorts of stupid and unwanted bells and whistles to work. Great phone. Will be buying more.",

It's very convenient -- but did you know that if you lose power (or cell towers), you could be without any telephone service? It pays to have at least one corded phone hooked up directly to the lines to the phone company or the cable company, as I do. In case of an emergency, you have another option for staying in touch. This is a nice inexpensive phone that does the job!",

      "title": "AT&T TRIMLINE CLASSIC LANDLINE TELEPHONE (BLACK)",
      "text": "Our Florida house experiences tropical storm and hurricanes periodically. If the electricity goes out, I discovered that our landline cordless phones won\u2019t work due to the units needing electricity. As a result, I purchased a few landline phones that don\u2019t require electricity and will still work during a power outage. These AT&T TRIMLINE classic phones are great to use as a standby phone. I have them installed in my home office, laundry room, garage, and bathrooms. The only thing I didn\u2019t like was that they don\u2019t have Caller ID built in, but that\u2019s why it\u2019s a classic!",

Other than that, it is exactly what I need...the ringer can be turned off, it has a volume control, the number pad lights up...and most importantly, it works when the electrical power goes out. The cord also keeps it from being carried about the house and misplaced.",
