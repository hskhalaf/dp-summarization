I ordered the same size I always do, and while it hugs my feet a little tighter than my shoes typically would it's far more comfortable due to the foam padding the entire inside of the shoe. As far as looks go these shoes are awesome. Very versatile and can be worn anywhere from the gym to a more casual setting. I've gotten tons of compliments on them so far and absolutely love these shoes.",
