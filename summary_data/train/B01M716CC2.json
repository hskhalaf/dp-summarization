I emailed Braun three weeks ago and no response. I'm actually going to toss it in the trash as I don't have to spend many hours to go through the hassle of sending it in to get fixed...my time is very limited. Using my old reliable Norelco... I actually have tow of them, both over 10 years old! DO NOT BUY THIER PRODUCTS, THIER QUALITY IS NOT THERE, AND THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE NEEDS A LOT OF HELP.",

Actually, the entire shaver is too large. It's far too wide, which makes shaving around a beard awkward. Plus the balance is off -- it just feels badly weighted/balanced in the hand. Definitely not worth the outrageous amount of money they are getting for it. I prefer the older, less costly 7 series.",

It's true....it shaves wonderfully and I got a super close shave in half time I usually take! Quiet, light and precise.

      "text": "A close shaver. Comparing my Norelco to the Braun, the Norelco felt smoother to my face when shaving. The Braun cleaner/recharger is a bit over engineered. Cleaning the shaver can be achieved by simply removing the head from the body and running both parts through hot water, allowing them to dry then oilying the head with Braun oil. I recommend just buying the shaver without the cleaning device.",
