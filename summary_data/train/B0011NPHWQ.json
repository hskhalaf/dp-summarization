      "title": "Great system",
      "text": "The system set-up is straight forward and the speakers' adjustable stands/wall mounts are excellent. The subwoofer is truly outstanding and I did not have any trouble balancing the system's sound. I would recommend a receiver with an adjustable frequency crossover for the main speakers and the subwoofer as this system lacks that. My receiver is several years old and does not have that feature, but I was able to balance the sound by moving the subwoofer around. A new receiver is in my plans anyway. The sound is excellent with highly detailed highs, wide dispersion, clear midrange and very good bass. They are attractive and unobtrusive in my room. I highly recommend them!",

      "text": "This is a full 5.1 channel home theater system with very clean and full sound. The subwoofer is self-powered and fills the room with plenty of bass. The very interesting Uni-Q driver with \"tangerine\" wave guide provides a seamless sound from satellite to satellite. These sound great with my Yamaha RX-A820. I am considering buying two more of the satellites in order to move the system up to the 7.1 sound. These satellites are a little larger than most satellites, more along the lines of a small bookshelf. They are beautifully constructed of high-quality materials. Glad I purchased through Amazon.com, which is a KEF certified dealer, at a low price of $1199.",

When it went on as a lightning deal I didn't hesitate to pick it up and have been totally thrilled with it since its purchase. As you've probably read, opening up the beautifully packaged speakers is part of the fun. They are an amazing looking and sounding system. I listen to music and watch movies through them and love every minute of it! If your serious about getting a great surround sound system do not go any farther, you found it. If I had heard these speakers before I bought them, they would have been purchased long ago.",

They're really wonderful looking speakers with a sound that belies their small size. They fill a medium sized room with great sound and the subwoofer is just seamless and is paired wonderfully. I'd definitely recommend picking up a set and checking them out yourself. I didn't buy these on Amazon.com though as they're priced at $1,750 as of the day I'm writing this review. I picked mine up back in November '09 for about $1,100 at a different website. Definitely worth the price and they're good-looking to match.",

    "description": "The KEF KHT3005 (SE) 5.1 home theater speaker system is an extremely high performance, yet room-friendly home theater system, which raises both the design and performance benchmarks in the category of elegant home theater speaker packages. KEF's patented \"sit anywhere\" Uni-Q driver configuration places the tweeter in the acoustic center of the bass/midrange cone. This creates a single focused audio source that disperses the sound image evenly throughout the room so that everyone enjoys the full richness of music or movie soundtracks. The Uni-Q array in the 3000 series has a completely new design which performs better than ever. Instead of having identical center and satellite speakers like other systems, KEF's created a stunning new dedicated center channel that gives dialogue more weight and clarity delivering cinema-like frontal impact. KEF also added a radical new high performance powered subwoofer. As a system, it certainly puts the 'live' into living room.",
