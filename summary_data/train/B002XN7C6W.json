For the price, it delivers a great picture and sound quality, but the auto focus kills it. You can turn off the auto focus feature, but you do not get crisp video every time.

Since I have a windows/linux dual boot and mostly use linux, setting autozoom off is a bit harder. Otherwise the hardware itself, the colors and resolution etc are pretty great for the price.",

I will just be sitting completely still while the picture focuses and unfocuses for no discernible reason.The stand/clip thing works quite well on my flatscreen monitor, but it was difficult to use on a laptop, and I am not sure how well it will do on an older, larger monitor.",

However, autofocus feature is annoying and gets activated too often. Would be good if there is a way to turn it off or make it autofocus less often. It would annoy others who are doing a video chat with you or other solution is to keep still when you chat ;)",
