It's flimsy, and due to the length and location of the handles, tips in either direction depending on where the baby is positioned. Maybe if you were just going to lay the baby in the basket and that's it, then fine, or if it's just for decoration purposes like literally just a basket to hold other gifts, okay. If you actually wanted to carry a baby in it - no go. Also while the liner for the sided of the basket is surprisingly nice, the pad at the bottom is meh -just flimsy foam.",
