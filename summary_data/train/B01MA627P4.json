This one sounded much better than the Planet Audio. I gave up on 8 inch subs and went with a Kicker 12 inch. BIG sound difference. Spend the extra money on a 12 inch. There's not a big price difference and the space savings are almost non existent.",

Only issue I have is the mild steel stamped frame. Both speakers I ordered had small bends in the mounting flange, which I was able bend back into shape with my fingers. However, once mounted, no problem. This speaker is a great value, IMHO.",
