      "text": "I decided to upgrade my modem from the sb6183. I was getting avg 452 Mbps. My service is for 600Mbps. That is close to max output for sb6183. I figured this modem would give same performance and not work as hard. Setup was easy, up and running in 10mins . While speed tests were 552 Mbps, watching Apple tv or Disney plus, the stream would pixelate and lag. Restarted twice and waited a couple of days. Same issue. The sb6183 ran everything smoother. I'm debating on returning it and going back to my sb6183 or getting the motorola mb8600.",

Sure there are faster modems out there, but we wanted the reliability and support that Motorola offers. We would definitely recommend this product and would buy it again. Pros: -Fast. -Reliable -Solid support system Cons: -Upload speed isn't as fast as the competitors -Setup was also not very easy and required a bunch of tinkering between the router and our internet provider.",
