      "text": "I bought this for a knife of my grandfathers that I have cleaned up. It's original case was shot, and I was looking for an inexpensive sheath that would fit the knife. The case fits up to 1 1/4 in. blade width and mine is one 1 in. so there is a tad of play, but nothing really noticeable. I am a rancher and cowboy so I know good leather when I see it, and this is decent. My suggestion is first thing, soak it in neatsfoot oil, then place your knife in and latch it. Over all I'm happy with it and I would say good bang for your buck. P.s. wife's account.",

One reviewer said they'd applied neatsfoot oil to theirs, and this seemed like a good idea so I did the same. The strap that goes around the handle was pretty tight at first - actually a little too tight - but it stretched out to perfect in a few days. I also hammered a couple of the rivets down a little flatter. I have zero complaints about this sheath, and don't know how it could possibly be made and sold for this price.",

Construction is solid with both stitching and rivets holding it together and that makes it easy to modify if you have an unusual knife size as I do. I cut off the tip right after the 3rd rivet, sanded down the ends to make it look presentable, and then seared it with hot metal to darken and seal the leather. You can't tell I did anything to it unless you are inspecting it and the mod took me less than 20 minutes to do. If I ever need to replace a sheath again this will be my first stop.",

The snap is large enough though stiff as expected and Will be coating the sheath and buffing this with Kiwi clear leather polish.
