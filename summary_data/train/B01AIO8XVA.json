Unacceptable. I have a pair of the K240s at home that I have had for close to two years with no problems.",

No snobby, quasi-technical complaints here. I got these at an open box discount and love them. I listen first thing in the morning to get my spirits up and to look forward to a hope-filled great day!

After letting go, the sound was gone again. Evidently there is a short somewhere in the headphones. A replacement pair is being sent so hopefully they will last longer.

My taste in music has actually changed because of the sound quality. The only downside is that they clamp on my ears a little harder than I'm used to and my jaw eventually gets a little tired pushing back. Not a big deal, and totally worth the sound quality.",

So i didn't let that expierence ruin what I thought about akg. I took a chance purchasing these, and let me tell you I was wrong. One side of the headphones was louder than the other, right out of the box. Very similar to what I expierenced with the k52s, this will be my last time buying from Akg. Invest on some other headphones, just not these .",

I found I also had to increase the output volume on my Mac when I use these headphones. Not happy, will on sell second hand.",
