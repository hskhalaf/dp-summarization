I needed something that I could focus from a greater length and this was it. I ordered a 70-200mm from Canon and it was just too heavy. I don't regret getting a Tamron instead of a Canon at all. The lens is solid and built just as well. I used it for the first time last week at a church fair outdoors. It was amazing. Picture quality was awesome. I never had to switch lens and it felt amazing!",

I highly recommend this lens for anyone needing the reach of the 300mm zoom and don't have a lot of money to spend. This is a steal at the price and you are getting a good quality lens.

Nice thick lens hood comes in the box. Only down side is no VC (IS in Canon lens)so I am always shooting 1/200 sec and up when hand held which can be limiting, but what can you expect for 130.00?

It \"does what it says on the tin\", even though it is easy to note that the picture can be a little soft, there is quite marked CA, and the autofocus labors somewhat. Construction seems solid enough, and with the included hood I would say that this does give a good value (although I haven't had the chance to compare it with the similar offerings from Sigma and Canon).",

It is NOT an IS lens so low light shots or tight zoom photography defininitely requires a tripod. Very good results in bright daylight but if you don't have a rock solid steady hand you might want to consider an IS lens.",

      "text": "I'm brand new to the photography but I am hooked! After getting my XSi from my husband for Christmas the natural next step was to buy lens. It's hard to afford the lens's direct from Canon so after monitoring several forums I decided this was the next best step. The reviews on here finally sold me and I pulled the trigger.Boy am I glad I did! I use this lens all the time in my travel and it's especially come in handy at places like Zoos, Parks, and other outside venues. I would certainly recommend this lens to anyone. It makes my rookie photo skills look professional :)",

Twice as expensive but a very nice lens. To date I snapped around 1K pictures and I am very satisfied with it. VC stands for vibration compensation and it truly works.",

Though a little soft, it gives me a useable image from the distance I need, and I've had some fun with the macro function on the side. Make no mistake, though; without image stabilization, this lens will be all but useless without a tripod, or at least a monopod. I wouldn't take this thing out with expectations of making it into National Geographic with my shots, but it's great for hobbyists and personal use. Can't be beat for the price range.",

    "description": "Style:Canon| Product Packaging:Standard PackagingTamron Auto Focus 70-300mm f/4.0-5.6 Di LD Macro Zoom Lens for Canon Digital SLR Cameras (Model A17E)\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nDesigned for optimum handling ease and portability (it weighs only 458g <16.2oz.> ), it\u2019s ideal for handheld shooting with full-frame and APS-C format SLRs. Its unsurpassed close-focusing ability (down to 0.95m (3.1 feet ) or 1:2 in macro mode) makes it perfect for nature and portrait photography. \n\n\n\nZoom in to 300mm from a distance \n\nAF 70-300mm f/4.0-5.6 Di LD Macro Zoom Lens Features \n\n\n\n\nLow Dispersion (LD) Glass for Greater Lens Sharpness \n\nLow dispersion (LD) glass elements in a lens help reduce chromatic aberration; the tendency of light of different colors to come to different points of focus at the image plane. Chromatic aberration reduces the sharpness of an image, but glass with an extremely low dispersion index, has less of a tendency to separate (defract) a ray of light into a rainbow of colors. This characteristic allows the lens designer to effectively compensate for chromatic aberration at the center of the field (on axis), a particular problem at long focal lengths (the telephoto end of the zoom range), and for lateral chromatic aberration (towards the edges of the field) that often occurs at short focal lengths (the wide-angle end of the zoom range.)\" \n *",
