It has a firm bail and the collapsible handle is a really cool feature. Before I realized you could lock it I was skeptical but it\u2019s very easy to lock and it\u2019s just an all around good reel. I would defiantly refer this to a friend.",

Got the 5000 for the bigger fish and landed a few stripers no problem. The drag is very smooth and took some time to bring in the 33\u201d striper. Seems to be holding up to salt water so far. I do recommend doing a light rinse after every session.",
