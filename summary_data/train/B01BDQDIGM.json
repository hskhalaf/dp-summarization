Just buy high quality, Arm and Hammer scented drawstring garbage bags, tighten the drawstring, and feed it into the refill ring and secure it.

(We\u2019ve used a diaper genie and the older style munchkin pail in the past.) I have 2 babies in diapers and I have to change the bag almost daily. Seeing the large size of the diaper pail I expected it to hold more than it does. Now we\u2019ve had it for almost a year and it doesn\u2019t twist the bag shut anymore when you close the lid, so it doesn\u2019t really enclose the smell. It also makes an awful cranking noise whenever you open or close the lid. Disappointed in the quality of this product.",

This helps with smell (because the opening is small) but it make you get poop on your hands or on the garbage sack when you have a full diaper...not a pleasant experience. Very good containing smell.",
