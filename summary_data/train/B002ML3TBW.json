I tried using different primers & even different amounts of the mineral powder when applying, but nothing changed the way it set after a few hours. I\u2019m sad, because this is the first mineral powder that actually covered well!! I\u2019ve tried bare minerals matte and honestly hated it. It didn\u2019t cover ANYTHING for me, no matter how much I used (& even when I used concealer underneath).",
