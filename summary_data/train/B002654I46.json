As an amateur detailer, I watched a few chemical guys you tube videos, followed the instructions and I was off to the races. My 2010 Toyota with 275K miles looks brand new. It made quick work of everything, my boat, car, SUV. A word of caution is make sure you have the appropriate pads and compound. For my car with heavy swirl marks and oxidation I went claybar, med cut and then heavy cut for the tougher areas then polished and then waxed. If you're detailing your own boats and vehicles this is well worth the $.",

I do not have the money to pay some one $450.00 plus to clean my motor home, so I took a chance and purchased my buffer and man I was glad I did. It is so easy and lite to use. I am now half way done polishing a 40' motor home and it looks great. I am using Chemical's from the Chemical Guys line of products as well as Meguiar's 105 & 205 compounds topping it with Meguiars Hi-Tech Wax #26. You should see it",

Do not buy this item if you are going to cut (buff out scratches) or polish your car; you will not be able to set speed ranges recommended by product for each step.

In my opinion, the ergonomics of the 7424XP are somewhat better than the previous model. This model is as well made as the previous model.

The 12 speed settings (1-6 at 1/2 increments) make this polisher so dynamic and great for any project. With the right product & pad combination, almost any paint defect can be removed. I highly recommend the PC7424xp to anyone who is looking for a high quality dual-action polisher.

Easily held and manuvers over the ridges, grooves and other body lines with no problem and again with no fear of burning the paint. So nice for getting down low by the quarter panels and rocker panels and around the bumpers, chrome or plastic it doesn't matter.
