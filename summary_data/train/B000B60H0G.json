It would pause and resume fine so long as it didn't go to the screensaver. If you did you had to power off and back on. It also often gets stuck at the menu when first loading a disk. Again you would have to power it off to resume. It is also somewhat limited in its app capabilities. It has lately been making funny noises which interferes with quiet scenes. I have since relegated it to the sitting room and purchased an xbox one for my theater.",

You begin to watch your movie and it just stops. You take out the disc - clean - return in to the player and the player fails to remember where you left off. This is a feature that has been part of DVD players - much less blu-ray players - for over a decade. Last Samsung product for me - if they can't get a simple blu-ray player right - what else do they mess up??",

The last 4-5 times I have played DVDs in it, it constantly stutters, skips, and I also get some occasional pixelation during play. I have updated the firmware once, and I will try a second firmware update. If the last update does not cure the problem, I am going to purchase a new player. Quite disapointing for a relatively simple product. The very first DVD player I have ever had any problems with, and I also have a Samsung BD C5900 that seems to work well. EDIT: Updated firmware but still stutters, skips, etc. Replaced with a new Blu-ray player. Terrible product.",

Cons -For some reason, the blu-ray player only seems to turn on when my samsung TV is on. Similarly, turning on the player automatically turns on the TV. -This player doesn't come with built-in wifi and wireless LAN adapter. -No HDMI cable is included. -Initial setup went ok, though the manual wasn't particularly helpful.",

Hopefully, Samsung will come out with a firmware upgrade to address this issue. The only other minor issue is the amount of noise the heads make when a disc is first inserted.

The unit streams very well, I can only assume the people that complain it does not have spotty internet connections. Buy this item with complete confidence!!",

In contacting Samsung, they confirmed this is not an option on this model and offered no explaination or solution in sight. If this function is not an issue for you, then go for it. Otherwise, look for another purchase option. I'm waiting to hear back from Vanns to see if they will take it back in exchange for another model...",
