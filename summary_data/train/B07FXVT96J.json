      "text": "We have a \"taco bar\" once a week. With shredded. cheese, onions, cilantro, diced tomatoes and taco sauce as add-ons, building the perfect taco takes time and can be frustrating when trying to hold the taco open and/or keep it from falling over and spilling the contents. These taco stands are like an extra hand that holds your tacos. Now you can focus on building the perfect taco instead of managing the spillage. Plus, they hold them upright on your place while eating. These stands are also dishwasher safe and stack neatly in a cupboard. I highly recommend these to anyone who enjoys tacos and wants to up their game.",

These holders are not artsy or fashionable, but they serve a specific purpose and will look great doing so. They're sturdy and large and I imagine they'll last for the rest of my life (which ideally is another 40 years or about 2000 taco Tuesdays, or 6000 tacos!)",
