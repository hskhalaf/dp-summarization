For someone who goes through these \"micro eyebrow pencils\" a little fast (losing them, breaking the tips off, etc.), they're great and much gentler on the pocket book than the higher end brands. They are a different set of shades than the other brands, so make sure you have tested them out or understand that NYX taupe isn't going to be the same as the Anastasia taupe. These have more neutral tones than Anastasia. If you haven't tried this line before, I would suggest you give it a go. It's relatively inexpensive, so it may be worth it to buy a few similar shades and see what works best for you.",

I looked up swatches of the different colors to pick the right one for me, usually its a safe bet to go a shade or two lighter than your hair color, and this worked out perfectly. The pencil may not be super fine tip because its a wind up, but I think its definite sufficient and so much less waste than a traditional wood one. Much faster to apply than powder and eliminates the need for brow wax, in my opinion. The spooly on the opposite end makes this super convenient for travel as well.",

      "text": "I\u2019ve really liked my brow pencil! I bought a more expensive one later and this one has outlasted that one by FAR because in that one most of it broke off and basically got wasted! So this one stays in place and doesn\u2019t roll up too much product ! Fine line although wish it could sharpen some as it comes out.... after you use the tip does get slightly rounded therefore you lose some of the fine line definition. Just a suggestion that I\u2019d find valuable as a customer if a company did that . But overall I love it .",

It doesn\u2019t itch like other eyebrow products make me itch and it doesn\u2019t wear away during the day. The color is naturally and the pencil is thin enough that i can make hair strokes. I would suggest using a face primer first and then putting this on as it will provide more grip and darker color.",

This very thin pencil is light, so it is incredibly easy to hold between your fingers and move around. The brush too is fine and can remove or blend without encroaching into other areas. Good staying power, and no smudging. Always put the cap back on to prevent tip from drying out even if it doesn't dry out easily. Highly recommended!",
