It's now my go-to hand saw that cuts as quickly as setting up and using an electric saw. Making accurate cuts are not easy for the novice. It takes some getting used to. Time will tell.",

I'm knocking off two stars because it doesn't come with something as simple as a blade guard. They couldn't have included a thin rubber tube split down the middle to 1) keep the blade sharp when not in use (if it's not being hung while stored) and 2) prevent owners from cutting themselves before and after use?

Easy to handle, and VERY sharp. Still razor sharp after completing my project, I expect this to last quite a while before dulling.",
