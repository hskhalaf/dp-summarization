I spend a lot of time traveling and in hotels in the state of Colorado. This product has helped with slight to moderate dry throat and dry noses. This product starts working the second you plug it in. Also as a bonus the company emailed a letter to let the buyer know how to use and what bottles are compatible, then a few days later they send another email to see if you still like the product and how it's working for you.",

I live in Singapore and it's easy to find a bottle to fit this due to the adaptor they provided with the humidifier. Edit: My bottle adaptor broke due to my carelessness of over tightening the bottle nozzle but thanks to their 10/10 customer support, I was able to replace it. I must say, Fancii has one of the best customer supports ever, they reply fast and are very helpful:).",

Not a huge deal if you're not traveling with it, but the portability of it is kind of pointless in scenarios where being run on batteries is more needed than plugging in. When it works, it's great, but there are random time it'll make a high-pitched screeching sound (obviously not appreciated when this happens in the middle of the night). But then turning it off and turning it back on usually resolves the issue. Wish I could give it 5 stars, but it's not consistently great.",

Also, it emits a rather bright light when powered on that is really annoying when you\u2019re trying to sleep. Also, no matter what kind of water bottle I put in it, they always made annoying crinkly sounds as the water was pulled out of them. Bottom line: If you\u2019re looking for a humidifier that actually makes a difference you can find something much more effective for the same price - don\u2019t waste your $ on this like I did.",

I can just buy a bottle of Evian at the airport instead of carrying one in my luggage. It has a USB cord and it can be plugged into a laptop while I am working. It can also run on 3 AAA batteries. Cons - The plastic has a very strong smell and it hasn't gone away after 6 months. The lid for the battery compartment is kind of loose. Haven't used it much since I bought it, so I can't speak to its durability.",
