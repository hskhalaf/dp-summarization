      "text": "Decent socks for the price. They don't compare to Smartwool, but if you're on a budget and can't afford $20 per pair of socks, these are a good alternative. I bought them for a trip to Iceland in the summer. They were a little on the warm side as they are midweight, not lightweight. I'm sure they will come in handy when I visit family up north in the snow. The socks themselves didn't smell after wearing them all day, but my feet sure did! You've been warned ;)",

I purchased a 3-pack of Meriwool socks in preparation for a trip to Alaska and I could not be more impressed. The Meriwool socks are much thicker, softer, warmer, and overall more comfortable than the Kirkland brand. I plan on doing some serious lounging with these socks this winter. Unlike some other reviewers, I found the quality to be outstanding. My Alaskan brother in law liked them so much that I ordered a 3-pack for him too.",

I noticed that my socks shrunk a little in the dryer (still fit) but like all mostly wool products you have to be careful drying at too high a heat and shrinking the product.",

Sure, I know you can air dry them and they probably won't shrink - but really? They're socks. I don't need washing / drying complications for something as basic as socks.
