      "text": "This worked great to replace a 3 light candelabra light with a 4 light medium base light kit. Unfortunately Hunter seems to want to put the candelabra base lamps with many of their fans and quite frankly the light output from a candelabra bulb is probalby 60% of a medium base so it's just too dark. Another downside to having to buy this is I pretty much doubled the cost of the fan versus if this were included with the fan to begin with instead of the candelabra fixture. But as far as this kit goes, it worked great, easy to replace and matches perfectly.",

The biggest downside is the mounting screws are too short and don\u2019t align with the holes in the housing covers. I have one in and will drill the other (and probably get longer screws). This has been pointed out in other reviews so it must be a common issue.",

I was getting ready to return it after my boyfriend said it wouldn't work, when I decided I should take a look at it and ACTUALLY READ THE INSTRUCTIONS! Sure enough, I figured it out. I dont know what men have against instruction, ego? Curious. Personally I would think failure and being out started by a woman in installation, would be more of a boon to the male ego, but apparently not. The lights look fantastic and now we have more than enough light in the kitchen.",
