That way when I am walking 36 holes in a day, I can connect my portable charger to my phone and keep going. Other than that, I am really happy with this cart. My buddy turned around and bought one days later and another friend just ordered his. Great buy!!!",

I especially appreciate the phone holder, which seems very secure, yet keeps your phone handy and usable. Once you get the hang of it, cart folds and unfolds extremely quickly. Cart is stable enough to let it roll down even steeper hills without tipping over. Walked 3 rounds so far - will update regarding durability at a later date, but for now am extremely pleased with my purchase.",
