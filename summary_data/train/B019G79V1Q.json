The feature that I especially like is that the alarm rings for less than a minute and shuts off by itself. Thus, my mother does not struggle trying to find a button to push. This company pretty much thought of everything. Well worth the money!!",

It is rather inconvenient to have to plug it in to AC power. I ordered \"wood\" color and received RED. What a surprise. My parents didn't really care, so I kept it. I don't know if the wrong one was shipped, or there was a problem with the way it was labeled, but it wasn't \"wood\" colored. I checked my order on Amazon and I ordered the right one. My husband wants one now and I probably will order another, but I will be cautious about my color and hope it isn't red.",

The much more useful Month and Date of the month are in much smaller type at the very bottom of the display. The clock already shows AM and PM beside the time in the 12 hour mode and a 24 hour mode does not need any more information displayed.",

I bought a new clock a few days ago that is fantastic, so I\u2019m throwing this one away.",

      "text": "This model has one major flaw. It must be placed where you can easily access the back of the clock. After even a few-second power outage it automatically switches to a less informative mode that does not show the time--it shows something like \"It is now morning\". That can only be reset by pushing the \"OK\" button on the back of the clock. We live in an area where the power drops frequently, so I find myself having to change the mode on this clock too often. The clock has battery backup so I'm not sure why they felt this feature was necessary, but I don't like it.",
