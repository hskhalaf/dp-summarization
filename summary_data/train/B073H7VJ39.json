From the moment I opened the box, I knew something was different. Yes, I noticed the regular paper smell, but I felt there was something bigger going on here and it sent a chill of excitement down my spine. I actually think my printer sang, when I opened a ream and placed it in the paper cartridge. Seriously, every day has been a bit better, since I purchased this Amazon paper. I encourage you to get your own and see for yourself. You will not be disappointed.",
