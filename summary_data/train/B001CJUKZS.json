Works best when the exhaust is switched off, and it 's like standing under a blow dryer (8ft ceilings). By the time I brush/floss/rinse my hair is nearly dry.

There is plenty of space to have designed in a bigger box. -The heat fan shoots straight down, seems like it could be designed to distribute the heat better. One other subtle thing to note, I wish I would have oriented the fan 90 degrees differently. You can see the guts through the fins from the entrance of the bathroom. Kind of like if you put a vent cover on upside down.",

The one thing other reviews mentioned is the tight wire install. There is an easy fix. Leave enough wire past the box. Pull the wire box out of the fan make your connections and then slide back up into fan and then pull excess back out the side and secure it.",

The heater takes a few minutes to warm up and when it does, the fan kicks on to blow hot air. 3. The vent fan is noisy compared to the fan I replaced which cost much less. 4.

It pumps out enough warm air to make the small room quite toasty, and the fan is powerful enough to recirculate air all the way to the floor. Installation wasn't fast, but it was pretty easy. I definitely recommend having a helper when installing this fan because it is bigger and heavier than most devices you'll be removing. It is sized perfectly to fit between two standard joists, so you'll only need to enlarge your drywall opening in order to make it fit.",

Perhaps the short run contributes to the noise level. I found one very annoying problem with the unit. One of the cfl bulbs flicker when the light is off. From what I read on the Internet it is my lighted switches that are the culprit. Amazingly, panasonic has never heard of any issues. I will probably switch to LEDs to eliminate the flicker.",

      "text": "I have not had this fan/heater almost two years. It works SO well and I love the features (fan, heat, nightlight, light). One of the lights did burn out, but I bought a generic replacement set of 3 on Amazon and it works great. Fan is quieter and works so much better than other fans I have. Would highly recommend this unit and would definitely purchase again if I was remodeling another bath. The heat function is great in the bathroom (if you have a shower in there) in the winter when the house is cool (which I don't mind) but you don't want to be wet and naked and cold as you step out of the shower.",

This also has an exhaust fan so it clears out the humidity during the warmer months. This installed in the same spot as the noisy and cheap builder grade exhaust fan. Since this requires a 20 amp connections (I think) I had to have an electrician install it. These beat space heaters and is much safer. Brownie points with my wife as well.",

The larger bathroom that is 7' x 12' gets no moisture on the mirrors at all if used with both the fan and heater and the same time, and has helped to eliminate the mold problem I used to contend with. I use them with digital timers, which helps keep power usage reasonable by eliminating the machine from running longer than necessary.",

    "description": "Style:FanFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nPanasonic WhisperWarm Ceiling Mounted Fan/Heat Combinations are smaller, quieter, warmer, and easier to install. A tubular, stainless-steel-sheathed heating element features Nichrome wire with magnesium oxide for optimal heat transfer and electrical insulation at elevated temperatures. The Panasonic FV-11VH2 WhisperWarm 110 CFM heater/fan has a totally enclosed condenser motor and a large, double suction blower wheel to quietly move air. The blower wheel is designed to draw air in from both sides allowing more area for the air to enter the wheel. Panasonic fans are quiet enough that you might not even know they're on. With a .6 sone level and rated 110 cubic feet per minute, this fan is designed to give you continuous, trouble-free operation for many years due to its high-quality components and permanently lubricated motors which wear at a slower pace. We designed the electrical configuration of this model's condenser motor to allow it to operate at lower temperatures, increasing the life of the motor and bearings. And, the fan housing is made of heavy-gauge zinc galvanized steel and painted to protect it from rust. This fan has a built-in damper to prevent back draft, which helps to prevent outside air from coming through the fan. The Panasonic FV-11VH2 WhisperWarm 110 CFM Ceiling Mounted Fan/Heat Combination is covered by a manufacturer warranty for period of three years from the date of the original purchase and is sold one item per package.
