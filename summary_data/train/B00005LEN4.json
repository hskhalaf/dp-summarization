I appreciate the extra light in the viewfinder and the almost \"feather-weight\" build. This lens does help make my D200 much easier to carry as a \"Walk-around\" camera. Of course I do sometimes miss the flexibility of a zoom lens, but I don't miss the weight gain from a zoom. Using a prime lens does make you think about the shot! I love my 50mm f1.8!",

I have only used it very briefly so far, but have gotten some amazing photos with it. I usually do landscape and wildlife photography, but have been getting into doing studio/portrait photography recently and this lens fits that bill perfectly. With a tripod and gentle manual focusing, I have been able to take some pretty decent test photos so far. I cannot wait until I have my backdrop set up and am able to take some true portraits with it. I have no doubt they will turn out quite well.",

Bottom line for me was the great reviews and the fantastic price for a low light lens that provided very sharp images. I wasn't disappointed. The lens is light weight and does as reviewers previously reported. You can't go wrong with this lens and the price you pay for the value you receive is unbeatable!!",
