I mainly used it to try and get rid of acne scars on my face and while it seems like it works, after a few days of use the area I applied it to breaks out. This of course then causes more acne scars, so to be frank, I actually think this gave me more scars than it got rid of.",

    "title": "Mederma PM Intensive Overnight Scar Cream - Works with Skin's Nighttime Regenerative Activity - Once-Nightly Application is Clinically Shown to Make Scars Smaller & Less Visible - 1 Ounce",
    "description": "Size:1 OunceTonight is the night change can begin, with Mederma pm intensive overnight scar cream. It's the first and only overnight scar cream specifically formulated to work while you sleep. During sleep our bodies work harder to reverse the skin damage caused during the day, repairing and regenerating skin cells at a faster rate. Mederma pm intensive overnight scar cream is formulated to complement this nighttime activity with tripeptol, a skin-nourishing complex with peptides, collagen and antioxidants to promote healthy looking skin and help your skin fight free radical damage. Once-nightly application is clinically shown to make scars smaller and less visible and can begin to bring noticeable results in as little as 14 nights. Now, the last thing you think about at night makes your scar the last thing you think about during the day. You can safely use Mederma PM with other cosmetic products like lotions and makeup. Please consult your healthcare professional before using Mederma PM with other topical (on the skin) products that you purchase with a prescription.",

      "safety warning: For external use only. When using this product do not get into eyes. Stop use and ask a doctor if condition worsens or symptoms last more than 7 days or clear up and occur again within a few days. Do not use on deep puncture wounds, animal bites, and serious burns. Keep out of reach of children. If swallowed, get medical help or contact a Poison Control Center right away.",
      "directions: Mederma PM Intensive Overnight Scar Cream should be evenly applied and gently massaged into the scar once nightly until fully absorbed for 8 weeks on newer scars and 3-6 months on older scars. Begin using Mederma PM as soon as new skin has formed, typically two or more weeks after the injury or surgery. Make sure the scab has come off naturally and any stitches have been removed. On older scars you may start using Mederma immediately. Do not apply to broken skin."
