The best way to avoid roll back issues, is to let it rewind back to the unit slow, holding slight tension on the hose until it gets fully rewound. It may also be best, not to fully extend the hose, leaving a few feet remaining on the reel.",

It will randomly retract your hose when you think you had stopped it at your desired length.

One is leaking from within the reel mechanism and yesterday with a second unit the threaded end of the hose blew off while watering with the nozzle. Just FYI, I have a new pressure valve on my house and installed three of these so that I wouldn\u2019t have to exert undue stress on each of the hoses. I was planning haven\u2019t these for years to come. I took great care using them. Maybe just poorly made??? I would love to hear from amazon or manufacturer. I\u2019ll update S needed.",

Really happy with it use it with a pressure washer fed off a garden hose pump drawing filtrated water and it has no problem with 40-60 psi.",

When this thing fills with water, it weights a tons and will come off the wall right out. BTW, remember to let it coil with the faucet open to allow water to drain and ease the internal tension.",

The latest, it flat out refuses to reel in the last 6 to 10 feet of the hose. I live in a new community with a lot of new homeowners, I am probably not recommending this to my neighbor.",

Never did see any marking or tape. It took about 15 minutes but I did manage to get it to retract in. Now 2 months later my wife pulled the hose out and again it is all the way out and I can't get it to retract. I have not even taken the 2nd one out of the box yet.
