The finest in Lenox quality, translucent china with wonderful detail and colors. A charming set rimmed in gold will add to your holiday delight. Do not hesitate to purchase this. Although others have said you can place this in the dishwasher, I don't do this,I always hand wash and dry. Why; because it brings women and men together to \"be in one place, working together, and enjoying each other's company\". Just like the \"old days\"...we so frequently forget how to connect with one another.",
