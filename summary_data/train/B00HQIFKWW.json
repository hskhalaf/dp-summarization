But, once I changed the case, I've had no problems ever since. It's really amazing to see all your daily info; how many steps you take, how much social media you use, how many calories you burn and, for me, how well you sleep. There are tons of features with the Lifelog app and my only wish is that they could make the data you store in the app able to be exported and saved on your PC. Hopefully that will come soon.",

Thankfully, I can rely on this to vibrate for every single notification I receive. It's step counter counts steps even when I'm sitting down, but even the most expensive smart and can't be 100% accurate. The battery lasts just over 2 days on a 30 minute charge, AMAZING! I'm rating this 5 stars because it does exactly what I bought it for, while also having a few extra features.",

They track everything we need them too through sony's lifelog app. Battery life is really good it last about 4 days.

Great thing its very lightweight you'll forget that you're even wearing this band. Rest all features are good. It serves all feature for which it is meant for. Only -ve point from my perspective of this band is it supports only Android not iOS (iPhone/iPad/iPod). Overall great product by Sony. You can purchase it.",

It not only graphs your sleep hours - it shows the time periods you were in deep sleep. Pretty interesting. And, it alerts you when you've distanced yourself from your phone, so you pick it up before it's lost or stolen. For someone like me who only wants to track sleep and exercise it's very nice and all you need.",

FYI.. this new Lifelog update only works with Xperia devices. Since this is the first time I'm using a fitness/Smartband tracker, I really can't give a comparison with other fitness bands (Fitbit, Fuel Band, etc.)",

      "text": "Always looking forward to a purchase of a Sony product. Sony wrote the book on top of the line. This falls way short. When it works this is a wonderful product, and I don't have a Sony phone so maybe this works better with them but I do have one that meets the spec Notification works sometimes., sleep mode wake up doesn't work. but the most annoying is it is constantly disconnecting three to four times a day. Very annoying and it doesn't reconnect itself I have to go in and figure it out sometimes it's a quick fix other times it's almost a guessing game. Trying to like it but it's not worth the hassle.",

      "text": "I have already stopped using this. The app is not the greatest, and the tracking part was spotty at best. I have used the FitBit Force, Sony Smartband, and now the Jawbone UP24. Worst = Sony, Best = Jawbone. This unit is really designed tyo be used with a Sony phone, and mainly for tracking what you do with the phone (logs your internet time, time in email, time in games, etc). Not what I was looking for. Initial bluetooth setup with Galaxy S4 was a pain also. Don't follow their directions, goggle how to and there are better ways. Connection gets lost. Just trying to save you (and others) some money. Good luck",

      "text": "Not accurate software. To let the SmartBand knows, you have to push the button. If you leave it on a desk whole nite, it will tell you you slept whole nite in deep sleep, which is so ridiculous. For instance, this morning, I did not turn it on to day mode, and I started running. It shows that I am sleeping during my running time. It does not measure your pulse and does not calculate based on that. It is not necessary to purchase it. You can also do exact same thing as free. Just download an app like map my run, or any other apps. Those are works better.",

    "description": "LOG YOUR DAY. EVERY DAY. INTRODUCING THE SONY SMARTBAND SWR10 LIFE LOGGING ACCESSORY WITH NOTIFICATION ALERT AND MUSIC REMOTE\nSony\u2019s SmartWear lets you stay on top of things that matter. It interacts with your Smartphone or tablet and lets you see your life as you live it. The SmartBand is an innovative life logging wrist band that enables you to keep track of everything you do \u2013 your movements, your communications and your entertainment. Wearable technology for wherever you go, around the clock. Log special moments and watch your life played back to you on your Android Smartphone or tablet.\n\nLifelog Android app that automatically records your physical, social and entertainment activitiesView larger Technological advances include NFC connectivity for one-touch pairingView larger TRACK MOVEMENTS, COMMUNICATIONS AND ENTERTAINMENT\nWith its removable core containing advanced sensor technology, the Sony SmartBand SWR10 feels your movements and sends the data to your Smartphone. But what makes the SmartBand really smart is the innovative Lifelog Android app that automatically records your physical, social and entertainment activities. With the Lifelog app, you can see how active you were, where you went, what pictures you took, where and when, and how you\u2019ve been communicating with your world during any given day. For instance, the Lifelog app knows if you\u2019ve been running, walking and how you\u2019ve slept. It counts steps, calculates speed, and can even monitor your sleep pattern and wake you up when you\u2019ve slept enough according to your sleep cycle. By tracking body movements, it calculates and measures the best time to wake you up and gently vibrates to bring you out of sleep.\n\n\nThis innovative life logging app will also help you set daily goals, monitor your progress and challenge your all-time bests. Look ahead in time to understand just how much more you need to run to achieve your daily activity goal. Moreover, Lifelog lets you know what the weather is going to be like tomorrow and days after. When a call, message, Facebook update or other notification comes in, SmartBand will vibrate gently on your wrist to let you know. It also has LED indicators which light up to show that SmartBand is active. You\u2019ll never miss a thing.\n\nDISCOVER JUST HOW MUCH YOU LIVE, HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE\nSpecial moments need special attention. At any time of any day, when you press the Life Bookmark key on your SmartBand, everything going on at that moment will be caught and remembered forever. Which means you can see how much you were communicating with your friends, what was said, when and how. The Lifelog app collects all your camera and music activities and presents them in a fun and animated interface along with your activity. On any day, you can see the pictures and videos you took; the games you played; the music you were listening to and how long you listened to it for. You can look back on your life and your journey through it. Giving you complete control over every aspect of your life, GPS enables you to see where you\u2019ve been \u2013 from a restaurant you visited to the location of a photo \u2013 and an edit function lets you write your own personal comment into each Life Bookmark. What\u2019s more, when you\u2019re enjoying your music on the move, you can tap the band to play, pause and skip tracks.\n\nSEAMLESS CONNECTION, GREAT DESIGN\nIn constant contact with your Smartphone via Bluetooth and to the cloud via your Smartphone, you can be assured of an always up to date activity log. Connecting is easy using NFC or a standard Bluetooth connecting procedure. When you go out of range (up to 10 m) of your Smartphone, a gentle vibrating SWR10 alert will let you know. So you never forget your phone. And even when you\u2019re out of range, this wearable technology saves information about what you do and automatically passes it on when you re-connect. You can go running and SmartBand will add your performance to Lifelog app when you\u2019re home. Incorporating a removable core unit and a stylish and comfortable wristband, the SmartBand is a 24/7 wearable device. Discreet and waterproof, you can keep it with you whatever you do. With a range of vibrant colours and styles to choose from, it\u2019s designed to look great with any clothing style and an iconic metal Sony fastening button and LEDs give it a premium look and feel.\n\nInnovative wrist band that keeps track of your movements, communications and entertainmentView larger ABOUT SONY MOBILE AND SMARTWEAR\nSmartWear \u2013 a new product category from Sony.
