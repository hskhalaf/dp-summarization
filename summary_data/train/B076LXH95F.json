I machine washed cold, and even though the tag says to hang dry, I dried it partway, and then hung. I would say it did shrink a bit but I expected that. It is a very comfortable top and I would love to order another color. Quality seems good. I am a fan of shirts with cotton blends so I was glad to find this.",
