It doesn\u2019t slide around on our wooden chairs, so I don\u2019t worry about it slipping off with all her wiggling. (It has some weight to it, so I wouldn\u2019t take it traveling with us).

But for the price, it's a little too simple. If it were $15 I'd probably be satisfied, but $35 makes this overpriced. No straps for the chair means the chair goes with my daughter whenever she climbs in or out of the seat. That's a hassle and also a potential safety hazard, so for now I am just staying very close and being very helpful. I typically love this brand, but this hasn't been a win so far.",

(Maybe we should clean it more than once every other week.... hah). Our two year old has no trouble climbing up onto the seat for meal time. Initially worried that there were no straps to secure to the chair but the seat doesn't move at all in the chair thanks to the secure feet. Also, glad there are no straps to buckle children down with, they would just get in the way and covered in spilled food.",

I really like the look too. It is so hard to find anything kid orientated that isn't brightly colored. When my son was first getting used to it, I wished it strapped to the chair because he would pull it down when trying to get up, but now there is no problem he climbs in and out on his own.",

I used a belt strapped around the chair for a while to keep him in his seat. I finally gave up and got another booster for him---one with seat straps. Now he stays put when that is important. This booster will probably be my choice in a few years. He does use it around the house to sit in and \"read.\" It is a great size for his little legs.",
