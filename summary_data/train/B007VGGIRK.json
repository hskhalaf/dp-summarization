The image quality is absolutely excellent, and the images have a certain pop to them that you often find in costlier lenses. The build quality leaves a bit to be desired, particularly manual focus ring which is quite crude for this price point. At least the MF ring turns easily, allowing you to fine tune focus on the fly with one finger. I wish the lens were a bit smaller, but I suspect the size is necessary because of the aperture and optics. Docked it a star for fit and finish, but optically you should have no hesitation when considering this lens.",

I had fast zooms and will miss that flexibility, but I really like how light and compact the primes are and the fact that they're 1 1/3 stops faster than pro zooms. Optically this lens and the 85 f/1.8G are some of the best bang-for-buck modern primes that Nikon offers. Even with the great optics however, I still think it's a bit overpriced.

      "text": "Overall I'm pretty happy with this lens as I've been wanting a (relatively) moderately priced fast wide-ish angle lens that can also focus in very close. Sharpness, clarity and contrast are all very good, however focus shift can be a slight issue with this lens so just watch out (hence the 4 stars and not 5). Mine doesn't seem to be too badly affected by I can still notice it from time to time depending on the subject matter being photographed. I still find myself using this lens quite a bit because it does offer a slightly unique perspective (being fast and wide angle).",

The clarity is remarkable and the colors are wonderful. I was surprised to find it to be so light in weight despite its obvious superb build. I have found it to be superb for portraits unless you are on top of the subject where you can gat some AP distortion, The focus is tack sharp and incredibly fast and very quiet. In short. you will not go wrong with this lens. 5 Stars. -Cheers",

I tested and tested this before any projects, then put it to work. It's a great lens overall with the only real caveat being it takes a little longer to lock AF in very low (candle) light. Not any worse than the 85's though, so pretty decent. The distortions are minimal and quite manageable if you need to correct them. The CA is well controlled overall, but as with any WA lens, there is some. Lastly, this is a SHARP LENS.",
