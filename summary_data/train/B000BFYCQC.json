They cost $20 bucks what do you expect, if you want a professional card shuffler they cost around $600 dollars. Bottom line for $20 bucks this thing works great.",

Works great for skipbo cards Phase 10 Sorry cards are thinner and kinda work Racko cards are thicker and can be difficult i usually just shuffle then by hand Uno cards work good",
