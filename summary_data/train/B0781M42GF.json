They will gradually become used to it with consistent use, and can easily be covered with a little bit of concealer. It does what it's supposed to do and claims to do! It comes with another model for the lips as well plus two blockers included! I like it, and recommend this product! Thanks!",

I will say that though the puffy look doesn\u2019t last long(maybe an hour) my lips do look healthier and more like they did when I was younger. I think the increased blood flow is the reason why.
