Because I was very careful when pulling buckles apart this wouldn't happen. Emailed the company and so far no response. Would I buy it again? No, probably not.",

Unfortunately you can see where the zipper came undone. Positive side is the zippers are super smooth. They never get caught or stuck anywhere. One zipper came undone because the stitching on that side became loose. Best way to deal with this is to either sew another of stitching yourself or take it to a tailor. Otherwise the canvas fabric is very durable and can withstand some light rain without soaking through.",

Mine has a lot of scratch marks already sadly but i still recommend as not many people buy the bag for such purpose. however I love it just the same. :D",

Within a week, I had received my replacement, with kind correspondence from the Customer service staff throughout the process. And, the new bag is pristine and beautiful! I recommend this product and buying all products from this company!",

Mine lasted for about a year before I had to use the warranty to get a free replacement. The zipper had lost its ability to hold and would require some force to finally zip.
