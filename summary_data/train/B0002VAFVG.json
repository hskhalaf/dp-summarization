I have juiced carrots, grapes, pears and pineapples too. I recommend using a small liner or trash bag on the waste bucket part for easier clean up or if you want to save the fiber. By the way the celery has done wonders for my skin and stomach.",

It does not juice greens well...you get very little juice. Things like peeled oranges, carrots, beets, apples, unpeeled cucumbers...juice really well.",

Second, It will not juice your greens properly. I had to run the pulp through 4-5 times to extract the juice out of my greens. It\u2019s such a pain to get 16 ounces of juice. It started acting up after 1.5 years. And it finally died today after 2 years of minimal usage; RIP Breville juicer; we will not buy another one of you.",

    "title": "Breville 800JEXL Juice Fountain Elite 1000-Watt Juice Extractor,Brushed Stainless",
    "description": "Providing commercial performance with Home kitchen convenience, this juicer runs on 1000 watts with two Speeds, 13,000 RPM or 6,500 RPM, for juicing hard and soft ingredients. Beautiful die-cast metal design and power combined.Do not soak the nutri disc in bleach\n\nEFFICIENT AND NUTRITIOUS JUICING\nFruit is largely composed of water, but its selling point is its nutritional value. How do you extract the juice from fruit, without leaving the nutrients behind? Breville\u2019s Nutri Disc and patented juicing system extract more nutrients than other juicers and transfers less than 1.8F of heat to protect enzymes and maximize nutrient absorption of select nutrients.\n\nThe uniquely designed juicing system features a feed chute that is centered over the shredding disc. This allows for more efficient juicing than systems that introduce ingredients on the side of the shredding disc.\n\nTwo Speeds allow you to adjust for the type of ingredients you are using. It is suggested that when juicing a variety of ingredients with varying textures, you begin with the softer textured ingredients on low-Speed then change to high Speed for harder texture ingredients. If you are juicing herbs, sprouts or leafy Green vegetables either wrap them together to form a bundle or juice them in the middle of a combination of ingredients on low-Speed to obtain the best extraction.\n\nAn extra-wide, 3-inch across feed chute makes it possible to feed whole apples, carrots, tomatoes, and peeled oranges into the juicer, saving you time and effort.\n\nNutri Disc with titanium-Reinforced blades shreds both hard and soft fruits and vegetables with ease Dual Speed control with a low Speed of 6,500rpm for softer ingredients and 13,000rpm for harder ingredients While juicing, you may notice juice escaping between the plastic juicer cover and the stainless steel filter bowl surround. Try pushing the Food Pusher down more slowly and using the low Speed. When large quantities of fruits and vegetables, especially those with high water content such tomatoes and watermelon, are fed into the Feed Chute at a rapid rate, the stainless steel filter basket coverts these into juice so quickly that the force may cause leaking.\n\nPRODUCT FEATURES:\n * Heavy-duty 1000 watt motor with dual Speed control: a low Speed (6,500rpm) for softer fruits and vegetables and a high Speed (13,000rpm) for harder fruits and vegetables\n * Patented extra-wide feed chute (3\u201d wide): juice large fruits and vegetables with little to no cutting or preparation\n * Patented direct central feed system for maximum juice extraction\n * Nutri Disc with titanium Reinforced cutting blades, which ensures the blades stay sharper for longer, and stainless steel mesh filter basket for spinning out the pulp\n * Die-cast materials make the 800JEXL both durable and beautiful\n * 1 liter juice jug (34 fl. oz.) with froth separator\n * Large capacity pulp container with integrated handle\n * Cord storage: the power cord wraps around feet and clips into position under the base for a reduced counter-top footprint\n * Safety Locking Arm prevents the juicer from operating without the cover locked into place\n * Overload protection prevents over-heating, automatically shutting the machine down when it senses that the machine is overloaded\n * All materials that come in contact with food are BPA-free, ensuring safe use\n * Easy clean-up with the included cleaning brush. All parts except for the mesh filter basket/Nutri Disc and food pusher can be washed on the top shelf of the dishwasher.\n\nModel BJE820XL: Juice Fountain Duo 800JEXL: Juice Fountain Elite BJE510XL: Juice Fountain Multi-Speed BJS600XL: Juice Fountain Crush JE98XL: Juice Fountain Plus BJE200XL: Juice Fountain Compact Key Feature Die-cast juicer with soft fruit attachment and variable Speed capability 'Rolls Royce' of Juicers: die-cast metal matched wtih power Variable Speeds maximize yield across variety of fruits Makes thicker juices and yields more juice for leafy Greens and wheatgrass than non-masticating juicers Great entry price point for Breville juicers Compact design takes up less space, with all of the juicing capabilities of the other juicers Type of Juicer Centrifugal Centrifugal Centrifugal Masticating/slow juicer Centrifugal Centrifugal Motor 1200 watt 1000 watt 900 watt 240 watt 850 watt 700 watt Speed 5 Speeds ranging from 6,500rpm to 13,000rpm Low Speed of 6,500rpm, high Speed of 13,000rpm 5 Speeds ranging from 6,500rpm to 12,500rpm 80rpm Low Speed of 6,500rpm, high Speed of 12,000rpm 14,000rpm Materials  * Heavy grade die-cast metal body\n * Titanium cutting disc\n * Stainless steel micromesh filter\n * Stainless steel puree disc\n\n * Heavy grade die-cast metal body\n * Titanium cutting disc\n * Stainless steel cutting disc\n * Engineering grade polymers\n\n * Stainless steel body\n * Stainless steel micromesh filter\n * Stainless steel cutting disc\n * Engineering grade polymers\n\n * Painted premium plastic\n\n * Heavy grade polymer body\n * Stainless steel micromesh filter\n * Stainless steel cutting disc\n\n * Titanium cutting disc\n * Stainless steel micromesh filter\n\nInnovations  * 3\" circular feed tube processes whole fruit\n * Centered dual knife blade asssembly\n * Stabilizing knife\n * Second juice disc purees soft fruits for 100% fruit smoothies\n\n * 3\" circular feed tube processes whole fruit\n * Centered dual knife blade asssembly\n * Stabilizing knife\n * Dual high/low Speed switch for hard or softer fruits and vegetables\n\n * 3\" circular feed tube processes whole fruit\n * Centered dual knife blade asssembly\n * Stabilizing knife\n * Unique 5 Speed smart juicing system maximizes juice yield according to softness and hardness\n\n * Direction control\n * Two step safety start\n * Filter basket with auto-purifying\n * Crushes and squeezes to make juice with nutrients and a little fiber for a thicker, smoother texture\n\n * 3\" circular feed tube processes whole fruit\n * Centered dual knife blade asssembly\n * Stabilizing knife\n * Dual high/low Speed switch for hard or softer fruits and vegetables\n\n * 3\" circular feed tube processes whole fruit\n * Centered dual knife blade asssembly\n * Stabilizing knife\n\nCompare Breville Juicers.",
