It is definitely safe to say that the blockage I was experiencing was one of the more extreme ones, but this worked flawlessly.",

I was an easy at first to used it to my 7 years old but his doctor recommended to do it at home since he don\u2019t do it in his office anymore liability wise so we have to go to a specialist to do it. This product is really good just need to follow the instruction its very simple and efficient I will used it again in the future if we have too, and it\u2019s not as expensive like the other product.",

    "description": "Size:0.5 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)| Style:Earwax removal KitDebrox Earwax Removal Kit includes a soft rubber bulb syringe to rinse your ear after using Debrox Earwax Removal Drops. Excessive earwax build-up can lead to ear discomfort and reduced hearing, which can affect your day-to-day life. Debrox Earwax Removal Drops are a safe and inexpensive in-home solution. Debrox's gentle, non-irritating microfoam cleansing action goes to work to soften and loosen earwax. When drops are placed in the ear, oxygen is released. This release allows Debrox to foam on contact as it gently softens and loosens earwax. Once broken down, earwax is able to drain from the ear and ears are relieved of built-up earwax so you can return back to daily life without muffled hearing caused by excess earwax. Trust Debrox to help keep your ears \u2013 and hearing \u2013 clear.
