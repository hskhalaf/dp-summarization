I bought this to replace my electric knife because my newly married daughter borrowed the one I got as a wedding gift over 20 years ago and still works like a champ. This one doesn't come close to the quality of my old trusty knife. The knife became hot, and smelled of electrical wires burning as I tried to cut both boneless ham and an eye round roast. The meat was slipping in between the blades, something I had never experienced with my old knife. Needless to say, I had to ask my daughter for my knife back.",
