      "verdict": "Picking a sneaker that can traverse the laid-back feel of the indoors and cross the harsh path of the outdoors is the holy grail of almost any human being. Though designed to cater women\u2019s feet, the Puma Dare AC performs well on all cylinders of comfort and style that is drooled upon by the most envious male class.Its natural slip-on feature marks a spot for a convenient go-to shoe in a price that is affordable for all ages. Users looking for more immersive arch support might find the low top lacking on that aspect.",
      "pros": [
        "The Puma Dare AC is supremely comfortable",

        "Aside from being super functional, the sneaker also looks excellent as commended by some buyers",
        "Two of these purchasers specifically praised the sneaker\u2019s cozy footbed",
        "One user loved the convenient slip-on construction",
        "A purchaser likes the way the elastic band allows you to adjust the level of stability",
        "According to a couple of customers, the sneaker is brilliantly priced",
        "Friends went crazy over them, as mentioned by one user"

        "A handful of wearers were not satisfied with its arch support",
        "One customer was slightly appalled by the sneaker\u2019s \u201cStorm Trooper\u201d looking soles"

      "text": "I purchased these for my girlfriend about a year ago. She has a really high arch and it gives moderate arch support, but because she has such a high arch, the elastic was always a little too tight for her. Over all thought, they were rather comfortable for long periods of standing and walking. However the biggest disappointment is that the fabric at the tip of the shoe (near the toes) came undone from the rubber sole and there were holes just after 3 months of use.",

Great for working out and running as I do both daily. Such a light shoe and IT IS NOT TOO NARROW. It fits like an expected shoe per the description of the width. If you have wider feet, the shoe is not made for you period. That is not a product error. I like my shoes tighter however and ordered normal 9.5, if I order them in grey I will get a 9.",

That would normally be a big plus but, because of my foot problems, the left orthotic fits well except that the lump on top of my foot rubs against the top of the shoe causing pain. If I take the left orthotic out, there is absolutely no support. I can still wear them, just not for very long periods.",
