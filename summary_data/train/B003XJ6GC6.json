The sound quality is decent; it is good and loud enough for me to hear him practice in his room and yell for him to turn it down. My only gripe with this set is that on low volume, the sound is distorted and there is a weird buzzing in the speakers. I would recommend this for a child or a beginning player.",

All in all I'd recommend it for anyone who wants to drum but doesn't want to take up a lot of space until they are ready for a set. Even then, these are portable & sound pretty good so I wouldn't get rid of them even then.",

      "text": "My daughter is 6 years old. She has been asking for months to get a drum set, last year it was a piano. She is musical but young and the idea of having drums going in my small home for hours at a time was less than appealing!...This is the perfect solution! It not only has volume control but you can also plug in headphones although you do need to get a adapter for them as the jack is made for the same size as the foot petal, not the typical phone headphones.- small price to pay in my book. Was delivered on time in excellent condition. Very happy!",

What child did not want to be a drummer at some point in his childhood years? Well, my husband can now sit and play drums with earphones on and not bother others in the house. It is that cool for him! The only downside is that he already has so little time left to spend with me and now I even have to share it with a digital drum!",

Sounds and responds much like an acoustic drum set. The only \"complaint\" is that the bass drum pedal isn't very good. I am in the process of replacing that at the moment. Otherwise, VERY pleased with this kit. Would highly reccomend.",

He told me that he didn't hit the pads too hard, so it's not his fault. And one more problem is that it won't react to your sticks about 1/10s of the time, skipping hi-hat beats and making weak snare drum sounds. In short it's an okay set to start off with, just don't expect too much from it.",

I will hopefully find the time to learn how to use it better and then help my daughter to enjoy her present.",

This is a new drum set but sometimes when a pad is hit no sound is produced. 2 months into the use of pedals, both of them broke. I love the sound of this machine when I use this with a sound mixer. It just becomes a totally different thing and I cannot stop my hands. Just wish I had a better throne as the one I bought with this is not something that I could sit on for long hours.",
