A search showed many people had the same problem. The machine was still working so I continued to use it but it became less and less convenient, beeping error signals several times while working. Now it only will vacuum about 15 minutes before needing to be recharged. This machine had basically an 11 month life. I not only won't be replacing with another of this brand, I probably won't even try with another robot vacuum brand.",

      "text": "This little vacuum robot really works well. I had the more expensive Roomba which I loved until it died. This works just as well. My only complaint is that the suction wheel area is much smaller than the Roomba so it does take more runs over the floors to get them clean. The battery lasts quite awhile and it obediently returns to its base when the battery needs recharging. Great product! Edit: 9 months later and it won't charge. Bummer. It was a cheap price and worked well when it worked but I think products should last longer than 9 months.",
