      "text": "The material, look, and feel of the bag are nice, but the design isn\u2019t practical. The opening is narrow so it\u2019s a little awkward reaching in to put something in/take something out. Like I had to really pay attention and open it as wide as I could so as not to scratch my hand with the zipper. I\u2019m used to a small crossbody purse but this wasn\u2019t just a smallness issue. It just felt like to tight of an opening to be practical. I had to return it.",
