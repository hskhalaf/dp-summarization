      "text": "My Lilac Amazon is used to a diet of seeds, and frozen veggies (which we microwave for her); we want to transition to pellet based so we can always ensure she has a well rounded diet. The first time I gave her one, I acted like it was a \"treat\" and she ate it. But the next time I gave it to her, she just threw it on the ground as if I gave her dirt. She ate all her food except these pellets. Today, I tried soaking them in water; her eyes pinned and she seemed to like it more. Will continue to try to transition her to these; stay tuned!",

They will eat the yellow banana out of an entire dish first before moving on to another color or flavor, and amazing they are so nimble to sort what they eat. I ran out of this feed a while back and had to use the grocery store pet seed Katee variety and it threw them both into a molt and they wasted most of it. That type of feed is not good for your birds and their health. Keep them on this ZuPreem diet for optimum health and happy birds!",

He hates this stuff, doesn't even recognize it as food and throws it out of his dish without eating it. He loves Lafaeber's food, especially the Nutriberries (I call it birdy crack). Fortunately, I have chickens that will eat this, so at least it won't go to waste! Mighty expensive for chicky food, so I definitely will not be buying this again. Shipping was good, and the box was well packed. Always get the freshest products for my pets when I buy from Amazon, and the prices are much lower than the local stores.",
