      "text": "Used them today on pungo 120 and 125. Fit well and tight to get on but held the seal in a windy cool day. Definitely kept us warm and out of the breeze and kept splash out of cockpit. I'm large guy and the body portion is very tight. Not more than 2\" of adjust in the Velcro tabs. Son is smaller And it fit him well but not snugly as it was on me. Any bigger and I would not be able to zip closed. Two way zipper is nice for air flow. Front rib adjusted well to avoid pooling.",

      "text": "This product is well made. It fits my Widlerness pongo 120 that is at least 6 years old. I love how the zippers work: you can attach this to your kayak (instead of wearing this item and then getting in), and then unzip the opening and climb in. And the zipper opens from the other end too! fantastic. Another super nice feature is the support that keeps water from welling up in your lap. This is just snug enough to stay put but be pulled off in a jiffy if that is called for. This BTW, was for the largest skirt.",

      "text": "Willing to adjust the rating if I can get with customer service but I finally was able to use this this past weekend. After the first use there was a tear created by the implosion bar. Everything else about it was great even if a bit difficult to get on...but I prefer that over a loose spray skirt. If this had been much cheaper I would ignore the tear because it doesn't impact the waterproofness (that I noticed), but at this price I don't expect it to get torn by it's own features. Since it was created by the sharp corners of the implosion bar I expect the hole will only get worse and bigger as I use it more.",
