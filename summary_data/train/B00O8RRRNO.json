Additionally, while its not an issue for me, my arthritic mother has a very difficult time unbuckling the chest strap.",

This small issue shouldn't matter once its turned around to be forward facing. We own another graco car seat in my wife's car, and while it cost twice as much as this model, its not twice as nice.
