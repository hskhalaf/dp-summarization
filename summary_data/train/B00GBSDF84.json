      "text": "I really liked this item! Great with hammer pencil, screwdriver however I really had a difficult time putting my tape measure back, it was time consuming slowed me down and very hard to do with work gloves on. The slit for the tape measure was just not broke in and very tight that was my only issue I'm sure if I wore it longer and dealt with it let it break in It would have been perfect. Cant really have it keep falling off though! At least it stayed put, when I finally did put it back!",
