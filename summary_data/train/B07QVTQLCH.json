Additionally, the shoe\u2019s low weight and high-level comfort make it ideal for daily wear.Fans of stability shoes that can handle any activity can enjoy the Wave Inspire 16.",

In fact, the 16 is a downscaled, lower quality version of the 15. Less cushioning, less comfort, and cheaper construction. My biggest beef is the reduction in the foam lining around the heel collar. On my first run with the 16, I came back with a broken blister on my ankle from abrasion with the collar. There is a bloodstain on the inside of my right shoe if Amazon wants proof.",

I mostly bought them for walking, going to the gym and golfing. After 4 months they have developed a hole in the padding behind my heel on both shoes for some unknown reason. Needless to say, they are now unwearable. Very disappointed. I have owned several pairs of Mizuno Wave Riders in the past that have lasted for YEARS, so not sure what happened to this model.",

I bought a half-size larger than usual because I have Morton's toes and had developed black toenails (first time in 40 years of running).
