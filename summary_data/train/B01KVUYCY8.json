I can't speak to ease of assembly, because I paid someone to do it for me. He did complete the assembly fairly quickly. I generally find the lowest setting to be enough breeze.

This reviewer is in Ventura, CA, and in theory, being on the ocean it's never sweltering. Wrong- this last 4 weeks have been warm and muggy and the fan, if nothing else, keeps the air moving until the evening cool down. The design is nice, if you like Pineapples- meaning it's not just a pole with blades. If there's a downside, it's size makes it awkward to move around, but it's fine as a stationary one-room tool.",
