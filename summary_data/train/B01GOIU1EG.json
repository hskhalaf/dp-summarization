Reason 1, there is no shoulder strap even though some product photos indicated otherwise. My bag came with 2 short handles, not so easy for transporting. Reason 2, the mat is not very comfortable. I prefer a sticky softer mat. This one has nice thickness, but no \"give\". Shipping was fast and company emailed to ensure delivery, so great customer service. Returned with no problem. 5 stars for service, 3 for product.",

Even though I rarely reply to those e-mails, at least I know that communicating with the company will be easy if I ever encounter any problems with the product.",

The bag is large enough to accommodate a few extra items without being so large that it's hard to carry or transport. I haven't used the towels or the strap yet, but overall the mat & carrying bag alone are well worth the price.",

The yoga equipment is good quality and is comfortable to use. I am doing hot yoga 5 times a week and the equipment is supportive and resilient. The communication with the seller was positive, enabling me to have my concerns addressed. It was evident that the seller cares about their customers, I would buy from them again.",
