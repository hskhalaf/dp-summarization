I put one one last night for 20 minutes, and after I tool it off my skin did look hydrated and less red. But now, the next day, I have about ten tiny pimples on my skin and it feels itchy and looks red & irritated. I haven't used any new products on my skin except for this one, so I know it's what broke my skin out.",
