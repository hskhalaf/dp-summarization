The Penn balls wear better, but all in all, I like these a bit more. Plus, the red logo is distinctive and easy to separate the balls from other brands.",

They really left a LOT of fuzz in my machine and I had to vacuum out large bunches of it. They felt pretty much like regular tennis balls when hit with a racquet - maybe a little more force was needed, and sometimes they bounced weird, but that was o.k. since real tennis balls can bounce weird too. I may start using them again since they seem to have a lot of life left in them, but probably won't be buying anymore.",

I notice that after working out with my ball machine the ball's fur left on the court is much less compared to Penn and Tretorn. Ball seems to be more durable. I would have to do another review in the future.I would definitely recommend.",
