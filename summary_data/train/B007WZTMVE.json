      "text": "I bought the camera to use it on my bicycle and to be able to connect it with my phone through wifi but the battery dies really fast when using wifi pod, very shortly after the pod itself broke and I was not able to connect. I sent it back to be fixed and shortly after getting it back it broke again and I was not able to connect it to my phone. One of the flaps of the clip also broke off as it was not durable enough. I learned that it's better to buy a product that is quality made like GoPro. I don't recommend this model or product.",

Item works great just got my hands on it and had to in the water with it. Video quality is very good and doesn't need no protective case since the whole cam is water proof up to 10m , it has this nice function to connect wifi with my android and you can watch what you're recording live. Overall love the cam and gonna keep exploring with it.",

      "text": "We purchased it to take a trip to the Caribbean and do some snorkeling. I read all the instructions, ensured the cover was on tight and locked, and within 5 minutes the camera stopped working. The deepest I got while snorkeling was ~7 feet. I have now read other reviews that seem to have the same issue. The design of the seal doesn't seem to be sufficient for any type of full submersion. I am sure it would be OK to get wet here and there, but if you plan on going underwater, keep looking. On the plus side, the camera mounts were solid and all other design features were nice. The vibe feedback to power on/record worked great.",
