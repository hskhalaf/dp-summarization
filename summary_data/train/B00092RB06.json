I found it hard to walk around my home and we have clear space with hardwood floors. Hard to bend and pick things up. Hard to do laundry. Took a lot of energy just to do basic things. Crutches are not great. Maybe if this product were not so bulky it would possibly work.",

It might be a solution once the bone has knitted back together? I'm not sure. But it won't work right after the break or right after surgery.",

This is my second Iwalk due to complications from an amputation. The vibram sole isnt even. It pushes your knee/hip inward, which is by design for some reason. It makes walking more uncomfortable when waking on hard surfaces. I would not recommend for lower leg injuries, the initial reason i bought it, as your injury will hang off the edge and get jarred around.",

The treads are made of plastic and are fine enough that they will easily strip if the thumb screws are not kept really tight. Overall, for $150 I expected better.

Definitely have to take it slow and not rush, but the extra pad for cushioning and use the hand grip to help make sure it doesn\u2019t drag. My husband was pretty fit before surgery which I think helped him pick it up quick. I would suggest practicing if you can before you need it to get the hang of it. He fell a few times when he first tried it because he was going to fast and reaching too far. Highly recommend this!!!",

I highly recommend practicing frequently prior to undergoing your surgery. After my surgery, it made getting around easier allowing the freedom to use my hands.

But, it needs good balance, hip strength, coordination and some athletic ability to take full advantage. For the generally active person, this would be way more useful than a scooter, for a prolonged period of non-weight-bearing. A little expensive, for all that. A little risky on stairs, cobbles, etc., but those would be non-negotiable with a scooter. Heavier than crutches. Straps are slightly tricky to adjust, but instructions and support are terrific.",

Give yourself a week to learn how to adjust because your balance will be off. But after that he thing is awesome. Brilliant invention! GET IT!",

      "text": "I like the hands free aspect of the device as it allowed me to walk my dog and hold my child as advertised. I\u2019m not enjoying the pain and discomfort due to lack of padding on the knee. After a few hours of use following the instructions making sure the fit was correct I noticed the area below my knee cap (patella tendon) had become bruised and I lost a significant amount of hair and skin. I feel that this is an easy fix perhaps a gel layer or something soft. Otherwise a solid five star. Will update when I\u2019m done using the device in a few months. (Fractured toe)",
