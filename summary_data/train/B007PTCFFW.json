Then, each time I asked a question I would wait 5 minutes for a response. Usually the responses were a link to an article. Then he would ask, have you tried \"192.168.0.254\" and I said yes, didn't work. Then 10 minutes later he says \"can we configure it\" and I responded that yes, that was my intention and he said to navigate to \"192.168.0.254\". Huh?",

The only issue that I have had and the only reason for four stars is that I cannot change the network pass key! I have tried and tried but it will not let me access the Admin functions.",

The wireless range is very good in an open area, i can still use it (1 - 2 Bars) 25 meters far from the router, remember that this router is very tiny. I didn't use it as an wireless expander, only generating wireless from an cable connection. The software is good, has all the advanced features if you want to configure it, or you can use the wizard that with only some steps is already configured. Based on it's price i really recommend it.",

It is able to download just as fast as using a patch cable (my internet connection is 60Mbps) and can recommend it for anyone with this intent. I cannot really tell you how it performs as a router or access point since I haven't had the need but if time comes that I need it, I'll report back.",

The device, which can be powered by an external power adapter or USB connection to a computer, can conveniently connect to the internet and share the connection around an average sized room at 150Mbps.The device's tiny size makes it ideal for use on the road and is powerful enough to satisfy almost any basic wireless application requirement.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\n\n\nThe TL-WR702N is designed for use with tablets, smart phones, handheld game consoles and other portable electronic wireless devices. The device, which can be powered by an external power adapter or USB connection to a computer, can conveniently connect to the internet and share the connection around an average sized room at 150Mbps.The device\u2019s tiny size makes it ideal for use on the road and is powerful enough to satisfy almost any basic wireless application requirement.\n\nPORTABLE AND COMPACT\u2014IDEAL FOR HOME AND TRAVEL USE\nTL-WR702N is the smallest wireless router in the world and is very easy to use. All you need to do is simply plug a hotel room\u2019s WAN cable into the port provided and enter a default password to instantly create a wireless hotspot. \nFLEXIBLE POWER SUPPLY\u2014EASY TO TAKE ON THE ROAD\nTL-WR702N has a Micro USB port that can be powered by an external power adapter or via a USB connection to a computer. When traveling, you can plug the TL-WR702N into your computer\u2019s USB port and share your Wi-Fi connection with family and friends. \nMULTIPLE OPERATING MODES\nTL-WR702N supports AP, Router, Bridge, Client and Repeater modes to enable various wireless applications. This gives you a more dynamic and comprehensive wireless networking experience. \nADVANCED SECURITY\nTL-WR702N provides WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK encryptions, which can effectively protect your wireless network. Its' Pre-Encryption function sets the initial SSID and Password for users to protect their wireless security. \nFEATURES\n * Compatible with IEEE 802.11b/g/n\n * Wireless speed up to 150Mbps\n * Compact and portable, small enough to take on the road\n * Powered through a micro USB port by an external power adapter or USB connection to a computer\n * Compatible with almost all 2.4GHz Wi-Fi devices\n * Supports AP, Router, Client, Bridge and Repeater operation modes\n * Supports WEP, WPA/WPA2, WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK encryptions \n\n\nAPPLICATION GUIDE\nAP MODE (DEFAULT)\nDefinition: The TL-WR702N is connected to a wired network and transforms the wired Internet access into wireless so that multiple devices can share the Internet. Application:\n1.Office, hotel and places where only wired network is available.\n2.LAN gaming party, small meeting and other situations where a temporary wireless network is needed.\n\n\nREPEATER MODE\nDefinition: The TL-WR702N copies and reinforces the existing wireless signal to extend the coverage of the signal. So the network name(SSID) and password don't change. This mode is especially useful for a large space to eliminate signal-blind corners. Application: Large house, office, warehouse or other spaces where the existing signal is weak.\n\n\nCLIENT MODE\nDefinition: The TL-WR702N is connected to another device via Ethernet core and acts as an adaptor to send/receive the wireless signal from your wireless network. Application: For a Smart TV, Media Player, or game console with an Ethernet port. Use the 702N to make your devices Wi-Fi enabled, granting them access to your wireless network.\n\n\nROUTER MODE\nDefinition: The TL-WR702N is connected to a DSL or cable modem and works as a regular wireless router.
