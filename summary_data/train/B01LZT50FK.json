Because we live in the Midwest, these socks have pretty much just been worn indoors. Other socks have lasted through all 3 of my boys and these barely lasted 3 months! In this situation, the mantra, \"you get what you pay for\" holds true. Don't waste your time. Pay a little extra to get socks that were actually designed to hold up to being worn instead of just looking good in the package.",

These fit the length and width of my 4 year old's chubby feet - AND they are not tight around the ankle like the others. Once he turned 2 it was hard to find good fitting socks and i was stretching his baby socks to keep wearing those since only baby socks not tight on ankles. He now has big kid feet wearing these great socks - not too long or short and great width. Not too thick or thin either. I see some reviews show they are tearing but I will buy more if ours do.",
