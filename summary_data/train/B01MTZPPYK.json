The remover disintegrated the gel spacers, particularly on the in-between bands. Guess I'll have to get a new pair.",

Since then, I have accommodated to wearing them about an 1.5hr around the house or while sitting. I can feel foot muscles along big toe & outer arch, lower back/glute muscles tensing & releasing. I am looking forward to seeing the results of my body alignment do to this little guys.",

Nothing wrong with the product and if you have foot problems it\u2019s worth a try. Foot problems are so different for each individual, i do suggest to try these, they did bring some comfort.",

      "text": "Big Toe area was flimsy, thin and ripped. They are not bad comfort wise - they function and had no trouble wearing them for prolonged periods (30+ minutes). If you look at the pictures, the loops for the big and pinkie toes where after shoving or gently placing toes inside, the stretch can be a problem if you have a larger toe/foot. After a few wears (<5 times), they tore and did not live up to the quality. For reference, I am 9.5 MEN U.S which is actually below average (10.5 US).",
