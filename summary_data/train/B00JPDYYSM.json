At first it didn't work on any threshold level, as the monitor light would stay on always. I think it was because my laptop was still charging while off? I think as soon as it got near fully charged it worked. It even works now when the laptop is slept. I had to set the threshold to high for the other stuff to shut off when the laptop is either slept or shut off.",
