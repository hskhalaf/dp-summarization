Unfortunately out of the box it does not have a setting to run the fan only without the heater. If you're handy with circuits and a soldering iron you can easily modify it so you can run it with the fan only (60w). HIGHLY recommend this dryer. I will update this again in a couple months as I use this every day to dry my work boots.",

When you hook up the glove dryer it's really difficult to tell that there's any air coming out of it. Not sure how well it's going to do on wet gloves and boots, but I'll update my review once I have the opportunity to truly test it.",
