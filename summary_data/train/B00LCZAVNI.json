Other than making a couple noises when you press its head, it doesn't do anything else. The only cool thing is that after being recognized by the real Furby and the app, it will update the app to its \"crystal\" version, which is much nicer. I bought it when it was $10, so I guess it was fine. I recommend buying it only if you enjoy playing the app.",
