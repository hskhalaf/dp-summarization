      "text": "I purchased this router on September 23, 2010. The router has a tendency to overheat. When this happens, performance drops. Linksys sent me a replacement after the unit continously overheated despite an ambient temperature of 75. Time based access rules are buggy and unreliable. I finally threw in the towel and downgraded to my trusty old WRT160N and I am loving it. I don't know what compelled me to upgrade this router but I sure regretted it. Do yourself a favor and don't buy CISCO home routers. They took what used to be a great router and destroyed it. Some people say that they have improved recently but I am not willing to plop down money to find out.",

I swallowed my pride and went back and purchased this guy based on the much better reviews it received. I was not disappointed. It has an updated Admin UI with additional features (such as static DHCP) that I didn't have with my 10 year old WRT54G model. I didn't need to put on any of the hacked flavors of firmware like I did with my old one because this suited my needs perfectly. The faster Wireless N and wired gigabit is a definite plus. Thanks Cisco for restoring my trust in your product line.",

Tried to reset , etc. Called Linksys and they said its gone, throw it away. Don't even bother with the online tips. If you are not getting a link light on one of the 4 switch ports and your PC says \"Network Cable Unplugged\" the thing is bricked for good. I understand Linksys (Cisco) cannot honor they hardware warranty forever but the quality of their products have clearly declined. Not sure I will buy Linksys again",

Out of the box, after a simple installation process, everything connected. However, signal strength was *low* in the next room where it had been *excellent* with the old router. After much time spent with Google searches and reading various support forums I found advanced configuration settings that make 802.11g work at the same level as the old router. So, all I've gained is more modern security (WPA versus WEP). When I do upgrade to 802.11n (or greater) this router may really shine. But for now, it was a big step backwards.",

Granted, I don't need anything special, but for those of us who just want the Roku to work and to be able to watch Hulu in bed, the default set up is all you need. And the pre-set router name and passwords are already unique, so you don't even have to mess with that if you don't want to. I've got a small apartment, so I can't speak to range, but the connection speed is good and much smoother than just plugging into my modem.",

I used the manual setup - it's very much like other Linksys routers I've had. When the microwave oven is running, it disrupts the wireless communication, and I haven't tried very hard to find a solution for this problem. My netbook doesn't have 5Ghz wireless, so that's not an option. Anyway, when the microwave shuts down everything goes back to normal (An occasional two or three minutes of patience never hurt anybody). Overall, I would recommend the E2000 to anyone who is looking for a capable router at a moderate price.",

And getting this router to work with my desktop was also a problem and required a call to support at Cisco/Linksys. I will never buy another brand because the support I received from them was absolutely TOP NOTCH and better than any I have ever gotten in over 30 years of computing. Bottom line is I am on line and things could not be better.",
