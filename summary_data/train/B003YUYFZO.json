The difference was immediate and surprising. My cat is now completely regular with softer stool. Plus her appetite has really improved. We're both a lot happier now that she's so much more comfortable. I highly recommend this product whether for just an occasional use or for the difficult cases like my senior cat.",

I squeeze some up, and my cat licks it right out of the tube. I give her a little bit a few times per week. She goes many weeks now without a hairball. The Laxatone helps the hair move through the digestive system so it can be eliminated in the litter box. I hesitated to order this item from this seller because the picture doesn't match the actual tube, but it is the same product. Needless to say, I'll be ordering here from now on.",
