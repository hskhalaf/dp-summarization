A light dusting didn't interest her, but with a heavy dusting, mixed in with the kidney cat-food, she finally ate some of the kidney cat-food. Hooray for that, but she lost interest after a few bites, even with this stuff in the mix. If I'm going to mix something into her kidney cat-food to make it palatable, why not mix in the ordinary cat food that she likes? So that's what I'm doing now, at about 1/3 the price of this stuff.",
