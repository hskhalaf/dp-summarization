The stand is quite nice, albeit large and heavy; it can tilt in an direction and it's possible to change the height. It is a curved display, although I don't seem to be able to perceive any difference from my old display.

The curved screen, though it can be seen as gimmicky, really does give a premium feel to it, regardless of what you are doing.

No motion color artifacts at all on my unit. Screen coating does a great job at reducing reflections without reducing image quality. Including a factory calibration report is a nice touch.

      "text": "It's a good monitor, looks great, but came with a bunch of dead pixels. Trying to get a replacement has also been a huge hassle. The monitor also seems to struggle when opening fullscreen programmes as it switches itself from HDR mode to non-HDR mode a bunch of times, so alt-tabbing out of games is not ideal. Other than that works okay, looks pretty good although blacks are a bit uneven.",

      "text": "Color saturation and viewing angles are very weak. Black level isn't great either. Picture settings and color calibration don't substantially improve picture quality. The curvature helps alleviate poor horizontal viewing angles a bit, but vertical angles remain problematic. Picture has noticeably lower contrast near top and bottom edges of the screen. Currently HDR is not properly supported by Windows 10, and there are very few games with HDR support. The only good thing about it is that 120Hz mode works. While Nvidia cards can't use freesync, cards powerful enough to consistently render 120fps can take advantage of it.",
