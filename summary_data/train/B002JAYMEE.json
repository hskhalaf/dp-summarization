This is great for my pale Irish skin. On the does-it-work scale, this is 5-stars. The down-sides? It isn't shine free. It's pretty greasy looking, but doesn't feel that way on your skin. Secondly, for use on your face, keep it far away from your eyes. It burns for about 30 minutes if it gets in your eye and it doesn't take much to feel that way. While this is a great sunscreen, you will need something else for your face.",

He is outside most of the time and has a hard time finding a sunscreen that will protect his skin, stay on his skin, not drip off with sweat, not irritate skin, and not leave a white film on the skin. This sunscreen is the answer for all those issues. It is lightweight, stays on with sweat, no need to reapply often, not irrigating to the skin, no white film left behind, and protects really well. Thank goodness, our sunscreen search is over!",

Does not make my makeup clot or smear throughout the day! I also bought some for my young adult son who is in college. He raves about it also. All other sunscreens he had tried made his skin greasy and shiny. Not this product. Highly recommend.",

I work outside, and my main issue, was that it made my eyes burn if sweat got in my eyes. I haven't had this issue with other sunscreens. On the plus side, there was no strong odor and it doesn't leave your face unnaturally white.",

If you sweat it off, that sweat will be white. At least that way you know you need to reapply 2.) Don't Put It Near Your Eyes. The stinging is incredible. As in, incredibly annoying. Other than that, it works very well. Used it for outdoor work 10 hours a day for over a month with nary a sunburn.",

We were in the ocean, and in the pool with a swim up bar most of the day, we kept reapplying it about ever 1.5 - 2 hours. This is wonderful stuff! Thick and rich and does take a little more time to work it into the skin, but it was so worth it! My husband came back from Jamaica BURN FREE and so did I!!! LOVE IT!",
