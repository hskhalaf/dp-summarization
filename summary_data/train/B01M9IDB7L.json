        "A tiny number of buyers commended the shoe's exceptional comfort",
        "Retaining the silhouette of the original release, the Puma Clyde Premium Core's image is much appreciated by a very a small number of reviewers",

It is much brighter with less of a light / medium blue undertone and more aquamarine. 2) The insert on these shoes is the worst I've ever seen. It's like someone decided to put the hardest possible material in the bottom of an otherwise comfortable shoe. Thankfully the insert does come out and can be replaced, but I've never had to do that with new shoes. Be aware of the added cost.",
