Doc said my ears were full of wax. Tried for weeks with liquids and bulb syringe. Nada! Used this in one ear with the liquid the other without. Bingo! Both worked. Amazing how well this thing worked. This thing was engineered perfectly. Set up Alexa to remind me to use this each month. Funny how a simple thing like this can improve your life. I SAID, FUNNY HOW A SIMPLE THING LIKE THIS CAN IMPROVE YOUR LIFE! ;)",

I applied the fluid to my ear, and took a little rest on the bed. 25 minutes later, I started using the pump to flush them out. Left ear wasn't too bad, and the little bit of wax came right out. I then did the right ear the same way, A monstrous wax plug came out after a bit of irrigating, and all is well. There are 10 doses of the wax dissolving substance, enough for 5 complete cleanings. This is a product that does exactly what I expected it to do, and I'm 100% satisfied with it..",
