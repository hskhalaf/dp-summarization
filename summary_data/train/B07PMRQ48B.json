I also own the Phantom 4 Pro and struggle to tell the difference in the picture quality. The USB C charging is so useful, I wouldn't buy another drone with out it. I like the way the Anafi flys, very steady and smooth, the losses zoom is a bonus, the active track is awesome. They've done so many things right, i'm very happy i bought this instead of the Mavic Air, and yes i still have the P4 Pro for when i don't need portability or i'm chasing windsurfers in 30 knot winds.",

Then we purchased the arm repair kit from Amazon, but we cannot open the original arms to remove the wiring and motors because there are no screws. Parrot customer service was completely unhelpful, they suggested we pay to have our brand new drone fixed. This is not an Amazon issue but a Parrot issue; we will not be purchasing any more Parrot Drones.",
