Also, this is the only lighted keyboard I found that turns the illumination off when you put the PC into sleep. The others stay lighted. G",

So ergonomically it's not as comfortable for me as the last one had been. I should have noticed that and looked for one without those added inches.",

My girlfriend decided she wanted one because she likes the heft, soft key feel and backlight on mine so she's getting this one. I cannot recall being disappointed with any Logitech keyboard or mouse purchases I've made in the past five years and I've made several. If you bother with the kit software, it's intuitive and simple. If you don't bother with the kit software, the keyboard works fine anyway. It's a good purchase for most all applications. I'm also an avid PC game enthusiast and recommend this keyboard as a less expensive alternative to gaming gear",
