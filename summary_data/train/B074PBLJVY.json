It came with a non removable cord and my old unit was hard wired so I had to put an electrical outlet in the cabinet above (very inconvenient). The lights are in the very back and not really over the main cooking area. It looks good and is a huge improvement over the broken one it replaced. lastly the instructions said to mount it 25 inches above the stove. I put it where the old one was at 19 inches.",

This hood met all of our checkpoints for a new vented hood! It was inexpensive, it had 3 fan speeds, was quiet, had 2 light bulbs for superior stovetop lighting, and was available in stainless steel. It got installed last night and we LOVE it!! I have to say...the new stove and vent hood look downright SEXY!!!! I highly recommend choosing this model when you upgrade your kitchen!",

I also put shiny tin foil over the top to mirror the light a bit more which helps. Update: The fan stopped working after 7 months.

The install was simple and the range hood LOOKS great. But its looks and its operation don't match. It has 3 fan speeds that are loud, Louder, and REALLY LOUD - none of which draw well in its ventless mode. Also, the rear-installed 1\" x 4\" LED light is not well placed, and not very effective for seeing what you're doing. If we end up replacing this, we'll try them out first - in person.",

The one I received (newer version?) contains surface mounted (SMD) LED bulbs -- in other words, they're soldered to a PCB Circuit Board. Only someone comfortable soldering electronic circuit boards will be able to replace these bulbs with a warmer alternative, or eventually put in new ones when they expire in 10+ years.",

It was very easy to install but I recommend that you have two people. Also make note that this unit has a standard 3 pronged plug. If you are replacing and older unit, It may only have a wire connection into the wall. In this case you may have to have a outlet installed.",

Looks fantastic and the buttons add a nice touch and are easy to use. The light is a very nice led and a huge upgrade from standard bulbs.",

It comes with two 3 watt, 250-lumen bulbs which are a little weak if you're looking for lighting in a darker kitchen. We replaced them with 5 watt, 500-lumen bulbs and that really helped.
