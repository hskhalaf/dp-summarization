The shoes themselves are comfortable although they seem slightly smaller than any of my other roughly half dozen pair of Altras I\u2019ve owned, but are still within the realm of acceptable. My biggest complaints are to the seller who clearly sent me a pair that someone else had worn and returned as there were pebbles all through the treads, the laces were already tied up and there was no paper or cardboard inserts in the toes. Perhaps I\u2019m unreasonble, but for $120 I expect shoes that are brand new.",

I ran 3 miles today without an ounce of pain, and I haven't done that in years. I am an over-pronator and these shoes make my foot strike feel solid and comfortable. Thanks Altra, you've made running painless and enjoyable again!",
