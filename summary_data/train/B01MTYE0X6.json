This printer is VERY fast and the print quality is excellent. My only complaint is that this one particular machine will not cut between the labels when we print multiple badges at a time. I have another 820NWB (as well as QL800) which does cut between the labels. I have checked multiple times to ensure that auto cut is on and compared settings and they are set up the same so it must be this particular printer. Other than that it is a great printer.",

It automatically reads the size tapes installed as a final check before printing. Saved me a few times since my wife installed a different size for her uses and I was unaware of the change. I have not found any blank tapes that have not worked in it, but I am purchasing only compatible tapes to save the expense.",

I have owned the 500, 550 and now the 720NW, with small internal changes, all of these units operate about the same. User manual translation is OK, but you may have to re-read certain areas.",

Having used lots of Brother printers in the past and had very few problems I went with this. I have not been disappointed. It was easy to set up, sits on the wireless network without problems, the drop in labels are really simple. I use this for file folders, address labels and it is always there when I need it. Printing is super fast. Software is okay (using Windows 8) does what I need it to do and doesn't get in my way. I really like this device and would recommend it.",
