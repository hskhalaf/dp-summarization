I\u2019m normally a 7 in trainers but that didnt fit me, neither did a 7.5 so I had to order a size 8 which was a whole size up. Size 8 fit perfectly with a small gap in the toe but this is perfect for running. For casual wear I would recommend only going half a size up.",

      "text": "Sizing is exact. So make sure you get your feet measured properly. If you want an everyday leisure shoe, go slightly bigger, if you want them for running. Get a snug fit. They're well made, with a firm rubber coating over the sole. This gives them superb traction, but does make a small impact sound. The ankle padding is very firm, while walking I find this very noticeable, but when running, you don't feel it at all. Also noticed after a good run down the canal the feel of the trainer felt much better. Delivery wise, I ordered on the evening and received before lunch the next day. So very fast. And at an excellent price",

I've tried a few types since wearing out the reeboks - Adidas, Reeboks and Nike specifically and unfortunately after a few sessions just started rubbing in the wrong places. So noticed these on a deal and have to say I am very impressed, comfy and the soles just springy enough to give me that knee/ankle shock absorption without wasting too much energy. I'd say give these a try if you are doing intense HIIT such as running on spot, kettle bell jumping jack squats and burpees. Had them for a few months now and still showing strong.",

I have a neutral pronation and on first wearing these the inside of the arch on both feet felt tight and like they would cause a problem. But when I started walking and then running my feet just found a comfortable groove and have been happy since. I can't comment on durability as I haven't had them long enough but judging by the price and their build quality they are great for beginner's but may leave seasoned runner wanting.",
