This tablet comes with QuickRemote from LG and the IR blaster only works with this app, and this app sucks big time, it only supports some 6 TV brands nothing more. If you are buying this tablet for its IR blaster look somewhere else, don't buy it, you'll be disappointed as I was. I'm returning it...",

I'd been reading on it during my commute from work and closed it after getting off the train. Much later last night around 11:00 p.m. as I picked up the tablet to put it away; I felt a lot of heat emitting from the battery. I just bought this tablet; ordered on February 28th, 2019 and received it on March 4th, 2019. What do I do now that it's stopped working less than a month after making this purchase?!?!?!?!?!?!? I'm disappointed and annoyed at this happening so quickly after making this purchase!!!!!",

It did not take the best pictures but for a tablet used for the usual browsing, emailing, watching streaming videos, and listening to music, it was a well deserved tablet. It was packed with more features that I didn't need but they may come in handy soon (like IR remote). I also used it for Android development.",

The LG QuickRemote App will only control the major TV and Cable Box models and most 3rd party Apps state they will not work with the LG G Pad due to some proprietary code.

The internal storage capacity is a big issue, and you really need an external SD card if you are going to take more than a few pictures, record video, or want to add an average amount of apps to the device. Some apps won't install on an external storage device, so you can still run out of room even if you do add in a SD card. The device software takes up a very large chunk of the internal storage, so you don't get full use of the 8GB.",

Look online at reviews of OS Lollipop & u will c it only takes away from the user satisfaction of this tablet. I would also recommend 16GB cause u only have 3 & change available to u before upgrade (DOWNGRADE) & less after. A sd card helps but u r still limited in playstore.",
