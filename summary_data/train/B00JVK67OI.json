      "text": "First things first, love the bag! Would recommend to anyone and have for 2 of my colleagues at work who complimented it. Plenty of room for the essentials and I now have empty pockets because I can put what I need in the bag. The only drawback/negative is after 2 weeks of use, the strap over one of the buckles broke and now the buckle keeps releasing its spot. Minor annoyance, but just frustrated how it effects the look of the bag since it is so noticeable and of course on the front. Other than that, great bag, but would love a replacement if possible.",

      "text": "I bought this for my husband about 15 months ago and it is still in great condition. Part of that is that it is sturdy and well-made; the other part of that is that he treats it well. He uses it for work and loves it. It is beautiful and sturdy, as long as you do not fill it too full or regularly put heavy objects in it. The inside has a padded pocket that could hold a tablet, but is too small for a laptop. But a 13\" laptop fits in the main inside area. We also use it to carry our laptops when we go on trips. It is a roomy bag that looks really classy.",

It seems pretty much made for small weight items. Still give it 5 just due to delivery options available. Very good value for buck. Ordered 23:00 on Saturday received Sunday afternoon, NYC area.
