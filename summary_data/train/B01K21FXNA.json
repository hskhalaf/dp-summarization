For those unfamiliar with it, it is a trimmer that has a significant extension and the ability to adjust to cut at an angle. We use it on a very large pyracantha that is impossible to trim completely with a conventional trimmer After an initial charge, the battery has worked well, providing as much power as the original battery, if it not slightly more. It fits both the charger and the connection on the trimmer as if it were original. We haven't had it very long, but have been very happy with it thus far.",
