      "text": "I'd worked with these balls in the gym in the past and like them. I like the Valeo because they're easy to grip even if your hands get sweaty during the workout. It arrived promptly and completely inflated, so no problems there. It also comes with a booklet with some exercises in it, which I find helpful and a nice change to my routine. If you don't have one of these I recommend it for, if nothing else, a change to your exercise routine and, with this ball, you can work a lot of different areas.",

There are only 2 drawbacks I can see, one it's a bit bigger than I would like and two you find out after the purchase they recommend you buy a basketball pump.

The 12 pd ball is about the same size as a basketball and had a good grip to it which ensures you will hold onto it when you are doing chopping exersises. If you are doing the squat jump up and slam the ball down you will get the ball to bounce about waist high. If you are using the ball to do chest exersises by phusing / throwing ball to the wall you will get about a two foot bounce back.",

It actually reminds very much of the medicine balls that are found in gyms across this city. Professional grade. This medicine ball also comes with a very helpful poster that tells you exactly all sorts of different exercises that you can do with it.
