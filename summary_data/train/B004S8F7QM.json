So it's really a matter of opinion. I recommend it if you are pretty open minded and don't mind a lot of off color jokes and references. If you can recognize it's JUST a game; a game that can make you blush, cringe, and wince- all while snickering in a guilty fashion, you'll be fine. NOT for the faint of heart or sober adults. I don't recommend it as a gift though, unless you know the person really well, or like shocking people :)",

I've been playing it, And love it. The instruction manual is great too! Couldn't stop laughing. Hope you get it, If you have no limitations or can handle dark humor. I played it with my dad last night, And we both laughed so hard, We sprained our backs the next day. So sore, But it was well worth it. My dad nearly passed out laughing. The best that money can buy.",

I've played this with very different kinds of people and all enjoyed it immensely.",

I guess it's fun to play with people who have never played it, so you can see their reactions to the cards. But that's about it.",

We did throw those cards out cleaned and washed up obviously.",
