The LED lights are cool and my son's friends and him really like to play in the dark. The LED puck work for the most part, but I suspect that after a month of beatings they will probably stop working. The airflow on this machine is good. This machine is sturdy and heavy. I put this together by myself. Please keep in mind, that after assembly you will need more than 2 people to flip the machine right side up (the instructions recommend that the machine be assembled upside down).",
