When I first used this product it felt correct and had the right scent. Morrocanoil has a VERY DISTINCT SMELL. It changed into something like cheap hand lotion as it got closer to the bottom of the tube. I have been advised to not purchase Maroccanoil products from Amazon to purchase directly from their website. There is A LOT of counterfeit product on Amazon.",

My hair is much softer, doesn't break AS much, and it's not as poofy. I have naturally curly, wavy hair and the bleach really fried it.

      "text": "Great weekly conditioning treatment, even for colored hair. I use this after clarifying shampoo once a week for my daughter she is constantly in the pool which makes the hair brittle and green. After clarifying shampoo, hair is extremely dry and brittle feeling. Put this in your hair for about five minutes and your hair is silky and soft for at least a week! This stuff is great without a heavy, or greasy feel! Great price on Amazon!",

After a month of treatment, it is almost 100% back to normal. Her new stylist recommended this to try to salvage her hair and it worked perfectly. Expensive but worth every penny.",

I don't think I'll ever use anything else. This helps cut the frizz and makes my hair really soft. Great price on amazon compared to salon prices!",
