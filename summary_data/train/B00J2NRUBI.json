The technician mentioned that they are having a lot of quality issues with products sold on Amazon and he suggested to buy a new unit at Lowe's or Home Depot, which I found funny. Why should the quality on Amazon be different than Lowes or Home Depot? Why don't the simply do a better quality control? I will have to unmount the hose and return it. A lot of wasted time.",

For starters, the hose comes wound up, so it will not lay straight. Common problem and understandable, but still problematic. Second, the spikes they give you to hold the wound up hose down, are not long enough or strong enough to hold the hose in place. I tried for a few days to set it up and just could not get the sprinklers where they needed to be.",

No, the automatic setting no longer worked. But \"manual\" did, and turning it on to drip in the mornings was tolerable. Now the manual setting no longer works. Basically what you're buying here is some cheap tubing and a controller that may or may not work for several weeks, and then die.",

Also, make sure to buy a water-pressure regulator. This Raindrip system works well only when the water pressure is not too high - it needs to be around 20 psi. Otherwise, the high pressure prevents the water droplets from emitting through the tiny hose holes. I bought a regulator (from Amazon), which also works quite well.",

I use a little bit to coat the hose threads , regulator threads, and timer threads to stop leaks. I DO NOT use it on the tubing. Be prepared for sore fingers. And don't forget to use fresh batteries in the timer, turn on the faucet and use the manual setting for testing. I will update this review over time.",

      "text": "This is a wonderful system. I do not know in what world this system would be assembled in 20 minutes, though. My plants are not all in a row, evenly spaced, so it took some engineering to get the hoses adjusted. They include a generous amount of tubing and miscellaneous parts. I wish there had been better directions on how to set the timer. It has rained every day since I installed this, so have not really used it yet. I do think it's a great system, and I am excited to put it to good use",
