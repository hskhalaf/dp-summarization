I have 3 large dogs and 1 small and its the small one who likes to boomerang between the back and front seats constantly, its like watching ping pong. This seat barrier did the trick, now she sits there without all the zinging back n forth. What i like about this barrier is it's not obtrusive and not an eyesore. Very functional design. Peaceful driving again, thanks Petfect.",

Also, it barely fit across the front seat headrest stands (2014 Mazda 6); I had to loosen it as far as it would go and still hold tight. Nitpicking aside, this really works in keeping the dog in the backseat where he belongs for our safety while driving.",
