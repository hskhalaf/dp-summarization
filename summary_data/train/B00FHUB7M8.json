The reason I am giving it four stars is because if the water level goes slightly lower than the fill line\", it takes longer for the lather to come out. Another complaint is that sometimes, the lather is SO hot, it is too much for me to handle. Other times, it's not warm enough, no matter how long the latherer has been running. It still gets the job done, though and I haven't found another product that compares to it, so four stars seems reasonable even with my concerns.",

Because I shopped early for Father\u2019s Day, I was outside my 30 days to return to amazon. Contacted the Manufacturer and basically was told it was not their problem because I bought thru Amazon. Pretty expensive item for no one to claim responsibility!",

Hot lather every morning... I love it!!!",

We leave it on all the time as we are a barber shop open 12 hours daily. That way the lather is always hot. The lather comes out thick and warm. I somehow expected it to be runny.....but we were pleasantly surprised.",
