She found that small crack and turned it into tearing a chunk out within and hour, rendering the toy useless and unsafe.",

At first a bit bummed with those sharp plastic fasteners that stick out after you removed the ball from the carton. Not sure who designed that. Just silly.

You cannot really push the little thingies in (they come right out) or cut them closely enough, but you can actually pull them out without damaging the ball.

I've used a cuticle scissors, a tweezer, you cannot fully remove the tack so you have 4 sharp plastic nubs that the dog can cut their mouths on when playing. HOW DISAPPOINTING. I took the rating down on a decent product because of this hazard. Might not look like much, but run your finger over it to understand. Can't even push it in, when they bite down you still feel or worse it protrudes further",
