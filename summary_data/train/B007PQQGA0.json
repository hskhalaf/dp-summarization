      "text": "I LOVE my cradle! So thrilled to have found it on Amazon. I searched high and low for an elegant, classy looking cradle. I am NOT fond of the standard bassinets found on every well-known baby site and I definitely do NOT like the bassinets on wheels. I wanted the look of a crib without the size. This fit the bill perfectly and it looks awesome in my bedroom. Every family member who's seen it loves it. It's definitely an heirloom type of piece and could definitely be passed down from family member to family member. Very pleased with my purchase.",

Anyway, it seems to be of great quality and I'm happy overall. The cradle we received happened to fit together well and my husband had no problems putting it together. (previous reviewers mentioned the bottom not fitting) We haven't used it yet but I'm sure we will be happy to have it once she arrives.",
