As you can see from the pictures, it sits kind of funny in my smaller cars seats, but once you sit in the chair it fills the gap.

I bought him this pillow for Christmas, and while i will not say it is a cure, it has helped tremendously. The pillow forces him to sit up more and correcting his posture has alleviated the pain in his back and reduced his migraines significantly. The rest we attribute to dealing with a high stress job, and while the pillow is great for back relief, a miracle worker it is not. Thanks for an amazing product!",

This larger cushion is so much more comfortable; it hits my back in all the right places. (And since it is memory foam, I'm sure it will hit your back in all the right places too!) Having two straps ensures the cushion doesn't slide when attached to a chair. The cushion provides great back support on upholstered furniture too. Now I can sit on my couch again! I just bought a second cushion for myself, and another for my sister. :) Well worth the money!",

      "text": "While this support works well and seems to be constructed well buyers should be aware that if using on task chairs where there is a gap between the back and seat this unit doesn't hold its position well because the bottom of the two straps just clears the back of the seat and tends to slip down with use. The top strap is not sufficient to hold it in place. It would seem best suited to chairs that do not have a significant gap between the back and seat.",

I'm just a bit above average size-wise and this cushion is too narrow for my frame and the protruding sides of the cushion are putting pressure on the sides of my back in the kidney area. The cushion is made of memory foam but it's fairly stiff. Although it doesn't feel like a solid object poking me, it's still enough pressure to be uncomfortable. If you have a small frame this is probably a good option, anyone on the wider side should look for something else. I will be returning this and trying a lumbar support with a different form factor now that I know what to avoid.",

Cons: Because it is a bit thicker, it is hard to use on my dining room chairs. It puts me too far forward in the chair. Overall, this is a great cushion that was soft but still provided support.

It's so soft right now I can't imagine how quickly it will wear out with use. If you need any strength or firmness don't buy this overly soft pillow.

I\u2019ve been using it on my couch but my plan is to use it in my car. I\u2019m very short so the lumbar built into cars is a little higher on my back than feels good, so I\u2019m excited to have such a plush supportive caution with mesh covering (I\u2019m hoping the mesh will make it cooler) I\u2019ll update when I\u2019ve used it a few months to speak to it\u2019s longevity.",

Didn\u2019t want to shell the money for a chair with actual back support as they\u2019re very expensive so I found this product which can simply attach to any chair I already owned, and it makes the sitting experience so much more comfortable. I\u2019m slouching much less now which significantly improves my posture. If you\u2019re not happy with your chair, get this.",
