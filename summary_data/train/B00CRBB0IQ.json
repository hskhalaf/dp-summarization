She wasn't too happy about it, but at least I got it down her throat and it works. Try it. Or else use one of the needleless syringes they sell here on Amazon probably a 30 cc size. Good luck!",

      "EASIER THAN PILLS: Every cat owner has gone through the rigmarole of trying to get their pet to eat or swallow chews and sprinkles, only to have them crushed up and spit out.

Our joint aid employs a \u201cpour over\u201d feeding method, allowing you to simply mix it into your cat\u2019s favorite food. With a delicious seafood flavor, you won\u2019t have to worry about your cat not effectively taking their medicine.",
