I was able to replace it in less than 30 minutes. I never replaced a disposal before, in fact I'm not American so this is the first time that I actually saw one close enough. Easy instructions. Just took the broken one off, replaced the power cable, put the new one in place and done. Working like a charm.",

I didn't even bother to use the flange part that installs on the sink itself...just used the existing one. I did have one operator-error. I failed to read in the instructions where it says to remove the plug for the dishwasher inlet. This prevented our dishwasher from draining....and we thought our dishwasher was going bad too. Thankfully it was an easy fix to remove the plug and now everything is working fine. Hopefully I'll get another 16yrs from this one. :-)",

Functioned ok but due to the noise it gets a low rank. I did buy this in 12/19 and it's now 5/19 and it barely works anymore as well. Larger items continue to get stuck.
