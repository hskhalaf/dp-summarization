With no motion detection at all. Using it on an Echo Show is simply a live view but yet it uses up all your data plan. Makes no sense at all. I called support, anytime you view your camera its using your data. Nowhere does it actually tell you this. So I just paid $49 to view my camera live for 15 minutes....That has to be the dumbest thing ive heard when it comes to data usage and cameras.",

The function of a picture/video on demand is the most important of features to my company. Real time viewing of inclement weather has surpassed the cost of the camera by saving money on labor & fuel.
