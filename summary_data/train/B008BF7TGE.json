It only says \u201cfast dissolve\u201d but I just thought that meant you would swallow it like a pill and it would be absorbed into your body quickly. Also nowhere in the description or on the bottle is there a picture of what the tablet actually looks like. That would have tipped me off because it is a large disk (like a Tums) so I would have realized it was chewable.",

Very tough to chew and swallow without a lot of water. I like the taste of the Natrol B-complex, it is smooth and non-acidic. A great option for a vitamin B complex.",
