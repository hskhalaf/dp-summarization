Stupid design flaw, though - two of the pieces can't be separated, making for a hassle when washing and also making it awkward to use slicing discs with large items like potatoes or large hunks of cheese. It's not a deal breaker, but it was a dumb design choice and a step back from the last Cuisinart I had (which I accidentally destroyed - no fault of Cuisinart's).",

      "title": "11 Cups?",
      "text": "I purchased this to replace a DLC-5 (type 25) 7 cup processor. I quickly discovered that the bowl sizes were nearly identical. There was a 3/4\" height difference in the bowls but I don't see how you can fit 4 cups in that space. A bit disappointed in the descriptions accuracy as I was expecting a sizeable difference. I have used it and it performs well, but has a delicate interlock on the chute that I fear may break easily. The motor is heavy like my old one so the stability is good. I'll likely keep it now that I have it but I might not have pulled the trigger had I known what I know now.",
