Would definitely reccommend to someone with normal eyesight who wants to give their eyes a little TLC while working at a computer all day.",

Additionally, the yellow tinge of the lenses is almost imperceptible, plus the design of the glasses is super fashionable and flattering to most face shapes. In short, I love these glasses!

Wearing the glasses, my eyes look and feel so much better. I was skeptical to say the least, but at around $15, I figured it was worth a try. They actually work, and are stylish enough to wear throughout the day. I'm a fan and would recommend to anyone who spends long hours staring at a screen.",
