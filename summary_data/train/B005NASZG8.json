The metal hose is also at a terrible angle and does not adjust for going under beds or furniture. Do NOT purchase without seeing a product like this in person. This is the problem with buying online.

There is this really odd \"ring\" attachment system where you have to screw an attachment piece on, while somehow engaging a metal ring to get a snug connection. It made it exceptionally difficult to attach different pieces. I could manage this maybe 1 out of 20 or 30 tries. As others have mentioned, the \"S\" tube is pretty huge. Too big if you're under 5'9 or so, so shorter users beware. The cannister is also pretty large, not majorly so, but you need to attend to your workspace or you'll back into things.

The length of the \"wand\" cannot be reduced for the use of the attachments, so every attachment has a full length wand. Further, the floor attachments don't swivel, so maneuvering it requires large movements of the lengthy wand. This makes the backpack extremely awkward and nearly unusable in bathrooms, laundry rooms, etc. I think it would be fine for large office spaces. I especially liked the clear view to the bag, strong suction, replaceable extension cord, and the size/weight. We previously had an Aspira backpack and used it for about 15 years, but it had much better maneuverability.",

Using it to do everything puts a lot of ware and tare on the vacuum. Definitely invest into two if you plan to use it everyday",

I'm 5 ft and 95 lb, so this can wear me out after about an hour or more of lugging it around. Overall, I love it. It does what it claims to do...SUCK!",

    "description": "You don't have to vacuum in pain or in any discomfort with the Hoover C2401 Shoulder Vac commercial backpack vacuum cleaner. This handy vacuum cleaner stores all of its collected dust and debris in a backpack canister, allowing you to clean without any obstructions. As one year-old toddlers often weigh less than 10 lbs., so does the C2401 backpack vacuum! The C2401 vacuum cleaner is also compact so that you can clean out narrow passageways, small spaces, as well as large areas with ease and comfort. The C2401 can carry up to 6.4 quarts of dust and debris. You can also monitor its dust capacity with its clear dome lid so it is easy to know when to empty its collection bag. The C2401 can be used with a shake out cloth liner or with a disposable paper bag insert, allowing you the flexibility of choices and options needed for a versatile cleaning job. HEPA filters, like that included in a C2401 back pack vacuum cleaner, eliminates up to 99.97% of particles 0.3 microns or smaller. That means that allergens such as dust mite debris, dust mites, pollen, and much more are trapped and locked away. Attachment Kit: Includes backpack, 60\" positive locking hose, 38\" two piece straight metal wands, 6\" crevice tool, 11\" turbo floor tool, 2\" dusting brush and 4\" upholstery tool.",
