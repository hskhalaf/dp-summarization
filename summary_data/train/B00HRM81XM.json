Apparently, it is 100% guarantee or your money back (plus the letter they sent was very funny which made them seem like a fun company!)

Instant communication once you purchase the product, constant communication of when the product was packed and when it was shipped. It was at my doorstep within just a day or two minus the weekend of course. But I was extremely pleased with the efficient process and timely delivery of the product. I highly recommend the product to anyone who does any grilling whatsoever.",
