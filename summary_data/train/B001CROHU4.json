It works very well with my Polk speakers and I have two pairs hooked in parallel to the amplifier. Sound quality is great and power is enough for two pairs. I recommend wherever you install this device to well ventilate the area because it will get hot. Also note it comes with two Ethernet ports so that you can daisy chain the port with another amplifier or device, thus saving a port on the switch.",

The only thing we'd like is if the Amp was more powerful, especially since they are driving outdoor speakers. We find the volume is often above 1/2 way to just get decent background volume. Our setup has the Amp in the basement with speaker wires running out and up to the deck - I'm sure most people can find a similar solution.",

We've done everything - all the reboots, attaching ethernet directly, testing on single speakers, etc. It appears to be a wifi issue, but the issue seems to be within the Sonos equipment and inability to receive a signal with no solution. I received a shrug from the company so I guess I'm just out of luck.",

We are now able to play music from our Sonos system on our outdoor patio without any hassle. Since Sonos doesn't make their own outdoor speakers I think this is the best route you can go!",

I've also tested it with my Rega floor standers, and that worked great too. Well made and worth the price, IMHO. The only surprise was that I had expected it to be the same size as the Sonos Connect, but it's quite a bit larger. So that's the only caveat in case you're putting it somewhere with limited space. Looks good though, so it can easily sit somewhere where it's visible and not be annoying.",

If you are connecting more than 1 speaker per channel, I would recommend that you check the impedance on your connected speakers to make certain that 2-speakers on each side are between 4-8 ohms. Mine were 4.3 ohms. Less than 4 ohms will blow the amp. Also make certain that you have a good WiFi network since your iPhone or iPad will connect with it to control your system. I also connect my Sonos service with Google Play and now I have an amazing music library that I can play at the pool. Great product.",
