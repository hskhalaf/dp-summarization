Was easy to put together and the drawer is a good size. The reviews that say the drawer is wrong, it\u2019s only goes in the wrong direction if that is how you put it together. Only complaint I have is that the instructions are pictures. That is it. It isn\u2019t built like a heavy duty truck, but it is well enough to get the job done. Shouldn\u2019t be leaning on it anyway is my thought. If you\u2019re doing nails this really is a good table.",
