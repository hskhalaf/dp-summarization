I've been using the new Sharp for a couple of months now, and overall I am very pleased with my choice.",

However I think most of us will just use a microwave to heat or re-reheat food regardless of the bells and whistles available. That's all I've used this one for, and it works great for that. I doubt that I will ever use it as a PRIMARY cooking appliance, and I'm glad I choose this relatively economical model.",

So your options are: - Press \"+30\" seven times to get to 3 minutes 30 seconds, or - Press \"Power\" - \"3\" - \"3\" - \"0\" - \"Start\" -- (which is odd because you have to press \"Power\" to set the cook time and because \"Start\" is labeled \"Start +30\" but in this case it doesn't \"+30\".)",
