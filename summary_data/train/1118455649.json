Excellent for researching ingredients, and as always, the simplicity of a basic recipe, followed by alternative versions, and recipe additions - all great! Our family is mostly vegetarian (no red meat at all) And I try to cook vegan most weekday evenings. I've found the recipes helpful for providing nutritional balance and full flavor.",
