      "text": "This is my third LAMY Pico pen as I find them very handy to carry in my pocket. The only issue I have with them is that since they are small and the barrel is \"polished\", it falls out of my pocket when I'm sitting and reach for change in my pocket (drive-thru). After loosing two (over five years), I put a rubber \"sleeve\" (about 1\" long) around the pen (from a cheap ballpoint) that provides some resistance inside the pocket. This works well and actually helps me hold the pen when writing with it.",

Easy to work pen when you need a pen to sign anything. Refills are available. They are also unique and often people will ask where did I find these. My first was found in a formal stationary store but now there are several colors available on Amazon. My always with me pen. Works great and will last for many years. Very well made product.

Thankful, it is easier than my thinner pens. Of course, it doesn't take away the pain, but its thickness makes it easier to write with. Expect normal Lamy ballpoint quality from the ink and pen itself. I just wish it had a clip. This is a winner for me. I may end up with all the colors! Sadly, after about a month, I've lost this pen. I got another in white. Same quality and experience. Hopefully, I don't lose this one.",
