In the case of this SOG Entrenching Tool, I am extremely disappointed in it overall. At $11, you would think that this would be a great buy to add to your camping kit, but unfortunately this little foldable shovel is extremely dull, and flimsy. You better be digging in the softest dirt ever, or you might be digging for quite a long time. I'm really confused at how this shovel got such great reviews, I gave mine away and wouldn't recommend anyone to buy this folding shovel.",

Update: After using this little shovel digging around sand and rock along a river beach area I've managed to break it =( The piece that actually broke is where the rivets hold the shovel spade(head) to the folding hinge piece. The just: the rivets loosened allowing the hinge bracket piece to flex, ultimately stressing the steel beyond its elasticity resulting in it breakage. I guess to sum things up it's a decent little shovel for the price, and is compact and would likely serve its intended purpose. Great to fold up and throw behind the seat of the truck.",

      "text": "Decent shovel for adding to a survival kit, but make sure you understand how small 18\u201d is. It does fold up very nicely and comes with a bag/sleeve (which is essential due to the pointer saw teeth on one side of the blade). The locking mechanisms aren\u2019t the tightest and that was my biggest issue with this shovel. I purchased two for a set of car emergency kits and had planned to purchase a third at a later time for my own kit, but after seeing the actual product I\u2019ll be doing more looking around.",

The first folding type shovel I bought wasn't too great as the thread-in design actually caused the threads to jump and eventaully widen the hole so it never stayed tight. This item gets better leverage; it cuts similar to a planter's trowel. The locking, tho, isn't completely tight and the blade can move a little but it doesnt affect function. The shovel blade could stand to be thicker.",
