By itself it is a fast absorbing, but as a stand alone moisturizer this wouldn't be good but if you used it with another product you can lock in the moisture. The more natural a product is the quicker you body absorbs. To reiterate, this is the closest thing to natural as I have used, pretty much one step from breaking open an aloe stem.",

It is gelly-ish and has a smell of cucumber mixed with banana kind....it really did not matter to me. Applied it to my face as a face pack and had it overnight. Rinsed it this morning and I feel my face looked bright and toned. Will recommend this to friends and family. Will buy this again!",
