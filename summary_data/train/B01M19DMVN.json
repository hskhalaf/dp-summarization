The use of high-quality materials, a lightweight feel and an ergonomic design round out the benefits. I am also very happy to state that I have already found a host of coins and other items. Considering that I have only had this detector for two months, I could not be happier. I would definitely recommend this unit to anyone who is looking for a cost-effective and yet powerful metal detector.",

Within minutes found a nail, a piece of tin trash, and an old triangular piece of iron . That's without knowing anything! Just read instructions and will go back outside and try again! I really like it and am very excited to \"treasure hunt\" on my four acres! Great product with my limited knowledge and experience for under $200.00!",
