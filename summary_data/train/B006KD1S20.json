So, I go to the Rachael Ray website, they identify their manufacturer/supplier as Meyer Corp. I mail it to them for almost as much as the bag cost. I got it back today from Meyer disavowing any responsibility for the bag. Just a bad experience all the way around--cheap zipper, Amazon declined to replace it, the Rachael Ray company disavowed the product. Buyer beware.",

It had really good ratings at Cook's Illustrated, who actually tested things like how well it kept things chilled, so I'll have to trust them on that one. The quality looks and feels very nice.",

These two ideas are a statement for a picnic and paired with our watermelon painted picnic basket....we look mighty fine at the river or a roadside park or a festival!!! It cleans easily and has an outside pocket, too!!! thanx Rachael Ray!!!",

I use totes a lot to avoid using plastic bags and we also shop frequently out of town so bring cold or frozen foods home and may make a stop or two on the way. Love it. Have already given one as part of a gift and would highly recommend it.",

I can't imagine how big the \"jumbo\" size would be, since this bag is fairly large itself. I purchased it to keep our meats chilled on grocery/errand days--and will test that out soon. My first impression, though, is that this tote will hold up quite well. The stitching looks great, the size is perfect, and it's all around attractive. :)",

      "text": "I purchased this on the recommendation of America's Test Kitchen, and they were not wrong! Generally, I avoid chef-branded gear, as it's usually low-quality stuff - you end up buying the name, not a quality product. However, this insulated bag is the exception to that rule - roomy without being so big as to become impossibly heavy when full, well-constructed, and most importantly, keeps cold items cold. We keep it in the back of the car, where it does double duty in keeping our take-out pizza warm on the ride home (works great!). Definitely a worthwhile purchase.",
