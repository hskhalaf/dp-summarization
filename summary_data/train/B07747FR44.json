It also destroys the somewhat grainy feel of the older model which mimiced real paper. Text quality should be the first priority in developing new READING devices.

The battery life is improved with an automatic sleep function, meaning that it takes a little longer for the kindle to come to life when opened ( I use a cover for mine so it still retains the feeling of opening a book.) All in all, a worthwhile purchase.",

It is very slow; the home page shows only a limited number of books, I couldn\u2019t find an email facility.

She was actually more than happy with her Generation 4 Kindle (several years old) and would probably never have bought a new one until that died but now she says she couldn't go back. It's much sleeker than the Gen 4 it's replaced and lighter too. I was concerned that the back light would demolish the battery life quicker but it seems to last for weeks even with the back light on all the time. If you're a Kindle user and have a much older generation then this is a must-have upgrade and worth every penny.",

      "text": "I wanted a new Paperwhite as an upgrade to an old one I had. Really love it! Much like my old one in look and weight, however, my old one was a bit glitchy and would have a longer touch-screen reaction time, and the battery was going. The power wouldn't last very long. This one has: - Smoother screen texture. - I have the option to change the screen to black background/white font for when I read in bed - Quicker response time (although that could be because mine was old) - Longer battery life Haven't used the Whispersync feature yet but definitely something I would use.",

      "text": "Really like this. Lost a star as I bought it for one specific reason. And that was so that I could have audio books and reading books on the same device. My expectation was that I could listen to the audio book while reading it as well. As someone who struggles with dyslexia I really benefit from listening and reading at the same time in order to digest the information. If anyone from the Kindle team sees this could implementing a audible overlay to my books be considered for a future software update. It would be a game changer for people like me who struggle with reading!!!",

However, watch out for the special offers small print which leads to you getting advertisements on a piece of tech already costing over 100 pounds. I bought from Argos and it clearly wasn't advertised. I Have discussed with Amazon who said there is nothing they can do to get rid of them. Poor service.",

Having read the reviews I was a little reluctant as people said it is easy to turn itself off and turn over too many pages at once. All this is true but you just need to persevere and get used to the extra sensitivity of the touch screen and hold it so you are not pressing on the on/off button. I am still delighted with my new purchase after 6 months continuous use, I paid the extra ten pound so I didn't get annoying ads. Well worth it.",

It is a paper white bought it in bundle together with cover and special fast charger including its own cable. It is also slim, the cover matches perfectly its size, the text is very clear. Immediately after setting it up, all my library from the old kindle has been transferred on it so, in short time the new kindle was ready to be used. The price is quite affordable as it will be paid in instalments over the following months. All in all, nice purchase.",

I called customer service and they were rude and wouldn't answer my questions. Finally I was offered a small percentage off a new one and they told me to complain on a review and maybe Amazon will help me. I cannot believe the poor customer service. After nothing but good service from Amazon for years, they can't even replace my still new device. I am very disappointed in Amazon.",

What a difference, no more silly buttons on the side which I used to manage to knock frequently, nice simple touch screen. I do still have a bit of an issue finding the books that I transferred over, but I think that is me rather than the Kindle. The back light is brilliant, means I can finally read in bed comfortably. Very pleased with it.",
