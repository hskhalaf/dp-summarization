We needed a phone that would be pretty foolproof when it came to hanging it up. It has satisfied that requirement very well. As a bonus, the handset, although an old style, works much better than the typical cordless phone. The earcup is large and covers the ear nicely, and with the volume adjustment, really improves my Dad's ability to hear. The microphone is closer to his mouth, making his speech clearer to the other party. We are very happy with this purchase.",

When attempting to call him, the phone would almost always be of the hook and we would have to go to check on him as the phone wouldn't be hung up. He has a hard time hearing and the volume control on the handset was a blessing and the phone is now always hung up. I always liked the wheeled volume control for finer volume control but this works great as the wheeled controls are no longer available.",
