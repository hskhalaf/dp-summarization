I don't recall, but the online description seems to only give the recommended animal size, rather than the actual dimensions of the pod. The latter would be helpful (if not already added to the description). Also, the package notes that the pod will not begin to breakdown for 3-5 years. I want something that breaks down much more quickly.",
