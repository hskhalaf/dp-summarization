It does come in a crate and my husband did struggle a little breaking the crate apart but he has mowed 6 acres in 4 hours which normally take 8 to 10 hours. This mower was a great purchase.",

I mow 10 acres of bahia grass which is very tough with no effort. My neighbor who owns a lawn maintenance business has used it on many occasions when his equipment was down. I have nothing but praise for this equipment. One Spindle replaced, belts, and blades is about all the repairs required over six years. Oil changes lube jobs air filter and oil filters for routine maintenance. Hope the new one with a 27 horse power engine works as well.",

Since then I find bolts and parts on the ground and don't know where they belong. Yesterday another blade fell off and then later the belt to the pulleys became jammed. The seat sensor went bad and it wouldn't start. Maybe I got a lemon but you guessed it it's just out of warranty. I've had nothing but trouble with this mower. Wish I looked at competing brands better.",
