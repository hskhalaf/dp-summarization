If I known it had a switch you had to activate to use it, I would have never purchased this item. It's so 'odd' that they would think of this. When you do switch it on, the light from the button is very bright and stays on, burning your battery.. Part of the 're-thought' I guess is to remove the safety out of the lid and put it on a switch on the bottom. This is a 're-engineered' disaster, and makes it very un usable since you can't pick it up and use it without turning it on.",

There seems to be less harshness in smoking and less heat as only the heat from the burning product is sucked into the bong. WHY FOUR STARS?......CON ....One drawback is the cap. The cap keeps flopping around when lighting so you have to work around it. I wish there was a way to control the flopping around cap.",

The only downside is that you have to touch the top of the lighter to whatever you are lighting, so it puts your hand really close to the fire and you can't safely light anything with any kind of accelerant on it.",

Also the flip top tends to fall in place when you are trying to say light a candle. Takes a bit to get used to that so you hold it in a way that will light the candle without the top getting wax on it or blocking your path.",

That's my fault though, it's just a little less usable than I was hoping for, but for fifteen bucks I'd probably have bought it even if I had known what i know now.

      "text": "Was recommended as a good cigar torch...so far, I'm not convinced. It struggled to get a cigar lit. The plasma does not extend far enough out to hit the tobacco. You really need to hold it in place for 30 seconds to get the cigar to glow a bit, then puff away, hoping the ember grows. I'll stick with a flame for now, but will keep this as a back up.",

No more worries about wind while out on the patio, and the usb charging works well to charge up the battery for your next sesh.",

It still works just fine after using it for all sorts of fireworks and things that explode. It's gotten very dirty and it's been through a lot in a short amount of time and then sat for a year. It still works great tho. Lasts forever too, never needed an actual lighter for the past 2 years. 100% recommend for people who buy lighters all the time.",
