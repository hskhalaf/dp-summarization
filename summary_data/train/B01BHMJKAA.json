The only con is that it comes with markers and the holes are too small for crayons. IMO this basically makes it unusable on a road trip situation. I know pencils and pencil colors work too but they also have a sharper point which can be dangerous for younger kids when not being monitored.",

We were worried that she wouldn't have the motor skills to use it without frustration, so we got her the Spirograph Jr. It's great because it holds everything in place so she can just move the pen around and create the pictures. She loves it and has no trouble using it. Also, almost any pen, pencil, or thin marker works with it, so when the markers it comes with go dry, they're easy to replace. When the paper in the kit runs out, a regular piece of typing paper cut in half works great.",
