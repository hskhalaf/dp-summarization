      "text": "We are long time Canon camera owners so we bought this when we planned our trip to raft the Grand Canyon. Within days of being on the water the camera became fogged. After that point the camera was unable to take a picture that didn't just look like fog. While the camera was splashed some, it was never submerged at all. Essentially, it failed at its basic task. We watched with sadness as others on the trip with Fuji and other cameras continued to use their waterproof cameras throughout the trip.",

After owning it for about one year (used maybe 10 times total), it started making a clicking sound when taking video. I suspect the stabilization mechanism was broken, but turning the stabilization off did not eliminate the clicking sound. I sent it back to the manufacturer for repair, and they wanted to charge me the cost of a new Canon D20 to replace it. The manufacturer did not tell me why it was clicking, did not offer a discount to purchase a new one, and did not provide any other assistance.",

We took it on a family cruise last year (sorry for the late review, but almost a year and a half later, it's still holding up). We've taken it to beaches, pools, water parks, theme parks... and don't have to worry about it getting splashed on. Battery life holds up pretty well, too. Have no complaints except having to be careful that it doesn't accidentally sink. But since it's bright blue, it's easy to find in the even that you drop it. My friend's waterproof camera has a floating strap that I should look into, but it's fine without it. Highly recommend!",

I've been an avid Canon camera user for years now and this one is great. If you don't want a GoPro this is a nice alterative. Pros: Durable, lovely color, solid water seal, good battery life Cons: When the lens is wet you NEED something dry to wipe it so that your pictures won't be blurry, size (it's bigger than a normal point and shoot)",

Removing and replacing the battery did not enable the camera to successfully start. It had some problems focusing when not zoomed to minimum focal length, so perhaps that was a warning sign? It did take some very nice pictures under water and image quality (when it focused) was good. The water seals worked as advertised and the camera has a good physical design. I hope Canon can address the manufacturing issue with the lens and turn this into a solid win. For now I am returning this unit and will be turning to another brand.",

The image quality was a little better with the D10, but the size and shape of the D20 is much better, with exception of the attachment point of the strap. The location doesn't allow it to be placed upright on a flat surface with the stap's lug attached. Thankfully this issue seems to have been resolved with the D30 as far as I can tell from the pictures of the new camera.",

    "title": "Canon PowerShot D20 12.1 MP CMOS Waterproof Digital Camera with 5x Image Stabilized Zoom 28mm Wide-Angle Lens a 3.0-Inch LCD and GPS Tracking (Blue) (OLD MODEL)",
    "description": "Product Packaging:Standard PackagingThe Canon 6145B100 PowerShot D20 12.1MP Outdoor Camera can handle it all. This camera is waterproof to 33 feet, temperature-resistant from 14\u00b0F to 104\u00b0F, shockproof up to 5.0 feet, and equipped with a GPS tracker. Slim and sturdy with a highly visible color layout, its buttons are operable even with gloved hands. Spectacular image quality is ensured with the 12.1 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor and DIGIC 4 Image Processor for excellent low-light performance, and a 5x Optical Zoom with 28mm Wide-Angle Lens that brings excitement to your imaging. A single touch and you will be shooting incredibly vivid 1080p Full HD Video with full zooming capability. Lots of optional accessories take you deeper underwater and more.What's in the box: Canon PowerShot D20 Waterproof Digital Camera (Blue), NB-6L Lithium-Ion Battery Pack (3.7v, 1000mAh), CB-2LY Battery Charger for Canon NB-6L Lithium-Ion Battery, IFC-400PCU USB Interface Cable, Wrist Strap WS-DC8, Strap Mount, Digital Camera Solution CD-ROM and Limited 1-Year Warranty.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\nLET THE ADVENTURE BEGIN\nOutdoorsy, adventurous types need to look no further for a camera that can handle it all. The PowerShot D20 digital camera is waterproof to 33 feet, temperature-resistant from 14\u00b0F to 104\u00b0F, shockproof up to 5.0 feet, and equipped with a GPS tracker. Slim and sturdy with a highly visible color layout, its buttons are operable even with gloved hands. Spectacular image quality is ensured with the 12.1 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor and DIGIC 4 Image Processor for excellent low-light performance, and a 5x Optical Zoom with 28mm Wide-Angle Lens that brings excitement to your imaging. A single touch and you'll be shooting incredibly vivid 1080p Full HD Video with full zooming capability. Lots of optional accessories take you deeper underwater and more. \n\nPUT THE POWERSHOT D20 TO THE TEST\nWATERPROOF, SHOCKPROOF AND FREEZE-RESISTANT DESIGN \nCanon created the PowerShot D20 to be the tough, practical companion you'll want to bring on all your outdoor adventures, making it possible to capture truly impressive stills and video while doing what you love. Scuba dive, snorkel, paddle surf and more: the camera is waterproof all the way to 33 feet. Performance is fast and reliable in temperatures from 14\u00b0 to 104\u00b0F, so it's safe for everything from winter sports to summer hiking. Shockproof up to 5.0 feet, the PowerShot D20 is also able to survive the accidental falls and bumps inherent to mountaineering, biking, and other outdoor activities.\n\nEXPERIENCE THE POWER\nCANON HS SYSTEM\nThe Canon HS SYSTEM lets you take bright, clear photos in an even wider range of shooting situations. Beautiful low-light shots are possible with minimal noise and maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas. The system is the result of two technologies brought together in PowerShot cameras: a high-sensitivity imaging sensor, which is able to capture more light; and the DIGIC Image Processor, which actively reduces noise with high-speed image processing. The 12.1 Megapixel CMOS sensor in the PowerShot D20 incorporates advanced light reception technology that enhances sensitivity. The DIGIC 4 Image Processor provides a major boost in noise reduction, expanding the usable ISO range to an amazing high of 3200. The Canon HS SYSTEM takes the frustration out of low-light shooting, delivering clear, blur-free images.\n\nDIGIC 4 IMAGE PROCESSOR \nCanon DIGIC Image Processors have set the standard for functionality and performance since their groundbreaking introduction in 1999. With each successive generation, DIGIC processors have brought elevated performance and powerful new features to PowerShot digital cameras. The DIGIC 4 Image Processor has ushered in a new level of picture quality and accelerated processing, making possible features such as high-speed continuous shooting, HD video and Face Detection Self-timer.\n\nMEMORABLE MOMENTS IN SPECTACULAR FULL HD\nCANON FULL HD VIDEO ADVANTAGE \nIn addition to the Canon HS SYSTEM, the combination of the advanced CMOS sensor and DIGIC 4 Image Processor in the PowerShot D20 makes it possible to shoot crisp, clear high definition video. Imagine the fun and excitement of being able to shoot spectacular 1080p Full HD that you can later watch on your HDTV or download to your computer to share with family and friends. In addition to being able to shoot Full HD 1080p video at 24* frames per second, the PowerShot D20 can also shoot 720p HD video at 30** frames per second.\n\nDEDICATED MOVIE BUTTON, WIND FILTER FEATURE AND OPTICAL ZOOM FOR EASY VIDEO CAPTURE \nIt's never been easier to shoot videos with a PowerShot digital camera. The PowerShot D20 has a dedicated movie button that lets you start and stop recording instantly. There is no need to go through layers of menus or operate switches or dials to switch to and from video recording mode. The camera is always ready to shoot stills or video whenever you want. The PowerShot D20 also incorporates an electronic wind filter, which suppresses wind noise that can muffle or distort the sound. And unlike less sophisticated point-and-shoot cameras, the PowerShot D20 lets you use the full range of optical zoom when you're shooting a video.\n\nHDTV PLAYBACK VIA HDMI OUTPUT AND CEC \nIt's easy to enjoy and share the videos you shoot with the PowerShot D20. Simply connect its HDMI terminal to your HDTV using an HDMI cable. And because the PowerShot D20 supports HDMI-CEC technology, you'll be able to control the playback of your images and videos on any CEC-enabled HDTV using the TV's remote control. (CECConsumer Electronic Control \u2013 is part of the HDMI specification, enabling components in a system to communicate with one another.)\n\nIFRAME\nWith the PowerShot D20, you can also shoot video in the Apple\u00c2\u00ae iFrame format, which is a computer-friendly standard that speeds up importing and editing of videos. It keeps file sizes small, making it more convenient to upload or e-mail high-quality videos. The iFrame format enjoys native support in compatible Mac and Windows video applications, making it unnecessary to perform time-consuming and often quality-degrading conversions.\n\nDYNAMIC IMAGES, EASY TO SHOOT AND REVIEW\n5X OPTICAL ZOOM WITH 28MM WIDE-ANGLE LENS \nThe PowerShot D20's optical brilliance is a perfect match for the outdoor adventures the camera's tough design supports. The 5x Optical Zoom (operable during video recording, too) brings wildlife and other difficult-to-approach subjects close. The 28mm Wide-Angle Lens (35mm equivalent: 24\u00e2\u20ac\u201c140mm) makes all your shots more dynamic, and allows you to capture landscapes with their magisterial breadth intact.\n\n\n\n\n\nPURECOLOR SYSTEM LCD \nMany LCD screens on the market today use a striped arrangement of dots that works great for text and menus, but is not ideal for imagery. The PowerShot D20's PureColor System LCD uses a delta arrangement of dots, which works better for the organic nature of photos and videos, allowing you to review your images with exceptional clarity with rich, true-to-life color. The PureColor System LCD is also ultra-durable to withstand heavy use in all sorts of conditions. Just as importantly, it offers clarity you won't find elsewhere. Outdoors in sunlight, color is faithfully reproduced, while a high contrast ratio ensures that you'll see exactly what you're shooting from any viewing angle. This makes it easy to frame shots quickly in tight situations.\n\nOPTICAL IMAGE STABILIZER\nHandheld shooting can often lead to camera shake, making photos and videos blurry. Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer is a sophisticated system that uses lens-shift technology to correct for unwanted camera movement. It makes handheld photography more practical, providing excellent image quality in many difficult shooting situations: outdoors at dusk, inside without a flash, and even at the telephoto end of the zoom range without a tripod. For photos, it enables shooting at slower shutter speeds, accommodating more low-light shooting situations than ever before without having to boost ISO sensitivity. With camera shake and vibration reduced, you get a sharper, steadier image. And because it is an optical system, there is none of the image degradation typical with electronic image stabilizers.\n\nTHE IDEAL TRAVELING COMPANION\nGPS TECHNOLOGY\nThe PowerShot D20 digital camera is equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS)* technology. Now you can travel the world and let the camera automatically record the locations** and local times of your stills and videos. The camera can also use the GPS unit to automatically set the exact time. You can maximize the usefulness of the GPS feature by using the special bundled Map Utility software that makes it fun to share the memories of your world adventures. In addition to displaying all your photos' locations on a world map, the camera's GPS system can also track your route from photo to photo \u2013 a great way to visualize each trip! You can also create and share custom maps and personal mini-travel guides with friends and family members.\n*In certain countries and regions, the use of GPS may be restricted. Therefore, be sure to use GPS in accordance with the laws and regulations of your country or region. Be particularly careful when traveling outside your home country. As a signal is received from GPS satellites, take sufficient measures when using in locations where the use of electronics is regulated.\nThis software uses Google Maps for displaying maps.\n** GPS tracking does not work underwater.\n\nA STEADY IMAGE IS A BEAUTIFUL IMAGE\nINTELLIGENT IS\nThe latest advance in Canon Optical Image Stabilization technology, Intelligent IS analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation. For stills, the system automatically selects among Normal, Panning, Macro (Hybrid) and Tripod IS modes. When shooting video, the system automatically selects among Dynamic, Powered, Macro and Tripod IS modes. With Intelligent IS, you can concentrate on image capture, letting the camera make the most effective IS settings to assure the steadiest possible image.\n\nNormal Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills.\n\nPanning Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement.\n\nMacro (Hybrid) Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting.\n\nDynamic Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking.\n\nPowered Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified.\n\nTripod When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed.\n\n\nTAKE THE FUN EVEN FURTHER\nOPTIONAL ACCESSORIES \nA full range of optional accessories designed specifically for the PowerShot D20 take its fun and functionality to new heights. A Waterproof Case and Float are perfect for shooting in deeper waters down to 131 feet. A Carabiner Strap and Shoulder Strap keep the camera at hand during biking, climbing, hiking or any physical activity. A Silicone Jacket and Soft Case provide protection from the elements without adding extra weight.",
