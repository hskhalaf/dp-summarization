I was able to 5-6 days worth of outfits, 4 pairs of pajamas, and lots of underwear and socks. I also was able to fit a few pairs of shoes as well. There is a zipper pocket that can hold more clothes. In our case I use that to hold his toiletries. When we aren\u2019t using it for travel he would use it to pack his toys and play in. It his highly durable. The fun graphics on it is great as well!",

The extending handle on it makes me nervous; seems cheap and I fear it will break in the future. The rest of the suitcase seems so much more durable than the handle.",

Backpack is only good for snacks. Child loved having his own luggage. It\u2019s sturdy and was easy for him to maneuver the carry on. He loved the backpack. Only issue was the size of the \u201cluggage\u201d - I should have paid attention to the dimensions. Going to try to locate the bigger size to add to these pieces.",

I could pop it out easily enough with my hands and the wheels all still roll well enough, but there's a bit of visual damage which remains. The backpack easily fits 3small playdough tubs, 2 board books, 6 diapers, wipes, a milk cup and a small toy (current contents in mine). The suitcase fits winter clothes for 1 week:(jacket, shirts, pants, sweatshirts, socks, shoes, jammies and toiletries for 1 week).",
