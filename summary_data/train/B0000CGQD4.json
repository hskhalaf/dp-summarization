When I open an oversized can of sauce, I put my hand underneath just in case, but it even handles those cans well. For the price, this is a great little can opener.",

Such a small change can make a big difference in someone's self-perception of their abilities. I highly encourage this for those who don't like or aren't able to open cans anymore; it's worth the money, I promise. My mother's happiness, at least, was 100% worth it no matter how much money I spent.",

I will say...it's VERY lightweight and will tip forward easily. Also, it crimps the lids in an odd way but I wonder if they all do this because the other two new models I tried did the same thing.
