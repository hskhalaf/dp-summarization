On the closed up picture you can see where the layers have split apart! Not happy at all!",

I think it's one of the largest desks currently available on Amazon, which is just what I wanted. I am so happy with the desk, I decided to write this review, I consider it money well spent.",

I love having the room on both sides as I was able to put a small plate on the left side while using the right as a mouse pad. The riser is great too, I don't use it much but when I do, it works wonderfully. My cat loves to sleep under it when I am not using it, so it's dual purpose!",

My only issue is that it is rough in some spots and I have gotten a splinter already, the paperwork with the desk states that it is common for the desk to not be completely smooth. But for the price you would think they could seal it, smooth it out or something to prevent splinters. Just my opinion. I would def purchase again though.",

The book rest is removable and can be stored in the little drawer so that it isn't in the way when you want to type or write. The adjustable height makes this bed tray comfortable for most people regardless of size. The vented top is great for keeping your laptop from overheating. The tilt action always keeps reading material at the perfect angle. There is even a little indentation to rest your glass and keep condensation contained. This tray is wider than most and the centered hinge mechanism makes it a good choice for right or left handed people. I'm very pleased with this purchase.",

The cutouts on the tilt up on the table are really nice and allow the computer to breathe. She uses her table all the time, so it has taken alot of wear and tear. It still looks and responds like new after seven months of use. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a nice laptop table for chairs or beds. I give it five stars.",

The only thing I could say is it should have lower settings but the wood is tight so you can pretty much angle it the way you want. The drawer is a little small (shallow) to fit more than 2-3 pens but it works and is a nice feature. Looks nice and is a great bed tray and or serving tray:)",

One minor issue I found is that the drawer on the side is held in place by a small magnet. My magnet came out of the hole, so the drawer doesn't stay closed. However, a small bit of super glue or wood glue will probably take care of that. This product is a GREAT buy for the price!",
