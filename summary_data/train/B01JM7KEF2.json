Extra two inches would make this product really better. However if you have small desk space this would be perfect.",

We have used the organizer to hold pamphlets, paper clips, pens, and note paper. It is small enough to fit nicely on the half-circular desk under the counter top, yet it's roomy enough to hold most of the items we had intended. I would recommend and we definitely would purchase this item again. If you're looking for something with lots of storage, this is probably not your item (check dimensions), but if you need something to tidy up a space, this works great.",

My planner fits inside perfectly, and it actually comes in handy as a place to hold my phone as well if I don't want it sitting on my desk. It's solidly built and comes ready to use right out of the package as described. I'm eager to buy another for home, now that I've seen how it looks at my office.",

Also purchased the 3- tier stackable letter sorter: another very cool item! I bought 2 of them, so I got jiggy with them and stacked them 2 / 4, instead of the traditional 3/3. I like the versatility of them. As for shipment: they arrived before I was ready for them! Highly recommended for anyone wanting to get professional looking.",
