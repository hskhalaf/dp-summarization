The floor has no solid base so the center leg juts straight through the soft base. But worst of all, the only support and rigid structure it has is on the sides so even when fully assembled in carrier mode, the center length just collapses!!!",

This one, however, is perfect! He has more than enough room when is expended and can still fit decently when its not. He's too tall to stand up in it - as most dogs are - but you can always unzip the top to give them more space, in case they want to stand. I definitely recommend it, specially for those with dogs that are a bit bigger. My dog loves it and the quality is good!",

Handle cover is a nice touch; gentler on hands with no digging in. Will order several more for the house cats. These carriers are roomy, especially with the sides extended.

Sadly though while it was completely open my puppy chewed on the zipper on the lining and now we can't zip the lining all the way up. I would suggest that the lining be attached to the inside of the bag so that they can not chew it. I will be sewing the lining to the inside.",

It would be better if it were 16 or 17\" long instead of 18\". I love that the bars can be taken out of the top so part of it will slide under the seat but it doesn't collapse on the dog. Also, the strap to go over your carry-on handle is a wonderful addition.",
