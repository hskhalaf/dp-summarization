Sadly, I found out the hard way that this is not an accurate statement, on two occasions, when I found yogurt in my back on day, and cottage cheese on another. I've checked the seal to make sure I put the lid on tight, the ventilation is closed, and that the silicon seal is on correctly. It just isn't leak-proof. If you take that feature out, it's a good bent. It compact, the cutlery is ok, and works well in the microwave and dishwasher. Sadly though, for my purposes, I'll have to find something else, and I do need something that is truly \"leak-proof\"",

      "text": "The containers are nice sized, but should have 2 dividers rather than just one. Also, I think there should be some type of sauce container for it as well, to hold sauces in for the food inside the container instead of having to bring a completely different container for it. But other than that, the container quality is nice, hand wash is a bit annoying-but when has it ever not been annoying- but the quality is very nice. The fork did break after a couple months, but other than that it's really great.",

It\u2019s harder to tell if something going to last if you\u2019re not going to see until you buy it. But after reading the reviews for other bento boxed I took a chance an chose this one. I have used it since I got which is about 3 weeks ago. I I haven\u2019t had any problems with this. I bought my own chopsticks and have my own utensils but the bag and the container are wonderful. I get tons of complements about my container very often. I definitely would recommend...heck I\u2019ll definitely buy another one!",
