Also love being able to add essential oils to help my house smell amazing!",

Despise the small size and quiet motor, this humidifier does output significant amount of mists under \"quick mode\". I can definitely feel the difference in dryness relief after turning on this unit on \"quick mode\" for 15 minutes in my 10x11 room. I usually switch it to the low output mode maintain the moisture in the room after 15 minutes, and it works great over night. This unit has worked extremely well for my situation, and I would highly recommend this humidifier for a small room.",
