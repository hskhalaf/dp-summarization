Cons: Doesn't corner worth a damn, doesn't get into the corners or edges. You have to do the edges with the attachment separately. I think this is likely the case with all cleaners.

I had two little pet stains from my 5 pound dog.. took that out first run over. My carpets dried very fast, I would say before 3 hours. Dried much faster than when I had the professionals come in. Very happy with my purchase. Now I can do my carpets every couple of months. Thank you for a great product.",

Yes, this is more expensive initially but don't let that stop you...we have bought 4 so called carpet cleaners that have all died within 1-2 years and this has a 5-year warranty.

The only downside is if you only wanted to spot clean, you'll end up with a too clean spot & need to finish the rest of the carpet or furniture piece. This is even powerful enough to finish pulling hair out of carpet that a DC65 misses, let alone all the water put down. Go slow, don't be in a rush, go over the surface until you no longer see water coming up, & you'll have clean & dry carpet/upholstery in a very short time.",
