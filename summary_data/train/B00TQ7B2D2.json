Since starting extend she has regained some pep in her step. She now runs to meet me at the door each day and acts like she did in her younger days. She has only been taking Extend for about 2 weeks now, but I can definitely see a positive change in her mobility, stiffness, and overall demeanor. I would highly recommend this product.",
