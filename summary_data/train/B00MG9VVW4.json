For starters, this thing is NOT waterproof, or even water-resistant. The flap that is supposed to cover the ports does not seal or even properly cover the ports as there\u2019s no way it fits or can be pushed into the recess it is supposed to fit in - see pics. What is the point of having a rugged power bank with three gaping holes in the side? Plus it weighs a small ton and is far too bulky to carry around when traveling.",

Other than that it works great, the light on it is very effective, and it charges at the same rate as a household charger. The pack takes a while to charge from 50%, but even at that, there still is enough power left to charge my phone almost twice. If you have bigger hands it's nice because it fits very well. Great product for the price of $15 ish dollars.",

      "text": "Unfortunately this item broke within one month of purchase. The plug for the micro-USB charge cord broke, one of the sockets contact tabs got folded/bent and I couldn't charge the battery anymore. This has rendered the unit useless and I cannot fix it myself. . I was hoping to exchange it, I liked the unit while it worked. There is no way to exchange the item apparently. Very frustrating. (Particularly since it actually broke during the first 30 days.)",

It will charge my iPhone 6s 4 times before I have to charge the external charger itself. I bring it with me when we're on the boat all day and won't be around a charger. I have never missed out on any Kodak moments due to my phone being dead and that is awesome. The only downside is that it's not the best looking charger out there, but it works great and water resistant.",

      "text": "The one wrinkle to keep in mind with this battery is that it takes a long time for it to fully charge -- it can take 12-14 hours, though typically it has taken about 10 for me. Also keep in mind the fine print on what \"waterproof\" means -- it will do fine if it gets rained on or spilled on, but not if you drop it in a swimming pool or bathtub. Those caveats in mind, this has proven a reliable backup power source for our phones and other devices. I'm glad we purchased it.",

Next one was here in two days. I charged it overnight. Ran my kindle down to 10%. Put the charger on it and watched it recharge my kindle as i used it. Also the flashlight is very bright. A little heavy but worth it. Thank you.",
