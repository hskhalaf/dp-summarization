      "text": "Do not Buy this scanner!!! I did not listen to the bad reviews. I should have. I purchase this scanner March 7, 2017 and it worked fine until today. It began to jam. I reset it several times and even tried different quality and different weights of paper. It keeps jamming. I have alredy purchased a better scanner that got very high reviews, even from a law office. If you are considering this printer DO NOT BUY IT, YOU WILL REGRET YOUR DECISION IF YOU DO.",

To be fair though, the upload speed to dropbox is pretty fast. I bought this to assist in scanning files for my office to go paperless, needless to say that process is not progressing.",
