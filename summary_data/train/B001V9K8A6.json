You'd have to count the number of times you hit the minute button, then wait about 10-30 seconds for the timer screen to be readable, and when I hit start I don't trust it, pretty much trash. But the set without the timer is still worth the money, look for a timer somewhere else...",

Has everything you need to help move hot canning jars and their lids. The magnet (on the lid lifter) is a good strength to securely remove lids from hot water after boiling, but not so much you have to struggle to remove the lid from the tool and end up contaminating the lid in the process. Good kit at a fair price. Update: We've canned hundreds of jars to include meats, fruits, vegetables and dairy. No melting concerns whatsoever. These have held up to canning and dishwasher cleaning great. Definitely recommend as a good starter canning kit.",
