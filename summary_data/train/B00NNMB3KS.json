I can see some movement of the blades because of the flickering lights, but they might as well be behind glass for the amount of air flow.

The pull isn't that strong either, but it is fairly quiet, so you sacrifice one for the other. My other gripe about this is the rubber feet towards the front are terrible, they've already started falling off and don't have a lot of grip (on glass anyway).",

      "text": "I have a ROG Zephyrus 15.6\" gaming laptop and felt like it was getting hot while playing the latest Modern Warfare. I bought this cooling pad and it seems to work well. Simple USB connection and an on/off switch. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that originally it was whisper quiet but after maybe 10 hours of use the fans got noticeably louder. It hasn't moved from my desk so rough handling hasn't had anything to do with whatever caused this issue.",

Another feature that I like is the ability to fold the two back legs up into the pad frame making it easy to place inside my carrying bag along with the laptop. The 3 fans are so quite that you would never know that they are running. I love the soft blue lights that are built into the frame giving it such a cool relaxing glow. Wish I could leave a photo or two with my review, but looks like Amazon has taken that feature off the product review section, sorry.",

      "text": "This is a solid product. However it doesn't cool enough where my computer gets the hottest. My Thinkpad W520 gets very hot in the upper left hand corner (by the left hinge of the screen). I'm assuming that's where all the processing, etc., is happening. Unfortunately, the fans on this unit don't cover that area. My computer was getting so hot while processing video that it would abruptly shut down. I ended up buying the LotFancy version of this which has FIVE fans - including one in the upper left hand corner. And it's doing a great job.",
