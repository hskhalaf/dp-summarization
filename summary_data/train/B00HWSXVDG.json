Bare bones features too: No way to control it remotely AFAIK, no external output or EQ of any sort. For almost $300, there should be far more to this unit. Revisted after 1.5 years: No longer using this unit - it is stashed away in a drawer. Not a good investment.",

I loved this while it worked, but for the money, im kind of mad it broke so fast. hopefully bose will fix it, then i would say 5 stars",

That situation is solved by disconnecting the speaker and reconnecting to the desired device. It's really easy to do. I found help with this at the Bose website.

Also, $300 for this little jewel is a bit steep, but if you have the money, you may really like it. I do! Links easily with Bluetooth, good sound. Used it outdoors at a small wedding and worked fine. Not sure about battery life. I If you're a sound fanatic, you may not be impressed; but for the rest of us...an excellent purchase. If you buy one, your kids will borrow it a lot. I warned you!",
