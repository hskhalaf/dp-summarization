Even after letting grill heat for 10 to 15 minutes at sear temp it just doesn't do the job. Might be good for burgers, hot dogs and thin chicken slices but not steak. I'll go back to my old grill, if I can still find one, that was half the cost and got much hotter than the Hamilton Beach.",

One it reached the desired temp I added a few sprays of non stick spray just in case and grilled some marinated chicken. I was pleasantly surprised by the lack of smoke (literally smokeless) and how tender and juicy the end result was. Easy to take apart and clean as well. 10/10 would recommend.",

After, I just throw boiling hot water on the grill (once I take it apart and put it in the sink) and the hot water just cleans away all the dirt. I just use a sponge to clean off any residue and it looks brand new. I loved it to much I bought one for my brother and son.",
