I had really wanted an ancient China scenario with some martial arts and was not very excited about a journey to Greece but after playing for 10 hours I will say easily this is graphically the most beautiful in the series and the story is very engaging. More combat focused than previous titles which is a nice change. The RPG element is also a nice addition and the franchise continues to grow and evolve.",

The story is not surprising so far and not engaging enough to keep me coming back. I may decide to just stop playing instead of finishing the game. For me, it is too one-dimensional, you are just slashing haphazardly at the world, with no sense of building or adding to the world. I want to like it, but I just can't seem to care about the characters or the stories. Probably spoiled by Skyrim, Far Cry, and Fallout. Sometimes I just fly around as an eagle to enjoy the landscape and escape the frenetic \"storyline\" - not a good omen.",

Still a fan of the series don\u2019t know about the other guys but I like that gameplay and story. Only assassins creed I didn\u2019t feel was origins just cuz the fighting seemed a little stiff to me. But odyssey felt a little better in fighting mechanics.",

It's very similar to how Middle Earth: Shadow Of War was during its first year of release. No matter your character level, you will reach a story point where a new quest-line requires a 5 to 6 level character increase to complete. Essentially, Ubisoft wants you to buy XP boosters from the in-game store (good old micro-transactions) to finish the final act of the main campaign or grind on fetch quests and area activities for 12-15 hours. You may want to hold off until they eventually patch this out.",
