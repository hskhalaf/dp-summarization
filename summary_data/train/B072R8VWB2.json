I found it so hard to find floaties for their weight (over 50lbs), especially ones that we\u2019re not life vests. These floaties were great!! We used them for the first time last night and though I stayed in arms reach of them, they were able to be free and play! (Which is a first because usually they cling to me for dear life) I\u2019m SOOOOO thankful to have found these!!",

We do own the Stearns puddle jumper but those are really bulky and inconvenient for packing into a suitcase. These were the perfect solution and even came with a storage bag too, which is a great value. The detachable belt buckles are really useful too - I'm surprised no one else has thought of that yet. We currently have the arm floaties attached since he's still learning how to swim, but once he's more experienced, we'll detach them so he can just use the arm floaties. Would definitely recommend, especially to take along on vacation.",

She's comfortable in water and can sort of swim, but I don't trust her ability in water where she can't touch the bottom when an adult isn't in the pool with her. I'm sure this would have kept her afloat, but the arms were HUGE. Ridiculously large. My daughter said she wouldn't wear it because they were so big (and she wasn't being dramatic). Will move on to regular arm floaties and swim lessons from here.",

My 26 lb daughter not only looked uncomfortable in this, but also was stripped of the comfort of \u2018fearlessly floating\u2019 as this device just isn\u2019t well fitting nor is it as well made as its competitors. The arm floats aren\u2019t half bad but the fabric from the chest peice is separate from the foam within. Thus it away and slips, twists, pulls -contouring the angle of the floatation device within, never allowing for a comfortable moment in which I felt she could safely be held by hands or arms alone. THATS no fun in the pool\u2014 nor is it a good first time swimmers experience for her, and a headache for me!",

LOVE that this is separate pieces so they can graduate and use the water wings or not. The colors are awesome. Wish it didn't say \"First Floatie\", but I got over it in a hurry. :-)",

This one actually keeps him afloat and he didn\u2019t constantly get water in his mouth. It\u2019s also great for slowly transitioning him off floaty\u2019s because we can remove the front floaty completely.
