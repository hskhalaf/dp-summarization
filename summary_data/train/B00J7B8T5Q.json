      "text": "Alright, these blankets are fabulous!! I bought 7 of them. I would call them a mid weight blanket. They almost feel like they have just a tiny tiny bit of wool in them. They are not scratchy like wool, but sort of have that feel. I own rentals and bought them for that, and bought extras because the price is so cheap! I have washed them all and they come out very fluffy and in perfect condition! I almost want to buy more just to have extras on hand! Great price, great blanket! Highly recommend!",

      "text": "I received a blanket that looks like parts of it were overheated and melted a little, just on the very surface of the fibers. I don't know if this is from heat while making it or maybe chemicals. It's not a deal breaker for me, mainly because it's fairly hard to see, unless you look closely and it's fairly small patches. So I am keeping it. But they are very rough patches and even though it was only $13 I expected one without these flaws. Maybe I just got one that slipped by inspection. The next blanket I buy, I will pay more for and hope I get better quality.",

This is everything I hoped for - very warm but light weight, the right size, and very soft just like my old blanket. The cats love it as much as I do. After the initial wash, there was absolutely no lint or fuzz on the blanket, in the washer, or in the drier filter, and no chemical smell. I have high hopes that this will last as long as my old blanket. Recommended, especially at the low price that it's currently sold for.",
