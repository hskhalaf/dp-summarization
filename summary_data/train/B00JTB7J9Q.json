      "text": "I bought this monitor in April and so far I love it. I haven't had any dead pixels and the resolution is pretty good. I have a laptop and I needed a bigger screen, so I got this. It works great! It was very easy to install (instructions come with pictures, not words) and even though it comes with a CD, I never had to use it, it was that easy. I haven't any issues with it and I think this monitor is very high quality for such a price. I play lots of video games and I love the option to adjust the settings yourself and save them for game nights (called Gamer 1, 2, 3).",

      "text": "The monitor looks great and turned right on as soon as I connected it to my computer. The description for this monitor says that it has built-in speakers but I have been unable to coax any kind of audio out of mine. I assume I just I got a bad egg that slipped through quality control, but I have a separate speaker system attached to my computer so it doesn't matter to me anyway. Other than the lack of audio, the monitor is great. The colors are rich, the pictures are crisp, and the screen is responsive. Even without working speakers, I'd still recommend this to a friend.",

The Black eQualizer especially is a real game changer. My only complaint with it is the video quality. Things tend to be noticeably pixelated, even more so than my old monitor that was made in 2001, which is what I upgraded from. If you're looking for a monitor built for competitive gaming for a low price, then by all means I can recommend this, but if you're going for good graphics, you might want to buy a different monitor.",

So overall if anyone was doing the same thing as me then get a pc monitor (in particular this one), and this is a pretty good monitor to own, especially on sale",
