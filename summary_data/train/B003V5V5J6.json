They are squishy and hard at the same time. It is difficult to explain, though my kids seem not to mind it.

Sure its mostly organic and natural, but the taste itself isn't vastly different from a traditional super cheap gummy, and it still is heavy on the tapioca syrup and sugar, with the actual fruit products way down the list (if you can call them fruit products and not just flavor extractions). Its good, and its organic, but I am not impressed for the price, and would not buy again.",
