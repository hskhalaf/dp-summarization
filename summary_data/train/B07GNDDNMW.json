My office chair that my corporate purchased was something similar but I think it\u2019s way more expensive than this one. I was amazed by the quality of this chair. It\u2019s very easy to install, the instructions is very clear and easy to understand. It come with all the needed tools and even a pair of glove to keep your hand clean, very thoughtful. Husband spent about half an hour to install and he loves it. It\u2019s very sturdy and comfortable. Wheels are smooth; leaning back, hight and the head support adjustment are very easy to make. Highly recommend.",

Fabric covered seats with mesh net back makes it comfortable and there's no hard feeling after long sit. Metal bottom with 5 special designed wheels make it static and sturdy. Back angle and height could be adjusted and the feeling like a recliner. Even the head rest could be adjust as height and angle. I have to mention it has a wide seat and the whole feeling is like I'm sitting on a back seat of an Range Rover. This one is really good and I like it very much.",

So far I love it. And it has armrests with adjustable heights, which is an oddly rare (and very helpful) feature for this type of chair. If you're looking for a mesh style desk chair with a built-in footrest, this is absolutely the best one I've found on the market.",

The chair is very supportive, has a great set of incline options, and the adjustments work well. It feels very well built after two months of use. If I have issues, I'll update the review, but right now I would say it would be tough to get better bang for your buck if you cannot afford a $500-$1,000 chair.",

Came with all the pieces I needed including extra pieces and a box opener. fantastic, clear directions, awesome for someone who isn\u2019t great at putting stuff together. Took me about 30 min to put together without cuss words. Lol. I just had surgery so can\u2019t sit for long periods of time but this is very comfortable and easy to sit at. Absolutely love it and really want to save up to buy another one for my son. My only regret- I didn\u2019t find this chair sooner. It\u2019s fantastic",

Only one part I hope can be better that the head part can not adjust by one button. If different high people use the same chair cannot adjust.",

This chair is very simple to install. I followed the instructions and installed it in about half an hour. Its back fits my back exactly, and the headrest is flexible and can be adjusted according to people of different heights.",

All day I'm having to stand up and bring the chair to the top position again. It's super annoying and it's been doing this since day 1. I'm going to attempt to buy a better lift cylinder and replace it but this is ridiculous.",
