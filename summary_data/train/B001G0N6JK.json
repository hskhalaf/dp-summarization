The upper and middle velcros, you won't have a problem since you still have the snaps to keep the velcro in place. The problem is the bottom velcro where you don't have the extra snaps, so if your velcro won't stick, you have a loose fitting splint in the bottom. It still works but at least for me, it feels uncomfortable when I sleep w/ it at night.",

One problem, however, is the velcro over the front of the foot - it doesn't hold throughout the night - it needs a strap and snap like the other 2 fasteners. I handle the problem by using masking tape to hold that fastener in place. A great value for the moderate cost.",

I bought a cheaper \"on top of the foot\" one, and it hasn't helped in a month. I had ZERO foot pain after the first night of using it, so I'm hoping it will start to heal again. It's large, bulky, and definitely uncomfortable to fall asleep with, but it helps with the pain.",

Keeping my foot in a right angle position at night means less pain at night. This boot has changed my life. Wish I had known about it earlier.",

The one thing I hadn't tried was a night splint-my podiatrist doesn't \"believe in them.\" Wow! It was easier to get up the first morning and within a few days I felt better throughout the day. I am now well on the road to recovery. Oh, I also \"fired\" my podiatrist.",

      "text": "I bought this cast because I have a cast with only 1/2 of a hard bottom and it didn't help with my heal. So, I saw that this cast had a complete foot bottom AND a very nice removable bottom cushion that you can freeze/heat and put on the bottom of your foot while wearing the cast. Your foot stays straight, you don't have to worry about it falling out because it is secure with the velcro straps. This was a great purchase and I highly recommend it if you are suffering from Plantar Fascitis.",

      "text": "After months of prescriptions, stretches, and pain this made a huge difference after 4 nights of use. Lower and thinner that the other splints I tried. Much more comfortable. The only drawback is the upper strap is not quite long enough if you have large calves. It has another strap that goes over that one with plenty of adjustment room. It is still comfortable enough for me and I'm not a sound sleeper. Attached is the proper photo.",
