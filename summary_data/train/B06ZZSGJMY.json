Be sure to disinfect with rubbing alcohol before and after! The case is very nice looking and I would even consider giving this set as a gift because the quality is terrific and the price is very affordable. It looks more expensive than what I paid.",

      "text": "The individual tools included work great, with the exception of the nail file. It's just cheaply made and you'd be better served by replacing it with a better one or some emery boards. This kit has some tools in it that I don't even know how to use, but rather have that than be missing some of the pieces I regularly use. There was a problem with the case on my original order, but the company took good care of me in replacing it, A++ on customer service!",

Mine, however, is incredibly feminine so not entirely ideal. Also, I'm not impressed with the scissors included within. The non-razor edge is just as sharp as the cutting edge which makes trimming noise hairs quite painful, and I'm no snowflake. Odd to put that in a review, but that's one of the main reasons I needed a new grooming kit, so I figured I'd help a brother out.",
