I suspect it is because the material across the top is not mesh like my existing shoes (the length was fine; it was the width that felt too ttght) Instead of these, I ordered New Balance Men's M860SB4, Silver/Blu, in the same size (9D). This pair cost over $15 less than the pair I returned plus the fit is \"As expected (96%)\" compared to the pair I returned that only 53% of customers said the fit was \"As expected\". Most people of the comments I read were complaining that the shoes felt too tight.",
