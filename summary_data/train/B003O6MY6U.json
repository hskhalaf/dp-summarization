I'm not sure if they reformulated them, although the box does say \"new and improved.\" Now my dog has severe allergies to the wipes and his paws are raw and bleeding from licking. Once we stopped using them, the allergy went away. The labeling is very misleading. There's an American flag saying that it is designed in the US. However, the company also writes that they are made in PRC (People's Republic of China)! The company is impossible to get in touch with. I would definitely avoid at all costs.",
