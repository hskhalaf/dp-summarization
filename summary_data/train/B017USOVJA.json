The made the toe box wider than the 22, but now the shoes are short. I'm returning these immediately, ordering a pair of Kayano 21's, and will have to find a new running shoe after 20 years.

I keep buying their shoes, but have not been happy with them since the Kayano 21 because instead of my feet feeling happy with out a break-in period, I feel the shoes break my feet.

However, they were too small even though I ordered the same size as the ones I already had. Don't know what happened there. They're great running shoes, but they generally run small and this particular pair ran even smaller. Sad.",

The fluid fit upper leverages seamless stretch mesh reinforcements to increase forefoot support, while adapting to the foot's natural motion to create a custom sock-like fit. Our forefoot and Rearfoot gel cushioning systems absorb shock upon impact to equip overpronators with a smooth and effortless transition between heel strike and toe-off phases.\n\nIn 1949, Mr. Kihachiro Onitsuka began his athletic footwear company (Onitsuka Co., Ltd.) by manufacturing basketball shoes out of his living room in Kobe, Japan. He chose the name ASICS for his company in 1977, based on a famous Latin phrase \"Anima Sana In Corpore Sano,\" which, when translated, expresses the ancient ideal of \"A Sound Mind in a Sound Body.\" Taking the acronym of this phrase, ASICS was founded on the belief that the best way to create a healthy and happy lifestyle is to promote total health and fitness.
