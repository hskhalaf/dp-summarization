      "text": "My kids bought this for me as as somewhat of a tongue-in-cheek pre-Christmas present. The individual items for each day are easy to put together and shouldn't challenge any level of Lego builder. Be aware that there is an ABUNDANCE of extra parts that come with each one. At least one, sometimes three extra pieces. I suppose you could either enhance the items with the pieces, keep them as spares or try to make something else with all of the parts. Definitely recommended for all but the youngest(or oldest) members of the family. The individual parts are tiny and colorful enough to be a hazard for the infant/toddler set and tough to handle/see for the physically-challenged.",
