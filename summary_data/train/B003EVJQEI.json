I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d like it so I bought this notebook because it wasn\u2019t as scary as starting in a hardback book. I fell in love with it. I originally got two books and used them up then got a hardback Leuchtturm. I\u2019m finishing my eighth notebook now and have another on the desk waiting for next month. I recently bought more softcover books to have for crochet patterns. I love the way these books are set up. They\u2019re durable and can handle all the punishment I put them through. I will always buy these notebooks because in think they\u2019re perfect.",

The pages are numbered, and there are a few pages in the back that are perforated and can be easily detached if needed. Additionally, there are two page markers and a back pocket that can be used to store small notes or business cards. The only minor issue is that, if you use a pen, ink can be seen through pages on the flip side, but that is dependent on the type of pen you use.",

The paper is rougher than the moleskine, but I do like how the pages are numbered, the outlines, and the date field. I also think I will utilize the table of contents that is at the beginning of the notebook. I would definitely buy again but I wouldn't say this is the quality that I expected for this price range. If you write with small pointed pens you might get annoyed with the scratching it does when you write in this notebook.",

UPDATE : 1/30/20 For the price, you'd think the softcover would last, but after 7 years the softcover is \"flaking\" in many parts and the band is outstretched. Dust seems to have \"seeped\" along into the softcover as well and I can't remove it. The paper is the same though, that's what matters to me.",
