      "text": "My 8 year old chihuahua has had very sensitive skin since I can remember. Recently, he had an allergic reaction and got hot spots all across his back that just turned into one giant patch. I tried creams that were recommended by veterinarians and nothing compared to this! It's only been 2 weeks and the difference is insane! I use this medicine along with Science Diet brand dog food and I think my dog's new food helps as well. The first picture was June 15th and the second picture is June 30th. I am extremely pleased so far. **UPDATE** Third picture is from July 24th. His fur is so much more longer now!!!",

      "text": "This stuff is gentler than chlorahexadine sprays, but it is a mild disinfectant (detergent?). It works by suspending an extra electron to the main molecule so when sprayed on bacteria or fungus, the electron jumps ship and destroys the organism's molecules/cell wall. Works in ears, paws, raw skin, nether regions, and for the incessant itchiness of a malassazia infection. I have a large dog and at one bottle per body application, it's WAY overpriced to use for anything other than small, non-chronic spots. Otherwise I'd give it 5 stars. I caught the dog's infection and can attest that its gentle, does not burn and stops the itch preceding a pending explosion of activity dead in its tracks.",

I thought the hot spot hadn't healed but when I took a closer look her skin is healthy under the fur but the fur is stained. Edited to say: The stain is definitely from the Vetericyn and not from mixing because the two spots I sprayed were a hot spot on her back that she never licked or scratched at, and a small wound on top of her head that she never bothered, and in both areas the fur stained the same way.",
