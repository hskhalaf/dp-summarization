Board looks believably like reclaimed wood except for a little too much sheen which I\u2019ll sand down very lightly. Since I\u2019m decorating with items which fuse reclaimed/repurposed woods with high gloss black tech finishes, this is really close to perfect. The box was a little beat up but the item was well protected inside with styrofoam. Took about a week to ship.",

Those are all the pros- now the two cons. First and foremost, keep the allen wrench provided. You will constantly have to tighten the screws! Second, there are four screws that attach the table top.

It is very sturdy, holding up a Bose 303 speaker, along with some decorative items, and some bins fit perfectly on the shelf below - keeping things off the floor, and stored attractively. The finish is very attractive, and the piece is quite heavy and sturdy, upon assembly. I had no problems with assembly, either. Fit and finish was quite good.",

The table is sturdy, but it is not super heavy to move for vacuuming. The finish on the table has held up, and I do not have any scratches on it. I would recommend this product.

The installation was the easiest I have ever had for any type of furniture. It is also sturdier than any bulky wooden (likely plywood) one that I would have purchased for a similar price at a big box store. It looks great, functions great, and is worth the money!",
