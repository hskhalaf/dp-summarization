It is a very snag-friendly material. I do not have high hopes for it holding up well with time - but I will update later as I have only had it a few days. On the whole, I've had better crib ruffles for less.",

Never had any issues with tearing or snagging, the material has a bit of stretch to it. I would definitely recommend this item to anyone wanting a good quality material, and special look to their little ones crib. It was worth the price!",
