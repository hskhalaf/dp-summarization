It is very quiet and it is one of the few fans that do not have a remote control. We have enough remote controls and we certainly don\u2019t need one for a fan. It\u2019s also quite attractive and contemporary and goes well with our furnishings. Highly recommended.",

It took 2.5 hours to get a return call. I tried the online route for the second fan issue and had received a replacement from Amazon and had it installed before I heard back from the manufacturer. The fans work great now but not worth the aggravation.",

My contractor helped pick this fan because it matches the modern look of our house which does look great but that's about it. I now have 4 rooms with totally worthless fans, HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!! DON'T BUY THUS FAN unless you just want the fan for looks. Oh, I did purchase remote in case someone is thinking to install with a remote and does work with the fan but again fan is just useless itself.",
