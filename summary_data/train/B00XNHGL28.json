But then...I heard a sound that was like a low fan running in the room. Yup, it was the bulbs. These DO make noise. Based on another review here, it said they didn't. Not sure if I should return them. Disappointed. Update..they stopped making a \"low fan running noise\" after using them a few times. That changed my rating from 2 stars to 5! Glad I didn't return them! They are now PERFECT!!",

This bulb is definitely one of the most yellow I have tested. Too bad, because the price is great. If you're going for *very* warm lighting, these would be really good bulbs for you.",
