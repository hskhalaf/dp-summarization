      "text": "This is a really well designed massager! I have had a similar one for years and it works really well for tension in the traps, shoulder blades, and neck. It also works well for calves and feet. It works so well that my son keeps taking mine so I bought him this one instead. This model is really cool because it has the same knobs with strong massaging action but it is thinner and lighter than the one I bought a few years ago. Great way to relieve tension and stress!!",

Definitely would recommend this to anyone. Note u can't change the heat settings its preset.",

He used it all weekend long! Before sleeping, in the car and today installed it in the office. It is really easy to use and the price is great! My husband used it in the low mode... It is also small so easy to storage. You can put it even in the nightstand!",

It has a good heating function and speed control that my old Brookstone does not have. I know that it's built as a neck massager but it loses my calf muscle exceptionally. The manufacturing quality is not shy of Brookstone and the material feels heavy duty which should last for a long time. It also came with a car charger, haven't tried it but it is a very thoughtful touch. The only drawback is the size of this massager, may not cover your whole back if you have a wide back.",

I guess I can\u2019t expect it to last forever but my last one ended up working for at least two and a half years so I expected more. Three stars because it did help to alleviate migraines caused by muscle tension but the other reviews are right when they say it can come unplugged if you move only slightly wrong.",

I live in an apartment with my roommate, so I have to work in my bedroom on my small desk. Without the good office supply, I got neck pain quickly. This product definitely helps a lot. It gives you a press and also warms your muscle to help relief your tension. The 3 modes give a wide selection. I like how the red balls moving, very creative. Plus, you can take it with you when traveling. Easily attach it to the car seat. Use it for neck and lower back. Great product!",

Sometimes i forget to turn off, but it has an overheat protection which is great. High recommended",
