Not a fan of the hand pump, had to rig the end of the tube to fit our electric pump instead of spending half the day pumping it up by hand. Overall a great product and keeps my child entertained and outside for hours.",

Can't find any hole/leaks but still loses air very quickly. It is also very hard when blown up. Too hard for my boys to practice gymnastics without have a spotter to make sure they don't land on their heads. Not bouncy like they advertise it to be. Already having to look for a replacement.",
