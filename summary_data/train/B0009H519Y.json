Even though I don't own a buffer, I decided to try this using the old manual buffer, elbow grease. Wow! My 1994 Chevy pickup headlights were totally clouded; they now shine. You can see the silver reflectors and bulbs with totally clarity. It worked so well that I did my siblings vehicles when they came to visit. I can only imagine how much better this would have worked with a good electric buffer ( it would at least have saved me some time).",

I did use a 3M buffer sponge attachment which I hooked to my drill, just a regular drill is what I used. Applied the polish directly to headlights and sponge and then began buffering. The headlights look so much better than what they looked prior. They obviously do not look brand new but definitely look very good! I highly recommend this product.",

I\u2019ve used many other polishes and most do a great job. This polish does a fabulous job. Surface needs to be very clean to start. After that, just rub it and keep it moist with paste.

The polish itself is white, but after you begin to remove metals it gets darker and darker. once its dark wipe the polish off the product and begin to buff your item with a clean rag. you can get great results with this polish with only a little elbow grease!!!",

It took a lot a lot of elbow grease and I actually am not completely satisfied, but it does work better than any product I tried before looking to see what the manufacturer recommended. I would recommend using old rags that you can throw away after use, I tried to wash the ones I used and was unsuccessful.",

It seems to shine faux chrome just like it shines real metal. With a little light buffing, the product removed water spot stains and some discolorations.
