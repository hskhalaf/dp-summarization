I'd plug in the drive and the light would turn on and I could feel it spin up, but it would never mount on my computers (OS X, Linux, and Windows). I thought it was a defective drive and was pretty dismayed based on the warranty problems other people had. Luckily I had another cable laying around and figured I'd give a shot and it worked! If you're having problems with the drive, try another cable before throwing it in the trash can like I almost did!",

      "text": "I bought this harddrive to expand the storage on my Playstation 4 (PS4). It does exactly what you would expect! I plugged the hard drive in, the PS4 recognized it and asked if I wanted to format (of course you have to say yes), and then it was up and running. I now have about 5 games saved solely on the hard drive, and they load just as fast as if they were on the internal. I don't plan to every take this hard drive with me since it was meant for the PS4, but it is very small. I would say it compares well to a deck of cards, except a bit thinner. Very pleased overall.",

Once that takes place no option exists to power on external hard drive. While data may be ssfe, it is safe inside a box and you can not possibly access it and I mean forever. I'm guessing if you have a recovery expert do the job they can open it up and maybe use the drive to copy and recover your data. Do not entrust critical data to this device.

Both WD and Toshiba perform similar but WD's security user interface is better and easier (can skip password). Anyway, will test this Toshiba for a couple of months.
