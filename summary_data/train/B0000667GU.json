      "text": "I purchased this kettle from amazon about 9 years ago. It still boils water for my morning cupp'a quickly. I agree with other reviewers about the positive aspects of this kettle, but because it doesn't have adjustable temperature control I would only note that it isn't ideal for green, white, or oolong teas - I still use it for those teas, but transfer the water to a tea pot and use a thermometer to measure when the water is the appropriate temperature.",

I had to replace my last electric kettle that looked like a regular tea kettle when a guest at our house put it on the gas stove to heat some water (mmmm. . . nothing like the smell of burnt plastic). So, I figured getting one that looked different might prevent future accidents. This one turns out to be much quiter then my previous kettle and I like that you can lift the entire lid to get a good cleaning in if necessary.",

The large lid opens more than similar kettles, which allows for easy cleaning, temperature checking, and more unconventional uses. The only issue I can think of, is that if you plan on making pour over coffee, you may prefer a boiler with a gooseneck or a better spout.",

    "description": "The M675 Cordless electric hot pot brings elegance, ease and advanced technology to the everyday function of Heating water. The ample capacity, sleek design, Seamless stainless steel interior, triple protection safety switches and cordless feature make it the best of its kind.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nPerfect for making coffee, tea, soup, and hot chocolate at home, in the office, or in the dorm room, this 1,500-watt pot brings 1-3/4 quarts of water to a boil more quickly than a stove or microwave oven. It lifts off its power base for cordless pouring. Made of 18/10 stainless steel with a matte-finish, black plastic lid, handle, and bottom, the handsome pot is polished to a mirror finish on the outside and has a brushed-finish interior that's seamless for easy cleaning. For safety the pot shuts off automatically when water reaches boiling or if it boils dry, and the hinged lid opens only when a button on the roomy, stay-cool handle is pressed. A gauge displays the water level and a light shows when the pot is operating. To prevent, say, tea bags from plopping out, the lid's indentation at the pouring spout contains sieve-holes. Measuring 6-1/4 inches in diameter and 8 inches high, the pot has a cord-wrap in the power base and carries a one-year warranty against defects. --Fred Brack",
