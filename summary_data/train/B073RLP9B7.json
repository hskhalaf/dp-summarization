Since the manual mentions it, I have to assume that the sound is normal for this unit. Other than that it seems like a really good refrigerator at an amazing price (referring to the 60509 model).

Be VERY VERY careful if you attempt to move the handles to the other side -- take out the two screws for each handle, CAREFULLY rotate the handle to the side of the door, and SLIDE the handle horizontally along the face of the door in the direction opposite the screws. SWAP the handles when you replace them (freezer handle -> fridge handle, and vice versa). There is an EXTREMELY (deliberately) fragile, tiny, replaceable plastic fastener on the inside of the handle that you will almost certainly break.
