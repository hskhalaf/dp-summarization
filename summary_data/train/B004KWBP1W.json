When I used this chair this w/e for first time, I leaned back and it immediately took the pressure of my ankle and knee by supporting my body with the weight distribution balanced around my butt. Furthermore, I believe it was very therapeutic for my ankle and knees because they were positioned slightly higher them my heart. this allowed any swelling to drain away for these areas. Long story short both ankles and knees felt a lot better after resting on this chair. My only issue is the other posts about the frame failing which I will repost if this happens. Hope it does not!!",

After 3 months of inside, normal use, for only 3 or so hours every few days my wife's chair buckled on the front support. The fabric and everything else about the chair is still fine, however we can no long fold the chair back up, and she now is basically sitting on the floor about 4 inches off of the ground. For $35 they seemed nice, but during reclining where the foot bar, 3rd leg support, is not touching the ground at all times you probably won't get the full weight support that is needed with just 2 legs in use.",

It\u2019s very embarrassing if you\u2019re in front of anyone because it makes you look like a fool. Now that I've had it for a couple months, the plastic cracked and it won't lock into place at all.

      "text": "Came right out of the box with no setup involved. I am facing back fusion and disk decompression surgery. Once I found the right angle, I am very happy with the chair. For you back pain sufferers, I discovered another great use for the head rest. I was needing something to support my back in my car seat. Tried rolled up towels without much success. Looking at the headrest, I thought that it was molded perfectly and just the right thickness. Tried it and it is absolutely perfect. You can even used the velcro on the back to stretch it around your driver's seat so it stays put. Loved making this discovery.",
