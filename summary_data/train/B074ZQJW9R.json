The internal components of this stand will cause conflicts with anyone using a wireless headset other than a Corsair brand. Issues have been documented regarding using the Logitech G933 Artimus Spectrum headsets with this product. Extremely poor customer support for this product by Corsair. Better off to purchase a regular stand, and the RGB Lighting is not very bright or impressive.",

You have to pay for your own shipping to return it to them, which was $25 -- one third the cost of a replacement. Plus the long wait. It looks cool and its fun to mess with the RGB settings in iQue, but I'll probably list my replacement on Craigslist just so that I don't have to worry about another one dying on me and wasting money on a 2nd RMA. The rest of my Corsair components were nice but this one felt CHEAP.",

For reference, my Philips SHP9500 fit perfectly on the stand, but it's just a bit too wide for my Sennheiser HD58X, even with it's recessed groove in the headband cushion for headstand compatibility. If the corsair stand could've been rounded to match the arc of headphone head bands, it would be perfect. Other than that, its great.",

Otherwise it's rainbow fade all day every day. Any time I put my computer to sleep or log off current user, the lights automatically jump into the rainbow fade default. Checked with Corsair support, there is no way to change this. Looks nice, but not having the ability to turn off the LED's when your computer sleeps (without USB power management or physically unplugging the device) is a deal breaker. Returning for something that will actually sleep properly.",

This might not be a problem if you don't plan to set a pure white, but for the cost I expect better. Isn't the RGB the entire point, after all?

I would definitely recommend if you're an rgb fan and if you have a wireless headset, it's a great addition.",

I recently bought a Corsair mouse as well, and having all 3 products sync RGB waves is just amazing. Build quality is awesome. Would recommend!",

Not too tall and not too short, can hold many types of headsets. 2 USB ports make it easy for wireless headset charging and phone charging. LEDs are a bit dimmer than I expected. Would recommend to buy as a headset stand if LEDs brightness is not that important.",
