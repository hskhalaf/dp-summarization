The older I get, the more careful I need to be. These braces... Now I'm not gonna push the limits because I still have a day job and don't wanna become disabled but, I'm able to squat again. Not hundreds of pounds but, 135# safely for sure. Very happy with this product. Would purchase again. Also... Customer service is A+.

Not too tight. I won't say that these are the best on the market as I only used one other brand. I definitely like this brand better in that comparison. In just shy of 400 pound squats my knees feel very stable. I don\u2019t feel that these sleeves impacted my squats such as allowing me to lift more weight. That\u2019s not what I was looking for though. I just wanted stability and something that wouldn\u2019t interfere with my range of motion. This is it.",

I went with the medium, but found that it was a bit looser than I was hoping for--fine for running, but not lifting. ProFitness' customer service was awesome in getting a smaller size to me within 2 days. The small is very tight and much more supportive--very happy with this purchase. I will note that the neoprene is hot, and not the most comfortable thing to wear for a full workout. I plan on putting it on only for my heavy leg lifts.",

I only wish they were maybe 2ish inches longer, I\u2019m 6\u20194 and have really long legs but they still work really well and fit good",
