However, the net itself is only ~36 inches on the longest dimension, and is made of nylon rope so it does not stretch at all. The joke on you is that there is a bungee cord woven around the perimeter of the net -- and that *cord* stretches to attach to something 60 inches wide. But barely half of the width will be covered by the netting material.",

First of all, it's cheap, but it's not cheap. Seems to be well put together. The anchors it comes with are more than sufficient to hold the net up. I just had to drill two anchors up high and then the bottom pieces connected nicely to seat back. Now I have a great dog barrier to keep the dog from chewing on things he isn't supposed to. Bottom line, for whatever you want to use this for - the price cant be beat. *2009 Ford Escape.",
