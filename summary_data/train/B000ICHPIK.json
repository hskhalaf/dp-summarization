I occasionally will get a hamstring cramp because my legs are bent to 90 degrees, with ankle weights. But, I'd definitely buy this again. And my girlfriend likes it for her YouTube barre class.",

      "text": "I've been using the Ultimate Body Press dip stand for a couple of weeks and it's a great product. It was very easy to assemble and it's solid in construction. The fit and finish is very good and the foam grips on the handles are also very good. Given the angle of the handles, you can target either chest or triceps, which is very nice. I was originally shopping for a more substantial dip stand but I'm very happy that I purchased this stand instead. We use it in our small home gym and the ability to pick it up and move it very easily is great. This was a great buy.",

It isn't a huge deal but it does make it more challenging and not in a good way. Now when I use it I have to prop it on my mat and that makes it more sturdy.",
