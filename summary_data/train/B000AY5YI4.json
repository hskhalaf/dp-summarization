Having the equivalent of 10 buttons (left+right click, side button, resolution up+down (if you change the settings in Logitech utility so they're not bound to resolution change), scroll wheel left+right+up+down+ scroll click) in games is great. The cord is wrapped in nylon so it doesn't won't get twisted and bent and break the wires inside. Nice and heavy with the weight discs in, and doesn't glow in the dark at night so I can sleep!

I've added soft plastic bumpers to my [ and ] keys on my keyboard for increasing/decreasing brush size/hardness by touch (I don't have to glance at the keyboard).

The extra thumb button is programmed to \"hit-the-dirt\" so now I don't get shot as often. Logitech makes a great sturdy product. I've been using them for years and they've never failed me.

My 510 was a bit jumpy and too light. I went to the G5 and was not disappointed. The weights help in controling the precision movement needed for sniper shots and the laser is fantastically smooth and accurate. I still wish it was bigger to fit my hand better without parts of my hand rubbing the mouse pad but that's life. Don't forget to get a smooth and monolithic mouse pad for best performance.",

The G5 is limitless in its sensitivity and weight customizations and has notibly improved my play in the short time I've had it. However, the shape and size of the mouse is a bit awkward for my hands and I foresee cramping issues in the near future before my hand gets used to it. -PS \"waltzing matilda\"",

The mouse has been 100% accurate since the time of purchase (almost a year now). This mouse is truly overkill though, just find a cheaper laser guided mouse if you can or if it even exists. Or just buy this.",

Installed Razor copperhead in 2.66 min., wasted 6.25 hours and could not get Logitech to work. I have been using PC's since they were invented and never have failed to install anything, software or hardware. Until now. Never owned a keyboard or Mouse that were not Logitech, until now.... I support Razor.... they install, not lockup. They are not trying. Good Luck to you with yours.",
