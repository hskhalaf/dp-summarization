      "text": "it looks good on my desk, but there are quality control issues. It works most of the time, but I've noticed the following issues... 1) On very hot days the video ports start cutting out. No amount of fiddling fixes this. And its annoyingly inconsistent. 2) The sound port is so bad there is no point using it. It crackles like a cheap pair of headphones. 3) The front USB C port (the one my MBP is plugged into) is a bit loose. It works, just feels insecure. None of these issues are bad enough for me to return the item, but I wouldn't buy it again.",

      "text": "I bought this to use with my new HP ZBook 15v G5 laptop. Although it's a very good all-round dock and has the ports I need, it does NOT work with two monitors and my laptop. This is a problem with the laptop and not the dock. I just had a very useful chat with a StarTech support agent. So if you have an HP laptop, check if it has \"hybrid graphics\" - in which case you will have to do what I do, which is to use this dock for one monitor and the laptop's HDMI for the other.",

Works out of the box with my MacBook Pro 16\u201d, dual monitors working without the need to any drivers etc. Bonus are the two display ports, so can run two monitors without problem. No lag or quality issues to the display via the unit. Very well built, no noise or excessive heat. Comes well packaged, power adapter with both uk and euro plug adapters. Also has a USB-C cable to connect your laptop to it. Highly recommended.",
