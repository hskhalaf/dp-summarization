The problem is that the buttons on the divider itself were but on backwards and the buttons on the center divider are 2 inches closer to the edge than where the flap connects to the front. Kinda makes for a small awkward uneven pocket in the front that always unsnaps. Might have been better off spending a few extra dollars but it'll do I guess.",

I'm very pleased and this will hold a LOT of stuff. Plus one of the dividers you can move or lay flat if you're not going to use it. There's also a section with a snapping divider that you can unsnap and not use if needed. Lastly, it collapses easily if you need to fit something larger in there. Highly recommend and I'm so glad I found this product.",

Since there were no instructions I did the initial setup based on what I could determine about how the product could be configured in different ways.

What really stood out was that I could locate the organizer in the back of my new Crosstrek and still fit a golf bag in the space between the organizer and the end of the space. Not a large cart or staff bag but my current bag so that's what counts.",

The buckle/clasp does not secure tightly due to the flimsy quality and the straps can be easily pulled and extended even in the closed position. I am ordering a set of straps to replace the ones provided bringing up my total investment by another $15 so in the end, maybe it is not such a 'good value' after all ?",

      "text": "I have this on the bed of my 2018 Chevy Colorado and it is a good storage organizer. The only thing that this needs work/change is the straps that holds it in place. It is made out of a very bendable hook and the adjuster for how long/how short the straps can be is made out of plastic that is easily pulled. I was adjusting the straps one time and the plastic lock came apart! I thought i broke it but i simply put it back together. Other than these 2 issues, the organizer itself is very useful.",

First, one of the straps buckled broke immediately, with barely any tension, and second it is not very sturdy. While one side maintains its rigidity thanks on part to a partition bottom the other side, does not which makes it difficult to hold anything without collapsing if the strap Is snug. I truly was hoping for a product that worked as advertised.",
