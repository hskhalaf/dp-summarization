I do not have a power drill so now instead of setting up my new shelf, I had to repackage it and throw it in a closet until I\u2019m able to get a power drill. Whenever that is.

      "text": "Basically on top of all the previous reviews which to me seems pretty spot on - I would just add that it is a simple/ minimalistic fixture and you must keep that in mind depending on what would you use it for. It's definitely not heavy duty so I'd be careful with towel placement and try not place anything too large or heavy upon the shelf. I would recommend keeping it out of reach of children or persons whom could be easily harmed. The frosted glass although a bit narrow in depth, seems pretty sturdy and easy to keep clean and brass mounts have a nice finish to it. Easy to install as previous reviewers have described.",

It was easy to install as I was able to do so in a matter of about 20 minutes. It look perfect and I would recommend this product. I wish I could find one just like this only smaller so I could place it on the other wall where I need a towel rack.",

First, it took my husband over a hour to install because he had to drill multiple holes because the round mounting brackets do not mount tight against the wall in order to keep it shelf from wiggling and it wont hold the glass shelf securely. Second, this is only big enough for hand towels, the bar doesn't come far enough away from wall to easily put a full sized towel on it. I also wouldn't trust it to hold a full sized towel (which is what we bought it for), it definitely is not made well enough.",
