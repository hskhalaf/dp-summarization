Every flagship has the same specs, but the sound on this one... perfection! Pros: - Sound with and without headphones is great, I don't think if anyone could improve this. - O.S. dont freezes, actually is the best LG (I repair phones, so I tested every LG that exists, except for the V30). - AI Cam is great, but it can improve like everything new. Cons: - Facial Recognition is a little bit slower. Great phone! 9.5/10",

Performance really suffered in that the OS did not seem optimized for the hardware (stutters and lags) but this was most evident in the camera software which would lock up during launch or during a photo capture, sometimes not even taking a photo. This was also reflecting in the poor battery life, very moderate use in good signal area resulted in 50% drain with only a few hours (mostly in standby).

Quality of materials is excellent and sound quality is above average, though not as good as as the Moto Droid Turbo 2 it replaced (the T2 had dual sizable front-facing stereo speakers).
