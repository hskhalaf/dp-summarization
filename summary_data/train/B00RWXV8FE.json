Fortunately there is a fast enough external SSD that can help. The Samsung T1 USB 3.0 comes in 250GB, 500GB, and 1TB capacities. With a Benchmark of 400 MBps read and write, you can edit 4K at home and on the go",

Interesting concept because in all my years of using file storage systems, software was not the was access to the storage. Either the storage was there or it was not. So........I am thinking that actually it is using some kind of compression to expand the storage amount. Compression slows processes down. End the end, the transfer speed from my \"C\" Drive to this back up seems to be the same as a SATA drive. I was hoping for much faster transfer rates.",

It works great like a super sized thumb drive. It allows for fast access and the will allow the playing of music, photos and videos on my car audio system. It does require that you format it in FAT32 for use in the car but once formatted it works great. I will likely get another for my other car.",

One of these years, they will be much larger capacity, with a good price and I would buy more, but for now the size is adequate for what I store on laptops.

MAN, was I surprised! This thing is EXTREMELY LIGHT yet AMAZINGLY FAST! My sample libraries load from this SSD almost instantly. My only regret is that I didn't 'pony up' for the 500GB version!",

Amazon policy is very clear, one month. The product is less than one year, it should be under warranty. However, I found that Samsung does not support their product. Be careful when you buy Samsung product.",
