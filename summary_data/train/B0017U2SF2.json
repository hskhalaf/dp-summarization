I love the Boston cocktail shaker! It works extremely well. The seal on it is extremely tight. The double sided-shot jigger with a handle is awesome. The strainer is high quality. Honestly, all the other parts of the set are high quality and I absolutely love them! The only \"cheap\" feeling part is the stand, but who cares? It's just a stand! I have been wanting this FOREVER and am so happy to have finally added it to my bar!",

But, if your looking for a tool set this is definitely the best priced for how much you get at a great quality. I'd recommend it if you don't already have a shaker. But if you do, then get the OXO bar set for roughly the same price.",

I have three complaints, or it would be five stars: -The tools look good, but have a bit of a cheap feel -The glass for the shaker has tacky drink recipes on the side. I like the measurement markings, but could do without the recipes -The jigger is 2 oz / 1 oz. I think the perfect jigger should include a 1/2 oz measurement. It's easy to remember where the halfway marks are, but I would recommend grabbing a 0.5oz/0.75oz jigger or a measurement shot glass (with the oz/ml markings on the side)",

      "text": "Pretty cool set for the money. I like that it came with multiple items needed to make drinks. Most importantly a stirrer, a jigger, the tumblers, and as an added bonus the stand, the cutting board, the knife and even a bottle opener. Great item for anyone who hosts guests who like to drink and a great addition for your home bar.",
