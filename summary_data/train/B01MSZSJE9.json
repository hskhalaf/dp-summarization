I think the engineers 'solved' this by implementing audible beeps for every 'event' (i.e. user interaction). Unfortunately, a track change on the audio device counts as an event - so when you play an album or playlist, you get an audible beep between each song (on an iphone at least). Definitely not a headset for audiophiles and I definitely would not have bought these had I know about this issue.",

Battery life is good, can't say I've timed it but usually lasts 2-3 days of intermittent use whilst I'm at work before another charge is required - so I'd say the quoted battery life is probably bang on (bluetooth connection) The headphones are comfy and can be worn for relatively long periods, although those with large ears might fine the cups restrictive. Build quality is standard Sennheiser and nobody can complain when paying this amount Sound is acceptable, was expecting more in the low end - but a tweak to the equalizer on your device sorts this right out. The rest of the frequency range is nice without any uncomfortable spikes.",

Battery life really good, suggested 25 hours which I think is accurate . and if you run out of juice you can plug them in via a supplied cable to continue wired listening ... you do lose all the music controls and volume on the headphones, and cannot charge and listen simultaneously. Charging quick and via micro usb cable.",

Sennheiser support said it was to do with phasing of volume between headphones and iPhone, tried to suggest a technique to phase but it didn't work and there's no way I'm messing around with this every time I use them. Not fit for my purpose I'm afraid and I'm surprised at a quality brand still selling a product with this flaw.",

The other thing is that I haven't been able to connect them using the bluetooth to my laptop, but it works perfectly fine with my phone. Pros: - Very comfortable and light - Long lasting battery - Good range from device Cons - The sound isn't the best. - They come only with a bag so they can damage if you don't buy a hard case",

The headphones fit on top of ears and not around them and therefore become uncomfortable, particularly if worn for longer periods. Extending the head band helps from a comfort perspective. Mainly will use if commuting or walking dog. Controls super easy. I don\u2019t get any annoying beeps when switching tracks when using with iPod nano. Generally quite impressed. The bag supplied offers no protection so perhaps it\u2019s worth considering a storage case. Update - Despite all the positives, they\u2019re too uncomfortable, so have since returned them and opted for the Sony WH-CH700N instead.",

    "description": "Sennheiser HD 4.40 Wireless offers good quality wireless sound for every day listening on the move. The closed-back, around-ear headset features Bluetooth 4.0 and aptX compatibility to deliver true Hi-Fi sound with a satisfyingly dynamic bass. Its minimalistic design has been crafted from robust, good quality materials to meet the requirements of the street. Typical audio output ports include: 3.5mm headphone port, red and white RCA audio output ports and digital audio output (either optical or coaxial). In some instances an adapter or extra component will be needed to make the appropriate connection. For example to change a 3.5mm headphone plug to an RCA connection you would use a female 3.5mm to male RCA adapter. For example to change an analog connection (3.5mm headphone plug or red and white RCA plugs) to a digital connection (ie: optical) you would use a digital to analog decoder (like the OREI DA 34).\n\nBOX CONTAINS\n4044155204711",
