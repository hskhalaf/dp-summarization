A bonus is it keeps your beverage of choice ice-cold. Mine arrived in time for use on a hot, humid Chicago August summer weekend, and I enjoyed no less than 4 martinis in it. This receptacle keeps the beverage chilled to perfection and it looks pretty cool, too!",

The copper is the perfect thickness, the stem feels to be solid copper, and they are perfectly shaped. Often, the weakest point will be where the stem mounts to the base and bowl. Looks to be as solid as it can be. The joints are seamless and I don't foresee any problem with the construction They are top notch quality. I'm very pleased!",

Best part is I no longer have to worry about everyone breaking my delicate martini glasses in the freezer, or being washed, or even in the farking cupboard, and I didn't have to compromise on asthetics! Someone's gonna have to stop me from bringing it to my next happy hour because I so want to! That it makes me feel Game of Thronesy doesn't hurt either:)",
