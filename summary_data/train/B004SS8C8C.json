The snowmobiles are kept outside all winter and stored inside all summer with the covers on. The cover for my cat was $475.00 and is a much better cover and you can trailer with this cover! I never consider the Budge cover for trailering for a cost of forty something! I will be ordering another Budge cover for my cat this year because you just give it a shake in the winter and all the snow just slides off I have to sweep the snow off the cat cover.",

That cover is easily a $100 cover for only 50.",
