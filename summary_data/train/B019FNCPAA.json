Simply great quality at a fair price compared to the Bob and Thule Urban Glide. We go on daily walks with our huskys and this stroller is smooth. I removed the seat material so we could use it as a car seat caddy in the first months. The KeyFit 30 car seat clicks in and out very easy. It fits easily in the trunk of my Honda Accord. You will not regret this purchase,",

I absolutely LOVE this thing. It is so easy to push, it\u2019s very sturdy, and handles bumps and gravel like it\u2019s nothing. It is such a smooth ride for my baby. The quality of this is great. It is very easy to collapse and put in the car. Just a button and twist of the handle and boom done. It is quite heavy which I don\u2019t think is a bad thing. To me it just means it\u2019s sturdy. I love it.",

I did check to make sure the carseat fits this model before purchase and it does, but sometimes it gets stuck in the clips that are supposed to hold it, and we have to pull our baby out of the car seat and then shake the car seat free to get it out. This is a minor inconvenience, but the stroller is really nice I'm willing to let it slide since our son will out grow his car seat before this stroller.",

It takes 2 hands and a turning motion. It\u2019s also very bulky and doesn\u2019t store well in a car. The padding on the front fell off during a run and I lost it, only after 2 months.

We also do have the Chicco car seat that will click into the stroller... if we needed it. Baby loves our multiple walks today and fell asleep in it. Our baby likes to hold on sides of bumper that fits across so another reason we choose this seat is it has that she can use.",

    "title": "Chicco TRE Jogging Stroller - Titan",
    "description": "The Chicco TRE is designed to keep up with fast-paced families from everyday outings all the way to race day. A lightweight aluminum frame, sleek three-wheel design, deceleration hand brake, and 16\" pneumatic rear tires make it easy to maneuver. And dual FlexCore suspension adjusts for smooth or rugged terrain.\n\nFor smaller babies, the TRE accepts all KeyFit and Fit2 infant car seats. (car seat sold separately) For added convenience, the stroller seat and backrest detach easily in one piece, along with the canopy, leaving behind a lightweight frame stroller. As baby grows, a five-point harness, multi-position backrest and waterproof fabrics help create a comfortable and secure environment for continued strolling or jogging. A full-coverage canopy with a zippered extension panel and flippable mesh vent/tinted window provides comfortable shade from the sun.\n\nFor unmatched convenience, the TRE features an exclusive Control Console with hand-operated functionality that\u2019s easy to access while strolling. The front swivel wheel can be locked/unlocked from the console for on-the-go adjustment. The deceleration brake is also controlled from the console and doubles as a fixed brake for parking. A padded push handle, soft parent tray with two cup holders, and large storage basket provide added convenience.\n\nTRE conveniently folds with one hand into three compact configurations: the standing fold is perfect for the garage; the front swivel wheel easily folds down to create a flat fold for the trunk; and quick-release wheels reduce the footprint for longterm closet storage.\n\nBRAND STORY\nBy Chicco",
