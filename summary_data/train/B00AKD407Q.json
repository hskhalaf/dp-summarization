      "text": "Virgin Media Customers, I can't recommend using an external router enough. I had an instant improvement in wireless performance with this router. Got a much stronger, faster & reliable signal with all my devices around the house especially with the dual-band wireless, 5GHz is so much better if your device supports it. The router was super easy to set up, really clean sinple UI. Put your Virgin Media Hub into \"modem mode\" plug the router in and it does the rest. You can of course tune the settings if you know what your doing.",

Every hotel, sometimes every night, you have to get a wifi login. With this, you log into the admin page through your laptop, once per session. Every device can now log into the Netgear. The added advantage is that there is a firewall between the Netgear and all your devices.",

All of which means when I change my ISP or upgrade to fibre, I don't have to change wireless settings for any of our devices and my Sky router is working much better now it only has one job to do, i.e. deliver my broadband. The gigabit ethernet option has provided a performance boost to my NAS as well. Happy days.",
