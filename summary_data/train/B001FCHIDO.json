Easy install, it's a tight fit and needs to be. Let it sit out of the box for a couple hours prior to install to get it's shape. I believe the rubber is softer than some others, perhaps giving it perceived better traction on pavement. When worn, this tire has wear markers, which seem to be nylon threads appearing with ~25% tread remaining.",
