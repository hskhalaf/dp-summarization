Before buying this, I used to just pack my hair products, cleansers/skincare, toothpaste/toothbrush, etc., in separate gallon sized plastic bags that would get buried in my suitcase, and aren't exactly sturdy. This bag has 2 large clear compartments that fit things like standard-sized shampoo, lotion, hairbrush, etc, not just travel size, and 3 smaller side zip compartments. It zips and fold ups easily, to store in my suitcase. I traveled across Italy, staying in 4 different hotels, and this bag made keeping all my toiletries organized. Highly recommend!",

Absolutely love it. It may be expensive and that had put me off but it is now PRICELESS to me. Would definitely recommend this than a cheaper bag that may break on you!
