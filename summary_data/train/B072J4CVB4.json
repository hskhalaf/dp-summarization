Only problem would be taking the car seat out of your car from the base. If your car is small and the front seat is touching the rear car seat, it is difficult to take the car seat off from the base. You need some space for it to detach from the base. Apart from that, my wife and I really love it!",

While the car seat should come with a base (ours did, anyways), I highly recommend buying this additional base if you have someone transporting your baby on a regular basis, if for no other reason than convenience.",
