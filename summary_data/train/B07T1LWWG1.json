Weight is very well balanced, the 165Hz is a game changer indeed, the only down-side to this, honestly, is the 2k resolution, as I was used to a 4k monitor before I bought this one. I do not regret buying it, it is a jack-of-all-trades monitor, which is exactly what i wanted, and the price is really competitive for a curved screen. Would totally recommend!",

Simply put this monitor is excellent, no regrets, in fact I want another one for dual set up. The On Screen Controls are easy to use, via the joystick in the middle. G-Sync compatible, make sure you update the monitor upon installation, latest is F03. The monitor is a quality build too, also comes in a sturdy cardboard box that will not damage your monitor while in transit. Enjoy screen tearing FREE gaming! BTW Doom looks and runs amazing!",

So far so good, it was easy to assemble the 3 parts and it has been lovely to use both in normal use and whilst gaming. Only minor niggle is that the RGB lighting on the back does not glow very brightly meaning that unless you position it on an open back desk you cant really see the glow reflecting of the wall/ other surfaces. But does not effect the primary use.",

The colour of an IPS panel compaired to the TN panel is amazing though the response times are not as fast and there is some slight ghosting if using speed mode with low fps. The colour more than makes up for this, also using balanced setting which got rid of the ghosting and no noticeable increase in the panels response times. I play games like cod and rocket league, i don't really play csgo so dunno if going from TN to IPS would make a difference in a game like that.",

      "text": "I purchased one of these, not through amazon, but through overclockers uk. On arrival I discovered that there was a set of dead pixels in the upper middle part of the screen. That's the first time this has happened to me in 20 years of buying monitors. Fine, no problem. Arranged a replacement only to have the second screen exhibit a different set of dead pixels and a horizontal black bar when displaying HDR content. This is a \u00a3450 product that's 0/2. TLDR; Give your money to people who won't waste your time.",
