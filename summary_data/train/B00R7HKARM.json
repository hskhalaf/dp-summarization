The proof of this is that I use it most days whereas others have sat gathering dust after initial use. I love this because it is simple, it keeps my coffee hot without it stewing on a hot plate and very importantly it is very easy and quick to clean. It keeps the coffee hot for a good three hours and very warm probably a little longer. You can make as much or as little as you like. I use paper coffee filters but you can buy a gold permanent filter if you prefer. Love it.",

It\u2019s cheaper to run as the paper filters not too costly and can buy lovely great priced coffee from a certain German supermarket. I love having the timer function on our particular model too. I set it each night for 6am and coffee still at drinking temperature by 9am (and beyond) due to the brilliant thermal jug. It\u2019s quiet, reliable and makes a gorgeous cup of coffee (well several) all at once. Love it!",

Perhaps it isn't too bad if you make a full jug everytime but not great for smaller quantities as you end up with mildly warm content. Also, you never know how much coffee there is left in the jug. I opted for a steel jug option hoping it would maintain coffee's taste better but due to the above I rate this product and idea itself quite poorly.",

Keeps the coffee hot for a couple of hours without the traditional hot plate design (which can actually burn and impair the flavour of the coffee). Saves electricity this way, and keeps warm a lot longer than other machines that power off the hot plate after 30 minutes. Removeable filter cone for easy cleaning too.

I love the timer, my coffee is ready when I need it. Water is easy to pour in, cleaning is easy, adding filter and coffee is easy. I love the heat maintained in the jug, four hours later - I still have hot coffee waiting for me. It pours well, much better than all the glass jugs I have used. No hotplate needed as it is so heat efficient. Just make sure you properly engage the jug before you switch on. Superb product.",

I read this coffee machine is just a single drip nozzle which isn't the case, it has an intensity dial to select between single and multi drip. Great purchase and looks smart too.",

The vacuum flask keeps the coffee hot for hours without a hot plate, making it ecofriendly. But the flask is sealed, with a valve allowing coffee to drip through. This means hardly any coffee aroma comes from the machine. That said, the coffee it makes is great. I found Lavazza 5 is the best. Coarser ground coffees did not work well. I do love it.
