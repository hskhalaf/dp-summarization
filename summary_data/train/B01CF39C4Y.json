I even bought a new oven (Wolf Professional gas) because my old oven (Viking) was so unreliable and I also hated cleaning it. I thought it was the oven as the portable thermometer never went above 350. I had bought the CDN one just before buying a new oven and then decided to buy a new AcuRite to compare. When I set the new oven to 425 degrees, the AcuRite registered exactly 425 degrees. The CDN registered 350 degrees. My puff pastry came out perfectly. So, I'll stay with the new AcuRite and throw away the CDN. Sorry Cook's Illustrated!",
