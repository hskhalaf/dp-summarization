I wanted to get something for my parents to use, to maintain the edges on their knives. I applaud Whustof for trying, but for the life of me, I could not get this thing to put a proper angle on a knife. I tried a few cheap knives & one Henckels (same angle as Wusthofs). The coarse carbide just ground a ragged edge.....I wanted to like this thing, but I just couldn't. Maybe I got a dud. Seller sent it quickly, no problems there.",

There are few major flaws in it. - it outwears very fast in just 6 minths after sharpening 7-8 knives the rollors are gone more than 50%. - it creates pits along the edges for cheap/low quality knives - it receives cuts at plastic next to rollors",

      "text": "We have a set of Wusthof Trident knives that are 14 years old and had become quite dull. I was hoping to revitalize them and recover their original razor-sharp edge. When the sharpener arrived I immediately put it to the test. The sharpener removed just enough metal to recreate the appropriate angle and impressively brought them back to life. They are now razor sharp. Very pleased!",
