View larger\nUltra-high native contrast of 3000:1, five times of that of general panels FLICKER-FREE TECHNOLOGY\nThe flicker-free technology eliminates flickering at all brightness levels and effectively reducing eye fatigue.

With a native contrast ratio this high, you can expect an infinite dynamic contrast ratio that far exceeds your expectations.\n\nTRUE 8-BIT COLOR PERFORMANCE\nAn 8-bit VA panel delivers smoother and more stable color transitions by rendering a total of 16.7 million color shades simultaneously. A 6-bit panel with Advanced Frame Rate Control (ARFC) requires interpolation to display the same number of colors as a true 8-bit panel does.\n\n178/178-DEGREE WIDE-VIEWING ANGLES\nVA panels bring truly authentic colors and ultra sharp details from left, right, above and below to your eyes with a wide-viewing angle of 178 degrees /178 degrees.

View larger READING MODE FOR AN OPTIMIZED READING EXPERIENCE\nThe Reading Mode recreates the comfortable experience of reading actual books by adjusting the monitor's color temperature and brightness, as well as balancing its contrast ratio and sharpness, to simulate the look of paperback paper. The high contrast ratio characteristic of the VA panel enables this upgraded feature to maintain high text clarity at low screen brightness settings, without irritating your eyes. In turn, this helps reduce the risk of computer eye strain caused by prolonged and focused use of eyes on computer monitors.\n\nIMPROVED ECO MODE FOR HIGHER ENERGY EFFICIENCY\nThe improved Eco Mode adjusts the backlight brightness level to ensure the highest display quality is presented to you with the highest energy efficiency. This intelligent mode reduces at least 37% of the power consumed by document viewing, Internet browsing and emailing and up to 44% of the power consumed by gaming.\n\nSENSEYE 3 VISUAL SOLUTION TO YOUR EVERYDAY VIEWING NEEDS\nExperience the truest colors of the world with the BenQ Senseye Human Vision Technology.
