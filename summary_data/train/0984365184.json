Well, i didn't have an answer for that so I told them to go ask the elf and then I went on amazon to buy the little guy. I'm a sucker for all the \"elf magic\". It brings so much joy to the kids. This is a great addition because the kids actually get to touch the reindeer and snuggle with it. The story itself is really adorable too. Plus you'll be using it for years of Christmas magic. You won't be disappointed",

This toy is very well stitched, it isn't filled with noxious plastic beads and the eyes are stitched on tight and are not plastic. My dogs absolutely adores the thing. They run around and shake it it wildly and play tug-a-war with it, but it hasn't torn like most of their other toys. This year I purchased a second one so they each have their own then gave the book away to a friend to read to her toddler grandchild this Christmas.",

As we also introduced the Krampus in the Corner as a comic foil to Roddy (our Elf) this year, it was nice for him to have a trusty partner for his adventures. Unfortunately, we have an older child that is \"post-belief\" and loves stuffed animals. So we had to explain to our son that the reindeer had some special Santa errands to run to explain why she would leave Roddy's side from time to time (his Sissy absconded with it). Very happy with the purchase.",
