The color and material has held up nicely, especially considering the amount of rough-housing that takes place between these two 5 month old boys. I really like that the reflective material is stitched into the collar rather than printed on it like with some other brands. One pup did develop a sore under the buckle, so I had to buy him a different brand - but I believe this was due to an allergy to whatever type of metal is in the buckle, not due to a defect in the collar itself. That particular pup has thinner fur and more sensitive skin than his brother.",

That allows placement of the leash on the ring near the buckle to remain unobstructed. The collar appears well made and sturdy. My dog seems completely comfortable and happy with his new collar.

Another downside is that the grommet holes on the collar seem to bend after a little bit of use and that can make it tricky to buckle.

      "text": "i'm saddened to write this review. we purchased this collar for our 40 lb aussie rescue in Sept 2018. the collar itself is marvelous. thick, durable and well-made. but if you have an ID on your dogs collar because it's a runner like ours...disappointment is coming your way. The separate loop for the ID tag came off completely. we didn't even make it a year. this feature was a big deal for me because it kept my kids from hooking the leash to the wrong loop. now we are back to what we have to do with all the other collars. of course the return window is closed. I had hoped for much much better.",

This a well made collar, very sturdy, and the reflective stitching is great to keep tabs on her when she wakes me up at 3 a.m. to do her business in the 8 acre field next to our house.",

I will probably end up buying another one or two of these collars because they keep their color even when my dogs roll in the mud and they're very bright and vibrate however, I wish they had more color options.",

      "text": "Love the collar. Durable, looks great. It is true that reflective stitching isn't all THAT visible from a distance, but I wasn't expecting that to be the case, so I wasn't particularly disappointed. If I could change one thing, I would have made a medium length collar that also comes in a 3/4\" width. But as I said, the collar is functional, durable, and more than one person has commented on how good it looks. So I would definitely recommend this product.",
