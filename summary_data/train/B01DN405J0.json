Second night, more rash. Third night, bloody nose and swollen eyes. He had little bite marks all over him. This thing was infested with i'm guessing dust mites or some little bug. Every time I touched the rug afterwards, I felt like little bugs were crawling on me. Couldn't see any of them though. Once I stopped my son from sleeping on the rug in his sleeping bag, the rash/bites went away. Totally disgusted and will not buy from this supplier ever again.",

It is a lighter, not quite neon, definitely not grass green..unless we're talking about smokable \"grass\" in which case yes, maybe that color green depending on the variety.",

The rug by itself, visually and aesthetically, is not attractive enough to stand on it's own in our opinion. For those of you contemplating putting this on a hardwood floor: There is no anti-slip rubber backing on this rug. Note: In it's defense the backing / underlayer of the rug is a sturdy woven material (seems durable) and shipping was free.",

Such a good deal for the unbelievably low price. You can easily pay double for another barely as great as this one. NOTE: I JUST unrolled it and fluffed it up a bit. Almost all wrinkles and corners are smoothed out and it has only been 10 minutes. Just lay something on the corners for a few minutes and the rug will be perfect. Super fast delivery and not too heavy to carry. Buy it.",

You\u2019ll be the envy of everyone who visits your home with the magnificent color from your Solo Solid Shag rug. All machine made rugs (made with polypropylene) will usually have some degree of smell which is simply an off-gassing which is caused by the polypropylene pile. This material is extracted from propylene gas.The odor will subside naturally in an open ventilated area so in cases of a strong smell, we advise to leave it outdoors on a sunny day which will allow for the odors to maximize aeration which should then neutralize. For heavier cases, adding baking soda while outdoors will be helpful to expedite this process.",
