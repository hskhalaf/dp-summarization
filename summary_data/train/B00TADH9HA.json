With the sensitivity in the middle range, it does the job in all soils. It gets wet, sandy, muddy, and rattles around in a bucket of heavy gear every day of the year. Holds up great. Battery life with the 9V has been about 10 months of intermittent use on a weekly basis. Quite happy with it. Saves time digging around.",

I repaired it much better than when it was new. works fine now. For 127.00 you think they could afford to rivet the belt loop. Just a suggestion. Thanks",
