I can feel the difference all over as I am now breathing correctly (not shallow breathing) so I am getting more oxygen to my vital organs and brain. I am more alert and I am sleeping much better too! And bonus, my husband says that I am not really snoring anymore! I did not buy this for sleep apnea but it was a happy extra therapeutic benefit I learned about! Brilliantly intuitive device!!!",

Uncertain how long if ever it will stop off gassing. Which tastes and smells horrible. Also since it doesn't come apart more it's difficult to dry out which will harbor mold and bacteria and could potentially cause other lung issues. Needs higher quality safe plastics and better cleaning designs. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this product when I had such high hopes for it.",
