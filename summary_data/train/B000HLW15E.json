      "text": "Most lumbar support pillows sold today are made of memory foam. If you think about it, what good is memory foam when you need support to correct bad posture and to relieve pressure when sitting. This pillow offers you the support you need and includes a composite board that increases support if you need that extra amount of \"stiffness.\" If you don't need this added support, you can remove it. The pillow is high quality and a reasonable price too. Save your time reading through all the reviews of memory made pillows that cannot offer the support you need. Try this one and start feeling better sooner than later.",

      "text": "Take it from someone that suffered a spinal injury 25 years ago, I have tried MANY different lumbar support cushions. Most are cheap with not much side support so the cushion ends up moving while you drive. The curvature is also a factor and most are just flat so you back doesn't arch much. These are perfect because the sides are bigger which keeps it in place and the arch is just right to make your back comfortable. I had this for 10 years until I lost it on a road trip... my back was in pain until the replacement came. Don't waste your money on the \"sponsored\" cushions and buy this one !",

One consideration: The elastic strap does very little other than keep it from falling forward when you get up. This will work well with chairs that have a back that meets or comes within ~ 4in of meeting the seat. The strap will not do wonders in securing it higher up on the chair back, nor will it adapt well to a design like this: (",

      "text": "I purchased this lumbar support cushion to use in my car. I have a lumbar disc issue from a vehicle accident in the past. This cushion gives me the necessary support while I drive especially if I have to drive for extended periods of time. I like the extra support it provides especially since I drive a later model full sized car. I did not use the added insert since that made the cushion too firm. The other advantage to the cushion is that it makes you sit up with better posture and avoids slumping which places pressure on the lower lumbar discs. I thoroughly enjoy my Duro-Med cushion.",

The strap is very weak and does not hold the wedge cushion in one place/elevation. no matter how I adjust it, it always sinks down to rest on the piece of metal on my chair that attaches the backrest to the seat, which is way too low to use this back cushion properly. I will probably have to modify this product with a better attachment method to use it better.",

I find that those cheap mesh lumbar supports work the best for my needs. If your chair is larger or too small, I wouldn't recommend this. I also think the elastic strap won't last too long with frequent use.",

It has a piece of removable fiberboard in the back of it, which contributes to firmness. Even without the board, this cushion would still be firm and retain its shape.

I would say being aware of your posture is far more important; however, with a cushion giving you a little support for your lumbar wouldn't hurt. I would recommend for individuals who sit for a long period of time.",

The towel was not adequate, but it was FAR better than this support. At least the towel didn't cause more pain.",

I have a similar product (same shape) but this one is better because of the wood insert. At first it seems cheap and not important --but I am loving it. It really makes a difference in the level of comfort and it's easy enough to move to almost any type of chair. Glad I took a chance. Great product!",
