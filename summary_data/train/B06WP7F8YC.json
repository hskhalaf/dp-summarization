      "text": "If I don\u2019t put it away at night, my two cats manage to turn it on (accidentally) by standing on it. This toy holds their interest on and off all day. They lie in wait in some far corner of the room and zoom in to pounce on the decoy, or they bat and bite at it, and sometimes they just like to watch or watch their mate play with it. Of their several toys (including 2 other electronic motion ones), this is far and away their favorite. My only complaint is that the \u201cskirt\u201d is easy to pull off. I\u2019m going to sew a tuck into the opening in hope that it will be harder to pull off.",

However, this toy is bad compared to the competitor of the same style (I won't advertise for them in a review but it's on Amazon and is yellow...). This one is pretty slow, absolutely destroys batteries, and pauses every few seconds and blinks lights.. It ruins the immersion for your pet and the lights literally do nothing to catch their attention. I do NOT recommend this toy versus its competitor. However, not taking the other brand into account, I do recommend this toy/this style of toy.",

The toy takes 3 AA batteries so make sure you get a small pack. Update: it does shut off after some time. I wish it would turn on by its self when my cat attacks it.",

This one is much smaller, cheaply made, easier to flip over, has useless lights that the cat ignores, and it makes a loud clicking sound like it's going to break when the cat holds onto it. In the video you can see that the Petlinks brand spins on the carpet when it's held so it doesn't put stress on the motor. The attachment also peeks out a little when it reverses direction which this one does not do.",

There is a slow mode and a fast mode. If it is moving and a cat pins the wand it does make an audible clicking sound when trying to move but can\u2019t. The different personality types also come out while watching them play with this. One may try to attack the wand only when visible while another literally goes under the cover to attack it. By far the best cat toy we have bought to date. Highly recommend!",
