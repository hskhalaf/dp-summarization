That, and because they successfully crafted a product whose selling price many would consider budget-friendly. The area where they somehow missed the mark, however, is in the width department. All in all, the Berghaus Expeditor Ridge 2.0 is a stellar hiking product thanks to its list of incredible trail-specific qualities. Those who find its fit impossibly confining, though, are welcome to try out the brand\u2019s wider offerings.",

As soon as the \"leather\" upper cracked, in came the water. Surprisingly the 'product' was out with the return period - \u00a3100 boots only lasting that length of time, I would have thought would be covered by a statutory guarantee, but no not on Amazon. Very neat fit, suggest buying a half size bigger too",

Only did 3 or 4 miles and they felt just as comfortable as they did when I put them on. Plenty of mud and unavoidable puddles after recent rain and my feet were dry and the tread was good and no sliding in the mud. Well worth the money.",

If you deliberately wear short trousers, white socks and like garish branded neon ticks and stripes and take selfies of your shoes then these aren't for you. If however you enjoy walking in comfortable, supportive, breathable, top quality, lightweight boots that will last, then look no further.",

Good grip on wet surfaces and so far seem waterproof. They look a little narrow but actually feel like a normal fit. So far they seem to shrug mark's and mud pretty well. Will write another review on their longevity after more wear.",
