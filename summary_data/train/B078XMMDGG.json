This is the third or fourth one I have installed This design reverses the usual male/female screws , and by far the WORST EXPERIENCE! The problem is the filter casing has male threads, so when it is screwed in, there is nothing to hold the O-ring in place. Consequently when pressurized, the O-ring will squirm out of its track and the unit will leak all over your kitchen floor. If you like to mop up leaks, this is the unit for you. Call their customer support and they offered me nothing.",

So i went all in on this filter and really glad i did. It was mostly easy to install, but i did have to buy an additional hose from the hardware store (due to how my faucet was hookedup). Besides that, the install was rather easy (make sure you screw the filters on all the way before turning the water back on). Now i have what seems like an unlimited supply of clean and great tasting water! Ice cubes, coffee, water, it's all amazing!",
