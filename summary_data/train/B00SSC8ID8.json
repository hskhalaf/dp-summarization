These seeds taste, look, and smell like chia, of course, but they're white, so they don't weird-out my husband when he puts them into his light-colored foods. Win!!",

They swell and become gel like texture the next day, very similar to tapioca texture. Since I like tapioca a lot, I thought this chia seeds pudding are a great substitute. They have mild taste compared to the black chia seeds I got from the store. Also the chia seeds I got from the store never swell, and very nutty flavor; therefore I am pleasantly surprised with this brand of white chia seeds.",

No crunchiness then- and they taste like tapioca pudding! Much better price on Amazon, you get twice the weight for the same price as 8 oz in a grocery or big box store and they're organic.
