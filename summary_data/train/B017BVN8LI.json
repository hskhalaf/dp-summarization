They look nice, aren't too bulky to be fashionable, and are really comfortable. They don't feel too clunky to wear as street shoes after you shovel snow.",

The fabric material on the outside of the boot resembles felt. I wasn't so sure what to think about that part of the boot at first. However, my feet/legs didn't get wet in the snow and my legs stay really nice and warm in these boots. So, I am happy. :) You COULD buy more expensive boots, but for the price these are pretty great. (They run true to size. I also have wide feet and these worked great.)",

The fit is somewhat small as I could feel the front of the boots touching my toes, which was pretty uncomfortable. The overall fit on my feet was uncomfortable.

There's a little bit of a papery, crackly feel to the upper parts, and the boots could definitely be a little bit thicker and more substantial. Guess I'm too used to UGG's, but the UGG's don't have a real good sole for traction in the snow; ergo, I needed snow boots.

The calf portion is a woven fabric and very likely would not keep moisture out if worn in deep, wet snow. I use then to go to the chicken coop and back to the house on a shoveled path. They do have good traction. The design of the calf does make it adjustable if your calves are wider.",

      "text": "Because these were boots, I ordered a half a size larger figuring I would want room for heavy socks. I unfortunately, had to return and Order My True size. My only complaint, is that I cannot lace them tight enough at the ankle without scrunching up all of the material since the tongue doesn't separate from the boots until apprx 2in. up from the ankle. I am assuming this is necessary in order to keep the weather out. They look great, but I can't speak to how well they wear yet as I haven't hit the snow with them as of this writing. They look fairly well made though.",

We had about 5-6 inches and my feet stayed perfectly warm and dry. I first bought them as a 9.5, but they were a little small. I requested a size 10 and the company quickly exchanged them with no problem. They were friendly and professional. I would definitely buy from them again. The size 10 fits great. I normally wear a 9-9.5 in shoes so I suggest buying a size/half size bigger for comfort. I absolutely recommend these boots.",

Waterproof on these boots is only on the shoe portion right you the ankle. Hey, it's cute snow boots to wear on slightly less than mild winter weather, not hip wader. Stitching on boots is well. Does not rip or tear easily. Comfortable to wear. 100 percent pressed with purchase. Will buy again from this company.",
