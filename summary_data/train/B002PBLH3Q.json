However, I decided to try to work with it and so the third day I blended it with my fingertip until it melted in, with some gentle pressure, and it did just that, melted in and smoothed over my problem area. So, if you think it is old or bad, give it another try. I think the product just needs more smoothing in that I was accustomed to.",

Other times I use foundation and makeup after this primer. Can be used just with moisturizer, moisturizer and sunscreen, or with all the steps of makeup.",

Due to this heaviness, it also makes me worried about clogged pores and potential break-outs. Additionally, it is a very small jar so it doesn't last very long. I personally will be going back to e.l.f's hydrating face primer which I feel goes on lighter and smoother while still providing a good base to work with.",
