I also highly recommend the Kreg clamp- it's fast become my go-to--automatically adjusts to thickness--another must-have tool!",

I'd recommend watching a couple tutorial videos before you get started, just to make sure you've got it down correctly. It's also extremely satisfying to use. Makes me feel like a surgeon.

However, if you look at (cheaper) competition, you might not understand why this is a little more expensive. Little things like the little guide for setting up the depth collar on the drill bit (which is also provided). The removable drill guide, so that you can use it on already-assembled work (without the entire jig). Well recommended.",

Please know that if you don't replace the long drill bit with a standard long phillips bit, you will be forced to continue buying the proprietary Kreg square head screws. The first thing I did was go to Menards and get a really long phillips bit and now I can use regular bulk purchased screws for my projects. Also, adding a little glue to each joint is a must! Softwoods like pine will not keep a tight join just with the screws. I learned that the hard way.",

My guess is I can finish drilling all of my pocket holes in less than one half the time it took with the little jig (which is still a great product and I am sure there will times I will need it).

      "text": "My husband and I love this tool! We used it to build make pocketholes on a toddler stool and a farmhouse dining room table from plans on ana-white.com. I used it on a few test pieces to make sure I was doing it correctly, and the first few I didn't so I definitely recommend testing it on scrap wood first. It is really easy to use now that I got the hang of it. Great for joining a table top so no screws show. We have become addicted to woodworking now that we have this tool.",

I finally broke down and bought one and wish I had years earlier. Joints are very strong yet so much faster than any other method. I found I use it for far more than just face frames too.",

It's easy to use once you read the instructions on how to adjust it. You have to buy their self tapping square drive screws, but they are worth it for the convenience of this jig. Good for new projects and for repairs. Would recommend for small to medium projects. They have an HD version for material larger than a 1.5\".",

I balked at the price at first but knew I would be getting a lot of use out of it right off. I am making kitchen cabinets and this jig works GREAT. I love the simplicity and all of the hype about how easy it is to use is solid. With a small amount of working skill you should be able to use this no problem. Even in the first days of beginning wood working shop I think this would have seemed elemementary. Great design and well engineered. What else needs to be said?",
