The description should specify that they don\u2019t have spikes!",

Perfect for distance running, hurdles or jumps, this spike shoe is a great all-around shoe that offers lightweight performance, fit and comfort. The EVA midsole is surrounded by a breathable synthetic and mesh upper, while the nylon spike plate digs in to the ground for a secure fit.\n\nIn 1949, Mr. Kihachiro Onitsuka began his athletic footwear company (Onitsuka Co., Ltd.) by manufacturing basketball shoes out of his living room in Kobe, Japan. He chose the name ASICS for his company in 1977, based on a famous Latin phrase \"Anima Sana In Corpore Sano,\" which, when translated, expresses the ancient ideal of \"A Sound Mind in a Sound Body.\" Taking the acronym of this phrase, ASICS was founded on the belief that the best way to create a healthy and happy lifestyle is to promote total health and fitness. Today, ASICS offers a full line of performance-driven athletic shoes and technical active sports apparel and accessories dedicated to bringing harmony to the body and soul.",
