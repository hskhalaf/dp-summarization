Of course I love my S4i so much when I saw these T5\u2019s on sale I picked up a set. The sound is nice and easy set up. But where they fail is fitment. If you\u2019re looking for earbuds to just wear than get these. But if you have any plans to do and physical work with them, look elsewhere. From walking to lawn are to running the earbuds consistently fall out of my ear. This is disappointing considering how well my S4i earbuds fit.",

Buds require pressing to operate (rather than touch-sensitive controls of some higher-end buds) so you need to basically push them into your ears to control them.

Some may not like the fact that they are meant to go inside the ear canal, but over the years with both wired (Etymotic mk5) and blue tooth headphones this is the only style that works for me. The sound quality is excellent and the battery life long. I found the sound better than my Samsung earbuds+ which these replaced. The charging case is made of metal and I like the look although it is quite a bit heavier than other brands that are made of plastic.",

I have a pair of wired bluetooth earbuds from Skull candy that sound just as good as these. No noticeable difference. 3.
