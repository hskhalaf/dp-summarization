Stay awa from this overpriced, unusable, nonsensical product and buy something else. There's myriad solutions that will work. OH and the design of this thing is dreadful. Where the hell am I supposed to put this metallic dildo camera?",

It sends me alerts all the time, regardless of whether I'm home or not. None of them are alerts that involve someone entering my home, which is why I bought the camera. As it is, it's worthless. Really cannot recommend the camera as is, with different software it might be useful.",

However, It lacks HDR which makes it completely useless for a room that has almost any natural light coming into it (e.g. windows). Due to the wide angle lens, no matter how I placed the camera the picture was washed out due to the light coming in from the windows. It made people completely unidentifiable which neutralized one of its most interesting features in facial detection. If they come out with a v2 with HDR and a better camera sensor it will be a day 1 purchase for me.",

    "description": "Receive home intruder alerts direct to your smartphoneWelcome is a new-generation smart indoor security camera. Unlike the usual motion alerts which require you to waste time watching footage, Welcome sends an immediate alert if an intruder has been detected in your home, complete with a picture of the person's face and a video recording. The camera uses facial recognition technology to help you look after your children or elderly parents, sending their name to your smartphone to let you know they are well. You can also use the app to disable video recording and notifications for familiar faces. When Welcome hears an alarm, whether it be a smoke alarm, CO alarm, security alarm or the Siren, it will send a notification and record a video. Welcome's setup is quick and easy: place the camera facing your entrance, plug it in and download the app to connect it to your home Wi-Fi network. Identify your loved ones with a simple click. That's it. Your home is now protected against break-ins!Specifications:-Video sensor: 4 MP-Full HD: up to 1920x1080-Field of view: 130\u00b0-Infrared night vision-Local data storage: MicroSD (8 GB Class 10 card included)-Wi-Fi: 802.11 b/g/n (2.4 GHz)",
