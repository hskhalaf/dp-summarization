However, after further research I've learned that this product & similar breathing masks are a health risk & do not actually increase respiratory performance. Cardio masks do restrict oxygen intake yes, but its not the same as high altitude masks which can cost a couple thousand dollars. This mask & similar ones prevent your body from recieving neccessary oxygen to red blood cells while also poisoning you with more carbon dioxide intake. I'll be returning this product.",

What I didn't like about this mask is that during cardio exercises when I am exhaling aggressively, the mask does not fit perfectly and air finds its ways in and out without passing through the mask openings. Also, the package did not contain a leaflet to clarify the percentage of air it blocks or allows. But generally, it is working fine and I can feel the difference after using the mask. Please note that this mask is a no-joke during high intensity exercises.",
