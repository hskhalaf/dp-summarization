      "text": "Update: I contacted the manufacturer on May 8th via email. They replaced my unit because it was still under the manufacturer 2 year warranty. New unit arrived May 11th. Super impressed with the customer service and the Company standing behind their product. Thanks!!! Original review: Loved this product and was perfect for doing my nails at home instead of the salon. Purchased April 6th and used 3 times. Used today, May 7th and it stopped working. My warranty return period ended YESTERDAY on May 6th. That stinks!!!!! Too expensive to only use 3 times and it stop working.",

With this one it takes me less time to do my nails and it works faster and with more precision. I would definitely recommend it. I love that it has the small led light as guide.",

I do my own nails and always have trouble with the cuticles and skin around the rest of my nail. I pick at it and even bite it...then it tears and I am left with open wounds that take forever to heal. With the PureNails nail drill I don't have that problem. The smaller tips gently file away the skin around the nail without causing damage to the nail. It is also a perfect buffer for the ridges that form on my nails. Overall, I love the product and would recommend to friends.",
