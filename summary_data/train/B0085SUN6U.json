However, it can be used to make small pie crusts and other pastries. If you want to make tortillas, I do not recommend this one. If you want one for pastries, this would be perfect.",

I was tempted to buy a more traditional-looking one (since this one looks and feels a bit like plastic), but I'm glad we found a tortilla press in a lower price-range. I didn't like that we had to use plastic sheets to prevent sticking, but I've heard that it's normal even with traditional-looking tortilla presses. We wash and re-use the plastic, and I guess it's better than having to wash the entire tortilla press. It is very lightweight, so I was a bit worried about the handle breaking off, but it feels sturdy when we use it.",

I'm reasonably sure this would eventually snap or crack with very little effort. Aluminum is too soft to be used for a tool that depends on the use of force or torque, IMO. The tortillas I pressed with this gadget were also uneven and too thick. I returned it for a refund & bought a cast iron model instead.",
