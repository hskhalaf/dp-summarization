Otherwise, it was a great dog costume, didn't bother my pup too much, and the gentleman's cut kept everything clean and dry. Like some others have said, the skull/hat thing is a weird shape and doesn't really stay in place. In my opinion, not using it didn't really take anything away from the charm of the costume. I stretched out the holes for the back legs a bit because those seemed a bit tight, but that all depends on the size and build of your dog.",

I have a 95-lb Golden Retriever and a 102-lb Great Pyrenees, and the costumes fit both of them! The costumes are very stretchy so it seems like they have a lot of flexibility. My dogs ran around playing outside like usual even with the costumes on--they hardly seemed to notice they were wearing anything at all. Love these and can't wait to show them off on Halloween!

This costume is great. It's super soft t-shirt material, but not cheap of thin. I bought the XL for my German Shepherd mix and he fits perfect. The only thing that doesn't fit well is the hat/hood. It is too big for my boy's head, but honestly I wasn't planning on making my dog wear something on his head. I would definitely recommend this costume. My dog, Axel, approves! :)",
