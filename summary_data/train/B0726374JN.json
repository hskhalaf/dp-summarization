I'm including a picture of the instructions which say the hold function will take the AVERAGE weight for you, which is great if you have a wiggly baby. However, this is not the case. As the seller says on this page, the hold function simply stops the display from changing once you've determined what the weight is.",

      "title": "Child with Rare Heart Defect Needs Accuracy",
      "text": "Very disappointed with this purchase. We have an 8-month old daughter with a rare heart defect. She started to lose weight due to the effects of the defect. We have been put in a position where monitoring her rate of diminishment versus gains is very necessary in order to report post-surgery progress to her medical care. We have many appointments at the hospital where she is weighed. This scale has been found to be lacking anything nearly resembling accuracy. It has been almost half a pound inaccurate for the entire time we have owned it. We bought this scale on May 7 and within a month and a half it is unusable. We are very disappointed in this purchase.",
