      "text": "I've used this bag everyday for the past three-plus years and it is the best backpack I've ever owned. It's water resistant which has saved my laptop more than once, the cloth hasn't faded from years of use, and the bottom isn't worn through even though I regularly carry around my laptop, planner, and several notebooks/books. The Jester's design is practical and also sleek enough that I feel fine taking it to professional conferences. There's a sleeve that's the perfect size for a laptop or folders, and a bunch of handy compartments. Great product.",

I haven't had the backpack long enough to know how it fares in snow or heavy rain.",

Plus, the drink holder seems small and it was hard putting a drink in there.",

Good new was it fits all of this, albeit snug. It is hard to easily pull out an item I am in need without taking everything out. This is due to the cushion used as built in laptop sleeve. The packpack is a little stiff and will not sit upright on the ground making it difficult to find a place to put your backpack in class or a meeting. The backpack is a pretty color, durable but not functional. My old Jansport (which I am now using again) blows this away.",
