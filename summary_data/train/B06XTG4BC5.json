I have not had an issue with the white dots that others wrote about or the tips falling off. They clean up nicely and honestly look great! The handles are metal so obviously they will get hot if you leave them in a hot pan. The whisk's handle is hollow, so when washing, dry with it upside down. The notch at the end is handy if you want to hang them up. I've been impressed with them so far. My mom really liked them so I'm thinking they'd make a nice mom's day gift!",
