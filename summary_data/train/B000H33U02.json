The saw cut through the masonry like a hot knife through butter. The only negative comment I have is that the diamond blade went flat after approximately 3 linear feet of cutting but I did not expect much from a prepackaged blade. the job is done and I'm going out to purchase a quality diamond blade for my next project",

    "description": "Hefty 11.6 Amp (2,090 Watt Output) motor\n\nAMAZON.COM\nThe Hitachi Dry-Cut Masonry Circular Saw features a powerful 11.6 Amp motor with a maximum 2,090 watt output to produce a no-load speed of 11,500 RPM for greater cutting efficiency. This saw is ideal for cutting through the toughest materials such as tile, marble, granite, concrete, and brick. The saw's design is specifically suited for dry cutting applications and also helps minimize the tool's vibrations and noise. The specially sealed armature coil is protected from dust and debris. The metal-seated ball bearing design increases durability by warding off potential motor damage caused by high temperatures and vibration. The 1-touch lever quickly adjusts the saw's cutting depth up to 1-3/8 inches, the short, 1-7/64-inch base-edge-to-blade distance allows for easier cutting in tight spaces.\n\n This saw is built with a dust-sealed switch and has a D-shape handle with patented elastomer soft grip to absorb vibration, reduce slippage, and provide greater comfort. This compact, lightweight saw measures 8-1/8 inches in length and weighs only 6-1/5 pounds for easy maneuverability and less user fatigue. The saw accepts wheels with 7/8-inch arbors and maximum diameters of 4-3/8 inches. The saw comes with a premium 4-inch continuous-rim diamond blade designed for high-performance dry cutting, plus a wrench, a 10-millimeter box wrench, a 20-millimeter flange, and a 7/8-inch flange. This Hitachi saw is backed by a 5-year limited warranty extended to the original purchaser.\n\n What's in the Box\nDry-cut circular saw, 4-inch continuous-rim blade, wrench, 10-millimeter box wrench, 20-millimeter flange, and 7/8-inch flange.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe new CM4SB2 4\" Masonary Saw sets a new standard for power, performance and durability. With an 11.6 amp motor and a maximum 2,090 watt output, the CM4SB2 will rip through tile, marble, granite, concrete, brick and similar materials. Designed specifically for dry cutting, the specially sealed armature coil is protected from dust and debris. Other features include the shortest base edge-to-blade distance for cutting in tight spaces, a soft grip handle, dust sealed switch, simple depth adjustment and a metal seated bearing for improved durability.\n\nSee more",
