Supports Muscle Recovery and Repair\nL-Arginine HCL aids in the building of muscle by providing increased nitric oxide; essential for protein synthesis. This means you get a stronger, longer workout so you leave the gym feeling more satisfied.\n\n?

Just as there are 4 growth stages for a powerful alpine evergreen, the same 4 stages apply to our manufacturing process. First, we source the highest quality raw ingredients. Second, we test every batch for purity and consistency. Third, we encapsulate these pharmaceutical grade raw materials by GMP and FDA compliant machines. Finally, we test the final product yet again, to ensure our capsules have the correct weight and contain zero contaminants.\n\nSUGGESTED USE: As a dietary supplement, take 1 tablet 1 to 3 times daily as needed. Take between meals or at bedtime with a carbohydrate drink to facilitate absorption, or as directed by your healthcare professional.\n\n**This product is manufactured and packaged in a facility which may also process milk, soy, wheat, egg, peanuts, tree nuts, fish and crustacean shellfish.",
