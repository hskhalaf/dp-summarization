At 1st it's weird because it doesn't seem like it's sinking in when your dripping wet straight out the shower but when you dry off boy can you tell the difference. It's not oily or thick like most \"medical\" strenght lotion's it's feels like nothing is on your skin. It does what it says. I will definitely be buying more. If not get a life time supply.",

It's not usually that big of deal, but if you put too much on or if you didn't towel off enough it can be frustrating to not feel clean after a shower. HOWEVER, it doesn't have any overbearing scents like others and when you get the amount right it does a very nice job.",

I use fragrance free products and am not used to them having much smell. I believe that.this option is also free of added fragrance, but there is some ingredient with a strong scent.",

While traditional body lotions only hydrate the skin's surface, Cur\u00e9l Ultra Healing Lotion works within the skin to repair its moisture barrier. With Advanced Ceramide Complex, the lotion replenishes ceramides to help skin retain moisture and prevent dry, tight skin from returning. Cur\u00e9l Ultra Healing Lotion is clinically proven to relieve and repair extra-dry skin two times better than the leading intensive lotion. Dermatologist recommended, Cur\u00e9l Ultra Healing Lotion has no added fragrance and absorbs quickly, so it never feels greasy or heavy. Skin is left soft, supple and restored.\n\nHow to use Cur\u00e9l Ultra Healing Intensive Lotion for Extra-Dry, Tight Skin\n\nFor best results, apply daily to extra-dry, tight skin and reapply as necessary.\n\nCur\u00e9l Skincare Advanced Ceramide Complex\n\nCeramides, naturally present in healthy skin, are vital to maintaining the moisture barrier. When ceramides are lost, skin becomes dry and damaged. While traditional lotions only hydrate the skin\u2019s surface, Cur\u00e9l moisturizers work at the source of dryness to help replenish skin\u2019s ceramide levels. They don\u2019t just relieve symptoms, but actually, over time, prevent symptoms from recurring.",
