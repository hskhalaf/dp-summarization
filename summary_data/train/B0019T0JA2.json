UPDATE, TWO YEARS LATER: It's still one of the smartest things anybody ever invented, and one of the smartest purchases I've ever made. I'm still VERY satisfied with it. UPDATE, FOUR YEARS LATER: I'm still happy with this purchase. I would recommend this to ANYBODY trying to deal with a tangle of cables and power cords. It's sturdy and it handles abuse really well. It comes in several different colors, if black's not your thing.",

For me the biggest advantage is the ability to quickly add or delete things without hassle.",

They are used to hide the router, power strips and cabling for my counter top mounted POS cash register systems.
