DEFINITELY worth playing multiple times.",

At any rate it has a good story line, good characters and banter but it's all over the place, tons of decisions and different outcomes but none were thought through, too many cliff hangers and confusing. Restarted the game 5 times and still I am confused.",

If u got ATI GPU try it if not then its a gamble weather or not u can get past the main tutorial or even attempt anything decent in its multi player.",
