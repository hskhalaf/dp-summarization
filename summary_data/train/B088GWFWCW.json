I use 8 50lbs bags and it is filled to the brim... could definitely use less.. wood is soft so I worry about durability... also the bottom pieces fit together loosely so its not solid but with sand in it its not going anywhere... thought it was going to be bigger, two kids will definitely be tight..",

I couldn\u2019t find anywhere that says how much play sand so I wanted to let everyone know who is thinking about buying this. I bought 5- 50 lbs from Home Depot and 4 were plenty. So you will need 200 lbs of sand.",
