      "text": "The Mosin Nagant rifle is notorious for its heavy recoil, which isn't mitigated at all by the metal butt pad. The Limbsaver Airtech Small Slip-On fits perfectly on Mosin Nagant 91/30. The result is tremendous. Felt recoil becomes easily manageable. After installation I put over 100 rounds through the rifle without any shoulder pain, bruising, or soreness. It made the rifle an absolute pleasure to shoot. The only minor drawback is that it slips around a little, which can be corrected very quickly. For the Mosin Nagant, I highly recommend the small size with a 1\" LOP over the small/medium with the .5\" LOP.",

The Mossberg has a little more kick than the dickinson, but this pad makes shooting birdshot feel like nothing. Slugs and heavy buckshot get painful after a while. The Dickinson has a lot less recoil naturally by itself, and this pad makes it feel like nothing as well. I'm just using that gun for shooting clays, so I can't comment on how it feels with buck or slugs. Great value for the price, and I will definitely get more when I get any more shotguns.",

This recoil pad helped account for that light and narrow stock, and made it so she hardly noticed firing 3\" shells. I got her some 2 1/2 inch shells with #6 shot and she had no issue!

    "description": "Reducing felt recoil by up to 70 percent, the advanced LimbSaver AirTech Recoil Pad is available as a slip-on option for most rifles, shotguns and muzzleloaders. It features advanced atmospheric chambers that produce a substantial increase in performance through uniform energy dissipation, and it incorporates anti-muzzle jump technology for faster target re-acquisition. The recoil pad helps increase accuracy of follow-up shots and you'll enjoy increased control for maximum stability.\n\nDesigned to easily slip over existing firearm stocks without any modifications, the AirTech Recoil Pad will work best with removing the current factory recoil pad before installation. The AirTech Slip-On can be installed directly over the factory recoil pad to increase the length-of-pull by 1 inch (LOP), but to achieve optimum performance, LimbSaver recommends the removal of the existing factory recoil pad. It's made from LimbSaver's proprietary NAVCOM technology (Noise and Vibration Control Material), which effectively absorbs a wide range of frequencies to dissipate energy and vibration. This recoil pad also features a no-slip surface that stays in place even in the rain.\n\nIt comes in four sizes:\n\n * Small fits stocks measuring 4-1/2 x 1-1/2 inches to 4-13/16 x 1-5/8 inches\n * Small/Medium fits stocks measuring 4-5/8 x 1-9/16 inches to 5-1/8 x 1-3/4 inches\n * Medium fits stocks measuring 4-13/16 x 1-5/8 inches to 5-1/8\u2033 x 1-3/4 inches\n * Large fits stocks measuring 5-1/8 x 1-3/4 inches to 5-3/8 x 1-7/8 inches\n\nUsing state-of-the-art technologies, LimbSaver produces highly effective noise- and vibration-dampening products for archery and firearm products, including bow stabilizers, recoil pads, rifle slings, and more. Proudly engineered and hand-made in the USA, LimbSaver products are widely used by outdoor enthusiasts, military, law enforcement, and more.",
