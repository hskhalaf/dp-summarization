This was very disappointing considering what I paid and also considering that he said that out of all of the boots he owns (e.g., work, snow, casual), these were by far the most comfortable.",

They are a little warm for summer wear (>85 F) with the Gore Tex version. I'm going to purchase a pair without the Gore Tex liner for summer wear. Overall, a very sturdy built boot that is very comfortable and supportive.",

If I'm wearing thicker boot socks, then they are a bit tight on the toes. Otherwise, the fit is pretty good. However, I have already had a problem with these. The stitching on the inside of the right shoe has started to come apart near the big toe. I have super glued them, but am unfortunately in Kenya for two more months with boots that are falling apart.

After a 5 mile hike I was in misery. Also I experienced rubbing on the inside and outside just above the ankle so the zero break-in period went right out the window there. I haven't had the opportunity to hike in them without the inserts so I will reserve my final judgment until then. Very disappointed so far though.",
