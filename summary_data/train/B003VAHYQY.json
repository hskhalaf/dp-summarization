If you have Beach Buggy 2 from release 2019.20.4.2 in your Tesla with MCU 2, don't expect to be able to use the game controller with that game.

I dinged one star because it's not as comfortable as an Xbox or PS4 controller, but it's still a lot less expensive.",

You do have to treat it as a consumable in that it wears down over time and then it will just become a regular controller as the d pad will not go back to neutral as fast as it gets used more; but will still work perfectly fine for any other type of game where d-pad responsiveness does not have to be perfect. Also for under $25 or even less on sale, any complaints I would have regarding longevity are really moot as you can stock up on multiple of these for the price of 1 \"premium\" controller.",

      "text": "I bought a controller to use for my PC for some SNES emulators I got. They work relatively well but nothing to brag about. It sure does beat using the PC keyboard but it is in no way as smooth as some of the other controllers I have used. I still have trouble playing Super Street Fighter with the more fluid movements. It does, however, do great on more basic movement games such as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Turtles in Time. So I would recommend this controller only dependent on what games you intent on playing.",

I couldn't return the item because to get it open you have to cut through the frustrating packaging which destroys the ability to return the item.",

The deadzones didnt hurt on games like GTA, but FPS games like COD and Battlefield are horrible. The triggers, if you can even call them that, are the biggest issue on the controller.
