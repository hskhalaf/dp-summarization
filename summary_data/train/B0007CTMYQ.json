Moved a few hundred pounds of machinery down stairs without issue thanks to the stair climbers. Rolls well on grass and gravel. It's a little difficult to convert from the vertical to horizontal configuration, but pounding on it with your fists a few times should do the job. Only complaint is the smell. Had to let it air out in the garage for a week or two, but whatever.",

It feels just as rigid as my previous truck, which was very similar style to this one only made of steel tube. The only time i notice less strength is when going over uneven surfaces, there is a little more frame flex with the nylon. The real advantage for me is not worrying about it rusting like the steel truck.",

I found the conversion to four-wheel mode not too tricky, but I did have to tap out the spring pins with a hammer the first time. The shoe is 7 inches deep, which isn't too bad.
