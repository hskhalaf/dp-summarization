      "text": "Ms. Flamingo is now a member of our family. We just launched her this past weekend and had a blast. Because the beach is quite crowded in many areas of South Haven, Michigan, we inflated her with a gas generator by the beach area. Once inflated, 5 girls walked Ms. Flamingo above our heads through the beach crowds and landed her in the water. We floated her to a more remote area and floated all day! We were so proud of ourselves to be able to handle a bird this size! It was so much fun and will make great memories for years to come! We expect to see a flock of flamingos join us!",

Only other thing I would want to change are the cup holders and wished they were deeper to actually hold our cups. Other than that the flamingo was a hit and it was so majestic against the sandbar scenery and calm, crystal clear water. Loved this purchase!",
