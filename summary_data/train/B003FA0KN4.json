      "text": "I wish it came with more cones. Other than that, it was easily assembled and disassembled, and works like a dream, though there's a learning curve to making cotton candy stick to the cones right. Even heavily textured, the plastic cones provided were hard to coat. I recommend buying paper cones. Also, the area to roll up cotton candy is small, be careful to not hit the sugar hopper. It turns any hard candy or flavored sugar into cotton candy, though I highly recommend butterscotch candies for a most delicious twist. I'd give it a 5 if it had more cones and they worked better with the machine.",

All worked really well. No flying sugar, just a little buildup around the edge of the pink part of the bowl. We have used it 3 times and it is really fun to do. Some flavors seem to produce more than others like pineapple life savers make quite a bit but the cherry not as much. Werthers originals don't make a lot but it taste really good. Peppermint seemed to make a lot, and table sugar made it almost faster than we could collect it! Great for the money.",

      "text": "My 9 year old daughter bought this with her Christmas gift money. I am always leery about specialty food making machines because we have definitely been burned in the past. The kids loved this! We have only done it once, but found that floss sugar, Werther's originals, and starlight mints work great! Definitely read the instructions - important to let it warm up first because it forms the cotton candy much quicker. Also important to clean it well (not hard if done as soon as its cool). I do agree with other reviewers that it does take time, so small numbers works better. can't wait to try other flavor combos!",

First- we were never able to get the full cotton candy on the cone as it is displayed in the photo. It was not even a third of that. And second- I will repeat another review here in that it sprayed candy dust on the floor and counter tops surrounding it. I used the candy floss both times. It was relatively easy to clean and is small enough to store. But definitely not useful in party situations where kids are expecting a lot of cotton candy in a very short period of time.",

There is a little technique to get the perfect looking cotton candy stick, but follow the directions and after using it a couple of times, you will get the perfect looking cotton candy. Heat is the #1 key to achieving this, so give it plenty of preheat time, and have your candy ready to go. It makes a softball size ball with 2 pieces of hard candy. Hot water dissolves the candy, making cleanup very easy. I would recommend this.",

The process is simple and only one switch to operate. Clean-up is easy.

Overall though, it would be fun for a kid's party, but don't expect the type of cotton candy you might buy pre-made.",

My kids love it and it's easy to clean. We used it with some of the candies and like others it comes out in a rush at first for some of them. Overall I would recommend it. The star off is for the slow/low yield.",

Few things....the middle section where you pour the sugar in, we had a lot of problems cleaning out after we were done, the sugar was so hardened in there. Also, make sure to buy a pack of floss sugar if you want to make cotton candy right away, we didn't have hard candy on hand, so the sugar kit really was helpful especially since the kids wanted cotton candy right away! I think this is why I didn't have to wait as long for it to heat up. Overall, great product!",
