Also it didnt help dandruff or anything to i consider this as money went to the drain. I dont recommend it. But i still wonder how many people fall for all 5stars like i did.",

I have thick, frizzy Mediterranean hair, and making it straighter and silkier is a challenge. This product did not do as well compared to Beabody. With the Beabody, I don't even need conditioner sometimes. If you are researching product right now, I recommend Beabody over this brand for argan oil shampoo. Note: This review does NOT apply to Maple Holisitcs Silk 18 argan oil conditioner. I use that product and love it. So to summarize I use Beabody Morrovan argan oil shampoo (5 stars) in combination with Maple Holistics Silk 18 conditioner (5 stars).",

Moreover, I am sure it was diluted - is it was very runny and did not smell good at all.. I forced myself to use it for a month or so to see if there are any results, thinking that even diluted it might still work. but no.. my hair situation is worse now, trying something else.. Don't waste your money on this fake product..",

This has not made me more popular with the ladies, wittier or stronger. But, it feels good during application and makes my hair (wavy/curly; a little long) look good. I think. Not really an expert on good looking hair. Perhaps I'll ask my stylist during my next cut. Anyway, I don't really have any hair afflictions (falling out, greasy, dandruff, etc.) so I can't speak to that but I would recommend this to anyone looking to upgrade their mane treatment.",

A little goes a long way. - Natural. - Lathers well and does not wash out color that quickly. - Has a very light, pleasant smell. Other than that, I did not see much of a difference in my hair. My main concern for shifting to Natural shampoos was hair loss. Did not help in that.",
