      "text": "I've had an opportunity to use this Carrier at least 10x since purchase. For the money I don't think you can find a better deal on Amazon. The two primary concerns I read were on lack of instruction on how to put it together and the amount of balls it can hold. It took me roughly 15min to put it together; instructions could be better but very simple to figure out just looking at the box. Now the carrier claims it can hold 80 balls....it can if you hand place each one in the carrier; Real world application it holds around 65. Fits nice in the car, sturdy, lightweight and picks up balls with Ease. Great product.",

The not so good: The screws to assemble the Ballport are too short and started coming out within a week. I had to purchase 1 inch replacement screws and rubber washers to fix it. I still recommend this as a good buy.",

I don't know why I didn't try this earlier, but I'm glad i have now - so much sturdier - it takes a little longer to set the legs up and close as you have to pull them out and over a ridge, but this is worth it as it is precisely this that makes it more stable.

We were pretty bad, too, so we'd empty out our old duffel bag pretty quickly. This Ballport made picking up the balls so much easier and faster. Of course, as we played more we started to get better and we'd take longer to get through the balls but still, this Ballport is super useful and we bring it with us everytime we play.",

Only downside, is that is a little more difficult to pour balls from this hopper into a ball machine, but that is definitely not a deal breaker. highly recommend this to anyone. update, still works great 3 months later. easily, very easily, transitions from ball basket, to ball hopper.

However, the same as other reviewers have noted, the hopper does not hold 80 balls (I am not sure how many it does hold - maybe 70 max), which is fine; and plastic construction and the torque from use will result in the too-short screws coming loose constantly. I have lost nearly all them, but luckily had some longer screws (longer being like 4x as long) to replace them and these hold fine (I am still missing one screw on the top that does not really affect use).",

It took me about 20 mins to figure out how to put in together. I currently have about 20 balls in the ballport and plan to add more soon. It does appear to be able to hold about 80 as stated.

      "text": "Ballport works well. It is easier to pick up balls with than its metal relatives. Pros are its lighter,and the balls enter thru the bottom easier, easy access to the balls and easy closure. Cons are it tends to twist and I've had top bars come out and the legs are misaligning in both positions. Just started seeing the misalignment which is probably due to the more flexible construction materials. Not sure yet if this will worsen. Would be a 5 star if I wasn't concerned about long term durability.",
