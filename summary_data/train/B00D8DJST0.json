It isn't as wide as regular T.V. stands, but tall and holds the DVD player and Dish receiver on the bottom ( had to cut an extra hole for cords ). Other shelves hold DVD's, and misc. decor. Just the right size for a small space that holds a lot of things. Sturdy, easy to put together. Really happy with this purchase.",
