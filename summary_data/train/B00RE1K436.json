The assembly and fit of these stools was very high quality! All of the screws went in smoothly, and there were no missing parts! The stools are very comfortable to sit on, as they have nicely padded tops. I would have given them a \"10 star\" rating if it was available. Thanks for making a quality product.",

The foot steps fall off making the chair unstable. We use these stools daily but not for long periods of time. The base under the seat has completely broken in half making it unsuitable to sit in.
