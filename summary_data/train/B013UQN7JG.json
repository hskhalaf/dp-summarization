My husband is a picky man with serious quality concerns when it comes to anything related to the way he listens to music. I am not so picky and bought the first pair on clearance at a major retail chain known for low prices. He tried mine and decided right then and there to order his own here. Would absolutely buy again, comfort, price, sound quality, ease of use, long charge, easy sync for music and calls, perfect! We both also really love the white color with red, black and grey accents.",

They are light and comfortable and feel sturdy. Really, they are pretty amazing design-wise. The sound is excellent with good bass. It paired easily and very quickly with both my iphone and my pc. These are the white, gray and red Uproar, wireless ones. I'm pretty stoked.",

I can't wear them for very long periods without my ears starting to hurt a little bit, but that's after several hours. The plastic feels a little cheap, but after several months I haven't noticed any wear and tear. It remains to be seen how long they will last. Overall, for the price I'm pretty happy with these.",

I use them when traveling, lifting weights and running. When running they stay put as long as you don't quickly turn your head, no bouncing up and down like I would expect. Other than them not being loud enough for me and can't severely headbang (lol) and maybe a comment that they look cheap and for kids, they're good for the price!",

Great sound, easy connection, stay on the ear and the battery lasts a long time (still on the same charge over the last 2 months). Definitely worth the price!",
