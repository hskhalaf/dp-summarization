It came with the required barb fittings to connect it to my existing supply/return hoses. This unit will run the INTEX vacuum much better than the original pump, and the INTEX skimmer works great now. I did a little extra plumbing work installed a Tee and a valve so I can switch between the skimmer and side intakes without fooling around with all the hoses. I will post a picture soon.",

I was spending an hour each morning before work just getting the pool clean. I purchased this filter, and only have to maintain this filter once per week. I can go make more money, I just cant make more time, so this is a very smart investment if you want to get 5 hours of your life back per week.... Just push the button and buy it.",

When it arrived the box the pump was in was damaged but the Amazon shipping box was fine. After inspecting the pump everything look in good condition so we continued with installation. We have had this pump for a month and it hasn't worked. There is no pressure whatsoever. We haven't been able to use our pool for over a month because of all the problems this filter has caused.
