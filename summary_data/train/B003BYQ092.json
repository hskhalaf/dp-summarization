As soon as I put this bed in his cage, he jumped in and plopped down and looked as happy as ever! I could tell he was finally able to relax and sleep pain-free! I have noticed some flattening where he likes to lay down, but some occasional fluffing of the bed fixed that tiny issue. Very happy with this product.",

It doesn't provide the support that's needed (it basically just squishes down so the dog is laying on the floor). When the dog isn't laying it, it's 5 inches thick. But when the dog is one it, it compresses down to like 1 inch. I'm returning it. I need a solid memory foam dog bed. I also immediately noticed that the moisture barrier on the top of the fill case is very loud and crinkly.",
