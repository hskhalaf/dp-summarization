I contacted BenQ they determined it was under warranty they paid to have it shipped, repaired it, and returned to me. I am Still using the original bulb.. Recently I just bought an upgraded BenQ 4K projector to replace it with. Since it is still working well, I gave my son-in-law this projector",

Speaker is really loud but not much else so I recommend getting a speaker system.I'm using speaker on level one in a 13x16 room and it's plenty loud. I looked hard at the view sonic and the optoma but ultimately decided on the benq. Brightness is pretty good even when all lights are on as shown in my images. Best setup is in completely dark room. Overall pretty good value being able to get a 100\"-120\" HD screen for under $1000. Will see how long the lamp lasts since i hear they are pretty pricey to replace.",

BenQ customer service would not do anything to help, other than to suggest taking it to an electronic shop to clean out the broken glass and install a new lamp. Now, to get it back up and running, I will have to shell out 250$ for a new lamp and housing, and whatever additional cost to have the inside of the projector cleaned. So, for a little over a year of use, I am upwards of a 1000$ for this item. I am regretting moving from a wall mounted TV to a BenQ projector.",

We did a test in our living room as well, which has large windows, and you could still see the picture very clearly. For video games, it seems like there is no input lag whatsoever, even in faster paced games everything holds up nicely. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",

I had to buy a new mount to hang this out in the middle of the ceiling. Other than that, the picture is great. It is comparibale the the DLP tv I have upstairs. Very bright HD picture.

I will say that watching sports or anything that doesn't require black level performance is totally fine in eco mode during the day.

I have another 1080p projector, and this BenQ has blown it out of the park, as far as picture quality. The speaker that comes with it is ok, just not very loud, which I don't use anyways, I use the surround sound system that I already had. I also bought the shutter glasses SainSonic Rainbow Series Black 144hz 3D for 20 bucks...on amazon. Movie Nite out doors is awesome with family and friends.update... still using this projector, for gaming and movies still using the same bulb that cane with it. Still very satisfied!!!",

Full 1080P display, crystal clear and can be bright enough to see in a well lit room! Not much more you could ask for.",

I had done quite a lot of research, using many of the well known, online fora, as well as real product reviews and these led me to believe that this was the safest way to spend $700 on a projector. I see that the price for the replacement, the HT1085, has reduced somewhat, so that might make that a little more enticing, but if you still want to save over $100, then its hard not to recommend the W1070.",

      "text": "I have to say I was a little skeptical about this projector at first but it has turned out to be a great purchase. I am watching this on a 120\" SI black diamond screen and it looks fantastic. The picture is crisp and the colors look great. The fan is a little loud but once the surround sound kicks in, you cant notice a thing. Definitely glad I pulled the trigger and got this projector. Thanks",

Finding a ceiling mount with 70\" extension for my vaulted ceiling was a slight problem and no attic to route cables, so some sheet rock work and paint but worth every effort in the end.",

I definitely get better image quiality than with my previous two projectors (which were also DLP) and it throws less heat. It produces razor sharp images. My only complaint is that it is tricky to put on the lens cap without throwing the focus off for when you use it next.",
