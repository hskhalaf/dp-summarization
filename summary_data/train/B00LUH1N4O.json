      "text": "It works OK for the most part. I realize this is not the highest speed FM2 processor, but when playing videos, it could be interrupted by just about any kind of other activities that might use the GPU. Also, AMD calls this a quad core, but it's actually two physical cores with additional hardware to support dual threads on each core. So if you actually try to run 4 CPU-intensive processes, it won't be twice as fast as running 2 processes. The other reason I got this model was because of its low power rating. I needed a cool and quiet processor for a HTPC.",

One thing though make sure you get two sticks of RAM (fast ram, the clock speed matters), I couldn't believe the difference when I added in a second chip, the fps went up at least 50%. I used 4GB of 1866mhz RAM initially and then added a second one of the same kind.",

I jumped at the offer and the APU was with me in 10 days!! The delivery was flawless. I could track the package as it traveled through the world and when it reached India. I also got updates as it was processed by Customs in India. The processor has fulfilled all my expectations. I have built my HTPC and everything is working well. The speed is excellent and the box barely heats. I am very happy with this purchase.",
