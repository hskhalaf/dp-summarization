      "text": "This is good for extra stability and less need for post work (video software) stabilization. My to observations are: 1. The gimble shakes at the extreme angle of tilting back but for video usage this is fine because at this angle one would have the gimble handle in frame which would be useless to use. 2 The battery cap on bottom should have some type of ridge or leverage for loosening. I almost had to use vice grip pliers to get it off. Just avoid over tightening. The problem is that if you use en extension pole you don't want the bottom of the gimble (battey cap) loose. I would say that he above are not deal breaker complications.",

      "text": "Love this stabilizer gimbal! I already had the Feiyu G5, but this G6 I have to say is a bit nicer. Mainly because they reconfigured where they put the motor so it's not in the way. It's tilted now at an angle so you can view much better. It also has a spot on the side where you can attach a holder for your cell phone or microphone on the side. You can use your cell phone as a larger viewfinder. Well made and also come with a nice carrying case. Perfect for the Gopro!",

The smartphone clip that came with the product is of nice quality, but I had to replace it with a ulanzi clamp due to my case being a bit more bulky. This gimbal is great if you\u2019re trying to add more peripherals to your phone such as a mic. The tripod base is also a great plus! Make sure you get the right version that has the whole lot (Tripod, extension, and extra battery) As a whole I\u2019m excited about this product!",
