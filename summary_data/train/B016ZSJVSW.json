It's a little disappointing, the plastic is week and when you tighten them down it doesn't tighten all the way, and you still need to be careful that they don't come loose. Will need to add something to them so that they don't slip. Not sure if I feel comfortable putting good rods in them.",

I installed the screw side outside of my pontoon boat rail to keep from getting caught on the screw, but when I removed the holder the rubber bumper fell into the water. I emailed the seller for a replacement part but have not heard back.",
