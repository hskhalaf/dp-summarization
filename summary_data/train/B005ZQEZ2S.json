      "title": "Great for sensitive lips/skin!",
      "text": "Been using this for years on my kids\u2019 lips. Both get chapped easy even in summer. This is smooth, soothing, absorbs well and has no waxy residue like other \u201cChap\u201d-esque tubs and tubes. Both kiddos have sensitive skin/eczema and this isn\u2019t irritating. Takes very little-between twin 4 year olds, one tube lasts about two winter months. The flavor and smell are different-not fruity, not bad or chemical. Seems typical of colloidal oat and Shea ingredients. No leftover tingle either, as it contains no mints or menthol type oils. My kids abhor stuff that tingles (rolls eyes), while I love it. Anyhoo, worth the price imho.",

Also the stickers they put on the tube were nearly impossible to remove. I used GooGone and it was still sticky after I removed it. (Can you say waste of time?!) But mainly my lips don't seem much softer after using this so I just bought some Aquafor to see how it compares. I already like it better. The main thing I liked about this was the ingredients but it just hasnt measured up to what if hoped for.",

I have my lips really cracked and I was using other brand to fix it that didnt work so I want it something \"stronger\" . Since I read so many good reviews I decide it to give it a try. Best choice ever! I started using it on thursday and today (saturday) my lips are not craked . Magic! Since I have been trying to fix them like since 3 weeks ago and with the other product I was using I couldnt do it. I will definitely recommend this product",
