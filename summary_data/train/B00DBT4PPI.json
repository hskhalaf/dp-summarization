I borrowed my friend's machine which is why I bought this one and never had a problem. If they fix it and it goes away the review will increase to 5 stars. AMENDMENT: After only a few months after replacing the battery, the time on court is down to 45 minutes again. They advertise 2-4 hours. It's not that long. It's pretty frustrating at this point since after 45 minutes I'm just getting warmed up.",

      "text": "I've had my Elite Liberty for almost 3 years and have used it an average of once a week, sometimes twice. I didn't buy the remote and don't feel I need it. When turned on, the machine gives you 20 sec. to get to the other side before it starts firing balls -- plenty of time. I buy pressureless balls online from WalMart with in-store delivery. I've been very pleased with the machine's durability and reliability. Admittedly, $1,000 for a ball machine seems pricey to me, but all good ball machines are expensive. If you ever have a question about the machine, Losbster's customer hot line folks are very helpful. Most importantly, it's really improved my game.",

Customer service was excellent for two problems I had after purchasing it. The only design problem with the unit is the tall handle which makes it difficult to transport in a regular car trunk. On the other hand, it is relatively light, and the handle makes it very easy to move the machine around the court and on other paved surfaces. I use only pressureless balls as recommended by Lobster. It's a good machine for the money.",
