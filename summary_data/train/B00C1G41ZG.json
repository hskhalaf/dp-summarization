With much anticipation and excitement we began to install it Christmas morning. Unfortunately the fun came to a stop when it was missing parts, most notabley the LED lighted seat. After calling Amazon we had another sent but took 5 days to arrive. After 5 days of waiting for the Christmas gift to arrive we were again very excited to get this zip line up and in use. Shockingly this set again had missing parts, including the seat. This was so dissappointing and a huge let down!",

It can be tricky to set up, as you have to find the right location to get the \"rise over run\" calculations right. Our first couple locations were too steep and we had to adjust until we found just the right height and location on our property. Note: the lights are truly gimmicky and stopped working after about a month, but that's not why we bought this thing",

I give it only 4 stars because the small lights on the rope near the t-bar are a joke; cheaply made and attached with zip ties- they've all busted and fallen off. The lighted seat, however, is super cool. It's a little confusing because the only \"on-off\" switch for the LED lights on the seat is designated with a \"try me\" stamp, yet it's the only switch. I wish the lights had a timer, as my kids forget and leave it on for days. Even so, the battery life seems to hold up. I would recommend this zipline.",

We did add a \"private protector\" as we call it (aka noodle) around the rope part where they put their legs around. Slamming at the bottom isn't too comfortable. It's a great product for the price and I'd recommend it, they love it!",

I installed this alone (34 y/o male), but I think even if you had 3 strong people, you couldn't get the tension the line needs at the manufacturer recommended heights which is why I'm giving it 4 starts. I ended up buying a come along and hand it up inside an hour. And now I have a come along too! The lights push it over the top and kids love it.",
