Very sadly, it is much too large for the table size in the description \"Designed for 8 Foot Pool Table with Outside Measurement of 54.0\" x 98.5\"\" Doesn't even grab around the table, just hangs over the table. In essence the elastic corners are useless because it's much too large. But keeping it because it cheaper than a sheet and too much effort to return and begin looking again.",
