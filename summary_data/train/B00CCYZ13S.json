      "text": "I ordered this TV after reviewing the CNET reviews on the tv compared to the samsungs. I have a samsung LED Smart tv in our house and wanted to go larger for our living room but the standard price is around 1600 dollars, and after comparrison this tv was equal to if not better in many areas for half the price. Excellent 3D, however the only issue I run into once and awhile is the wifi doesn't connect and you have to be directly in front of the tv to use the remote (from the side doesn't work as great if your lucky to get it to work at all). Overall a great buy!",

When the screen is supposed to be totally black one can see some of the side lights lit stronger than others so it is really a mess. This is not too noticable during regular viewing. The picture looks too artificial--movies look like afternoon soaps. The 3D is good, however. A little grainey but that is to be expected. $700 would be an appropriate price. I paid too much.",

After 3 weeks -- and promises to fix the TV -- I have not received a phone call from VIZIO or the HD repair service that they use. I would think twice about buying a VIZIO TV. They are not in any hurry to offer support for defective products. I should have bought a TV from WalMart or Costco.",

Comes with a bunch of free 3d glasses, all the intuitive apps, wifi, etc. For $788 with free shipping a no tax proves that Amazon is simply the best.",

After replacing the old projection LED TV, it took us a while to get used to the very sharp HD picture, but I wouldn't have anything else now. And with the extra HDMI and USB slots on the back, I couldn't ask for more option. Originally it was on back order estimated at 3 months. But we had the TV in less than a month. And the price?! Can't beat it with a stick. Buy this TV, you won't regret it!",
