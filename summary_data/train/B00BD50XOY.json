      "text": "Got this one (7' medium) instead of getting another Berkley lightning rod. Has a slower action than my 6'6\" medium lightning rod, which in my opinion makes it better suited for a nice closed face reel. I put my abu pro max baitcaster on it and it cast about half as well compared to the lightning rod it was on. I have to put a ton of weight on it to get a decent cast. For the money it's definitely good. Give it a good bend test after delivery. Mine flexes just fine and will easily hold a fish. Don't wait to find out that it was damaged in shipment with a fish on it.",

I have owned two, and the only reason the first broke is because I REALLY tested it trying to pull my swimbait out of a massive kelp column, and broke the tip. I did this MANY times before it actually broke. With patience in a snag of kelp, this rod will last a long time. I love it for the price.",
