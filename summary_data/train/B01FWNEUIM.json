I'd blow it off from time to time but that never quite got everything clear and eventually I ended up with 3 or 4 big stubborn spots that wouldn't go away. I was a little hesitant after reading some warnings about cleaning your own sensor but was so frustrated with those spots I decided to give it a shot. I followed the YouTube directions exactly and ended up using all 6 swabs (3 cleanings). You really only need a misting on the wet swab and there were no streaks that i could see. My sensor is completely clean now so I'm happy.",

I had a spot on the last bunch of photoshoots which I had to edit out in software. Didn't want to send my pro camera out to get it cleaned so I took a chance to do it myself. Many people online said it was easy and it was. Took maybe 5 minutes even going slow and it was perfectly clean. Took some test shots to be sure, all good. That 5 minutes and reasonable cost will save me hours in editing those spots off my images. Thanks.",

Before throwing in the towel i decided to give this kit a try and i gotta say, best $20 I ever spent. Follow the directions, be super careful, and ensure you\u2019re in a very clean environment.

Only downside is coming with 6 sensor swabs. You could go through those quickly as you may need several for one cleaning (if your sensor was disgusting like mine).

I did not have any lense or sensor cleaning equipment so getting it all in one package was good. Small air blower to remove dust or debris from the lens. Very soft touch brushes are included too. One medium micro fiber cloth as well as one rather large one. Cleaning solution and specialized wipers for sensors, as well as lint free tissue paper. 11/10 would recommend to anyone with a camera.",

The cleaning kit provided a instructions as well as a YouTube channel that gave in depth instruction on how to use the product properly. Two swabs and my sensor was like new. Awesome product and Altura Photo has proven to be a quality company. Look forward to purchasing this product again when needed.",

I cleaned them both and am very happy now that I cannot see those spots any longer. The D300s was the worst and took two cleanings to get all of the dust/spots off. I have enough swabs for 3 more cleanings.",
