So at first I was a little concerned that he wouldn't be able to use this without another child around as my other children are school-aged but it turns out that there is a middle seat and he can rock himself in the middle seat like a rocking horse or in this case a rocking alligator. Also my other two children can sit on either end and all three of them can use it at the same time. The other really great feature is that it's open and hollow so it won't fill the inside with water if you leave it out!",

Perfect size; extremely lightweight so I can easily put it out of sight. The only downfall is that it\u2019s a little slippery, so they both slid right off a few times.",

It fits them well at 2 years old and I can see them being able to use it for maybe another year before it gets too small. We haven't tried putting a third kid on this but I think it would be a tight squeeze with everyone jostling for space to hold on and put their feet. One thing I don't like about this is that because its so light weight it slides across the carpet when one kid is using it. It works well as an indoor and outdoor toy.",

So far it doesn\u2019t seem to bother the kids but I may end up wrapping them in duck tape just to soften them a bit. Other than that it\u2019s a great toy and holds up to about 15-40 kids a week using it :)",

Our granddaughter is 3 and plays on it all the time. Easy to stand up in a corner of the closet when not needed, but this toy is always needed! Very good quality and I expect it to last through a few more grandchildren (someday).",

Handles have sharp edges which were filed smooth by dad. Toe well a little narrow, but boys figured out better foot placement. They use it as musical instrument, push toy, car track, etc as well as rocker. Also, parents grateful there is no incessant cloying song (like many toys have), wipes clean easily, and one or both kids can play at same time.",
