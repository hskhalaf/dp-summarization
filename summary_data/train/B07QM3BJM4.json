But happy we got it because he uses it all the time. There is a tiny little compartment in the seat you could put stuff in but its too hard for little fingers to open so its not really useful for the kids.",

It does tip over quite easily, though. If the back two wheel were just a little farther apart, it would increase stability. She is now nearly 14 months old and has improved her own balance and tips over much less frequently, so with practice, things get better. But I still think more stability would make this a better product.",

He is able to ride without issue; it just looks a little funny. I am not sure he will be able to use it up to his third birthday, simply because it's so small, but he will get plenty of use out of it.

I like the fact that it converts from three to two wheels as they grow and get more advanced. So far she's lovin it and that makes me happy. Haven't heard any complaints so I'm taking that to mean no problems at all. So for the little one on the go this seems to do the job.",

Although buying it for his birthday was a little soon, it was nice to have available for when he showed interest.",
