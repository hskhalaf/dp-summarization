The part that you hang from the door is a bit too small for the width of our average-sized door, and doesn\u2019t slide down all the way without damaging the wood and paint; it had to be jammed down and takes effort to pull back off again, and the door definitely cannot shut with this on. Otherwise, it hangs things nicely on our now always-open bedroom door. Does not require any assembly.",

Now the top of the brackets lay flat over the top of the door and no problem. Simple design and it looks okay, though I didn't buy it for its looks. Sturdy enough for normal use. Just use common sense and it should last quite a while. No fitting instructions or tips like I just gave you so I'm dinging it one star.",

      "title": "Good for hanging shirts",
      "text": "I'm using this to hang up some of my shirts, and for that purpose it works really well. Since I use coat hangers, all of the hooks on the rack are usable/accessible. However, for other uses like towels or hats they are likely too close together to use all of them so it is more like a 6 hook rack (which still isn't bad). My door is 1 1/2\" and the rack fits it nicely even though it has room to accommodate a bigger door. It makes my door slightly harder to close but its barely noticeable. The chrome finish looks good. Overall happy with the purchase.",

I'm impressed by how much weight it can hold - I'll hang my purse and a full tote bag on it every night and it's never bent or fallen. It's also ideal for knit scarves. I've had other scarf racks, but they always catch the yarn and pull the weave apart. With this organizer, there are no rough bits to catch on and the hooks are large enough that they don't poke through the weave. Definitely a useful purchase!",

But they're still high enough up to reach to clear the refrigerator that my door opens up against.
