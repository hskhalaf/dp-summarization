Also the way the magnets are positioned with one directly in the center makes it kind of hard to use if your trying to use it on the end of a pipe . Because you can't center it the magnet being centered pulls it to the side .",

This level is a lot heavier than Klien or Milwaukee. The bubble is about 1/4 of an inch within the lines. The magnets are STRONG; the level will stay put on the edge of a 1/2 of an inch Ridgid pipe while jostling a pipe around on a bender. The best part is the level has a beautiful silver finish and blue spirit (Liquid) that makes this tool absolutely unique!!!",
