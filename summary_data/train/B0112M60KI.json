However, I took 2 pills the recommend dosage right away and I got a major headache and this kept happening, so I decreased the dosage to 1 pill a day is all my body can handle. Also, this stuff really regulates the body, if you know what i mean. When that happens,you can loose weight, i did. I will purchase more.",
