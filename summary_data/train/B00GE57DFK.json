Second the keys were locked inside it so I had to have a locksmith open it for me which cost $50. Third after seeing it open and filthy inside as well, the locking mechanism just clasps into the plastic button/handle that opens the safe providing absolutely zero security. The plastic piece can more than easily be busted opened with a variety of tools or bashing objects. This thing is complete trash and a total waste of money. I'm afraid to see how fireproof and waterproof it actually is.",

For a few more dollars these components could be upgraded. Otherwise, the unit is pretty solid and has plenty of room for [my] documents.
