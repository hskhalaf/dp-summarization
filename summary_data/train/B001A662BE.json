I was looking for the perfect curtains for my kids room to block out the daylight when bedtime comes. 8:00pm can look like 4:00pm which is hard for kids to understand and settle down. These have worked great! We purchased a curtain rod that wraps around to the wall so there wasn't a space between the wall and curtain where it hung. These really blackout the room and have worked great! I was hesitant since they are not lined, but no worries here. Great length and beautiful dark rich navy color.",

I have grey curtains on a different window and they let no light through. The material itself isn't the most attractive. It looks like semi-gloss polyester. I have a double curtain rod, so I'll probably put these closest to the window for some light blocking, and some more attractive curtains on the other rod to hide these. Too bad that's 2x the money.",

I'm not sure if it blocks 80% of the light but I took a chance and it still let's in too much light for my liking or, in my opinion, to be accurately labeled as blackout. This curtain is solid so it's fine for privacy like a regular non-sheer curtain, and an extra star was added for the description explaining that there might be a discrepancy. Unfortunately, it still let in too much light for me. I will probably return as soon as I find a proper replacement. Does anyone know if the gray ones block light more similar to the black/navy ones or if they block less light like beige/light blue ones?",

I needed them to be a bit longer, so I didn't use the pocket, but attached rings with hooks and put the rod through the rings to provide a couple inches of length. The fabric is soft and smooth with a very, very slight sheen. They provide excellent privacy and room darkening. For the money and good functionality, a great purchase.",

When the sun is shining, you can see thousands of pinpricks of light on the curtains, and that's with a sheer undercurtain in place. They are made from a fabric which feels great, looks ok, but there is no backing of any kind that would make them any more thermal than hanging a medium weight twill fabric at the window. While they are good to block the light from passing cars or the streetlight at night, as soon as the sun comes up they fill the room with a bright, warm, golden glow. Nice, but NOT blackout by any means.",

Especially when paired with special room-darkening rods that allow the curtains to wrap around the sides and cut off sun there, as well as installed a bit higher above the top of the window, to cut down on sunlight from there as well. As others have mentioned, the \"navy\" is very, very dark. Almost a black at first glance. So be prepared for that. But if you want real blackout, the darker color curtains definitely are more effective!",

They are better than expected! They also keep out the heat of the day and living in Southern California that can be all year round. They look like regular designer curtains but keep the light out fantastically. I loved them so much I bought another set for our bedroom. Now I too can nap in darkness while she is napping. They are great! I will buy another set when we have our next child for sure!",

The windows at the front and back of my house face east and west, so there is a lot of light coming in in the mornings and evenings, making it hard to watch TV due to the glare. These curtains look great, and best of all they block the light completely.",
