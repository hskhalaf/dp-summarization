      "verdict": "The Hoka One One Rincon is a running shoe geared toward neutral runners, but it has just a hint of firmness and energy return that allows it to be versatile for a wide range of workouts.\u00a0 It will appeal to runners who prefer a light, breezy feeling under their feet, no matter how fast or slow they prefer to run in it. Despite some durability issues, the Hoka One One Rincon is still appreciated for having the right amount of cushioning for recovery efforts. It is also lightweight enough for fast race days, making this Hoka shoe a versatile addition to any athlete's running shoe arsenal.",

They lasted me a week before the entire show was broken down and my knees were aching. I was able to return them and now my search begins anew for a good shoe for flat feet.",

From my point of view there's something severely wrong with the design of this shoe.",

I just purchased a second pair from the Running Warehouse for $91.00 with free shipping. ALSO, the runrepeat website is a great source for running shoe reviews and automatic price comparisons. Stay healthy and enjoy the run :)",
