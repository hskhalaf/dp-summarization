I do believe that this was time well-invested, as the sharp edges could possibly damage the shoe leather. Also, one of the supports in the heel portion of the shoe tree was cracked. I repaired that with epoxy, but believe that this defective tree should have been caught by quality control.",

I work as a DJ and spent almost $300 on my shoes so of course I want to keep them going for as long as possible and am confident that these shoe trees will do their part in making that happen. I will buy these again if I ever need to replace these for some reason or add another pair of fancy shoes to my work or play collection. Don't hesitate to buy!",

If you've never used them before, my only tips are to make sure and use the right one for the right show...they are generally created to fit either the left or right. If you don't, you run the risk of changing the shoe profile...not a good thing. Also, if you wear leather-soled shoes, I highly recommend putting the trees in at all times, especially when the soles get wet. That helps keep the shoes from curling.",

The mechanism inside is cool; pushing up on the connecting rod spreads the toes apart with a spring so it applies a decent force expanding the toe, while not forcing it to a certain shape. This combined with regular conditioning will minimize most creases in good leather.",
