I still get pimples, but when I put the mask on and take it off the pimples are already healing. It really sucks the oil out of your skin, which makes my skin normal, but someone with dry skin might need to moisturize or use sparingly. Also, it waxes most of my face! It hurts a little to take it off because it is gripping the skin so close, but it really works.",

This mask oozes out in a thin consistency, a tad bit thinner than toothpaste. To cover my face adequately I used about a quarter of the bottle. After letting the mask set for 25 minutes, I was left with a mask similar to elmer's glue that I peeled off in an upward motion. The charcoal removed surface dirt and brought other impurities to the top layer's of my skin. My face didn't feel dried out after using the black mask, but I rubbed in moisturizer as per my usual skin-care regime.",

I would recommend leaving it on for 30-40 minutes as opposed to 20-30 as indicated on the instructions to make sure it is nice and dry for an easier peeling process. I want to try this when I multimask for super targeted skincare next time:) Highly recommended and gets the job done:) Five stars!!!",

Papain helps remove dullness, discoloration and dead cells to leave skin flawless and supple.\n\nTea Tree Extract\nThe extract can balance oil levels, regulate skin pH, refine pores and activate skin cells\u2019 regenerating ability. \n\nSodium Hyaluronate\nThe ingredient highly increases the moisturizing effect of this kind of peel-off mask. \n\nBarbados Aloe Juice\nIt is highly efficient at hydrating skin, which can also help with dark spots removing and wound healing. \n\nBamboo Charcoal\nCreated from bamboo ash and valued for its excellent absorption abilities, it acts like a magnet to draw out dirt, debris and impurities.\n\nChamomile Extract\nThe plant's many benefits come from its daisy-like flowers, which contain azulene and bisabolol oils. These ingredients contribute to the extract\u2019s ability to soothe and calm ailments such as upset stomachs, unsettled nerves and fragile skin. \n\nDirections\n1. Wash your face with warm water and put a hot towel on your face for a few minutes to open pores. \n2. Apply a thick, even layer on oily parts of your face such as the nose, forehead, chin, and cheeks. Avoid the eye area, eyebrows, hairline and lips. \n3. Leave on for 20-30 minutes until completely dry. Gently peel off the mask from down to top. \n4. Rinse off any residue with cold water. Afterward, use a toner or other pore-shrinking products. Use once or twice a week. \n\nCautions\nAvoid areas of eyes, eyebrows and lips when you are using the mask. This kind of black mask is not suitable for sensitive skin and it is recommended that customers use the item on hands before using on the face. Not recommend for people who have skin redness, eczema, acne inflammation, sores or suffer from skin allergies. If there is any discomfort, stop using immediately.",
