I have a deer feeder set up on a timer and I just sit and watch all the critters while dinking my evening coffee. Long story short, these work. Not top notch, not even close but they do the job I need them to do. If you are any type of serious hunter, bird watcher or anything watcher I'd look elsewhere.",

We are not sure that they qualify as compact compared to other models, but their larger size makes them easier to hold steady when using maximum magnification on a distant object. For anyone looking for a really good pair of full-size binoculars at an amazing price, we recommend that you try these.",
