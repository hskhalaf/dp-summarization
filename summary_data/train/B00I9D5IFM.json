So far, the accuracy matches that of the local post office scales, and that bolsters my confidence in buying postage for shipping. It weighs up to 110# (haven't tested that yet) and as little as 0.1 oz. This is a good buy.",

By the time I finish packing up my package, it will have turned off and I have to wait about 10-15 seconds for it to turn back on. Not a big deal. I would purchase it again if it broke.",
