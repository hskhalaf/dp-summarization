Like many I tend to MF with AF macro lenses close-up but with this 105mm I can now routinely use AF even in low light (where the VR also helps) and results are fantastic. Not having to pay so much attention to technique allows me to give more to composition. Agree it's 5* My most treasured purchase of 2018.",

AF is a bit clunky but it gets the job done. The shots are incredible and I can\u2019t wait to try out some more!!",

Some of the macro shots I have taken have absolutely astounded me and have received great comments on twitter. It is a great all round lens taking exceptional portrait shots and acts as a wonderful prime lens. The only negative is that it hunts abit when focusing in low light, but that is soon cured by switching to manual mode, which I usually use. Just buy it, you wont regret it!!",

The main benefits are that you don't need to get so close to the subject (so you don't scare creatures or cast your own shadow onto them) and that the 105mm lens has Vibration Reduction. The latter only works with more distant subjects but it makes it excellent for portraits, producing super-sharp subjects with creamy smooth out-of-focus backgrounds.

The VR function is great if you want to keep your ISO low and shoot at low speeds. I shot at 1/5 s and got a nicely sharp image - I am a steady shot mind you, so combine that with VR it's a winner for low light alongside a D700, D800, D3, D4 etc!!

Of course, we get it because we plan to shoot handheld. Otherwise, a non-VR lens would do. This one requires a monopod if you're shooting for a long time. BTW, it's also great with the Nikon 1 system, and you get a really nice 540mm reach.",

    "description": "Size Name:70-200 mm f/4GOne stop further: The next-generation Vibration Reduction system incorporated in this lens allows for up to 5-stop compensation, enabling photographers to shoot at shutter speeds five stops slower than would otherwise be possible. A significant upgrade, the increased stability greatly minimises the effects of camera shake and extends opportunities for low-light shooting.\n\nSuperb resolution and image quality: Despite its lightweight build, this lens doesn't cut any corners when it comes to performance. Crafted to deliver outstanding resolution and contrast in diverse conditions, the optical construction boasts 20 elements in 14 groups, and Nikon's Nano Crystal Coat is employed to combat flare and ghosting.\n\nHighly Versatile: Well-balanced in terms of size, weight, price and image quality, this lens also has a dedicated tripod collar ring, the RT-1. This optional accessory helps to improve tripod balance and allows quick, smooth transition between vertical and horizontal orientation when shooting in either portrait or landscape format.\n\nHiro Sebata, Product Manager for professional products at Nikon UK says: \"This new NIKKOR f/4 lens offers high quality performance and flexibility, ideal for enthusiast and professional photographers looking for a versatile, portable tele-photo lens, with the added benefit of the enhanced Vibration Reduction system.\"\n\nBOX CONTAINS\nAF-S NIKKOR 70-200mm f/4G ED VR Lens\nLens Hood\nLens Pouch",
