This puts the joystick on the left with the fire buttons on the right which I had to learn. It's similar to the arcade units. I forgot how ugly the games looked back then but they were and still are very playable.",

The app pops up as soon as you plug in the iPad. And there are numerous game options. The only reason I didn't give this product 5 stars is because of the extra charge you have to pay for some games. Maybe this doesn't bother some people. Overall, great product.",
