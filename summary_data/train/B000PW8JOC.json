Only problem I have with it is the plastic ribbed part of the call can slip off fairly easily and I have had it come off in my pack while taking it out once up in the stand. If it wasn't for that 5/5. It is an easy fix for me though I just added a single drop of super glue to it and it hasn't moved since but I still could take it off if I had to which is nice.",
