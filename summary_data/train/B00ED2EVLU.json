I ordered them in the evening on Tuesday and they arrived on Friday. They are as advertised, feel sturdy and seem like quality knobs. The screws that came with the knobs didn't quite fit our existing holes/depth, but we used a drill and got all of them replaced within 10 minutes. If this design is your style, then get these! I have more knobs to replace and will probably order from this vendor again once I can decide which style to get...",

If anything, I just wish that we were able to purchase some individually as they come in packs of 5 and now I have some extra knobs leftover.",

The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I had to send 1 package back, because it wasn't the knobs I ordered. But amazon took care of that really fast for me and I just reordered another package and received the right ones. I have gotten several compliments on our cabinet hardware. These are really worth the price!",
