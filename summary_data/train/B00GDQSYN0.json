The MAJOR downside to it is that despite the company giving carry on dimensions, it does not easily fit in the overhead bin if you pack it to capacity. I had to pack it well for a trip to Haiti for the first use, and it definitely drew the attention of the airline staff. I realized today I missed the return window. I guess I'll have to gift it to someone or pack less.",

The wheel is the one thing you do NOT want to break on a rolling bag, but based on the poor tolerances, it would likely be the first thing to go. I shipped it back for a replacement, but the second one had the same issue, so I'm concluding the wheels are just normally of poor quality. Returned the second one for a refund.",

I actually love the bag; it's sturdy, the zippers are strong, and I love the option to split the bag into 2 sections or have it as 1 large compartment. And, the wheels are very study. The only complaint is what I mentioned earlier. I don't know how the company can fix this and still leave the design of the bag as is.",
