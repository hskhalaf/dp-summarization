I wish I had this item three years ago. It is not light weight, but I wouldn't want it to be. The weight helps move the dirt with an ease, I didn't imagine possible. I was able to dig up a pesky elm tree! (of which, I have MANY) It is, without doubt, my favorite purchase of the year! My only want for alteration, would, perhaps be, a longer handle.",

The add should have included a closeup view of a denoted measurement next to the blade so I would know to not buy this. Now I see why the seller didnt include such exhibit in the ad. The weight is the positive, because 5 Lb head is what ya need. I had bought a 2.5 Lb different brand with a normal wider head blade but 2.5 Lb felt too light to break through anything hard in the ground/soil.",

And the best part, the polymer handle is such that it dampens the impacts so they are not all transmitted to your arms and shoulders.

I also like the weight, neither too heavy or light. It sits right on the edge with good balance and heft. It is also holding up well, including busting up some cement. It's great!",
