Not to mention when not clicked into place properly there are balancing issues for them. We just leave it open all the time now.",

The reason I gave it 4 stars was it could use a mechanism to lock it into place, and also put traction material on the step to help getting an elderly person up and into a Jeep especially in the wet weather. For average use it ok as is.This stool is light, easy to set up, and stores well in the house or auto.",

It folds fairly easily after you get the hang of it in a small space of the front seat. In the kitchen, I use it for my grandchildren to reach the sink. The only downside is that I wish it had a cord attached to the upper parts (or at least a hole drilled on each side to attach a cord) so that we could pull it into the car instead of reaching head down to pick it up.",
