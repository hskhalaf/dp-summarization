Instead of having a plastic tab on the back of the mirror that is easily removable, one has to use your finger to push against a small piece of hard plastic (that is holding the mirror in place) to create enough gap to pry out the mirror in order to access the battery compartment. I wish this mirror was designed better so that the battery can be replaced with ease.",
