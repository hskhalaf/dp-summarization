I replaced it with a neato battery (priced much higher than \"compatibles\".) Within 2 months of new battery it stopped working again. Needed new motor. Customer service was no help at this point. I know when to cut my losses. I would not recommend this product or company.",

It took a few times around for her to stop getting stuck on things, but now she does great! The bin is small, but I empty it everyday as soon as I get home from work, a small sacrifice to make when she does such a fabulous job keeping the house clean for me!
