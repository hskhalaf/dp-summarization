Milk steamer is easy to use and easy to clean. Just be sure to read the instructions when switching from steamer to espresso mode--you have to allow for the machine to cool down or restart the machine to go back to espresso mode. Very happy with the performance, especially at this price.",

Once I programmed the quantity of coffee to pour it was all good. Oh and if your machine is leaking coffee from the top, your packing in too much damn coffee. I learned the hard way. Don\u2019t pay too much attention to the negative comments. Read the damn instructions when you get it, play with some of the settings and it\u2019ll make awesome espresso for you.",

The coffee maker needs to be descaled fairly often, so you will be a slave to its products. Coffee is delicious though.",

Also with it being light weight and tall when you put in the filter holder the machine would tip , move and you had to hold it down forcefully. I really had hoped this machine was it.

As I was new to espresso, I didn't know these things before I purchased. If you set it on Max temperature, pull 3 blank shots, and then pull again, the temp maxes at 84c, 13c less than minium for an espresso shot.
