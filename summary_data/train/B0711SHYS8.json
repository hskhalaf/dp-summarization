      "text": "Bought for Christmas present for my partner, she is really happy with it, she moved from an Samsung S3, which was no longer getting updates so apps stopped being supported, such a shame as that phone was ace. But the Moto is good, she's getting used to the different interface which is more sock google like (a little different from the Samsung). Love that it still have a removable battery, a micro SD slot AND a headphone jack, high end phones have removed these, for under \u00a3100, its a steal, fantastic phone, quick, responsive and seems powerful enough for her. So far so good.",

I think the best feature is the amazing battery on the device. Which goes forever. At this price range i dont think you can get a better device. Can get the Moto g5 which has slightly better performance but the battery is shocking. Best all rounder for the price.",

There are phones like OnePlus 5t for \u00a3350 or Huawei p20 lite (64gb) for \u00a3250 or S7+ they are a better choice than this. Better value for the money.",

I will keep it because I wanted a phone that I did not constantly have to charge. Apart from the camera, it is ideal for me. (I have tried 6 different camera apps with no improvement )",

And the most annoying thing is the poor signal quality, my previous phone (Motorola 3rd gen) using the same SIM got 100% reception in the same address - this phone sometimes has no reception and can rarely connect to internet. It's ability to detect WiFi signal is also poor meaning anything online is either not possible or very slow. Again this also seems to be a common issue - I should have done more research before buying!!",
