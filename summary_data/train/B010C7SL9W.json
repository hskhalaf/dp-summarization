As I like Levi's men jeans I thought their women's jeans would be the same; unfortunately, Levi's women's jeans follows the trend of many other brands of women's jeans. The material is soft (wears through very quickly) and the pockets are basically for pocket change--you'll not fit your wallet, your cell phone, or your sunglasses case in these. That said, still comfortable, and the flexible material means I can fit a 30 waist when normally I'm at a 32 or 34 in men's jeans. So if you don't care about big pockets or durable material, these will service just fine.",

      "text": "Because I already knew these run large now, I ordered a smaller size and it fits as expected. As I found in some of their other jeans, Levis has gone to vanity sizing. Just order a size smaller than you normally wear. This color (Legacy) is soft and has a lot of stretch without becoming baggy at the end of the day. These are 68% cotton, 23% polyester, 8% viscose and 1% elastane. Feels less like denim than the old jeans but much more comfortable to sit in all day. I would buy these again.",

And the legs are baggier than I would expect from a straight leg style.",

I just wish they would make real normal jeans with a waist that's not the same size as the hips and the pockets are normal. The pockets on these are better than some jeans that are out now.
