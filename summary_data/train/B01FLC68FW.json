It provides a lot of energy whether you are using it before the gym or just throughout your day. The herbal blend and caffeine content really work for me. Additionally, this is a very good appetite suppressant. I'm hardly hungry when I take this stuff for a good couple of hours. Even with all these positive effects I never felt jittery or unease. Overall great supplement! I highly recommend if you are looking for something to help shed a couple of extra pounds!",

I've tried many different stimulant fat burners and an array of the Hydroxycut line and all of the products are very good!. This one I think is one of the stronger ones and one that will let you know that it's working, in a good way! The Hydroxycut Black is good for beginners in the fat burner are where this is for the more advanced or have a higher caffeine tolerance. I loved the effects of this, the energy, and the focus I got throughout the day!",
