First the feeder has over filled multiple times causing the whole bottom of the pit to fill with pellets and catch on fire. The thing had literally exploded on several occasions. First time I had problems I thought maybe I am not cleaning well enough. So I has started cleaning it completely from top to bottom before starting a cook. Does not help. Have since looked in to and have seen multiple reviews with similar issues. Buyer beware",
