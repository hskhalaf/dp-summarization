It feels sturdy and well made. The toggle on/off switch give a nice \"clicking\" sound, and there are settings to vary the degree of light. It's definitely bright to turn on and read in a completely darkened room. One cool thing about it is that the power comes from a USB cord, so you can plug it into an A/C outlet, and computer or even a portable charger. This gives the lamp a ton of versatility. I'd recommend it to buy.",

Very strong clip. Overall am pleased with this purchase and would definitely recommend it.",

Gravity certainly has an effect on the neck, and although I've managed to position the lamp somewhere to support the neck, it was not my original intention for this to happen. The clip seems sturdy, the lighting is adequate. Brightness is \"somewhat\" adjustable, there are three settings for bright white light, yellow light, then a combination of the two. A bit minimalistic, that's okay. I just need to read books. Overall a bit disappointed about the neck stability, but whatever.",
