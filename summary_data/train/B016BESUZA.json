      "text": "Pros: The unit is compact, quiet (when it works well), and humidifies well in a normal size bedroom. Cons: Difficult to reach all parts inside tank when cleaning. After one season of use, the fan needs to run a while before it is quiet. On a cold start, the fan whines annoyingly until its motor heats up. (This was also a problem in early SPT humidifiers, but isn't a problem in the SPT we use currently in our living room.)",

They sent me a new humidifier right away, and it works perfectly. We've used it every night for almost a week straight now with no problems. This is a great little unit for a bedroom.
