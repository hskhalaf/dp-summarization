I only found out after gaining more info on basses that this is a replica of a fender precision bass. The pickups are ok The guitar strap broke within a couple minutes of use so definitely get a better strap The strings are ok. I replaced the pickups with better ones and will eventually replace the strings with better ones. Once that's done I'll have a pretty nice bass setup. I think this is a perfect first bass. Once you get an appetite for the bass you can always get something better.",

Truss bar needed to be adjusted, saddles needed adjusting, strings are good quality (though he did snap one while tuning it LOL). He took it to a local guitar store and they adjusted everything for him, and it plays nicely with no more buzzing. I expected a lesser quality for the price, but didn't want to purchase a more expensive one for him to learn on. The product greatly exceeds our expectations.",

As other have mentioned there was bad fret buzz but an adjustment of the truss rod cleared that up no problem. The wrench to make the adjustment is even included. Rocksmith picks it up just fine. No issues there. The only complaint I'd have is the pickups are held in by screws which gets in the way of where I like to rest my thumb while playing. But for the price, you can't go wrong with this bass.",

The base sounds good when it is plugged up to my amp. There is no static. Is also feels like a solid instrument. It does not feel cheaply made by any means. The strings stay in tune. All screws are tight and nothing is loose. I am a smaller person and I find that my hands reach to all of the frets. All and all I think this is a very good instrument. Especially for the price.",

I found this one and took a risk, because most of the reviews proved that the bass was worthy of my time and money. This bass has proved to be extremely worth $70. It sounds better than many high end basses I've recently played. Other than the minimal packaging, and the useless/nonfunctional strap they provide you, this bass is well worth $70. With a little bit of tuning, this bass is extraordinary. I would recommend this bass to anyone who is on a budget and ready to jam.",

Luckily I bought a electric guitar recently that came with a extra strap, a amp, and a chord. Very disappointed in the order and can not recommend to anyone, try your local pawn shops and see if there is one in there because most likely it's better.",

I bought it to learn to play along with Rocksmith, the first time tuning the bass, 1 of the top and lower tuning keys's wheal teeth broke. They look like metal, but they aren't.

The low price point means I'm not investing too much into something I might decide I don't want to continue playing, but the quality is still surprisingly good. Intonation was good, as was the action. It's a little unbalanced and kind of wants to neck dive, but that's not a huge issue for me. Strap was pretty flimsy, but for the price of the whole bundle, I'm not really surprised. If you're looking for a cheap starter bass, I'd say this is easily your best bet.",
