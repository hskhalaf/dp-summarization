The toasting is inconsistent, not only from slot to slot, but from used to use on the same settings, and surprisingly from top to bottom of the piece of bread or bagel in a single slot. I will probably replace this with a cheap, no name toaster because at the end of the day, It does not matter how pretty the toaster looks on your counter if it can\u2019t do basic toasting. If you buy this, prepare yourself for bread and bagels that are half burned and half untoasted. And also, the thing is unnecessarily large.",

I love the buzzer when the toast is ready, as I\u2019m prone to pop some bread down then get sidetracked and forget about it. The slots are nice and wide, so bagels and buns fit with no problem. I\u2019ve only had the toaster for about a month, so I don\u2019t know how long it will last, but it seems well made and durable. I highly recommend this toaster.",

It's seems like the legal dept got involved and warned that if the bread got too hot people would burn themselves and sue. What I finally had to do was use a lower setting (#3) and lower the bread TWICE. You might think that twice on #3 would equal once on #6 but you would be wrong. I tried it several times.",

You then have to toast again, but now turn the dial to \"light\" otherwise your toast will burn. This toaster gets an D-. I do like the appearance, but functionality sucks.",
