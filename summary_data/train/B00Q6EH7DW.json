I would suggest a clear plexiglass see-through so one can actually see how it is lining up. This is so much easier to use than the twine trimmer. I would recommend it.",

I don't keep my grass high, I mow on the highest level in the summer when you are supposed to. I'm going to probably take a hacksaw to try and cut off that part as a suggestion from my neighbor because he thought the same thing. Other wise I really cannot use it.",

Worked fine for about 8 minutes and then the bolt that secures the edger guard snapped which must of destroyed something else because the item refused to edge after that.

It either needs a sharper edge or it needs to be sharpened on a different angle. It tends to tear the grass blades instead of cutting them clean across and the blade seems a bit thick to begin with.",

What irritates me is that there are no more blades available. Worx says they are out, and you can sign up to get an email when they have replacement blades, which I did. Months ago. The fact that I haven't heard from Worx indicates that there are many, many people in the same boat.",
