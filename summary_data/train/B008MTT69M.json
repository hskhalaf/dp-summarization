      "text": "This is a great travel bed. My greyhound is a service dog. She often goes to offices with me for appointments. She needs good padding on the hard floors. Her blanket did not satisfy. I saw this and thought it might work. It self-inflates (you can add air). The inflation holds amazingly well. I left hers unfolded and the air has stayed the same for over a month now with no indication of going down. She often elects to use it at home which is the best indicator of how she likes it. The bed part vacuums off easily. It folds up something like a yoga mat. We love it!",

Good for outdoor use as long as you don't have a lot of debris to get stuck in the top surface fabric. One we used in our barn got bits of hay stuck in it, which was hard to clean off. But in other applications, they are great! Like a \"Thermarest\" pad for dogs :)",

I decided to buy another one for him to lounge on outside of his crate and I'm looking for the perfect spot to put it. I highly recommend this nice cushy bed.
