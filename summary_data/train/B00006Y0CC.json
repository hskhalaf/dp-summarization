      "text": "We needed to replace a similar laser printer we've had for years that finally quit working correctly. We decided to get the exact same model (no longer being manufactured) because our Unix server and software is configured for it already. This printer looks like new, even though it was refurbished! Arrived very clean, although they could have used something less messy to pack it in. It was well-packed, but they used lots of Styrofoam popcorn to fill the box. That caused a huge mess trying to unpack the printer. Other than that, everything is working fine and I'm happy I bought this printer from this particular seller. No problems!",

So I took a chance and bought this (approximately)10 year old refurbished heavy-duty printer. I had to buy a $35.00 printer/computer cable from radio shack to make it go. But the set-up is just a 'plug and use' and it is wonderful... The 'foot-print' is large, but I just have sitting under the folding table I use as my desk next to my computer. I highly recommend.",

No lines or excess toner on the paper. The only complaint deals with programming. Without a booklet or knowledge of the machine, programming can be a little time consuming. We would recommend purchasing this printer as it has been reliable and no problems. Original machine lasted a little over seven years.",
