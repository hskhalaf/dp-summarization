      "text": "We had over 6,000 family photos that we wanted to scan and were looking for a way to get them all into the cloud. This is the only way to go for a large project, since scanning is very fast. I removed a star because occasionally scans would come out stretched or partial, but that was rare. Also, the supporting software is archaic and doesn\u2019t help organize the photos - which is necessary in a large project. I\u2019d recommend scanning and then uploading to Google Photos to help organize all the pictures.",

      "text": "The FF-640 is super fast at scanning photos or anything else. I flew through a box of photos and have been using the scanner instead of my printers scanner (Epson WF-3520) because it is so much faster and the software for the FF-640 is much better. I have experienced all of the problems that reviewers have (dirty lens causing lines, elongated scan/image, etc) but none are a deal breaker. The elongated image has only happened once or twice and the scanner is easy to clean if there are lines showing up. It is so fast to scan photos that a re-scan is no big deal if you are not happy with something.",

      "text": "I was hoping for something that worked a bit better, but you get what you pay for. HARDWARE: When scanning stacks of photos, it is quite prone to pull 2-3 photos at a time, making scanning large groups a pain. I had to split the stacks into 4-6 photos per stack, and even then I'd have to re-scan the entire stack due to multiple photos being pulled at the same time. SOFTWARE: With no rhyme or reason, the software randomly orientates the photos however it sees fit - some images upright correctly, some sideways, some upside down. This is far from an easy process, but its manageable with time and patience.",

Happy to see the auto options to copy the rear of the photo when writing was discovered and to create an improved version with photo correction. Both options are done in the original scan and the additional copy can be deleted later. Very good news, I discovered later you can turn off these functions in settings if you like. I actually liked the photo corrected version in most cases so I set the scanner to save only the corrected photo. A good experience...",
