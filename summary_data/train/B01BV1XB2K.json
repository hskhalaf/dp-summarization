This isn't a fault with LG but rather Mac doesn't want to have people using unusual monitor resolutions.",

Great if you do stuff in excel, photoshop, premier, etc where a long screen is handy! The menu options are a pleasure and a breeze to go through with one button that doubles as a power and directional choice button. Cons: it is wide, but short.

The only issue I've ever had is (using an AMD GPU, RX 570) I didn't have the option of switching the refresh rate to 75 Hz and had to create a custom resolution to do so. Another minor issue is that the housing of the actual panel itself is pretty cheap and shoddy, all cheap plastic etc. Probably the reason it's cost is so low, but the panel itself is very nice.",

I play a couple games on my computer but not a great deal. It works great for both instances. Some people have said that this isn't great use as a small ultrawide, but I disagree. It's worked out really well for me. Honestly I couldn't imagine the next size up, though that could be due to the fact my desk isn't very deep ask I'm fairly close to it. This monitor is comparable to a 20\" 16:9 that's stretched out horizontally.",

Great feature is that you can split your monitor (no not physically :)), the windows on this monitor can be split into \"N\" number of windows desired your way Vertically/Horizontally with the help of its Software \"OnScreen Control\". Love this monitor and only thing I overlooked is I thought it had a built-in speaker system, but doesnt although you can connect your head phones to it. Awesome picture modes by the way.",
