However, my review is because \"Le Creuset\" is imprinted on this small pan in four places: the lid, lid knob, handle, and the bottom. This was not visible to me when viewing online. I find this distracting and thus a bit annoying. Wouldn't the bottom and knob, or bottom and lid, be enough? I'll be buying more enameled cast iron ware and may return to Le Creuset but will now first look for other manufacturers' if I can find one are as good without all the labeling. If other buyers do not mind this, it is a perfect pan indeed.",

This is a great addition. Expensive but worth it. The handle gets very hot but they make a slip on handle holder for 10 bucks that works well. The older pots like this had wood handles that don\u2019t get hot. Progress? Not really. Give me the old ones, but what can you do? Probably now made in China vs the old Made in France Le Creuset.
