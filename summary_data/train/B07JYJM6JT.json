These are not water proof, they are cloth and would retain water. Ive only worn them from the apartment office back to my house as of right now but they were nice and cozy. I will update if my opinion changes but as of right now i quite enjoy them.",

If I wasn't interested in the touchscreen aspect, I'd have considered these nice MILD winter or fall gloves. I would pick something else for cold winters.",

      "text": "I have been wearing these gloves for the past couple months to keep my hands warms during the morning hours when I am out. They have been great at keeping my hands warm, and still allow for the flexibility that I have been looking for. Compared to most other gloves these are a bit thinner so you wont get that same level of insulation as you would expect. However the trade off to actually being able to use these gloves in a working environment is the best for me. I would buy these again just to have a spare set if I ever lose the first.",
