Of course the threads can be clipped, but because of this, their lifetime will be shortened. Still, for the price, I feel they're a fair purchase.",

At size 13 I could barely get both my sneakers to fit. So if you have dress shoes, which tend to be bigger, no way you are getting both in the same bag. Sadly these are the exact kinds of shoes you buy protective bags for (dress shoes).",

Fortunately they were cheap enough that I don't mind that much, but when I've used the last one I'm not going to reorder these.",

I've traveled with it and use them to store my dress shoes in. It does the job. I did get some water on the outside of the bag, and sure enough, no water seeped though onto my shoes. My only gripe is that I wish the bag was slightly more thick. It feels like after heavy use, it would wear thin. But I'm not using these too heavily.",
