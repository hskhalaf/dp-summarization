The laser eye is small and you have to overlap your zaps, so to treat your legs will take hours to finish just the bottom section. The time spent treating your legs is actually very discouraging to keep using. Not to mention, it recommends to overlap a square inch at a time, and it can get confusing to keep track... so if you're going to use this def have a grid system. It's more practical for the face and underarms, but for almost 500?.... That's your call.",

Follow the directions for sure, don't think you can get by bc it really is the skin tone that unlocks the machine to do the job. Works best on pale skin with dark course hair.

I\u2019m not all the way done with it but the change I have already noticed makes my life so much better and I can\u2019t wait to see the end result. I definitely recommend trying it.
