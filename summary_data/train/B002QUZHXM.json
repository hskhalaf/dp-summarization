Replacing a Quantum QEQ6, not sure if the Quantum is up to the task, but i know the Planet will perform. My music is a bit lifeless with the Quantum, hoping the proven Planet PEQ15, with it's variable parametric versatility will help bring more dynamics to the installation. Could always be the factory radio being a bit lackluster, tho. People tend to bash Planet, but they always perform for me.",

You can't use eq boost for sub frequencies if you use the sub x over output at the same time. My amp already has this, but if you boost 20 hz @ 18 db and use the sub on the rear out instead then those powerful low signals get sent to the mids and highs. You will need another amp with a high pass x over to stop those deep frequencies. Update, like others, this unit makes noise, especially low frequency rumbling at higher volume it becomes apparent.",

    "description": "Audio ConnectionsView larger HOW AN EQUALIZER IS USED\nThe Planet Audio PEQ15 parametric equalizer is a high-fidelity signal processor/preamplifier that allows you to control the relative levels within the audible frequency spectrum of a stereophonic system. It is intended for use in a car audio system which includes amplifiers in a signal path after the equalizer, and provides front, rear, and subwoofer low level outputs via RCA connectors.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n * Front/Rear EQ center frequency ranges: Low (20-70 Hz); Low/Mid (150-400 Hz); Mid (1.5-4 kHz); High (4-20 kHz)\n * Sub channel EQ crossover range: 50 \u2013 250Hz\n * Equalization range: +/- 18 dB (boost/cut)\n * Frequency response: 10 Hz \u2013 50 kHz (+/- 1dB)\n * Signal to noise ratio: 110 dB (ref. 1V input)\n * THD: 0.005%\n * Channel separation: 82 dB (at 1kHz)\n * Output impedance: 50k Ohms\n * Power supply: 11-15V negative ground\n * Output voltage: 7V\n * Dimensions: (7.2\u201d W x 3.8\u201d D x 1.3\u201d H)\n\nFront Panel Controls and Key FeaturesView larger FRONT PANEL CONTROLS AND KEY FEATURES\n 1.  Fader: Use this control to balance the sound level between front and rear speakers as desired.\n 2.  Input Select (CD or AUX): This button permits you to select the equalizer input source. The unit features separate rear panel RCA inputs for in dash receiver such as a CD or another source such as a DVD player\n 3. Master Volume Control: Use this to adjust the overall output volume level.\n 4.  Subwoofer Crossover Frequency Selector: Use this control to select the highest frequency to be sent to the subwoofer channel. Choose a frequency between 50 Hz and 250 Hz.\n 5.  Subwoofer Volume Control: Use the knob to set the volume level for the subwoofer channel.\n 6.  Front/Rear Channel Center Frequency Selectors: Use these controls to select the center frequencies for boosting/cutting in the signal provided to the front and rear output channels. Frequency ranges for each control are Low (20-70 Hz); Low/Mid (150-400 Hz); Mid (1.5-4 kHz); High (4-20 kHz)\n 7.  Front/Rear Channel Boost/Cut Controls: These knobs will set the desired amount of boost or cut (from -18 to +18 dB) for each of the frequency bands within the signal provided to the rear and front output channels.\n\nTop Panel Controls and Key FeaturesView larger TOP PANEL CONTROLS AND KEY FEATURES\n 1. Subwoofer Channel RCA Outputs\n 2.  Front And Rear Channel RCA Outputs\n 3.  CD And AUX Channel RCA Inputs\n 4.  Power Connections: Please note that the PEQ15 has an automatic turn-on circuit, so that in addition to the (+) and ground connections, it is necessary for you to connect the REM terminal to the REM terminal on your head unit. \n 5. CD And AUX Channel Controls: Use these controls during setup to balance the gain for each of the two input sources.",
