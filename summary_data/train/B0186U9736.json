I tried this product because of the good reviews, and ingredients because my scalp was really sensitive. And I didn\u2019t expect the outcome of this product. Check the photos below! And aside from the outcome, my hair became softer than before and thicker, and 1 bottle of this castor oil lasted almost a year.",
