I could add pictures to prove my words But was no option to include photos in this review, \"suspiciously\" BUT, before open the box find the discription of the item on right side of the box, there written truth that this laptop has only 1tb. I was too trustful and opened the box before reading, so I hope you wont be fooled.",

No damage to the exterior box or anything and after updating/re-installing all the graphics drivers I plugged in an external monitor to find it working fine on the second monitor. So we ruled out a software issue. After talking to Acer technical support they believe it was a port issue on the internal graphics card so we have no choice but to return the laptop and have to delay her birthday gift. Very disappointed.",

We didn't discover this until he started using it to play games and found it far too slow. We then checked the spec. Amazon did let us return it due to being mis-sold, and we have replaced it with a different laptop which does have SSD.",
