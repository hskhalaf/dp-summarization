By the time I had my second I remembered to bring the hospital grade one home with me. I\u2019m now pregnant with my third and so happy Amazon is around to allow to order as many hospital grade nose suckers I can. However, this purchase was to help my husband unplug his ear that has been blocked with wax. Filled the bulb with warm water, repeatedly flushed, and by the third squeeze his ear was clear. Soft gentle tip worked perfect for placing in such a sensitive areA. Definitely will be purchasing more!!",

Used also for squirting cleaner onto carb parts to clean them and also squirting slime into bike and tire tubes when the pumper quit. Impervious to gas and brake fluid, how can you have a garage without one of these? I would imagine it would even work on what it was designed for although that sounds kinda yucky.",

As gross as the nose frida sounds to use, it has been more efficient and gentle on my baby. If you do choose this bulb suction for nasal use on infants just beware how far in it can go.",
