We have been able to close the grill lid and not damage the thermometers so far. The bluetooth app is by far the most impressive thing about this product. You can label each thermometer on your phone and it has cooking temperature pre-sets. We have been able to sit from the inside of our home and simultaneously grill fish and hamburgers or four prime rib roasts at once. This really ups the convenience factor of grilling.",

The reason I bought it was to get the connection to my phone. Now that it won't pair, can't set alarms at all. The thermometer works, but can't set alarms and can't remote reading. Also need to be careful with the probes. If the silicone handles get too close to the grill, they melt at normal grilling temps. Need to ust some sort of stand to keep the silicone handles far enough away from the grill.",
