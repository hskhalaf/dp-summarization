It didn\u2019t give my fine wavy hair the wave I wanted, but it wasn\u2019t frizzy like it is without using. I\u2019ve found other products that work better, but this wasn\u2019t terrible. I would use it again if it were my only choice.",

Curls galore in the morning which is just what I want. Cream has a nice scent and goes on very easy - great for longer, curly hair. Hoping it will work well to combat frizz during the summer months.",

I decided to risk using it alone and not applying a leave-in conditioner first and it dried out my hair and all of the curl fell out. Unfortunately, I will have to pass on this product. Very disappointed!!",

I have a hard time finding products that help keep it under control. I use a palmful of this while my hair is wet, and comb it through evenly. I then use a palmful of mousse to scrunch the ends and add volume. I would recommend!",
