      "text": "I bought this bag for a BTS concert at Rose Bowl stadium last year. I had only planned on using if for the concert only, & it lasted wonderfully for the concert. I ended up using it for the next 6-7 months after the concert, with heavy & rough use, before one of the straps popped off with plastic and all. Is it a great long term purse? No. But the price is amazing, & if you need it just for events, it's perfect for that. Can easily wear it for weeks at a time if need be, & it fits a lot more in there than you'd expect. Definitely recommend it for events!",
