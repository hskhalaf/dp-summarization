Be careful, you could slice a finger because this thing is SO sharp. Built in the USA and they'll resharpen it for life if you ever need it.",

If you're carrying change in the same pocket as your knife, especially pennies and dimes. It's possible for coins to get lodged between the blade and the body of knife which can make it harder than usual to open. The coins can also dull or scratch the blade. Not a big deal, just put your change in a different pocket.",

The knife is ergonomic and fits the hand well. The grip texture is amazing, and the glass breaker is a nice touch. The serrations aren't very aggressive, but get the job done.

I highly recommend this knife as it is a solid choice for any adventure life throws at you.",

The sping assistant is the smoothest and nicest even compared to knives way higher in price. The blade is super sharp right out of the box which is always very nice and the slight recurve is not to overdone but adds an impressive advantage while cutting. I use and carry this knife every day and will continue to for a very long time.",

The S30V steel is some of the best you can buy and it excels at taking and keeping an edge. The blade is sizable and thick. 3. You can debate price vs performance with Sanvick vs S30V vs other steels. It's splitting hairs (Pun intentional). The price point between the knives is ~$10...seriously that's cost of a meal at McDonalds. 4. I\"m left-handed and changing the clip to the other-side makes opening it as easy as the right-handed. 5. For the price point of $70 it can't be beat. Period.",

    "description": "Color:1670TBLKSTThe Kershaw Blur Tanto Serrated proves the ideal folding knife for tough jobs including hunting or fishing, emergency rescue and tactical engagement. The blade\u2019s partial serration allows clean cuts without shredding and enables easy cutting through fibrous material like rope, webbing and even seatbelts. Made of high-carbon, heat-treated, Sandvik 14C28N stainless steel, the blade provides corrosion resistance and amazing edge-holding capabilities and is DLC-coated for increased hardness and strength. The Tanto blade permits greater force for tactical piercing through any hard material in both normal and emergency circumstances. The handle is made of black 6061-T6 anodized aluminum and includes Trac-Tec inserts, adding extra grip for outdoor tasks and performance underwater. The Blur comes equipped with SpeedSafe assisted opening for quick one-handed open, a liner lock to hold the blade open during use, and a reversible pocketclip for versatile carrying capacity.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nConstructed of 13C26 stainless steel for strength and corrosion resistance, Kershaw's Ken Onion Tactical Blur folding knife features a 3-3/8-inch partially serrated Tanto blade. Ideal for extreme or everyday situations, the Blur series offers power and performance. A lightweight anodized aluminum handle offers Trac-Tec inserts which provide a non-slip grip even in wet and slippery conditions. \n\n Kershaw's SpeedSafe assisted opening system helps you to smoothly open the knife with a manual push on the blade's thumb stud or Index-Open system. SpeedSafe's torsion bar helps keep the knife closed, preventing it from being opened by accident. In order to open the knife, apply manual pressure to the thumb stud to overcome the resistance of the torsion bar. After the blade is out of the handle, the torsion bar moves along its track and takes over. The blade opens smoothly and locks into position, ready for use. \n\n About Kershaw Knives\nSince the company's founding in 1974, Kershaw Knives has been dedicated to quality that has led to a worldwide reputation for performance and innovation in tools and knives.
