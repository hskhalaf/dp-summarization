However, players on whose feet the ClutchFit Drive II fit well find that the traction, cushion, and support mechanisms perform very well.This Under Armour basketball shoe is for guards because it prioritizes speed and agility. Impact protection and responsiveness is minimal yet you get a ton of court feel.",
      "pros": [
        "The shoe generally receives good user feedback",
        "One comments, \u201cTraction, cushion, stability and lockdown are amazing",

        "Given that it is of the right size, a lot of users comment that the Under Armour ClutchFit Drive 2 is very comfortable to wear since the shoe\u2019s upper and ankle collar are padded with thick foam, and the insole is Micro G. One wearer comments, \u201cit almost feels like a sock because the tongue and inside padding are extremely thick, soft and cradle the foot.\u201d",
        "The shoe\u2019s upper padding and the narrow fit offer great support and lockdown, say most of the testers",
        "It is as good as the Kevin Durant 11th Nike basketball shoe",
        "A few purchasers like that there are many colors to choose from"

      "cons": [
        "A lot of wearers say that the shoe runs very narrow from the midfoot to the forefoot",

        "Several remark that they find the shoe too stiff and firm, further saying that they would\u2019ve wanted the shoe to be a bit more comfortable",

He is a delivery driver so on his feet for 14 hrs a day Monday threw friday and he also wears them on weekends. If your looking for a good shoe this one is it. It is a bit narrow so if u have super wide feet id go up a half size. My husband has wide feet but likes his shoes snug fit.",

So size if definitely off! So order up .5 or 1 size! Was going to order a 12 (us) but they are not in stock! Bummer. Shoe looks and feels really nice except for the width. Also another thing that upset me the most was the soles were dirty like they have been worn! So did I get a used pair of shoes? These were most likely returns!

Had I ordered my normal size, my shoes would have been near impossible to get on when combined with the narrower width. Luckily, I had a heads up on both issues so I can't really complain BUT I can knock off a star.",

    "description": "Under Armour ClutchFit Drive 2 Basketball Shoes Tackle the court in the Under Armour ClutchFit Drive 2 Basketball Shoe. Updated ClutchFit technology wraps your foot with a lightweight, second-skin fit for powerful support. Charged cushioning resides in the midsole for responsive quickness while the multi-directional herringbone outsole delivers optimal court feel and control. ClutchFit Upper Under Armour have incorporated their signature ClutchFit technology into the construction of the upper to offer a lightweight, second-skin feel to ensure powerful support and incredible feel. With the upper being incredibly lightweight, it will not hold you back or restrict your performance on the court. A 3D moulded tongue forms around your foot and ankle to provide an enhanced fit to boost comfort while the full-length, moulded Micro G sockliner adds cushion and keeps your foot locked in place. Charged Cushion Midsole Exceptional cushioning is delivered thanks to the Charged Midsole. The midsole works to combine areas of cushioning and support to comfortably absorb impact, meaning whenever you land the risk of injury is reduced as the shock is absorbed and gradual wear and tear on the joints is diminished. Multi-Directional Herringbone Outsole Optimal grip and traction on court is provided by the multi-directional herringbone outsole, giving you the confidence to make sharp, aggressive movements typically associated with a high octane sport like basketball. A herringbone traction pattern is located throughout the outsole and ensures a full, unrestricted range of motion in all directions.",
