I have tried moving it to the deep end and it moved back and forth for 30 seconds and then it's like rise of the machines, ignores the intended and does what it wants by returning to 3 foot and climbs the wall. This was a very expensive source of annoyance, I will be seeking a return to Amazon on this one",

Cord gets continually tangled and does not untangle well. Will tangle up quickly again. Almost rendering the vacuum useless. Certainly is strange that something simple like a swivel cord connection wasn't added to such an expensive, top of the line machine. The no-tangle hassle in the advertising is a complete misrepresentation. Stay away. I liked mine when I first got it. Now I spend as much time untangling the cord as I do vacuuming the pool. The garbage about the programming not allowing it to tangle is a total lie.",

Best features: Top loading filter (this is a major improvement over bottom style). Easy to grab folding handle. Cord has not tangled. Size not as bulky. Lighter weight makes it so much easier to place into & pull from the pool. Does not spill water all over the place like my old cleaner when removing. Overall, so much easier to use. Intelligent design. Does a thorough job. Easily climbs walls. I even like the little blu led light so you know it us running :)",

Doesn't clean the steps that well, but seems none of them do, Like the easy access top loading cartridge. Very easy to clean. The unit does not seem heavy to me. When you bring it to the side you just lift it a little slow to drain the water. The changeable filter screens are a nice touch. They are easy to switch to either handle larger debris and leaves to fine particles. If it had cleaned my steps well, I would have given it 5 stars.",

If the robot ever got snagged and somehow dragged the cord, the connection would be broken in a possible three places on the power supply line.
