It\u2019s not. This food does tend to absorb moisture very quickly, and thickens up like concrete. I have to add more water, than what is recommended, just to try and avoid it from thickening so much.",

It has the texture of flour and it's sticky. Honest Kitchen is like cornmeal. Spot Farms thickens almost immediately. It gets too thick too fast. It was a pain waiting three minutes for Honest Kitchen Food to thicken up, but I was almost afraid Spot Farms was going to turn into cement. I believe Honest Kitchen is a far superior product, but it's expensive, so I tried the Spot Farms. My dogs ate it fine, but I don't have confidence in the product. I will pay the extra money for Honest Kitchen.",
