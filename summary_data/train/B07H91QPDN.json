Sound and picture quality is better than expected.The remote control is great and makes options easy to navigate..It can receive about more than 80 channels. It works in kitchen, outdoor, living room. I can put it anywhere in my house..I think it would be a good choice to give my friends as a present... By the way,although I had doubts in searching channels, Leadstar has provided excellent customer service and they helped us finish the seaeching progress. Recommended.",

It picked up the same public channels I get on the tv in my house. Wonderful HD channels for free. I'm about to take a 23 hour drive and plan on resting a lot on the way up. This tv will earn it's keep while I'm sitting in a parking lot. Both antennae's worked great! You can plug it into your cigarette lighter, a house socket, or a usb port. I definitely recommend it. I'm amazed at how good and easy it was. For me well worth it!",

The viewing angles kind of suck, but the screen is bright enough to see outside on the brightest day, so that makes up for the viewing angles. I definitely recommend.",

The sound is weak but it does the job for a kitchen counter TV. One thing is that while changing channels it gets stuck on a channel (that is just a solid screen color) and becomes unresponsive to the remote. You can't change to another channel or turn it off. I have to turn the unit off with the hard switch and turn it back on. If this continues I will have to return it.",

      "text": "I realize it was $140 and it does come with a suction cup, antenna and some other accessories. They got a star for including a nice set of items. But the reason you buy it is to watch stuff and it falls down there. I've been using LCD screens since the late 90s. This is easily the worse I've ever encountered. The viewing angle is so narrow that you can't even watch something. Holding it about 18\" away, if the middle looks good, the top and bottom won't. Holding it just 15 degrees to the top or bottom makes the screen unwatchable. I can't believe anyone makes screens this bad in 2020.",
