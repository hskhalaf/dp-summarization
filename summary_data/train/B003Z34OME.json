The Toaster setting goes from a low of 1 to a high of 6. The lowest setting was acceptable but very brown. The medium #3 setting resulted in black, smoking, burned toast. I was replacing a similar Oster Toaster Oven that is 7+ years old. Disappointed that Oster cannot perfect the toaster oven after so many years of making almost the same model, Will try a different brand.",

I had looked at a more expensive Breville convection toaster oven, but in comparing the two side by side, I decided to go with the Oster not just for the almost $200 savings, but for the look--I just love the black finish and curved sides--it blends so nicely in my kitchen. So far, I have used it to reheat my morning frittatas, roast beets, bake sweet potatoes, and toast pumpkin seeds--I could not be happier with the results!",

A little liquid spilled while pulling a dish out and it went right in between the glass and the metal frame and there's no way to clean it besides possibly separating the glass from the frame via the screws 2. The rear and top of the oven get VERY hot so it needs plenty of clearance and dont keep any wires behind it. As such the power cord is too short because it touches the rear of the oven and I think that could be a safety hazard",

Since the purchase date it has seen almost daily use reheating leftovers, toasting breakfast foods, warming bread or cooking pizzas or smaller packaged dinners. Every function continues to work without issue. Ours tends to cook a little hot, but that is easily compensated for by just adjusting the temperature 25-degrees lower than your recipe may call for. Overall a great toaster oven that I hope they still make when ours eventually fails as I would definitely buy another one.",

      "text": "Good looking appliance. Controls take a while to get used to. Have to figure out what 3,2,1,toast is,Minutes? Happy with it so far . Update - We started to have problems the handle was getting hot, the fan was noisy, and the bake timer stopped working. Also the thermostat seemed stuck on high. It was past Amazon's warrantee so we called the manufacturer. It took two weeks but they sent us a new one. Very happy now everything works, the handle doesn't get too hot, thermostat works and the fan(Convection bake) is almost silent. Happy once again. Hope it lasts. Not the Oster of yesteryear.",

The lettering wore off and the dial broke. Then it stopped working. I LOVE the digital. The oven rack is flimsy, it bends and has dislodged on me when half to 3/4 extended while tending to the food. If they added just 1mm of extra stainless steel to it, that would help a lot. This is a minor flaw. It also gets pretty hot on top and behind. Could use a little more insulation.",

One week later I sent an email asking for status; nothing. One week later I sent another email asking about status; nothing. I will be sending the unit back and spending a little more for another unit with more features. One feature I would have liked is for the unit to display the measured temperature inside the unit instead of just the set temperature.",

Set at 250 bakes at 275. You can only set the temperature at 25 degree increments, so if you need something that heats precisely like a clay oven, I would look somewhere else. Also theres a decent gap between the crumb tray and glass. The digital buttons are a bit sluggish as well.",

It has been used a lot and we tend to cook anything small enough in the toaster oven rather than the full size oven. It does really well with cookies and chicken breasts, but I would recommend baking things like pies and cornbread in a larger oven, or cook at a low temperature, because following recipes tends to result in really dark top and bottom by the time the center is done.",
