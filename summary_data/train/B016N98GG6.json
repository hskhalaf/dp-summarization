(2) Not as bright as larger projectors, but adequate with lights off. Your going to be disappointed if you expect the same quality and performance as a $500 projector that's the size of a 90's phone book.",

One wouldn't think however that it shouldn't develop a short while being in the box. The projector itself is very sturdy and looks to be a much better quality build. The included tripod is also very nice. A great purchase for the price but had to buy a new cable which was another 50 bucks.",

      "text": "I love this device. The picture quality is good enough to play video games on, which I have not found in other mini projectors I have used. The fact that is it battery powered provides a whole new dimension to how you can use a portable projector. I would advise to also purchase a lightning cable/mini usb to HDMI cable to projector movies straight from you phone.",
