      "text": "Very disappointed with these penlights. One stopped working within a month with little to use (backup I keep in my office pencil container). The other still works (after 3 months) but moving it at all causes the light to dim or flicker. I've tried replacing batteries in both multiple times with no luck. I can only conclude that they're cheap junk that aren't even worth the plastic they're made of. Extremely disappointed but definitely a good lesson on cost vs. quality. Skip these penlights and go with something that will last.",

I\u2019ve given narcan like 3 times now in situations I might not have because I didn\u2019t carry the neccarry tools to assess constricted pupils. Pupils tell you a lot and this is an item I now see as important as a stethoscope in my assessments. Only probably is that I keep these in my pocket pants the light is always turning on without me knowing so I\u2019m worried the battery is going to go out soon. But I would purchase again.",

She was impressed by the quality and that they have the guide right on the pens. And the colors are fun. So whether you want these as small purse/pocket flashlights or to do surprise checks for fun or do real pupil checks in the medical field, I highly recommend these. Hope this was helpful.",

A great price, bright light, gauges on the side, 2 for 1, and included batteries...I recommended this to other Nursing friends due to how much of a steal this seemed to be haha.",

Excellent response to this issue, and I received the item within a few days, which is above what I would expect at this price, but certainly welcome. I will see how long these last and update accordingly. Color and brightness seem good. Very inexpensive. Light materials. Light is very unreliable, started flickering or not turning on after first shift using it, was never dropped or damaged in any way.",

Since this kind of light ends up in a pen sleeve of most EMT pants, you can't tell when it's on ... and because the spring tension / off position depression it makes it easier to turn ON than OFF, and it constantly gets turned on during normal movement and kills the battery. Not awesome to pull out your pen light for a patient and have it not work - I do not recommend for field duty.",
