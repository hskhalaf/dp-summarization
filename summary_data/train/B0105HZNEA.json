However, although I ordered the 46\" x 36 \", the cover was the right size, but the filling was about 8\" short on the length, so there was a gap at the end. Additionally, the stuffing was width wise baffles that had paw size gaps between them, so would be difficult for my dogs to walk on and be lumpy. Finally, the zip was not done up on it..... because it was jammed. For $100 dogbed, this was abysmal.",

I needed to find a thicker dog bed for my new beagle/Bassett rescue so that 'she of stubby short legs' could actually SEE out the window of my Forester.

This bed may even be more than 5\" thick with FIRM memory foam and a well-constructed, easily removeable, waterproof cover of 180 GSM microfiber that is thick enough to provide good footing for four- pawed passengers.",

Not a huge problem-we lined the sides with towels to compensate. As for the ease of cleaning, we were disappointed to see the waterproof part of the liner rip the first time we washed it(according to the directions on the tag).

      "text": "So this is the second bed I buy through Amazon. The first one was \"tempurpedic\" and we spent around $50 on it to find out it was flimsy foam and my dog easily chewed it up. When I received this bed, after ten minutes the foam rises and it was very cushiony. It's really big and my dog loves it so much. She doesn't chew on it. My dog gets hot on my bed so in the middle of the night she'll go sleep on her bed on the floor. It has a nice cool material so she doesn't get hot. I have a 65 lb 7 month Doberman and she LOVES this bed. Totally worth it.",

      "text": "I was originally very happy with this bed for our 90 pound 8 year old dog. However, 4 months after purchasing it, the whole bed seam tore all the way down. It is very clearly not torn up by our dog (who hasn't destroyed anything in 7+ years) but straight down the seam. The inside is made of very obnoxious to clean up shredded pieces. If our dog was a chewer or interested in eating things he shouldn't this could have been very bad! The bed was not moved around but kept in the same spot in his room except to clean around it. Disappointed.",

I tried to shake it and fluff it, but the center still had no filling. I sent it back and purchased a dog bed that is a solid piece of memory foam.",
