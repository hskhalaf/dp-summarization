I thought the humidity from the shower would make it drip but it hasn\u2019t. I use it to hang washcloth. It could fit two folded washcloths. When Installing make sure you know which anchor is left an right. I accidentally switched it and had to take it off. The adhesive cooperated. Also I was surprised the that bar in the middle moves intentionally. Like if you grab something off of it quickly the bar turns. Overall doesn\u2019t bother me and nothing falls off",
