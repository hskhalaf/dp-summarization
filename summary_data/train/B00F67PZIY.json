Not only are we putting less of a footprint on earth - it makes a great cup of coffee! In fact, now when we buy coffee from coffee shops and brew it at home it tastes just like theirs! Bonus - the music at the beginning and end. We love this silly thing. Honestly - I think the quality of the brew is better than those pour over single serves and the brew process (which you can watch in the window) really does eliminate the acidic taste somehow.",

It does give a smooth tasting cup of coffee however it takes 10 minutes to make a pot, leaves a lot--not a little--sediment in the pot and each cup of coffee, it's very noisy while brewing, and it's a pain to clean the grounds out of the large, oddly shaped basket. We are sending it back and ordering another Bunn. There is a secondary filter that reduces the sediment that makes it too the pot but it reduces the taste of the coffee and it's also a pain to clean out.",

      "text": "This was our second iCoffee Steam Brew Coffee Maker. The first one lasted 14 months. My wife and I really liked the coffee it brews so I ordered a new one to replace it. We did not order it from the original source because they did not respond to an email concerning the failure of the first one. I recommend this coffee maker for anyone that particularly likes black coffee; however I also recommend that you be very kind and gentle to the screen baskets. The gold basket was the failure (I discovered after I ordered the new one) of the first coffee maker. A replacement basket costs half the price of a new coffee maker.",

As mentioned by others, it is difficult to clean; we are not clean freaks, but the design of the filter basket makes it hard to clean rapidly and throughly. The biggest drawback is the heated carafe. The initial cup is good, but any subsequent cups taste burnt if coffee lingers at all in the carafe. Nothing significant enough to return, just not good enough to justify the advertising hype. We are back to using our old Zojirushi (sp?) coffee maker. -- the coffee tastes much better, and th thermal carafe keeps offee warm without \"burning\" it.",
