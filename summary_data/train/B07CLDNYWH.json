Update: After using this silicone brush for three months, I can say that I did got used to it. It does get bottles clean and I love that it reaches through those tall bottles like Dr. Brown. There is a TIP though, you got to put some extra water to the bottle while cleaning it so it can make some bubbles. That gives me the feeling that it is cleaning well. And the brush still looks line new even though I use it everyday. Good quality product.",
