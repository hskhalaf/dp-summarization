      "text": "A friend recommended this and said she didn't get any stretch marks at all during both of her pregnancy. Loving the cream so far. It's not too greasy and the smell isn't bad at all. I hate that I didn't find about this until a couple weeks ago and I'm due to pop any day now. I already had light stretch marks that didn't appear until a couple weeks ago so I'm hoping they won't stick around.",
