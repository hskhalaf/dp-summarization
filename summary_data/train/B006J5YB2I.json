I recently ordered medium to dark and it was too light, but I was able to exchange it for the dark shade and the shade blended with my reddish brown skin. Like to wear it whenever I'm going out and there will be pictures.",

It's also very light coverage...if you want more, you'll probably prefer a different product. For me it looks good, but everyone is different.",

I was looking for a BB cream closer to my complexion and this one had good reviews so I thought I would try it. I tried applying this after moisturizing, but it just didn't spread as nicely as the Lab Series, it clumped up on every pore, stubble and skin imperfection. Looks like it's designed for woman with perfect skin.",
