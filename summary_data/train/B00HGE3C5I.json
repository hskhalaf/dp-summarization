Negatives include the tiny sensor doesn't handle low light very well and documentation fails to point out that digital zoom is deactivated if you elect to save RAW (\"RAF\") files. Now mid-2017 and I've taken many thousands of bald eagle photos with this camera in rain and dusty winds -- great results, especially when using RAW (RAF) files.",
