Constant background static when on, no squelch control to make it quite when not receiving..and it does not even receive our local weather frequency unless you drive it up onto a nearby hill. All our other weather radio brands receive our local Noaa channel inside the home just fine. Constant static noise, no reception, very short antenna, no external antenna plug option, not sure what this one was designed/intended for. Gonna give it to someone I hope the weather will get.",
