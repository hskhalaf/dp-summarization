For a backyard project like mine this compactor was perfect and performed flawlessly. It's not too big where it's harder to handle and the fold away wheels makes it easy to move around. Don't let the small size fool you, it can get the job done. My project was about 30 X 20 and it started and worked great.",

On dirt, noise level is about the same as a 4-stroke lawnmower. On gravel or rock, noisier. The best thing is you can buy this cheaper than renting one for a few days. Also great for touch-ups, when one or two pavers settle slightly and you want to flatten it again.",
