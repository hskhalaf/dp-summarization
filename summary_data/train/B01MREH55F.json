Not nearly as great as yours. Make MORE!! I don't want the black. I don't want the maroon (too much like RED) MORE MORE MORE! Thank you!",

So many uses for them and they are very sturdy. I would recommend them to anyone. Thanks for having them to buy please add more colors.",

      "text": "I love the concept of these bags, but I wish I hadn't gotten the gold. I wrapped my gifts on my bed, and now I have gold dust all over my comforter. I question how long these will last, and I wouldn't trust throwing the gold bags into the washing machine. They do seem a bit pricey for the quality, but they're reusable and save me a ton of hassle since I always have to travel via plane with Christmas gifts, and normal gift wrap would get completely torn up in my situation. Next year I might try the red.",
