If you are buying this pan for a small toaster/oven, then you should use a measuring tape to check the size of the inside of the toaster, that is how I made sure it was going to be the right size for mine.",

The ones that are coated will eventually break down and can present health hazards. First off, uncoated aluminum does not overbake. You'll find that most restaurants use non coated ones due to this reason and in part because it's cheaper too. Anodized aluminum, non-stick, and dark metal conduct heat much more intensely so if you do end up purchasing that type of metal, you have to drop your oven temperature by 25\u00b0F to prevent over-baking. Sturdiness 5/5 ***** Value 5/5 ***** My Recommendation 5/5 *****",

The burned-on bacon grease discolored/destroyed the non-stick coating on the pan, and made the entire pan very unsightly looking. (Note: Using the broiler seems to damage the pan more than regular baking temperatures.) So the second pan has gotten more careful handling. Now before every use I line the pan with aluminum foil to protect the pan and make cleanup easy. I've been using it about once a week for 4 months, and haven\u2019t had any problems.

Clearly not the product's fault and simply my own lack of common sense, but a turkey will definitely not fit in this thing. For any other use though, very nice product.",

I will say that the first time I used it to make a London broil, the drippings burned onto the legs of the grill and parts of the grill work. I probably ruined the non-stick coating by using an abrasive scrubber to remove the burned on juices. I strongly recommend wrapping the pan and grill in heavy duty aluminum foil. It only takes a few minutes and the pan and grill will look like new. It's made of thick metal and does not warp.",
