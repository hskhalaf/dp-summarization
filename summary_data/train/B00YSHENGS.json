      "text": "Great looking, classic black frame. Mat opening for 8x12 measures about 1/16\" under 7.5\" x 11.5\" in both dimensions. Backing board is held in with little bent metal tabs and on the frame I received they were not arranged evenly around the frame. I doubt the tabs will stand up to more than a few bends back and forth. I bent them twice and they already feel like they could break off. Also, the frame comes with two clips that grab onto the backing board rather than clip onto the frame. I'd rather hang it by the frame rather than the backing board which is held in with those flimsy tabs.",

I solved this by inserting some cardboard in there. But who wants that hassle? Plus, when you do the wire, it is very difficult to get more than one exactly the same, which makes it hard to hang a series of pieces with the same frame style. I would not buy this again.",

The glass breaks very easily. If you clip the back on too tight, glass shatters. Fun! Go to the Discount store for your frames. You won't want to bother with these.",

Not a huge deal, since it should theoretically be hanging against a wall most of the time, but I still feel it should have completely covered the back.

      "text": "I have purchased these frames multiple times over the past two years and will continue to do so. The frames have never come damaged and are always in pristine condition upon arrival - this is coming from someone who now owns 10+ 8x10 frames that have been ordered several months apart on multiple occasions. Not once have I had a frame that came with any damages, dust or quality issues. In regards to the hanging hardware, I have personally never used any of what the picture comes with. I typically use command strips to put these up as I don't want to put any holes in the wall, but the hardware itself looks extremely easy to use.",

No problem, things happen, right? So I sent it back and purchased another from Amazon. The replacement at first glance seemed fine but it too has a problem, namely that there are three deep scratches in the glass. If I didn't need it to match my other frame, I wouldn't order again but here I am. Thirds the charm, right?",

I wouldn't recommend this frame if you're going to be changing pictures a lot, because the little metal stubs that hold the back into place seem like they could break if you start bending them too much. Otherwise, a decent frame for a decent price.",

It has a couple of metal pieces that you are supposed to attach to the metal wire they include, but even after putting it all together and attaching to the frame, it ends up hanging loose at best, and just sliding off at worst. Ultimately, they just didn't work. Unless you plan on purchasing a separate mounting piece/rack to attach to this frame, I would not recommend purchasing this frame for hanging.",

Also found dents and nicks and scratches on front of frame, very visible in black, so required touch up of wood finish. Very obviously \"Made in China\" quality, but guess good frame would cost lots more.",
