He dumped out all the bags of almost 600 tiny pieces onto our dining room table, and proceeded to put these buildings together, using the included instructions, which are in a bound booklet. I have no idea how he found each piece that he needed, but he didn't seem to have trouble. It took him a couple of hours. The buildings are to scale. I only wish the Statue of Liberty was a little more realistic, but it is a minor issue. Our grandson really loved it, and it was a great holiday activity.",

You really have to concentrate on what you are doing as some of the buildings have so many intricate details and there was a part where you had to build a part then build a mirror image and make sure they connected together in just the right way so it was symmetrical. The one issue I have is that the buildings are so intricately built on the inside then at the end they just want you to slap on huge pieces to cover up all the intricate work you just did",

This was a fun build though and remains true to the architecture line build techniques and style.",
