I have a 56 lb pitbull, for reference. It should, however, be noted that I measured my dog's chest and at 27 inches the sizing guide suggested a Large, which was too small, even at its largest. I exchanged for an X-Large, which she is barely big enough for. She wears it almost at its smallest. Maybe my dog is just a weird in-between size. If your dog has similar lean/athletic build with a deep-chest, I would size up.",

This harness had an unexpected benefit as well, it seems to work to help with separation anxiety for him too. Perhaps because the design has more coverage? Either way, we love it, and he looks forward to putting on, coming forward and putting his head right in! Thanks for a great product.",

My dog really hates it, and backs away from the harness, even when she is excited to go on a walk.

      "text": "We really wanted to like this harness, but it's just not designed for pup with large heads. Since there is no clip on the neck opening, you have to either try to force it on over and off of the dog or adjust it before and after putting it on. However, between the poor quality buckles and the stiffness of the straps, it is very difficult to adjust when on the dog especially if they are at all excited about having a harness put on.",

Great for car rides as the handle is big enough to loop a seat belt through and the clip for leash walking is very sturdy. My favorite part is the mesh elastic pouch on the front that you can put dog tags into- prevents jingle! The only reason for 4 stars is because he can slip himself out of it if he tries hard enough. He has to be pulling away from it (with head toward the leash holder) for that to happen. Other than that it's awesome.",

I like the beefiness of it but my dog can't talk, so I don't know if she likes it, LOL. I will continue using it until she complains about the weight.

We\u2019ve had it for a week and are very pleased with it. We training our puppy to walk on a leash and just a dog collar wasn\u2019t working well. This is comfortable for her and is somewhat easy to put on. I would prefer if the strap that goes around the neck had a clip like I saw on the video but maybe that is for a different size than we purchased.",

As dogs feel more comfortable with things they know are theirs, it is good to have a harness that is going to last! I would buy from this seller again.",

When the leash is attached to the front of the harness, it has a tendency to move or slide more than it should to control her forward motion. If I tighten it enough to prevent it from sliding, it won't fit over her head, It is very well made and seems to be a comfortable fit, and the reflectivity is good when walking at night. Maybe my dog needs therapy to control her pulling?",

Dogs don't get tangled in the leash and it works great for dogs who pull. Wonderful product and well worth the few extra dollars.",

So, tried the medium on the Boston and I can adjust it to fit, but it doesn\u2019t stay... by the end of a walk she can get right out of it! Bad product!

We also like that you can adjust the harness if the dog sheds a lot and body size changes (we have a rough collie who blows her coat three times a year).",
