He has consistently been using this now for over a week and the alarm simply does not sound, through some simple Googling, it appears this is common. Super annoying though because in one week he was late twice. Not impressed by the purchase.",

What I don`t like is the picture quality, especially when taking night photos. It`s kinda poor. Plus the audio is not loud at all when watching videos or listening to music. You also can`t move apps to a sd card, only video, music and your photos which is very disappointing. All and all, it`s a good phone for what it`s worth.",

Personaly, the screen is plastic, which is nice for someone like me who seems to enjoy dropping their phone. Worst thing that has happend to it from 5 feet, is the battery falling out. Runs the newest version of andriod, so in theory it should be up to date for a while. I would highly reccomend this phone",

Screen has a nice crisp bright look to it and streaming videos look nice on it. I was streaming WWE network and it looked almost as good as it does on my tv which is also lg. The complaints about the Apps to SD isn't really a problem because all you have to do is search and there are plenty of videos online that show you how to fix it. Another good lg product that is reasonably priced.",
