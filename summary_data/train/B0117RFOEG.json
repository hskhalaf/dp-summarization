I have run on an elliptical, lifted weights, and run outside with them 2-3 times a week since March 22 when I began using them. I've had other BOSE earbuds before that lasted for more than a year, so its a real shock that these died so quickly. Very disappointing.",

This is my 3rd one, and I am tired and will not BUY another Bose until the wire quality is not improved. I am sorry but when someone buy a earphone for $120+ that person can expect that the thing will be a part of his everyday life and it will last long. I don't expect it to last a lifetime though. I have tried to replace the cable in earlier one but the sound quality was not the same after replacing the cable. I wanted to add photos, but it's not being added.",

The mic seems to be clear and does not have much echo. These will let a lot of outside noise in, as they do not seal in your ear canal, they just sit outside it. I actually like this, as it helps you be more aware when you use them outside.",

The highs are very tinny and the base is nonexistent. You need to turn up the volume to a dangerous level before you can get decent sound quality out of them. Compare to a set of disposable earbuds you get at the gym. The fact that Bose has the nerve to charge $99 for this quality of earbuds is a joke.",

Headphones still sound great but the controls are a must have for me since I use this alone on runs/walks and easy access to make an emergency call is not something I'm willing to compromise on.",
