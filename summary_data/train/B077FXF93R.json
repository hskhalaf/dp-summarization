There are a ton of parts that came with it, witch makes me think it can do so much more than what I used it for. It allows you to drill holes at just about any angle, witch worked for me as I wanted to countersink quite a few seconds, I am going to have to experiment with all the attachments to see what this kit can really do. Overall very satisfied with my purchase.",

      "text": "I have not used the Kreg system but after easily and successfully finishing a fine birch piece of furniture, and paying much less for this tool, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The jig has a steel sleeve that guides the drill bit perfectly, the bit itself also made well and went through the birch with ease, it left a crisp clean cut. There is a learning curve, I practiced on many pieces of solid wood and plywood in various thicknesses. The instructions are not in English but if you're a craftsman, it's pretty self-explanatory.",

Quick change on thickness with snap in gauges. Minuses A. Instructions in Chinese and worthy only of fire starter. Thank goodness for YouTube video . B. Driver and Screws are Phillips instead of #2 Robertson. ( square ) C. Plastic hole fillers are a joke.",

Well engineered and solidly constructed, this is the kit to get you started. This set with the bonus clamp is the best deal out there. You could make do with your own clamp, but this one makes it quick and easy. All accessories and even the case is well designed to help you set up the depth clamp on the bit. The only minor complaint is that the case should be big enough to also hold the clamp. Overall a great tool, great quality!",
