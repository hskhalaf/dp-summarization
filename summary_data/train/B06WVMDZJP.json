      "text": "This board is so beautiful I didn't want to cut on top of it. However, after holding off for a couple of days, my significant other stepped in. We've only had it for a short time, so i can't speak long term, but thus far it is seriously preforming beyond our expectations. I will add that weight wise it is heavy. I need both hands in order to pick it up. This isn't a criticism. If anything, it speaks of how solidly put together it is. It will definitely be gracing our holiday table. The significant other particularly likes the grooves for catching juices. For anyone that has cooking aficionados in their lives, this would make an awesome gift.",

      "text": "I was skeptical about this, as I've had a lot of bad cutting board experiences in my life. This one, I'm happy to say, exceeded my expectations. It's big enough to handle all our everyday cutting and chopping. I like having one full side to use for veggies, and the other side with liquid channel around the perimeter for meats. This thing has a really nice finish to it, which holds up to daily use. It's heavy, so nice and stable when in use. I recommend this board to anyone!",
