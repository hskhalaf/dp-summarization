The only downside is that the pegs are super slippery, so coats have a problem staying on. It's an easy fix though; head to home depot (or Amazon) and spend $4 on white or clear non slip stickers for the bathtub. Cut them up and stick them around the pegs. Voila, problem solved. All my coats stay on now.",

      "text": "What I mean by the title is this. The spacing of the pegs are too close together, and they don't taper or anything on the ends. Therefore, if you try to put heavy/thick coats on this rack, they seem to push each other off. Many times when I come home, I find a jacket or two on the floor. The way to prevent this is to put jackets on every other peg which kind of defeats the purpose of having a rack with this many pegs. My suggestion is if you\u2019re planning on using this for winter coats, look elsewhere.",

This holds our shoes plush to the wall, and is an awesome use of space. I would say that this is nice looking, good quality, and EASY to install.
