And they're smaller than what I had expected which is actually a good thing as I live in an apartment. I'm 5' 11\" with what I would say are normal sized hands and they fit inside the bars perfectly.

It is so convenient to be able to change your weights without having a bunch of different sets sitting all around your living room. They are also really easy to change from one weight to the next, simply just pull out the pin and put it back in the other size. If using workout DVDs and they have you using just one weight, it is a little awkward to hold but you learn to figure it out.",

For me the 3lb increments are much better than the 5. It does take some time getting used to......be patient while inserting the pin handle so it doesn't go in crooked and make sure you push it all the way. Weights can only be adjusted (successfully) on a flat surface. Love love LOVE them.",

Pros: - cheap - nice handle, good grip, no slip - compact when compared to traditional free weights - adjustable with 3 lbs increment - once the pin is in it feels secure, no problem with falling out - quiet; a little bit crackling noise but less than I anticipated Cons: - sometimes the pin goes in the wrong way, not a biggie but you have to be careful",

All the other brands force you to lift the long ENTIRE Frame either empty or with the selected amount of the weight on them. They are much longer by design. These do not work that way. We find these much shorter and easy to use and for us, the most convenient. We recommend these to everyone. We are very senior citizens and appreciate the excellent design. Again, Only the selected weight is added to the handles; The remainder of weights remain on the floor where they belong. Excellent product. ANS",

The weights also do shift slightly depending on the exercise and it is a little difficult to grab one dumbbel with 2 hands for certain exercises. I do like the space saving purpose of them and they have a neat finished look. They serve the purpose but just fell a little short of what I was expecting.",

    "title": "PowerBlock Sport 24 Adjustable Dumbbell, 24 lbs (Pack of 2)",
    "description": "PowerBlock sport 24 adjustable dumbbell replaces 8 pairs of dumbbells in the space of just 1 pair. Sport 24 has a weight range of 3-24 lbs. Per hand in 3 lb. increments, replacing 216 lbs. of free weights. Compact design keeps workout space neat & organized. Weight changes take just seconds using a selector pin much like a weight stack machine at the gym. Selector Pin: Simple and efficient. Insert the magnetic polypropylene pin into the slot to select the desired weight. The pin has a 500 lbs. max load. Auto Lock: EXP models have an 'Auto-Lock' to make micro adjustments by reducing the handle weight by 2.5 or 5 lbs. The two 2.5 lbs. inside the tubes at the base of the handle can be removed by pulling on the lever. Bands on the side rails show the weight of the dumbbell selected with the pin. The pin covers the band/rail that's been selected to easily show what the weight is.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nThe only dumbbell system that can expand to meet your strength needs, PowerBlock dumbbells are the most versatile and effective exercise tool ever developed for strength training. PowerBlocks work intuitively. Rather than requiring you to buy a room full of dumbbells, PowerBlocks act just like a weight stack at the gym, with a weight handle that fits inside the first weight, which fits inside the second, which fits inside the third, etc. When you want to change weights, you simply move the weight selector pin into the appropriate slot and you're set. As you lift the core, all the weights above the selector pin are lifted at the same time, turning your 3-pound dumbbell into a 6-pound dumbbell, or your 6-pound dumbbell into a 12-pound dumbbell. Not only is the system remarkably easy to use, but it's also cost- and space-efficient, as a single pair of dumbbells can do the work of dozens. \n\n This pair of SportBlock 24x3 dumbbells, for instance, adjusts from 3 to 24 pounds in 3-pound increments (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 pounds), in effect doing the job of 16 individual weights. Even better, the weights are more compact and balanced than traditional dumbbells, with a padded handle that protects people with weak wrists. Best of all, the free weights are terrific whether you're trying to build muscle mass, firm and tone your physique, or get rid of unwanted body fat. The SportBlock set offers a maximum weight of 24 pounds per hand and carries a limited 10-year warranty.",
