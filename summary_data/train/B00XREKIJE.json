I would not give it that if I had a choice. I bought one last year and it is still working, but now I am looking at a different brand and a larger size before I loose any more information that I have stored on my old one. It is bad enough that I have lost the info on the newer one! Very dissatisfied with this!",

There are little nubs/feet on the bottom. Comes with a USB 3.0 cord for transferring files that is compatible with USB 2.0. When using the 3.0, files are moved pretty fast.

Despite getting bumped around in my bag a fair bit, this has stood up well to my moves and last better than any portable hard drive I've had to date. The small physical size makes it easy to travel with, which is a huge plus for me, and the large storage capacity meant I could take reminders of home while also saving my research.
