On a side note, it is 5/18/2016, and I am adding this because I have received, I don't know how many umpteen questions asking if this will fit a specific model car. This radio is an aftermarket radio. So unless it specifically states that it will not fit your car, it will more than likely fit your car. Also, if you have to ask me if it will fit a specific model car, you probably shouldn't be installing it yourself. Cheers!",

You can swap it in and out if you want to sell it with the original radio.
