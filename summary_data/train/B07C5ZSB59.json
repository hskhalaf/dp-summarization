She carries a bazillion dolls, stuffed animals, even a mini dachshund for a little stint in the house (It is NOT designed to hold a lot of weight.. I would say 10lbs maximum, fyi). The little boys will play with it too. It has been run and rammed and still seems to be in very good shape. It does well on sidewalks outside. This gift was a hit. I would recommend it if looking for a toy carriage!",

Its not only cute, it has great quality fabric, wheels, and frame. There is plenty of room for 2 babies, stuffed animals, etc. Best of all, it smoothly and effortlessly moves in any direction and pivots like a dream. Wish I had a real size stroller that moved that easily! The only hesitation I would have for purchasing is if your child is still learning to walk, this stroller might move to quickly for them.",
