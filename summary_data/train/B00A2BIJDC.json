    "description": "The Android based LG Spectrum smartphone allows you to multitask smoothly with high-end applications. With a 4.7-inch screen, the LG Spectrum 2 lets you comfortably watch movies and videos. Built with 16 GB internal memory and a microSD card slot that can support expandable memory, this smartphone provides ample storage space for all your digital files. Moreover, integrated with an 8 MP rear camera along with a 1.3 MP front-facing camera, clicking pictures and video calling is a hassle-free experience with this device. Equipped with quadband GSM and WCDMA modes, this smartphone is enabled for international use. This phone also offers access to thousands of apps, games, movies, books, and music on Google's Play Store.\n\n\n\n\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\n\n\n\n(view larger). \n\n(view larger). LG SPECTRUM 2\nAT A GLANCE:\n * 3G/4G LTE connectivity\n   \n   \n * Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich)\n   \n   \n * 1.5 GHz dual-core processor\n   \n   \n * 4.7-inch True HD AH-IPS screen (1280 x 720 pixels)\n   \n   \n * Dual cameras - eight MP camera with HD 1080p video capture, 1.3 megapixel front-facing\n   \n   \n * 16 GB (formatted capacity is less) ROM, one GB RAM\n   \n   \n * NFC technology\n   \n   \n * 2,150 mAh battery and wireless charging battery cover included\n   \n   \n * Corporate/personal e-mail\n\nThe LG Spectrum 2 was built for entertaining and impressing with its deep array of features, Android 4.0 platform, and full Google integration. Its large, 4.7-inch True HD screen delivers every detail of your favorite film and makes it easier for you to see your display at various angles with natural color and 550 NIT brightness. Record high-quality videos with up to three times zoom and customizable brightness, backgrounds, and color effects. QuickMemo is another easy-to-use feature of the LG Spectrum 2. Mark up your screen with notes or drawings using QuickMemo then share your annotated maps, sites and photos with friends. Experience the full range of features from Android Beam to Video Wiz. \n\nA TRULY WIRELESS EXPERIENCE \nBreak free from charging cables with the Wireless Charging Battery Cover (included). Also share videos, HD video, games, or other content wirelessly to larger devices via SmartShare (media sharing via DLNA). The NFC hardware in the LG Spectrum 2 makes pairing a simple process: just tap two devices together. Another wireless feature is the LG Tag+ sticker, which allows you to activate different phone modes with just a tap of your phone. For business, securely connect to your corporate network using LG\u2019s built-in, multi-headed Virtual Private Network (VPN). \n\nLG TAG+ ORGANIZATION\n The Tag+ can be attached to various surfaces including a bedside table, on the desk at an office, or in the kitchen at home, and then set to activate certain on-device modes. For example: after being swiped by the bedside table and put into night mode, Spectrum 2 could automatically switch off radio reception. In the morning, a swipe across the tag in the kitchen would automatically turn on Wi-Fi and launch a weather app or RSS feed. When in the office, the phone could be swiped across the tag and launch any business-specific apps and work e-mail. The Tag+ stickers are user-programmable and spill resistant. \n\nANDROID BEAM\nShare info with other smartphones faster than ever. Beam allows you to share contacts, YouTube videos, maps, webpages and more by simply touching two phones together. You can share directions by bringing up the map, tapping the devices together and hitting send.\n\nTHE LATEST IN DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY \nNever miss a shot with the dual-facing, high-quality cameras. Take great photos with the rear-facing, eight-megapixel camera, even when your subjects are moving. The camera is equipped with autofocus and LED flash. With the Time Catch Shot feature, your camera takes two pictures just before you tap the shutter and one after. Also shoot amazing panoramic scenes with Intelligent Panorama. With Voice Shot, just say \u201ccheese\u201d to easily take your self-portrait with the 1.3-megapixel front-facing camera. Another professional-grade feature is Continuous Shot, which lets you automatically take six pictures in quick succession after you press the shutter. Other features also include an advanced image editor that lets you crop, rotate, add effects, and more. \n\nQUICKMEMO FEATURE\nNever miss a note with the LG Mach\u2019s easy-to-use QuickMemo feature. Capture any screen on your phone and instantly draw, write, or take notes right there. No need to waste time searching for and launching another application. Take instant notes that are easy to share. \n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\n LG Spectrum 2; Standard Li-Ion Battery; Wireless Charging Battery Cover; Wall/USB Charger; Two LG Tag+ Stickers; Product Safety & Warranty Guide; Quick Reference Guide; Global Support Brochure \n\nVITAL STATISTICS\nThe LG Spectrum 2 measures 5.31 x 2.69 x .36 inches and weighs 5.16 ounces. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVERIZON WIRELESS 4G LTE NETWORK\nThe Verizon Wireless 4G LTE network allows you to download photos, apps, and games in seconds and entire movies in minutes. LTE (or Long Term Evolution) provides significantly increased upload and download speeds over 3G networks, as well as significantly reduced latency (or lag time). Verizon Wireless expects 4G LTE average data rates to be 5-12 megabits per second (Mbps) on the downlink and 2-5 Mbps on the uplink in real-world, loaded network environments.\n\nWith these blazing fast speeds, you'll be able to stream HD movies without the annoyance of constant pauses to buffer the video stream--as well as quickly download HD-quality movies right to your phone in minutes. Additionally, you'll be able to download a new song file in about 4 seconds or upload a photo to your favorite social networking site in about 6 seconds.\n\nThe Verizon Wireless 4G LTE mobile broadband network will also redefine the mobile office for business users. Business applications that used to require wired networks will be untethered forever, allowing you maximized productivity and efficiency while you're out of the confines of your office. Enhanced security lets you tap into most VPN networks with less waiting, and faster responsiveness enables you to upload 10 MB presentations back to your team in less than 25 seconds.\n\nIn areas serviced only by 3G, you can expect download speeds of 600 Kbps to 1.4 Mbps and upload speeds of 500 to 800 Kbps in Mobile Broadband coverage area.\n\nVERIZON WIRELESS SERVICES\nBackup Assistant: This complimentary service automatically back up your mobile contacts to your online address book. If your phone is lost, stolen, or damaged, or you decide to upgrade, easily restore your saved address book to your new phone. You can also add, delete, edit, and print your contacts online and send the changes to your mobile phone. There are no subscription fees for the service.\n\nVZ Navigator Capable: With this GPS-enabled phone, you'll be able to access the Verizon Wireless VZ Navigator service (additional charges applicable) for voice-prompted turn-by-turn directions, heads-up alerts, local search of nearly 14 million points of interest in the US (such as landmarks, restaurants and ATMs), and detailed color maps.\n\nVisual Voice Mail: This innovative service enables you to delete, reply, and forward voice mail messages without having to listen to prior messages or voice instructions. Visual Voice Mail is the ideal tool for the busy mobile professional who may need to prioritize which messages he or she listens to first. Features include on-screen access to voice mail message status, save up to 40 messages for 40 days (or archive permanently), create up to 10 different caller ID-based greetings, and reply via call back, text or even voice mail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANDROID ICE CREAM SANDWICH OPERATING SYSTEM\nThis phone runs the Android 4.0.4 operating system (dubbed Ice Cream Sandwich), which adds powerful new ways of communicating and sharing while improving on the best Android features: easy multitasking, rich notifications, customizable home screens, resizable widgets, and more.\n\nThe updated Ice Cream Sandwich interface features an onscreen navigation bar that replaces the hardware buttons for Back, Home, and Menu found with older Android-powered phones. And with Google+ integration, you can video chat with groups of up to 9 friends as well as easily upload and share photos and videos. Other features include:\n\nFace Unlock\nYou can now unlock your phone with just your face using the Face Unlock option. It takes advantage of the front-facing camera and state-of-the-art facial recognition technology to register a face during setup and then to recognize it again when unlocking the device. Just hold your phone in front of your face to unlock (or use a backup PIN).\n\nAnd the lock screen now lets you do more without unlocking. From the slide lock screen, you can jump directly to the camera for a picture or pull down the notifications window to check for messages. When listening to music, you can even manage music tracks and see album art.\n\nHome Screen Folders\nQuickly access related apps right from the home screen by organizing apps and shortcuts into folders--just drag one app onto another to create a folder.\n\nMultitasking\nMultitasking is even easier and more visual in Android 4.0.4. The Recent Apps button lets you jump instantly from one task to another using the list in the System Bar. The list pops up to show thumbnail images of apps used recently--tapping a thumbnail switches to the app.\n\nVoice Input\nThe new voice engine in Android 4.0.4 lets you dictate the text you want, for as long as you want, using the language you want.
