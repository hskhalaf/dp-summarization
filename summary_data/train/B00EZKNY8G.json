Biggest reason for switching and staying this long has been that it is not very intrusive and does not consume resources and thus slow down the computer. This is the second time i bought from Amazon. Make sure you install it just when your subscription/ coverage is about to end. Otherwise you lose the remaining portion of your existing coverage. I don't recall it was like this the last time i purchased from Amazon. Upon contacting Webroot, I didn't receive any credit/recourse.",

All this is done in the background while you are performing other tasks. It is reasonable the first time installed, however, if you renew the 2nd year the price doubles! I chose to repurchase the download again and reinstall the product. Difficult to do, but it works. My bank also recommended it. I hope this has been helpful.",

But the reviewers that actually test this product independently find it is one of the best out there. Also Webroot is fast in its scanning and has the smallest footprint on the PC.

I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't so difficult to figure out how to deal with this inconvenience. They should put in an option or make it easier to find the fix.",

What I like most about this product is that the computer doesn't seem to have slowed down at all and I really don't even think about it being there because it runs seamlessly in the background and doesn't pop up constantly.",

I never liked McAfee, even when it came for free on computers and I'm not trusting my internet security to a company based in Moscow (Kaspersky).",
