The directions were clear to follow and it was fun to make. It has to sit for 3 weeks to brew but we don't mind. The experience of making it was worth it. (It comes with two breweing extracts so its totally worth the price). All we had to buy was a pitcher, a pot, and 3 gallons of water. Everything else comes in the box",

It appears many of the tops that came with the bottle failed to seal correctly. (And yes, we did them all the same). I will order another round of bottle tops and see if the next batch comes out better.",

The 2 gallon batch size is just right for beginners. I like that I don\u2019t have to drink or find something to do with 5 gallons of beer before I experiment with another batch. Also, own recipies are turning out better than the mr beer extracts, but the equipment is still good. Of note, the seal around the spigot leaked for me on my second batch. Had to sand down the plastic on the keg some, but that allowed it to seal for my next 4 batches and counting.",

I eventualy found some cheese wax. it accualy sealed it! if you have a boken sprout use soft wax. overall, this was a fun proccese to make.

I've made a few batches, and when I stick to the book they turn out pretty nice. I got a little creative with my October batch and that was fun as well. I think I'm going to try for a more traditional set up in a few months, but I'll keep this handy to make some secondary quick brews. My goal is to stop buying beer from the store (with a couple seasonal exceptions).",
