Of course it was on the top of the chair where you can\u2019t hide it with the cushion. That is why I\u2019m giving it 3 stars. It was about a 2 hour job to put it together with 2 people and it was not hard at all.",

The pads are very pretty, but poorly made and already tired after about a month of light usage. We had a light rain four days ago and the pads are still completely soaked. Suggest you consider the pads as short term and look for something nicer. I suspect this set will last a year or two, but not much longer. Typical Chinese quality.",

Not sure who is running the quality control for this company but that's a pretty big fail in my book. Tried to call CS at the number provided but they were closed. I'll update review if/when I receive the hardware but this may have to be returned if the company doesn't come through quickly because I needed the set for labor day weekend.",

Then noticed parts missing, and minor parts bent. Also, the top did not lay flat. I put a level on it and there was about a one inch bow in one side. The set looks nice, but too many problems with this one. You may have a better experience and maybe I just got a bad one.",
