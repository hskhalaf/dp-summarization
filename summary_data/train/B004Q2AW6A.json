We purchased this design for the brand, and just as important, the handles on the larger dishes. We have not been disappointed, using the glass handles, it is easy to place the dish in-and-out of the oven, back and forth to the table, and just as important to me...easy cleanup, without breaking the glass. Also, the smaller dishes have nice edges that are easy to handle, with out loosing your grip. I recommend this set.",

The round bowls are fine but the rectangular ones need to go back to the drawing board. The lids for the Easy Grab dishes either fit loosely or literally pop off the dish within 15-20 seconds. I will be submitting a video review of this happening very soon. Pathetic product. Do not buy it if you are expecting the usual Pyrex quality. On top of the poor performance of the product, Pyrex has chosen to ignore my inquiries about correcting the problem.",

The lids fit nice and snug but are not air-tight. I would highly recommend. Lots of quality pieces at a very reasonable price.",

      "text": "...as you would expect from Pyrex. The lids of the round bowls are great too, hold everything in nicely. The lids on the rectangular dishes are not so great. Those dishes are very handy with their handles, but the lids are not tight, they pop off easily. Consider those lids one step above a sheet of aluminum foil. The good news is you can stack other (light) things on top of those lids when you need the space in the fridge, but if you tilt them over too far they're going to drip.",

    "description": "Size:19-Piece\n\nPYREX EASY GRAB 19-PIECE CLEAR GLASS BAKE SET\nSince 1915, experienced cooks and beginners alike have reached for Pyrex glassware products. It all started with our glass bakeware - loved for generations because it's affordable, durable, odor and stain proof, and great for cooking, serving and storing. Since then, new favorites have joined old standbys. The Pyrex line now includes products for the entire kitchen, including pots and pans, metal bakeware, and kitchen tools and gadgets.
