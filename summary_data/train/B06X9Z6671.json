The blade is so smooth and sharp that it was easy to cut through veggies, meat and bread. Giving you the choice of four/five knives (can\u2019t really remember and I\u2019m in bed hahah) it helps and with the price you can\u2019t beat a good set of knives and aesthetically pleasing as well.

Ok, I admit these aren't professional chef standard, by any means, but you'd have to pay AT LEAST triple the price of this whole set just to get 1 chef quality knife!!
