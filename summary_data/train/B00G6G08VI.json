      "text": "I had the very first of these the TF101 and that was the dogs dangly bits! :-) I was dissapointed with this however. Although it is slimmer and lighter and supposed to be much faster than the other one, I found that it seemed very FLIMSY! I have also some concerns about the screen. There seems to be slight gaps at the edges where it seems to not be properly joined. There a number of posts on the web about random screen cracks. I suspects it is due the flex described above. Don't get me wrong I love this product, but it is let down by the build quality.",

      "text": "The faster processor and extra RAM really transform this \"transformer\" after the tf700t. Stuff just happens without the lag of the previous model. The extra battery in the keyboard helps out if you are away from power point. On my long distance walks such as Offa's Dyke trail, the SD card slot in the keyboard takes the card from my camera and allows me to back up and review the days pix. At less than \u00a3300 it is a bargain.",

The later models of this tablet were cheaper in price and quality and the spec and screen quality was reduced. I am very happy with this and the quality is awesome. So happy I finally got an Android tablet now.",

I am currently negotiating with Amazon on a return. Please do not buy. You will be disappointed after a couple of weeks when the shoddy docking station fails.",

The digitizer is then partially unresponsive. I was told to do a factory reset to cure it! Well, guess what - that had no effect. They won't replace it, but insist on repair instead. The hinge is also quite wobbly, but so was my old TF101 and it didn't give me any trouble. I've been a loyal ASUS customer for years, Their offhand attitude to a clear manufacturing defect mean I won't be buying from ASUS again and I won't be recommending this otherwise excellent tablet to anyone.",
