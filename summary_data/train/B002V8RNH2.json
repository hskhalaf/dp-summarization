      "title": "Impressed with  Hamilton Beach 10 Cup Food Processor",
      "text": "Very impressed with this product. Previously had a Cuisinart food processor, but after 10+years it was time to be replaced. I was hesitant to go with another brand, but very happy I did. The 10cup bowl is a great size for my family of 6, and the motor is much quieter than my old Cuisinart's. It delivers on what the product promises (e.g., chop, mix, grate, shred), as well as being very easy to clean and store.",

Replaced 14cup ham beach \"big mouth\" food processor after 5yrs avg use. 10 cup is a good size for normal family of 4 cooking needs. Smaller foot print, plus this lid stores inside the bowl.

The lid is molded in a way that it's easy to rinse between recipes. Other machines have several grooves and other nonsense which make the water splash up - not fun. This is the second model I have owned. The first lasted for more than 4 years, with daily use during the past 2 years. If you are a regular user or one that occasionally dabbles, this is the food processor for you!",
