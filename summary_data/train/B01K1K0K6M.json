Even if your kid isn't tall enough for the upper deck, there is lots of room to play below. 3-4 kids could easily play simultaneously at this water table.

It\u2019s one thing to have your things messed up, it\u2019s a totally different thing to disappoint your child on their birthday.

I had even bigger issues with the second level. Because it gets screwed into the bottom of the table and through the legs for the second level, water ended up getting in the whole base and leaking out the bottom. Poor design. Even with the screws, the top level had some wobble to it.",

It definitely it. To help the water last longer you can put tape over some of the holes so it empties slower. We are still using it this summer.

However, one of the holes to place accessories (such as the \"frog flipper\") is to small to accommodate anything. Additionally, when assembled, the two towers that support the second level of the water table are not particularly solid, even though there are supposed to be two screws holding it in place. Otherwise, it certainly works and is a good value for the money.",

Should last through the next kids at least. Highly recommended!",
