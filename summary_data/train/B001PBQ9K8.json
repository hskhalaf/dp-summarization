If you go cheap on suction cups then you may have to spend on replacing the broken glass or granite stone. It is dangerous product. My fish tank is bottom up without the bottom glass as the tempered glass broke into million pieces. see photos. I lost $1000. My loss that no one will compensate.",

I ran a bead of silicone along the spacer, then had to lay a 3x7 sheet of glass onto it with total precision. After a disastrous effort to lower the glass by hand, resulting in badly smeared silicone, I realized I needed a suction handle to have any shot at making it work. These gripped the glass very well, making it easy to lower slowly and carefully. I'm really pleased with how well they worked, and I can foresee lots of other projects where they'll be useful.",
