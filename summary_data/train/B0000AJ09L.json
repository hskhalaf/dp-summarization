      "text": "After a hospital stay my 92 year old mother needed balance and endurance therapy. The balance beam although hard work for her, has helped a lot. This is worthwhile, I made it a rule she had to use it everyday. I set it up in the hallway and she walked sideways down and back, then rested and walked toe to heel down and back and then rested. Every week she improved, after 6 to 8 weeks she could do the whole routine and only needed to rest at the end of it and was walking around the house with her cane. There were other exercises we did everyday, but I felt this made the most difference.",

It was a fine choice! -- large enough to use two-footed (I can even use it diagonally for a tandem stand, one foot directly in front of the other), and compact enough to store easily. I've also used it as a kneeling pad when cleaning the floor. I got my money's worth!",

Yes, I wobbled, but didn't break the stand. The cost is higher than other cushions I perused, but I'm glad I took the deep dive. Worth every penny and will most assuredly increase my bone density. I feel much stronger and it's weird, but when I walk, my feet are well positioned on the ground ( I never noticed what my feet were doing before Airex. Great investment in my health!",

I originally ordered one of the many cheaper, generic foam pads thinking I'd save a few bucks, only to be royally disappointed in the actual quality/\"feel\" of the pad...it's just not the same. That being said, for some, I would imagine that it wouldn't matter too much, but for myself, having worked with an official airex for so many years, it's hard to accept something that seems to pale in comparison (e.g. feel, movement, pliancy, etc.) to the real deal. At the end of the day this is just one of those products that I feel you sorta just get what you pay for.",

After a year of trying other products and spending more money over the course of that time, then returning them, the price is well worth it. Save time, just spend the extra money up front for this - and finally - useful mat.",

Unfortunately, as a 5'4\" 120 pound petite female, this pad is too long and awkward to use for that purpose. It would also be too awkward for use on my shoulders during traditional barbell work. I will use it for floor work, as it is impressively padded, but I will have to come up with an alternative for hip thrusts.",

I ordered the kiwi/green and received the pink...I'm actually happier with the color choice to be honest so it doesn't bother me at all, but just wanted to let others know the color may change that you order. It's worked great for me and I would order again!",

      "text": "Found out about airex balance pads via my gym. this is a pricey item, but something so simple and effective. Couch potatoes can purchase and when you are watching TV just practice standing on it for balance. Then stand on one foot for balance. lift weights while standing on the pad. Use it to do lunges. I gave one to my exercise buddy and she and her husband fight over sitting on it while watching TV. lol they also use to kneel on when giving their grand daughter a bath. I like it!",

I am eldery and feel that this is a nice test, just to see how I'm doing in the balance department. Good product.",
