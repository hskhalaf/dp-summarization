      "text": "I got this so my dog could lay out in the sun/shade on snowy or hot days off the ground with a little comfort. He lays on other raised beds just fine, but I got this one because it had a canopy. If we go beyond the Velcro flap that does not hold the edges together because it\u2019s too narrow, or the difficulty getting thing together; the quality is poor. The material they used for the bedding and support fabric is like duct tape. Super easy to tear in 1 direction. My dog had it for 10 minutes and ripped it apart into strips. One of the worst product I\u2019ve gotten so far for my dogs.",

It also makes daily cleaning much easier for me- just sweep underneath! No hair collecting around the edges of a soft bed. In addition to being sturdy enough for my dog to play and lay in. It has also held up 100% to nieces & nephews from toddler to preteen putting it through some stress. I keep the tent portion on even indoors so my dog can feel like he has his own lil cave den room- He loves it. Great product and easy to assemble!",
