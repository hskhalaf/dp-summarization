      "text": "I have purchase Estee Lauder loose powder for many years. I was able to buy the translucent which was not designated as any color. For me, this was an excellent product. More recently, they only offered loose Powder in Light or darker shades. I bought the light (and it is not really light for very fair skin) so it looks darker on my skin and not very attractive. This product is expensive and so not to waste it by not using it at all, I bought another product which is light and mix that with the Estee Lauder to lighten it for my use. I would not buy the Estee Lauder again unless they offer the translucent powder again.",

The translucent powder I use is truly colorless so it won\u2019t look to light or too dark with your foundation. And sometimes I just use it over an ultralight, moisturizing tinted sunscreen with a bit of concealer around my eyes and my skin still looks good. I highly recommend it.",
