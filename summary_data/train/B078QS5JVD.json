Now only do I think the design is awful, but it feels like the front of your feet is way too high off the ground. 2) The squeaking of the shoe. The shoe seems to be squeaking every time I take a step. I thought it was a new shoe problem, but it's still there after wearing it intensively for a week.",

I was mildly annoyed at first, but figured that the sound would subside after a week or so of regular use. Nope. Every single step I take sounds like I've attached a man in a latex suit to each foot and with each step, he squeaks. Yearning to be released from his pedal prison.",

I have also found them to be somewhat loud compared to other shoes I've had. I only got these shoes because Nike stopped making the shoes I liked and I ruined those and had to get some new Nikes in a pinch. Not a bad shoe for the price, however they aren't for me.",
