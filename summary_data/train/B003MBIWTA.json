A similar desk bought in a furniture store would be out of reach for me cost-wise. There are just a few minor manufacturing flaws that I can point out, such as some of the knobs are just a bit crooked and you can tell there is a lot of wood putty here and there. But overall, people (including myself) are always impressed when they walk into my home-office and see this beast.",
