However, after 4.5 months, the vinyl plate is already detaching from the rest of the skate, and that's really disappointing. I should have spent the extra money on a better brand. By all means, purchase these if you just have a light skating hobby. Don't buy these if you're serious about jamming and blocking.",

Only thing you may wanna consider down the road after some time in them are the bearings. Other than that great skates",

After more than 20 hours of skating they still look new and none of the components have broken or bent. I would recommend these skates.",

I can\u2019t tell you how many times I nearly fell trying to tweak the balance on them. The stops also twist and unscrew while you slow down about half the time.
