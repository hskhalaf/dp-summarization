By hand, no dishwasher, gently. We love it! However, it has recently stopped working. We\u2019ve replaced the batteries several times with no response from the aerator. It simply does not turn on. For the price, I was hoping for some sort of recourse or warranty. I see from the manual there is a one year warranty only. Is there anything else that can be worked out? Or is it your expectation that for $90-ish dollars we should only expect the unit to work for one year? I\u2019d love a response, either way.",

Unfortunately, my first one broke a few months in, which I thought was a fluke, but then my second one broke as well. As much as I love this, it is not worth $100 for it to end up breaking after a few months.",
