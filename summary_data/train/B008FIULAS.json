The straps all fit great and tighten up well and all in all the wife and I installed it in about 20 minutes. One tip I saw online is to use pool noodles cut and put over the extruding gutter system so it wont puncture the cover. Only concern I have is durability/longevity but I will update when this thing rips or gives up the ghost.",

      "text": "Well just installed the cover last weekend and I have to say it was easier than I thought it was going to be. It took two of us to put it on. The quality I would have to say is good and the straps to tie it down are very good. We will see how it holds up thru the winter so I might need to write another review at that time. But for now I would highly recommend it.",

Only downfall is they should have put zippers on both sides of cover so slides could be put out for access to interior.",
