These shoes, although admittedly uncomfortable at first, broke in quickly and are like walking on a couch. Incredibly comfy. They are great for going out on a warm day and are a fantastic alternative to slippers around the house. Being water proof, I can take them into the showers when I go camping, or outside when washing the car. These shoes are incredibly durable and I'll be sure to purchase a new pair once these ones wear out. I can't get enough of these sandals!",

The first time I wore them that piece of material dug into the top of both feet causing cuts. It was so painful I had to buy a replacement pair at the resort. I gave the pair a second try after getting home with the same result. It wasn\u2019t because of the fit being incorrect as they fit perfectly. I wish they had worked out because the footbed is extremely comfortable. Unfortunately I disgarded box with full intentions of keeping them being impressed with the manufacturer and glowing reviews so I\u2019m stuck with them.",

Think after wearing them for awhile, the leather in-toe strap soften up and it became more comfortable. Don't know if this was just a minor glitch in this particular sandal.

Actually the rubber on the sole had turned hard with age and made them slippery to walk in, so I upgraded to a new pair. I couldn\u2019t be happier with them! Same amazing comfort, and they arrived in perfect condition right away. After a short break-in, they feel just like my old pair. Love the color, too! I will never wear any other flip flop!",
