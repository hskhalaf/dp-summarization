This product leaves my skin moisturized and nourished without any greasy residue or breakouts the next day. I've been using it for about 4 months now and really do see a difference in the smoothness and feel of my skin. I will absolutely buy it again.",

I\u2019ve dealt with adult acne for years but now I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s because the cheap drug store cleansers and moisturizers abused my skin. Definitely hesitated buying from this company due to the price, but it\u2019s SO worth it! A little bit goes a long way. No smell or dyes used in this moisturizer either.",

    "description": "THE DRUNK ELEPHANT DIFFERENCE\nWith a mission to deliver clinically-effective, clean skincare products formulated with both cutting-edge synthetic and natural ingredients, Drunk Elephant knows that every ingredient should directly benefit the health of your skin or the safety of the formulation. \n\n PROTINI POLYPEPTIDE CREAM\nThink of Protini in your Drunk Elephant skincare routine like adding a shot of protein to your smoothie. Abundant with proteins and nutrients, it replenishes and restores your skin back to a strong, healthy state. Protini is formulated at the ideal pH level of 4.0. Apply morning and night to clean, dry skin for a vital dose of protein and replenishing moisture the skin needs to retain its youthful appearance. \n\n NO FRAGRANCE\nAfter carefully balancing the best ingredients available, Drunk Elephant doesn\u2019t have to add anything to mask their natural scents. When you smell their products, you will likely detect nothing but a glycerin base with slight hints of Marula oil, Zinc Oxide, Thermal Mud, Fruit Enzymes, and Vitamins for a refreshing and reassuring scent. \n\n BREAK THE CYCLE\nYour skin is left vulnerable with the overuse of harsh exfoliates, chemical peels, expensive laser treatments, Botox abuse, layered foundations and powders, and chemically-laden beauty creams. There\u2019s nothing wrong with an occasional beneficial beauty splurge here and there (when appropriate), but it can be a vicious cycle that is hard to stop. \n\n COMMITTED TO CLEAN\nDrunk Elephant is committed to using only clean ingredients that either directly benefit the skin\u2019s health, or support the integrity and effectiveness of their formulas. You\u2019ll never find the \u201cSuspicious 6\u201d (Essential Oils, Drying Alcohols, Silicones, Chemical Screens, Fragrances/Dyes and SLS) in their products.",

      "WHAT IT IS FORMULATED TO DO. Protini\u2019s proprietary formula delivers younger, revived-looking skin, almost from the first application. Lines, wrinkles and signs of sun-damage appear reduced; depleted skin feels strengthened and moisturized.",
      "NO QUESTION IN QUALITY. A routine is only as good as its worst product, and a product is only as good as its worst ingredient. Drunk Elephant is dedicated to your internal health and external skin health; \"If there's any DOUBT, it's OUT.\u201d",
      "SENSITIVE VS. SENSITIZED. When skin is exposed to irritants and sensitizers, damage can be imperceptible and cumulative, leaving it in a reactive mode. \"Sensitive\" skin is often just skin that has become sensitized over time by harsh additives",
      "MADE IN THE USA. Drunk Elephant doesn\u2019t take shortcuts or compromise ingredients to save money. They are hands-on and will stay true to their ethos. Their products are designed, tested, and made in the United States. Drunk Elephant is certified cruelty-free, they have never, nor will ever, animal test or allow products to be tested on animals."
