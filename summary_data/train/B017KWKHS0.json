Great battery life, the built-in stand is useful, and the projector is great for meetings. I'm disabled and use the tablet hours on end, so this is critical equipment for me. Oh, the sound is excellent, good volume.",

      "text": "While the tablet's projector is a huge plus and definitely a great feature, the Yoga Tab 3 Pro's software was severely lacking. There was a huge memory leak/problem, leading to the tablet being incapable of opening PowerPoint, Firefox, and Facebook Messenger at the same time, constantly deleting the background apps' information. If you want a portable media device, then this is perfect for it as the image will be crisp and the projector will make for a great time. If you want a tablet to be a tablet that can multiple productive tasks, then this is not what you want.",
