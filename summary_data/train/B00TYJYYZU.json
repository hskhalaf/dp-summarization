      "text": "I have been searching low and high for a good pair of hiking boots. These boots have great support, both around the ankle and arch, the soles are grippy. I customized the fit by using a lacing \"window\" and the heel lock method. I plan on using leukotape to prevent blisters or hot spots. These boots support my feet extremely well with plenty of options for adjustments if needed. I have foot issues (multiple surgeries on left foot, arthritis, plantar fasciitis) so finding the right (and left ha-ha) boot is extremely important to me. Very pleased with my purchase!!",

I had to get the wide size, which fit better than regular - but the soles are very stiff and hurt my arches, too. It really is too bad because they are great looking boots! I'm not sure if I got a bum pair or if my feet just didn't like them, but even so, the fact that the inner layer of tread was showing through after such a short amount of time is disappointing.",

I've only had them for a few months (most shoes give out after 6 for me) but I will update when we get there. There are no signs of the sole coming off or the seams coming apart yet, which is great!",

They are well-made, look like they will be durable, and they look nice, I got the Gargoyle/Damson color combo. They are relatively light, comfortable and a perfect fit.
