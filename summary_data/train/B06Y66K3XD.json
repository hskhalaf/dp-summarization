I am very disappointed as XFX used to be a great brand but now sadly they are a shadow of their former selves. once again avoid at all costs as it will cause a massive headache when return window closes!",

Nightmare, as I needed this urgently as I was working from home and had no on-board graphics! I've since replaced it with a RTX 2070 SUPER, and couldn't be happier.

The two redeeming things about my experience with this graphics card are the customer service from Amazon (which is nothing to do with XFX) and the way the GPU looks. It is a kickass design.",

I'm only dropping 1 star because I probably just got a bad one - solid card otherwise.",
