      "text": "This phone is terrible. It cannot handle any of the OS updates. The issues include programs shutting off in mid-use, significant lag in opening programs and the dreaded \"Unfortunately contacts stopped working\". Contacts is a basic built-in original program and I often have to try opening it 4 or 5 times before it finally works. This phone is a waste. Motorola has made an awful, awful phone. The Samsung Galaxy S3, which is an older phone, handled updates without loosing much of a beat. I don't think that I will ever buy another Motorola product.",

It was so shattered that the glass came out.
