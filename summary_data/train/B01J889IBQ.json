      "text": "I bought this for my twin cousins last June with Keyfit 30 carseats. This has held up well. If you empty EVERYTHING out of your trunk it can go there. I have a RAV4 and it JUST fits. Thankfully the pieces easily slide out, so you can put the frame in first and then the seats. It pushes smooth and has plenty under the seats doe storage. I seperately bought the Mickey bag for bottles/keys etc. It says 34lbs and they mean that, but I can lift it solo.",

Does it take some effort turning tight corners, YES, but with these requirements your not going to get anything better. I LOVED that I didnt need any tools to put it together (everything was clip/snap in place). It has only been a couple weeks but we are pleased with it so far. If issues arise I will update the review. Im happy its not super wide so we can fit through reg doors!",

      "text": "Nice quality, lots of storage. My only complaints: 1. The seats are small. My 2.5 year old is almost too big for the seat and I was hoping to have him in this stroller for at least 2 more years. Wish they had bigger seats or an option to purchase a larger seat as an accessory. 2. It's bulkier (longer) than the UppaBaby Cruz (however, I suppose this allows for more second row leg room than the Cruz) 3. It's difficult to go over bumps in the sidewalk because it is so long (the front end gets heavy and makes it hard to lift when you need to maneuver over a bump in the road).",

All in all highly recommended for families with twins, just make sure you have a big car :)",

      "text": "I bought this stroller back in December. I was worried with 2 babies under 2 that having to invest in a double stroller was a nightmare. I was worried it won't fit in store aisles or in doorways. I was worried it wont fit in the back of my explorer with the third row up. BEST PURCHASE EVER! I regained my freedom with this stroller. It's easy to push, the chairs move like I want. I have an 8 month old and almost 3 yr old. Perfect for naps no matter the age. If you remove the chairs from the actual stroller, it folds tighter, allowing me to put it in my 2016 explorer with the third row up.",

You can feel every tiny rock and crack woth these wheels. Contours if your saving money on the wheels atleast make inflatable tires available as an add on.. otherwise the contours elite beats bumbleride in every way.. you can fit threw all the doors with out folding it, you can have kids face you if you like, its lighter.. but Contours did cheap out on the visers :( uhhh",

Oh, but don't call on a Saturday, because there is no customer service or even an answering system on the weekend. We will see how Contours and Amazon handle this.
