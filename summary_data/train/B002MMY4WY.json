I bought the Kensington Pro wireless keyboard (connects either USB dongle or bluetooth) and prefer it's lower travel more laptop-like keys.

There is a momentary indicator on screen when you change the state of the Caps Lock, but it really gets old having to press the Caps Lock key to display the state of that setting. The keyboard is well made and has a good basic design. It could use a greater \"U\" angle for the key alignment as the very shallow angle currently in use is almost like a straight-line keyboard. I would have given this keyboard 5 stars except for those two deficiencies.",

The keyboard has feet at the head that raise the top of the keyboard if that is better for you. It is for me. I also like that this is a full keyboard with a 10 key number pad. With the number pad, typing numbers is so much faster. Great keyboard for the money.",

One thing I really appreciate is that the INSERT key is set above and away from the BACK key because I type transcripts daily and on most other keyboards, when I use the BACK key, I somehow hit the INSERT key and typing goes into OVERTYPE mode, which is very annoying. This has never happened with this keyboard. I always keep spares of these keyboards not because of mechanical problems but because I hate that the lettering wears off within months to a year at most.",

I think it is the wireless on the mouse, and it pairs with the board, and the computer. I think it is too complicated in the pairing part..",

HOWEVER, recently I have been having an issue with a couple keys, specifically with making the ( and @ symbol. I can type 2 and 9 with little to no issues and can capitalize letters using shift, but after 4 months the keyboard has been having issues consistenly doing shift+2 and shift +9. The 2 key has been increasingly also failing to work. It sounds like some reviewers the keyboard works wonderfully for a couple years, so I wouldn't outright not recommend it as it was otherwise fantastic.",

That said, the ergonomics work well. The wrist cushion is comfortable. The overall quality is quite good.",
