Stretching it higher to leave the bottom plug would make this perfect so far with me. Very easy connection and I've used all brands of connecting devices.

I really regret buying into their smart plug \"ecosystem,\" and if this is your first \"smart home\" device, I strongly advise you to stay away. My next smart plug definitely will not be a TP-Link one. Save yourself the trouble and look into any of the hundreds of other smart plugs.",

      "text": "I shopped around online quite a bit before buying this and am very happy with my choice. I'm using it to control a string of lights in the rafters of my backyard covered patio. Set up and link with Alexa was very easy. I know some complained about staying connected but this outlet is 50 feet away from my house with the router on the second floor and I've had no issues. Make sure you follow the directions in setting up the app. You need to turn on remote access in order to control through Alexa. Given how well it works I'll probably purchase more for other areas in my home now I know the range is so good.",
