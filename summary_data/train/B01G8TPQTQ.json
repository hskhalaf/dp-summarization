In Chicagoland weather it doesn't keep me completely warm but I couldn't expect it to in such gruesome temperatures. Warms up in probably 15 seconds. GREAT for keeping warm in a cold house. Once I outgrow this one and it needs to be replaced I'll be coming right back here. -1 star for size inaccuracy, I'm easily a medium and after seeing others reporting that it runs small, decided to order a large. It fits perfectly, so I would DEFINITELY recommend ordering one size above what you actually are.",

Heater worked for a month and quickly cooled down and is barely luke warm. Heater would never restart unless I unplugged the unit from the jacket and plugged it back in. I ran tests on the pack to find a good battery output but very high resistance in the heater coils. I don't believe this batt is a matched unit for the coils. I would need to see the design specs. Anyway the jacket is going to good will and next winter i will be purchasing something much better.",

When I tried to reply to the email it just sent it back to me. When I tried to reply through amazon the option was removed. The answer to Lynn question is that the Jacket never heats up. Yes the battery still haves power when the jacket quits heating because the jacket never heats. When we lay the jacket down flatly it never heats up.",

I have put books on it at night, rolled it down flat and the collar just stays popped up. It is irritating. The only reason I did not give it 5 starts.",

The only strange thing to get used to as a man is the the sipper catch (pull) is on the left, not the right. No big deal.
