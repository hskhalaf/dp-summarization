Whipping up my coffee the bottom comes off in 2 pieces, the base that attaches to the wand and the flat corrugated blender. IMO its needs to be a spot weld or a better press together. The return period is over. I'm done. This was my last unfortunately because I really like it and the stand for your kitchen counter.",

That's an impressive commitment to quality.) They \"made an exception\" for me, though, and sent me a replacement, which spins off-center about 50% of the time (noisier, less effective and bad for the motor/product). It does burn through batteries like a rock star, though, so there's that. So, no\u2014do not recommend and will not buy again.",

The quality of this new frother is not nearly as good as the first one. The motor works well but the shaft is not true and the spinner tends to wobble. The manufacturers quality control department needs a bit of help.",

Although this froths as well as the previous one, I find it is rather difficult to operate. One has to really press down hard on the push button to keep the motor going. Even the slighest change in pressure stops the motor. I find this really annoying and am debating if I will write Bonjour to complain about this defect.",
