      "text": "Well, this carrier would have been fine, but my cat is a murderer. Put her in this for maybe 20 min max and the teeny tiny hole she nibbled in the outer mesh suddenly became an epic escape route that she was able to squeeze her whole fluffy body through. The carrier also happens to be a little small for my 10 lbs cat. In its defense, I did take a swatch of the mesh to Petco and compared it to other $45-70 fabric carriers, and it was the exact same material. The carrier is made of quality materials, but it still gets 3 stars because it couldn't contain my floof-monster (who now has a plastic carrier with bars).",

I used it again in January -- the cat escaped by separating the zippers and got all the way to first class from the waaaay back of the plane before a flight attendant caught her. On the return trip, she got out again, this time via a rip she'd made in the mesh, but I was able to catch her after she'd only gotten about five aisles away. I'll be purchasing a new carrier before I travel with her again.",

Great quality seat belt \"like\" nylon strap handle and over the shoulder. Plus it folders down flat for easy storage. Good value.",

I chose to not get sedation for him as I think he will be just fine. I love the mesh sides so he can stare at me as I am driving with those pathetic eyes but the sides are close enough for my big fat 19.5 lb cat to feel comfortable and secure. Great product!",

My cats enjoy playing in it, but it would be great if both ends were open so they could \"tunnel\" through it. Beyond that though, it's very well constructed and sturdy enough for carrying even our larger cat to the vet.

My only complaint is that in order to stay folded up, there's a velcro closure which is located on the bottom of the carrier, with the scratchy side-- meaning, on a carpeted plane floor, the carrier velcros to the floor making it difficult to slide in and out from under the seat.

      "text": "Only my 10 lb cat could fit in this without touching the sides. It\u2019s a zipper close, so if your cat is a bolter, it\u2019s not as easy to shut as your typical hardside carrier before your kitty escape artist makes a break for it. Plus, if the cat if large enough, I have to be wary of catcing their fur with the zipper. So far kitty has not been as calm in this carrier as a hardside carrier. Still, it has the advantges of being lighter, carry-on approved, and I like the shoulder strap for distributing the weight as I haul my furry friend around.",
