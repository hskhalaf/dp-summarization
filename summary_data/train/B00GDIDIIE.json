      "text": "I had to write this review fresh from my first commute with it (on esk8). I've historically never been able to find a helmet that fit and looked right on me. This one fit perfectly (size 59cm), is lightweight, offers plenty of visibility, and looks great (not too bulky, no flashy motocross graphics). The flat black paint is perfect for urban use. Note that the helmet (size L) comes with thick pad inserts. If you're above a 58cm, then replace the pads with the included thinner pad inserts for the best fit. Highly recommended. I would buy this again",

January 23 2020 The visor is incredibly flimsy and broke in two. From falling off the handlebars. My son still uses the helmet. For the price I guess you can\u2019t complain. But wish it would have lasted longer. Update : May 5 with very little use over the the last couple of months, the face mask portion glue has begun Deteriorate leaving the padding falling off of the face mask. This item is not worth the Money",

It takes apart to convert to a half face helmet but the only bad thing is the visor could be a little more sturdy, because it broke in the crash. On the plus side, you can spray paint the broken side of the visor to make it look cool. 10/10 would recommend",

I love how the chin guard can be removed (the screws are part plastic, so you have to be careful with you screwdriver to avoid scraping the head). Wearing with the chin guard during the summer is treacherous so I recommend wearing that during the winter. One problem i have with this is that without the chinguard its a loose fit and I dont have much padding to make it a better fit.",

I was hoping for something I could wear on the weedays (without face guard) and still use to play downhill on the weedends (with face gaurd) Ive bought the helmet and am very impressed. Upon taking it out of the package, it felt light weight.The flat black finish is of quality although it can easily be scratched. It comes with two different size pads so that it fits almost anypnes head. If you dont trust my review, read the over 40 reviews left on the .uk amazon.",
