Also, very long pieces of grass will not get cut as they get bent down, width of cutting blades will pass over, before the grass will stick up again. Figures on how to adjust cutting height were not as helpful as could have been. I agree with other reviewers that the foam grips should be sized for insertion without needing soapy water (as it says in the manual).",
