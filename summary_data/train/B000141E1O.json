The lotion provided is good quality and soothing too. Highly recommend!!!!",

The key to wax strips is pressing hard and tearing fast. At first i wasnt pressing hard enough, once i got over the fear i truly love these. Im not brave enough to shape my brows yet but upper lip and chin i will. Yes theres always tweezing after but like i said, you get that in the salon. Saving some money and like i can do a tiny spot that maybe im too shy to tell my salon girl to wax!!",
