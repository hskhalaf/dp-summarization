It is difficult for a young child to get george back into the box and shut the lid, and it took her awhile to figure out how to turn the crank the right way. It is a toy that needs adult help for awhile. Not my daughter is almost three and she can do it on her own.",

      "text": "We bought this for our one year old and he initially had fun with it. The novelty of Curious George popping-up quickly wore-off. While that in itself doesn't deserve a knock against this product, like other reviewers have said, it's just not worth the money. Aside from no longer being excited by the popping-up, our son figured out in a few days of very infrequent toying with it that he could just press the little latch that holds the lid down to have Curious jump out. Other reviewers have mentioned that it's likely this piece will eventually break, unfortunately I doubt we'll get to that point because our son's simply not that interested in playing with it anymore.",
