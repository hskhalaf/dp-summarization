Although it is not needed, for our own peace of mind, we are working on another way to anchor the ladder to the pool without drilling holes in our metal railing. Our granddaughters have been jumping off the platform into the pool and it has not been an issue. Great purchase.",

Pros: Wide platform is better than most other pool ladders I've seen. Roll guard is a nice feature that works well. Relatively simple setup.",

It's nice and wide and love the solid platform on the top to turn around on. Sure gives me more confidence with how sturdy it is. The mat is the perfect size.

I wasn't sure whether the price for this ladder was justified when I ordered it (almost half the price of the pool!), but it really is sturdy. I'm 220lbs and now my wife feels safe getting in and out of the pool! Worth every cent! Love the product and recommend buying from this company!",
