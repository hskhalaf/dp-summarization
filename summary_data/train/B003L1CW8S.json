Any review I\u2019ve read about sticking, burning, and warping, I assume user error in most cases. These have amazing heat distribution My cook times are less and I typically lower the suggested temp 1/2 a temp since they heat so well. Clean up is easy if you follow suggested cleaning tips. Soak with warm soapy water then clean with a soft sponge. I use Astonish cleaner to shine them like new. I truly can\u2019t say enough amazing things about this set. But it should only be purchased by people who understand how to use or are willing to learn how to use them.",

Otherwise our issues are these: everything sticks to these pans, and I mean everything including bacon, real butter, fake butter, and grilled cheese. They overheat to the point of melting plastic cooking utensils. They are impossible to clean without scraping, which makes the sticking worse. Handwashed or dishwasher they appear stained after just one use. We are returning these because we simply cannot use them.

My husband drinks ice tea by the gallons so I make a big batch of it daily using the larger pot, which has stained the interior even though I clean daily.

      "text": "I love the stainless steel. I previously owned non stick. I did order non stick omelet skillet for more delicate foods. I would have paid more attention to the pans that came with this set. I may have ordered individual pans or a set with less skillets since I ordered the other skillets. I do like the Calphalon quality. On the Calphalon website they offer videos of proper care for your stainless steel that I found helpful. Also pay attention to your quart sizes if you are looking for a large spaghetti pot order it separately.",

Instead, if you want a lid, you have to buy another brand. Outside of that these pans heat very quickly, fire them on low and let them go. I don't use anything higher than 3 unless I am boiling water. Great product!",
