When mixed with my other fire pit glass, it fell to the bottom so I can\u2019t see any of the color anyhow. Largest pieces are maybe a quarter of an inch, which is pretty much useless.

I have nothing negative to say about this product. I did wash the pieces upon arrival, however there was minimal dust in my bag. The one 10 pound bag filled my fire pit, although the lava rocks are still in there also. I was planning to exchange the lava for the glass, however my son got ahead of me and just added the glass to the lava. I have not had a problem with the glass turning black, and we have had a fire each night since my purchase arrived.",

For a barrier, I recycled the metal curtain from a fireplace door set. Works great. Two small bags of lava rock, one metal curtain stretched out tight, then one bag of this fire glass filled my ~4\u201d fire table perfectly with a cost of about $35.",
