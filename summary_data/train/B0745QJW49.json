Folding up & down is literally a \"snap\", with an elastic strap to hold it folded down. Some other reviews have experienced failures with the struts, but so far, mine have behaved well. Just don't rough-house it & it will probably last a long time. UPDATE 2/'18: Mine suffered the strut failure that folks are complaining about. This basket was only used a couple of times a month & then, always with care. There's no way to repair. It's shot. Downgrade to 2 stars!!",

I have 2 of these in my car and one that I use when I walk to the store for a quick grocery run. For anyone that is looking for sustainable alternatives, this fits in perfect.",

They fold up small enough to fit in the car without taking up much space. I liked them so well I purchased a second set of 3 for various usages around the house. Keeps lots of things organized. I wish all colors were the same price. Seems the 'hot' colors are considerably higher priced.",

Long handles. Handy pocket to put your phone and keys in. Love.",

They fold up so they hardly take up any space and since they have an elastic band to keep them closed, they don't pop open when you take them out for a shopping trip.",

One or both sides creep up, so it's not flat unless you put something on top to stop it from unfolding.

It\u2019s also nice that you can fold it, and tuck it away neatly on the side without taking up space. Down side to it is that it\u2019s not made for heavy items. Besides that, I\u2019m so happy with the product.",

The other side looks like it will do the same eventually as well. I didn't even use it on a daily basis, nor did I overload it. I'm extremely disappointed in the quality (durability) of the fabric used. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who wants something to use long-term.",

    "title": "CleverMade SnapBasket Reusable Grocery Shopping Bag - Large Eco-Friendly Durable Collapsible Tote with Reinforced Bottom, Navy/Cream",
    "description": "The Clever Made Snap Basket is a smart, space-saving solution to simplify all of your shopping trips and day-to-day activities for an on-the-go lifestyle. It was designed to help the environment as plastic bags from the grocery store are not eco friendly. These baskets can be used for so much more than grocery shopping too! Both men and women use them for produce at the farmers market, travelling in your car or SUV for weekend road trips, bringing lunch to work, loading up food for a summer BBQ, and in so many other ways. You can even load it full of dirty clothes and take it to the laundromat. Perfect for active moms bringing snacks for sporting events or for college students who take advantage of it being foldable for their small dorm room, apartment or condo. Durable handles can hold heavy loads up to 25 pounds of groceries, books, yoga gear, towels or linens. There are 2 of our patented SnapHinge in each utility tote and you'll love the sound they make when they pop-up and fold down. The checkers and baggers at the grocery store are going to love them too as they don't have to struggle to keep them standing up when you check out. If you're in need of a bag that's portable and can fold flat for compact storage then look no further!",
