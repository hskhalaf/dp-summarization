In fact, I took it off and went back to my 1980's kickstand. Watch the video and you'll see the need for a flat level surface to make it work properly. I could see this being nice if you had a child seat on the front or back and you wanted to park the bike completely upright. But other than that, I'm not sure what problem this solves that a regular kickstand doesn't already handle.",

Unfortunately, my previous double leg stand (which I really liked) no longer had enough clearance when I switched to larger tires. I was hoping this kickstand would work, but I was wrong. The bike was very unstable and fell over several times even when unloaded. Just turning the handlebars the wrong way was enough to make it prone to tipping. I would not recommend this kickstand at all.",

You lift the bike up by the seat, flip down the legs, and rest it solidly on the v-shaped kickstand. It's a lot more balanced that the typical leaning to one side kickstand. The height is adjustable, though I should note that my daughter's tall size Cannondale hybrid was on the lowest setting and the front wheel stays off the ground a little bit. My own medium size Cannondale mountain bike had to go out a few holes. It didn't occur to me that the taller bike would also be lower to the ground. Anyway, solid product, highly recommended.",

This works very well but there is a caveat: Because the body is an aluminum casting, the steel attachment screw, if slightly loose, will chew up the threads in the casting. Eventually the stand will come loose, even falling off the bike. (This happened to me. Fortunately it didn't go through the rear spokes.) The way to prevent this is to use a thread locking compound on the attachment bolt, and check the tightness of the bolt periodically, after every ride if you ride on rough terrain.",

The Beast sits upright, securely balanced. I was concerned the stand would rub the 4\" fat tires, but no worries plenty of clearance. Pedals are OK too, feet have no interference issues on my short test ride. Looks trick, Problem solved!",

A little WD-40 has it folding and unfolding easily. I will say this... mine is adjusted all the way down (shortest leg length) and it is just the correct size. It's a 58 cm frame and the bottom bracket is pretty high... a less-tall frame might have problems with leg length.",

No more bike hitting the ground if the front tire moves! Highly recommended.",

Not only does it provide more stability when supporting my bicycle, but its multi-level feature allows me to service the bicycle more easily (and without inverting, repositioning, etc., it), i.e., clean, oil, and maintain the chain and derailleur, make adjustments, etc. It is also positioned so as not to interfere with the chain, or any cables or hydraulic fluid lines. (Mike Pitch [The Vicious Cycle,West Islip, NY] where I purchased my bicycles, is quite impressed by this kickstand and its versatility.)",
