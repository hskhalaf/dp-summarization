But after three months there are significant structural issues with the frame, the frame integrity on our bed is sub-par. The bed was used by a preteen with no rough play and sometime over the three months of ownership the frame is compromised severely. We are hoping for a positive outcome with customer service, will update review when resolution is determined. Update: No action will be taken. No replacement or refund offered. Three months is the apparent life span of this product. Update 2: Seller has now initiated a replacement with the manufacturer.",

It is very sturdy, not squeeky and wobbly like many metal beds are. Not sure on the trundle yet, as it hasn't been tried out, but everything seems to be of good, solid quality. The 16-year old put it together himself, so not too complicated, although he is good at that type of thing. So far, pretty satisfied overall with this bed.",

Still waiting on the delivery of the twin mattress for the trundle but it only took me a couple hours to put it together and not fully tightening the pieces until it was all put together helped immensely. I saw some people having issues with things not lining up and that wasn\u2019t the case for me. Everything fit perfectly together and is really sturdy. Now I just need to put some bedding on it and spruce it up. The full size with twin trundle is a perfect solution for someone needing to save space in a small room but not wanting to only have a twin bed for guests. Definitely recommend this product!",

As for construction, my bed frame came with detailed instructions that made setting it up a breeze. I probably completed putting the whole thing together in an hour or less. The pieces themselves look nice, too! I would highly recommend this bed frame!",

As far as durability, it's an iffy. The bottom legs that are the supports, don't look that stable. I'm hoping that they don't break anytime soon. The bed itself looks nice when all put together. It's a cheaper item I'd consider as far as bed frames go. I probably wouldn't buy it again, after knowing what I know now. I'd just spend more money and get a better quality item.",

We thought this would be perfect for guests who have kids. The bed came damaged (part of the metal was crushed) with sharp edges that would have been an issue. It was damaged in the factory, not in shipping. It was in a very, very heavy box, and I felt bad for the delivery guy. It really should be in two boxes. Amazon was great about returning the bed. I wish it had worked out.",
