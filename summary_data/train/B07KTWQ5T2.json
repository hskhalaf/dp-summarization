      "verdict": "The overall feedback for the Terrex Two Parley has been positive. This Adidas trail running shoe is praised for its eye-catching looks, the lightweight construction, and the exceptional traction. The use of recycled plastic-based yarns for the upper is also commended. On the other hand, the thin instep construction and the flimsy heel security have become the points of criticism.Fans of neutral running shoes that are for the trails are the target market of the Adidas Terrex Two Parley.",
      "pros": [
        "Several people claim that the forefoot section of the Adidas Terrex Two Parley is wide enough to welcome natural toe-splay",
        "A handful of consumers have noticed that the fabrics of the upper unit are smooth enough to prevent irritation",
        "The outsole unit of this trail running shoe is praised for having a grippy construction that adheres properly to the ground",
        "The aesthetics have been lauded by those who desire a trail companion that is appealing to the eyes",
        "Runners are happy with the environment-friendliness of the Parley Ocean Plastic\u2122 yarns that are used for the upper unit",
        "The midsole unit is deemed sufficiently light and reactive for daily use"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "Some users complain of pressure points near the instep, a phenomenon that is attributed to the thin fabric and its lack of padding",
        "The rear portion of the facade is wrinkly and not very secure, according to a few testers"

      "text": "I finally found a replacement for my Nike FSB chukka. the laces seem like they are more for looks as I feel I don't actually need them, maybe as the shoe ages they will come in handy. The material that make the 'sock' of the shoe is very firm but also flexible. The heel has a little bit of protection and feels firm and hugs the heel in place. The toe bed is nice and wide so as I hike, run, walk all day there is plenty of breathing room for those little swells that happen. Also, recycled ocean plastic... bonus.",

Wore for 10+ hours at Disney World with no rubbing or pinching. Wear them camping, hiking, to the gym, or just around to run errands in. Any time I can wear athletic shoes, these are my 1st choice. I have a thinner foot, so they aren't hard to get on like others have stated. Plenty of support in the arch. I don't think the sole will ever wear out.",
