Regardless of the limited workload, the right shoe has managed to tear near the top left hand side of the shoe (near the ankle). Where is the quality?",

On the inside of the shoe near the last lace hole, the material is wearing away, looking as if you repeatedly rubbed it against something. It has happened on both shoes and on the other pair as well. These shoes are not cheap and truly expect them to last quite a while. Will be reaching out to Brooks as well.",

I have followed my podiatrist's regime of stretches, had cortisone injections, and ordered special inserts - all with limited relief. On my son-in-law's recommendation I ordered these particular shoes. I was a little hesitant at first because of the price but I am so glad I did. I could feel the arch support immediately and within a week the pain relief was in full force. Hopefully I am not being premature in my exuberant praise but as of now, 10 days after first putting them on, I am completely sold on them. My next podiatrist appointment should be my last for awhile!",
