My main problem is the fact that the Home, and Back buttons have for some baffling reason been moved to the middle of the bottom of the screen. This means that it is no longer possible to hold the Kindle with one hand and use one's thumb to operate the buttons - particularly annoying when reading a book. The battery runs down faster than my old Kindle - despite shutting down Wifi and always turning off the power. The screen is less sensitive - often cannot make it work with finger pressure alone.",
