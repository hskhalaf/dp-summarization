      "text": "First, let me say that the person complaining about the holster not being safe or securing their weapon, obviously did not purchase the Level II retention model. This holster is very well made and fits my Gen4 23 like a glove without the scratching and overaggressive contact I get from my other retention holsters. The material is far superior than most of my USA made retention holsters and feels like a quality made holster, not a poorly made plastic toy holster. If you are buying this holster for a Gen5, it may require some minor sanding to allow the right side of the ambidextrous slide release/lock to slide in without forcing it in. Great product. Will definitely be buying again!",

Luckily with the included Allen key I am able to loosen it, till the adjustment screw is all the way out and the drawing is smooth as I like. At this point holstering still gets a \"click\" and the gun won't drop even up side down. Orpaz holsters are made in Israel and the quality is top notch. Even better is that the price is excellent compare to other name brands with similar quality. I have their other holsters for my 1911 and Jericho 941, highly recommended.",

Wish the gun could be a little closer to the body, but maybe not possible with the mechanics involved. This is a fantastic holster for the price! UPDATE: I have to change my thoughts on this holster because of the seller's lack of concern about a customer after the sale. I felt there was a piece missing and called customer service; left my phone number & a detailed message, only to be ignored. If customer service is poor, the product is poor, IMO. Wouldn't deal with this seller again. Buy a Blackhawk, far superior.",

One very minor negative is: I have a personal bias against using security head screws (adjustments) when a simple phillips head would suffice. That's only because the more common phillips head screwdriver is usually more accessible when away from the house, shop,or office. That's only a minor inconvenience though and, once the correct driver bit has been obtained, all the tension and position adjustments are straightforward and easily made. I really like this holster and will be returning to Orpaz for other gear. -Stay frosty! -",
