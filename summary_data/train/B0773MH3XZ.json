The goggles fit my face well though and don\u2019t seem to have issues (which I\u2019ve had in the past) that make them \u201cfoggles\u201d when we hit the slopes this weekend. The strap is comfortable and so is the padding around the face. Added bonus is the colors match my board and outfit! I\u2019d recommend these for anyone that is looking for a decent pair without spending $300 on them. They also come in a super nice zip up case so I can store them easily in my board bag.",

I even wore them to the beach one day because my eyes were sensitive that day and I needed the extra protection from the sun. They did an amazing job at keeping out all sun and glare. They also have vents at the top so they don't fog up. We've been planning on going snowboarding soon so I will get to put them to the test eventually. But as far as wearability and quality - they're pretty good!",
