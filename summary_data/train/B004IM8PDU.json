I bought Tommee Tippee and Avent bottles around the same time as these, and both of those have held up, but the como tomo bottle clearly has a tear in the nipple, so it leaks, but more importantly if my daughter were to bite through it a bit more, she could end up choking on the plastic/silicone.",

When dispensing though there\u2019s always a little at the end that is a pain to shake out just because of how the hole is in the middle. But otherwise it dispenses nicely.",

I wanted something compact and everything else I could find were the big, bulky multi serve containers and every review said you could not trust the dividers to keep the amounts separated. I love these ones because it makes it so easy. They are easy to clean, and they keep mess to a minimum while out and about.",
