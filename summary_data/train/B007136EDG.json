Right out the box they sounded TERRIBLE (not like other skull candy earbuds I've bought at Walmart) the sound quality is like when you record a song on your phone from the radio to make it your ringtone. TRASH! No bass at all. And the cherry on top...the left earbud stopped working after about 10 hours of use!!! I want to say these are a cheap fake look alike because the last pair i had bought of these (from Walmart) were fine. Those never broke I just forgot them on a plane. Would not recommend buying these from this seller.",

The only drawback is that if you are sitting in silent places like office or library and have been listening to songs with these earphones on, chances are that the person sitting next to you can hear the songs as well. This happens even if you are not at full volume. Other than that, these are good for the price range. Another good earphones for around $10 are Sony MDREX10LP/BLK In-Ear Headphones.",

THATS THE MOST ANNOYING PART. The sound quality is worse than the dollar headphones you might find. Very bad quality and finish. Look like they are fake headphones. have owned Inkd previously definitely they werent this bad. Returning these. No point in keeping them absolutely useless.",

      "text": "As many other reviews have stated, I don't think these are real skullcandy headphones. I have had several pairs of skullcandy headphones over the years and they were all great. I opened these yesterday and there is a buzzing sound that comes from them whenever you plug them in. Also when you play music through them the volume gets louder and quieter every few seconds. I am returning them and will buy a pair from a store. Also when I purchased these they said they were sold through Skullcandy, but when I went to return them the seller information said Kar Wah. Im not sure why it says this but I would not suggest ordering through this link.",

They are awesome as headphones with a nice bass and great sound, and the microphone is decent at least, however they provide way too much insulation, regardless of the buds that you're using. If you plan on using them as both headphones for music and a handsfree while you're walking, jogging and everything else, they are a prime choice for the price, however when you're driving they stop too much of the outside sound for a safe drive",

The One Problem: They are a metal housing. That means every time I roll in my office chair I get zapped(Static Shock) in the ear. It's a little annoying, since I'm stuck at a desk all day. I put a wrap of electrical tape around them and they work great. Other than that I am very happy with these head phones.",

Pros: - Good sound quality - Decent price - Nice player controller - buds fit nicely - The flat cable does help prevent tangles a little Cons: - The wires in headphone jack are the first to break - The earbud break off next - The contacts on the jack wear out quickly - the longest they last from normal use is about 1.5 years These ear buds are good but I think I won't be buying anymore of them. They're good for a while but if you're looking for headphones to last, these aren't it.",

Also, they're not that durable. After about a month of regular use while exercising, the left year bud's sound has become quieter than the right. i'm assuming it's because sweat got in there and messed with the internal components.",
