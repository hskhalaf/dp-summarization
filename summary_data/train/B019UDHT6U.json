      "text": "This is a wonderful camera. If you\u2019ve ever owned an ELPH camera, you know that they\u2019re high-quality, ultra-portable cameras. Obviously you\u2019re not going to get DSLR-quality images from a camera like this, but this is still a great camera, and if you use a tripod, you will be able to get excellent results. I use mine with an Amazon Basics tripod (which costs a little more than $20 and is really light and portable). Shooting with a tripod, even when using a little Point and Shoot camera, makes all the difference. But back to the camera. This is a great camera. It's also very affordable.",

I also own 2 Nikon Coolpix pocket cameras which worked very well, but over time no longer hold a battery charge.
