It is a clean, beautiful, Very big, very thick and firm mat.Leathery on both sides. Velcro at ends. I would've paid even more if I knew the quality would be this good! Definitely recommend this to anyone! Also, I ordered it knowing it said it probably wouldn't make it in time for Christmas and said the 28th, it came the 23rd! I was so excited I got to wrap the huge box and give it for Christmas!",

After having surgery, I've been doing my therapy exercises on it too. I like the 2\" foam - thicker than most that are 1.5.",

The quality is very good and the price is reasonable! Definitely recommend this to anyone! The mat has velcro on the bottom so it\u2019s not slipping on the hardwood floor. The velcro is not sticky to the carpet which\u2019s good. This is a big plus compared to others.",

The only criticism is that the Velcro closure doesn't work that well, and so it's harder to get it out of the way because it falls open when we try to lean it against the wall. We do have a couple of dogs and their hair has gotten in the Velcro, so it's not really the manufacturer's fault. That's just a limitation to be aware of if you have pets. Some strong snaps might have been nice instead of the Velcro.",
