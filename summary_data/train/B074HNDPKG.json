      "text": "I know absolutely zero about making layered cocktails. That guy\u2019s review is a lot more helpful than this one is going to be. I like making really big coffees in really tall cups, and normal-length spoons were not working. I needed a longer spoon so I got this one. It\u2019s probably a little too long for my purposes, but it gets the job done. I think the bright gold tone looks totally 80\u2019s, so I\u2019m very much okay with it fading in the dishwasher. The bottom line is, if you have a need for a very long spoon, this is one. If you have more specific spoon needs than just length, then this review has not been very helpful.",

The twist handle provides a little extra grip when muddling. This muddling end is great for citrus. The points make it aggressive, unlike my wooden muddler, which is better suited for crushing mint. This design wouldn't be the best choice for mint. Very happy to add this to the mix of bar tools. Highly recommended.",

So much better than a long spoon, chopstick, finger.... it was made to stir drinks in a tall glass. It looks nice too -- not your typical shiny silver finish, but the copper finish is unique. I also have the shot measurement cup, so together -- it looks like the cocktail, whatever weird recipe I'm making for a guest, is going to be spot on. It's just a tall spoon, but the color makes it unique and worth buying.",

It is, however excellent for mixing ingredients in mixed drinks or for blending already crushed ingredients. It is also very good for use in a coffee shop or kitchen where lattes and other coffee drinks are made. It is very useful and much less awkward than trying to achieve the mixes with a long handled spoon. It does tend to bend when pressure is exerted upon it so it is best used where mixing without pressure is required.",

I don't think it's actual gold, of course. The coloring on this spoon is very brassy so the spoon looks more bronze or brass than gold, in my opinion. The spoon itself is pretty thick and sturdy. It doesn't bend easily or anything, so that's nice. It's fine. It gets the job done.",
