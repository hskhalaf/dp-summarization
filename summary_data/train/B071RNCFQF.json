Nice camera(small problems with AF when you take a pic from a few cm distance), nice speakers, great design, top quality materials and physical keyboard(love it). Sounds good? Yes, but...there is Android. In my opinion Android is the worst mobile OS. I just hate it! I'd pay twice as much for this phone if there was BB OS. If you like Android go for KeyONE, if you looking for something different buy...I don't know...Passport maybe? But the problem is that the BB OS is supported until the end of this year only and you have some problems with applications already.",

      "text": "Brillant phone, a good move from Blackberry to make an Android phone with Keyboard. I experienced some issues with the battery not being regconized after only 3 weeks of used. Hard reboot did not solve issue but it was replaced under warranty and the new one has not yet shown a sign of battery issue. Battery life is huge. Once optimized, you'll be able to run it for a full day of work without worrying having to charge it. Tho, when heavy use, you may have to topup the battery arriving home in the evening (15 - 20% mark), but you'll get a very swift fast topup via the Boost mode",
