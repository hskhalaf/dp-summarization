It\u2019s basically Grand Theft Auto where you play as Spider-Man and can\u2019t kill anyone or steal cars (so I guess not that much like it). But the open world and ability to go anywhere is very similar. And it\u2019s a beautiful game. My 9 year old loves it as well and it\u2019s the perfect difficulty for him even on normal. I love the amount of checkpoints during the missions so he doesn\u2019t have to start over from the beginning every time. Swinging around the city is just an amazing feeling. Highly recommend.",

Cons: the city doesn\u2019t feel alive to me. When compared to great titles such as GTA V, urban areas felt scripted, and at times, repetitive.

The best Spider-Man game to date and I am speaking from the early beginnings of Spider-Man being on N64 lol. Insomniac has done Spider Man well.",
