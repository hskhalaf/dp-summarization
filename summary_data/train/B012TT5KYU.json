It has a pretty weak motor though and the wheel can easily stall, but after I replaced the motor with a more powerful one (, the pottery wheel was easier to work with.",

It has a right hand/left hand feature which allows for opposite rotation which is great for my family of lefties and righties. One tip: if the clay is too dry it\u2019s hard to mold. Wrap it in a damp towel and let it absorb the moisture prior to use and make sure hands are wet or it will cause resistance. We\u2019re happy with this product and are considering another so our kids can work independently together.",

I would not recommend this at all. It should be called toy pottery wheel, not pottery wheel for beginners. Very very disappointed.",

I will try to bring it out again now that it is summer and she can do outside. Must have a good/stable table to set on. Foot pedal could be more substantial for a kid but at least they can learn hand/foot manipulation.",
