It's still functional to this day. The wake up light is very bright and the transitions are smooth. The wake up sounds are relaxing. Cons: pricey. There are much cheaper options now. Setting the alarm is not intuitive. I've never had to read a manual to learn how to set an alarm or the time until I bought this one. Fortunately the manual is online so I don't have to dig for it.",

The instructions are great, just keep them in a safe spot so you don't lose them. The normal functions are easy to remember.",

I had a similar clock many years ago that didn't have all the options of this one and I loved it until it was killed by a lightening bolt. I love that the volume and brightness can be adjusted to individual preference. I wake up much happier with this than the typical obnoxious beep or a strange voice suddenly in my room. I tried a few others in between: some had an annoying blue quality to the light, others weren't bright or loud enough. One blinked brightly and had the old time bell alarm that scared the *bleep* outta me....",

Once your alarm time arrives you are greeted by the soothing wake up melody/sounds that you chose. My only gripe is the small (TINY) buttons on the top used to turn off the alarm.

Sometimes I lay in bed a long time just listening to the bird sounds, which isn't great when I need to get up. But the light is definitely helpful for making me feel like sleepy time is over.

The features on the clock/light are great. The buttons are a bit hard to see, but once you learn the clock, it is not a problem at all. The \"sun down\" feature is terrific-helps my daughter know just how long she has to read before it's lights out and time to go to sleep. The best part of all is that my daughter now wakes up much, much easier, and in a much better mood!",
