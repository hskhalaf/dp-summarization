I charge them fully before any long journey and sometimes they last the trip, even the day if I use them sparingly. But recently, they keep dropping the bluetooth connection and go dead after barely half an hour or so. They tick the box for design idea and even sound, but I cannot recommend anyone to buy them - they are so unreliable. Out of warranty and but used probably no more than 20 or so times.",
