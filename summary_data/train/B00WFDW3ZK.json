But if you are injecting a really big roast or bird, I could see how the multi-hole nozzle would save a LOT of time. Regardless, this works like a charm, the cylinder doesn't leak. All in all, it's a must-have for pitmasters and cooks!!",

This meat injector replaces a broken plastic one, and is wayyyy better. Stainless-steel is the best way to go. The included, two different 'needles' work well. When injecting the single hole needle pull it out a tiny bit before pressing the plunger - works like a charm! I would highly recommend this product, & spend the extra money over the plastic units.",
