You name what you want out of a printer and this one fails at them all; poor wi-fi, SLOOOOOOW as molasses, shuts off power after 10 minutes rather than go into sleep mode, nothing extraordinary about the prints, regular or photographic, doesn't hold enough paper, and jams all the time. Oh yeah, and drinks up ink. Do NOT buy! Thank God it's nearly Black Friday and I can hopefully get a good deal on a non-Canon printer.",

The other cartridges Costco does fill, but I was told by their photo center these cartridges are the most expensive ones they fill.

Its simple to use and the individual ink cartridges make it so easy to know which ink to replace and to do it seamlessly!! Also the cost of the ink is easier on my pocketbook..so Thank you Canon..You have a great printer at a great price!!",
