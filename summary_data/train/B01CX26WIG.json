The first thing I noticed was how light it was - so light I began wondering if it was a quality product. Although it looked and felt flimsy, it worked ok at first. The third time I tried to turn it on, however, it would not power up; it was dead. Based on my experience, Samsung\u2019s TVs are absolutely incredible, but their computer monitors are junk.",

I purchased the adapter with was metal fitting into the plastic backing of the monitor and it just is not sturdy and I am afraid the Monitor will break. The 398 is mountable with no adapter...

Also the VA panel is not as amazing as it looks on paper. I tried various color setting on the monitor but none seemed corrent. For light use I would recommend this monitor but if you are sitting in front your monitor for more than 5 hours I would suggest exploring some QHD monitor with IPS panel.",

The entire screen is slightly shifted and is not a flush 90 degree corner from pixel to frame. That too is crooked Also to note. I have a Bi-Pod stand for the screens. The crooked screen one sits a good 1/4 inch higher than the one built correctly Will edit with pics later",

It's just a slight brightness difference between the two even though I've got them both on the same settings. I'll chalk it up to my docking station somehow distorting the signals. I definitely recommend these to anyone needing a nice home office setup.",

My only complaint is that there is only tilt adjustment (no height adjustment).",

The problem about this though, the reason why its not a 5 star, is because its not adjustable unless you plan to buy their company's mounts which is only usable for their own products. Also when left standing on a flat surface (table, etc.) the monitor slightly leans forward because there is no actual knob/screw to keep it securely in place. The reason it stands is because there is a little part that slips into the stand which bends diagonally keeping the monitor up, hence there reason why the monitor slightly leans forward.",
