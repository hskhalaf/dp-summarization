The number of devices connected to it increased markedly, and the network started dropping out about every half hour or so (at least under regular use). It was a shame to have to replace this after this router followed me coast to coast to coast to coast, but I replaced it last week. I would've expected more like 8 years before it started having problems, but I think I bought this with the knowledge it would likely need to be replaced on about this timeframe anyway.",

If VIZIO had made a new router now, we probably would have gotten it, because it's interface was so good, that it was even better than the Linksys WRT interface, and WAY better than NETGEAR's Genie.

The signal strength is poor, it went from the high 90% (95-100) with the old Netgear to the low 30% (32-37) with the Vizio. Being less than 20 feet away I would expect a lot stronger signal. I don't know if I'm getting the through put for streaming that I expected, it may not be as good as my old router. My laptop also gets poor signal strength.",
