This was due to a hole in one of the hardware bags.

This table fits nicely in our dining/living room area and is a good addition to our new apartment! I brought this awhile ago (but never had a chance to actually use it)!",

I would recommend buying seat cushions as the chairs are pretty hard. Everything is in perfect condition and adds a modern touch to my apartment. The price is very good, as it is reasonably priced and looks expensive. Highly recommend for the price!",
