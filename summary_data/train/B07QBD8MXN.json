THIS STUFF WORKS WONDERS!!!! NO IRRITATION AT ALL...use spatula, leave on anywhere between 7 to 10 mins for course hair, which i have, works wonders, i tested very sensitive areas...so far so good! i had to use regular razor for small touch ups, other than that, ....I'm going to test some more sensitive areas later. and let you know..EXCELLENT PRODUCT & RESULTS! Updated 48+ hours later: Did a 2nd application and worked great again! I'm too scared to try even more sensitive areas might try soon...everywhere else works GREAT!",

However, after following instructions carefully and testing first, then leaving on for max 10 minutes, it did not remove my hair. Over the following few days, about 50% of the hair broke off at about 1mm long. This is a fail in my opinion. I was looking for smooth legs after one use.",

      "text": "Neomen Hair Remover worked great! I left the product on for 5 mins on my legs, arm pits, and bikini line. It worked best on my bikini area. All the hair came off. My arm pits I left on a few mins longer. The hair removing tool didn't work well, but I just used a clean wet rag and wipe the hair in a downward motion and it came off pleasantly well. Next time I will use a body scrub on my legs the day before using because it did leave a few stragglers because the hair was ingrown. I notice the hair has grown back slower as well.",

There's next to nothing on the internet that gives any advice on products to use with folliculitis, so everything I've used has been trial and error. This product still irritared my skin, but far less than any other product I've tried. I believe that anyone without folliculitis would be pleased with this product. I would have continued to use it and repurchase it if I didn't have this skin condition. I definitely thinks it's worth a try!",

However, the hair comes back faster than I'd like. Maybe I need to use it more to see if the hair slowly stops growing there. Anyways, great product! I love the smell and that it doesn't feel like straight chemicals on the skin (:",

I've used Veet for sensitive skin for years, but they must have changed their formula because the last bottle I bought would not remove bikini line hair. Neomen does the job well. It did not burn the VERY sensitive regions beyond the bikini line either, which Veet did at times. This product is virtually scentless and doesn't have the strong chemical smell other hair removers attempt to cover up with perfumes. Plus, you can get all the cream out of the tube. Overall, I believe I've found a great hair remover in Neomen Cream! I recommend it and will buy it again!",

I used a wash cloth with warm water and I was shocked!! *most* of the hair was gone. I think my mistake was not putting a thick enough coat on, so make sure you do a good layer if you\u2019re going over thicker hair. I will try again in a few days with that thicker layer!",
