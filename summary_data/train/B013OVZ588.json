      "text": "The radio has a very annoying hum when in Bluetooth mode which in and of itself is reason enough to return this product. Additionally, there is a very bright blue light that flashes on the side when in Bluetooth mode so forget trying to use this radio in a darkened room unless you cover that light. Also, when using Bluetooth the radio dial light is not on at all so there is no visual indication that the radio is even on. When in AM/FM mode the dial light is blue when it is on instead of it being white or more yellow as it would be on a truly retro radio. This is not a well designed product.",

      "text": "This was a Christmas gift for my wife. She loves it. Everything on it works well, and we haven't had any problems with it. It matches the retro decor in the kitchen. The one comment I kept seeing was about the sound quality. I agree that it's not concert hall quality, but I think that's by design. The tone quality is similar to the tone quality on a genuine 30's radio. It has that 'nostalgic' sound. Obviously it sounds much better than a true 30's radio, but my wife and I feel the tone qualities give it more ambiance. Overall, we're very happy with the radio, and would definitely recommend it to someone looking for a retro looking radio.",
