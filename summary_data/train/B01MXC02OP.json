They were extremely soft and comfortable the first few nights. However, little pills started forming on the fitted sheet after just a week. I tried washing them again, as instructed. It has been just over a month and now both the fitted and flat sheet have pills all over them and the pillow case is starting pill up as well. I have bought much poorer quality sheets before and they wear thin after about a year, but none have ever gotten pills on them before.",
