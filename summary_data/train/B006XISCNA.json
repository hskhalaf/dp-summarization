Whether is was just holding fresh milk or defrosting milk that was frozen a day or months, they never leaked. When I had my second child last year 2018, I came back to Lansinoh when I started pumping for storage and noticed an immediate difference to how the bags felt (especially since I had some old ones left to compare). The plastic does feel ever slightly thinner which is fine as long as it does the job. Unfortunately, we have noticed constant leaking when defrosting milk on numerous occasions and will not longer purchase these.",

They were still useable and did the job, but it was quite frustrating and took away from some of the convenience while trying to pump at work. * also, I use these with my medella pump. I just cut little slits in the top of the bags to attach easily to the pump adaptor.",

I didn't overfill them, they weren't freezer burned and I packed them neatly - no bends. so I just don't think that the bags are designed for long-term freezing. They're great for short-term.",
