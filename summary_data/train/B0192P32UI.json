There really is nothing to it and it is a brilliant invention! If you nap in your car or you have a long road trip planned or even for short camping trips this is amazing!",

Both of us are around 5'8\" with small frames. We were able to sleep shoulder to shoulder with our knees bent up, or spoon each other with our legs stretched out toward the front seat.

I found that when it was inflated, it worked well. Overall it served my needs. Pros The pump is powerful and inflates in minutes. The air mattress fit perfectly in my back seat. Cons The pump cord was a little short, so filling the mattress in the back seat from the front council was a challenge. You have to be quick or you loose significant air before you are able to plug the whole. I found this very frustrating. A leak guard would benefit this product greatly.",
