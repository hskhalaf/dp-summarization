His coat is so soft and clean smelling that I nuzzle my face in his hair so much more now. Sort of related tip: Putting your dog's towel in the dryer on high for 20-30 min helps with drying time and also keeps them warm after bath time.",

I have two Pomeranians with long, thick hair that gets quite tangly as their hair grows out. I appreciate the fact that this product cleans as well as conditions their coat, all in one. The best part of using this combined shampoo/conditioner is that the scent is very long lasting. Long lasting as in weeks!! It\u2019s by no means overpowering though. It\u2019s a nice, fresh scent that you would only notice when your pupper is close or right next to you!",
