      "text": "I've had mine for over five years now, and it's still going strong. I just cleaned it, in fact, and was thinking of how clever the design is. It can't be submerged in water to wash it, but you can still manage to clean it in the sink by filling it with water, scrubbing the inside, and pouring and rinsing. The heating element is deep in the bottom, so it's a bit protected. The Breville is simple to use and makes it easy to brew a good pot of tea. My review is missing one star because I wish the top of the submersible basket was made of something other than plastic, though it's BPA free.",

I have to reset the clock almost every auto-brew set. The other issue is I don't think it ever looks clean at the bottom of the pot if that's a big deal for you unless you hand wipe it every day, since you can't put the pot in the dishwasher.",

What bothers me is the tannin build-up on metal surfaces, which takes place within weeks and affects the taste (and color)of the water. The suggested fixes - boiling lemons, baking powder or vinegar - have not been effective, and I haven't found a solution as yet. This has limited my enjoyment and use of this otherwise excellent product. Help, anyone?",
