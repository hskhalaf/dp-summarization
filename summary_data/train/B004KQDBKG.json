Either they can hear every other word or will tell you it sounds like your underwater. There's also tons of static. I don't recommend this at all, and make sure you read the reviews and pass on this one.",

Phone has a decent number of speed dial storage slots (dual layer); nice volume control and all the other features one would expect on a phone of this type. If I had to really dig for a criticism, I would say the hand receiver is a little light. No problem giving this phone a 5-star, especially for the cost/value.",

My prior phone let me switch between headset and speaker phone by pressing their respective buttons, and the handset was activated just by picking it up.

Extremely disappointed with the quality of this phone.",

I called support as it is still under the 1 year mfg warranty and I would need to pay for shipping back to them, then wait 7 days before I could call and get a status update, then wait for it to be fixed or replaced and sent back. Most places would send a new phone and pay for sending the broken one back. This is my office line, so waiting that long is not an option.",

Nice three position stand for low, high, and wall mount that has the phone a decent distance from the wall without making it an obstacle. Basically the same quality of Panasonic that I have come to expect at a reasonable price. Good Value.",
