These raise the chair to a height that is comfortable for me. My only complaint is that they are kind of unsightly under the legs of the chair. I fixed this by making a skirt that fits around the bottom of the chair and extends to cover the risers. Looks nice and works for me. Even if you don't sew, a staple gun can work.
