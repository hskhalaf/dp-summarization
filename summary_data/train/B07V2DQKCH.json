One thing to watch out for the hd comes with Bitlocker turned on so many programs will not work with it, go to Control Panel and turn off Bitlocker and its perfect. I always install ClassicShellSetup on my windows 10 machines which gets rid of those horrible tiles and puts the interface back to win 7 without losing any windows 10 bits. Try it, you can always uninstall and its free...yes really free! Last but not least you do not get a licence with the home edition supplied, you have to buy one... I upgraded to win 10 pro.....cost \u00a3119 from microsoft.",

      "title": "Good performance for the price - some persistent issues",
      "text": "Good laptop for the price, very decent performance, however, it is plagued by some quality issues. The main reason I returned it was the loose touchpad, which would \"rattle\" around in the bottom part when one puts a finger on top of it, making it very annoying if one uses the touchpad on a regular basis. This, combined with the not so great battery life, made it hard to justify keeping the laptop. Other than that, the screen was okay, with good touch capability, and also the fairly good spec made the laptop handle daily tasks easily.",
