      "text": "I've tried several different chin straps over the years and this was the worst. It is basically just a simple broad piece of elastic cloth that you run under you chin and over the top of your head, securing it with Velcro sewn into cloth. Their material costs must be very low, and even then the piece of cloth they sent was so short I had to stretch it way too tightly to make the two ends meet. Not comfortable at all. Having the cloth cover your ears made them hot, too. Unfortunately, you can not return chin straps after you've worn them.",

If this could be corrected somehow, this chin strap would be perfect. It just seems to me it won't last as long because it uses Velcro that holds too tight to the main strap. A conundrum for sure!
