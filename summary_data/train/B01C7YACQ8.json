This ferro rod shoots copious amounts of sparks, intermingled with bits of the rod flying in burning bits towards the tinder bundle. No \"cheating\" necessary [i.e. vaseline coated cotton balls or a hint of lighter fluid on the tinder} It is definitely up to the job. I now know that all Ferro-rods are not created equal. Spend the few extra bucks and this little beauty may be the last one you ever have to buy.",

The handle is comfortable and you won't get fatigued like when using the smaller handles ones. Applying/varnish yourself which isn't a problem. You'll also have to scrape off the black paint/covering time reveal the silver underneath. Only con is I was striking it instead of scraping and a tiny piece chipped off in the cneter towards the end. As long as you treat it right it shouldn't be a problem so I'm giving this a great 4 stars. You should absolutely buy this as your primary fire starter.",

I widen the hole a bit, insert the tie, once its through hole put the remainder through the loop then loop that below the sheath slot. Looks great and is fully secure.",
