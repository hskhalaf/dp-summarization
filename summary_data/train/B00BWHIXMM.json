That, I feel is an idiosynchrosy of Apple, not the keyboard. This cover/keyboard does add some weight to the iPad, but that is a plus in my opinion as it keeps it from sliding around on you on surfaces. I would recommend it.",

I like the tab function and this one is not workable. Can't recommend if the spacebar stops working and no access to seller for a replacement!!",
