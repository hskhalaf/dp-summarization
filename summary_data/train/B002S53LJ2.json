Now I feel horrible because I've trapped them all in a den of horrible customer service. This speaker no longer works. It has a nearly constant hiss with random extremely loud pops and crackles. If you search for this problem you will find the internet is rife with examples. Sonos support is geared 100% towards the software, app, and account linking. They don't care at all about hardware issues, not even in the support form as an option. I was told to go buy a new one, these are unserviceable. Didn't last 2 years, sitting in one place unmoved and undisturbed.",

We have other audio equipment that works perfectly fine after 10-15 years (speakers, receivers, etc.). For a relatively expensive piece of audio equipment to potentially not be usable after only 5 years is very disappointing and will cause me to not buy any future SONOS products for fear of them becoming obsolete quickly as well.",

Whether we're playing Pandora, SiriusXM or our iTunes collection, the music is crystal clear and there's nothing else like SONOS on the market. Don't take just my word for it, read Consumer Reports, other consumer reviews, etc. and you'll see that this is always at the top of the music system list. Thanks SONOS!",

But until today, there was one big exception to my favor for the Sonos speaker lineup : Sonos and Google seemed to be at odds about ever supporting Google Play Music on Sonos speakers. That changed today (4/10/2014) with the release of Sonos app that supports Google Play Music. Bravo Google and Sonos, for agreeing to play nicely together!",

It is a little expensive, but has changed how we listen to music around our home because its become immediately accessible.",

The sound is good (I play mostly classical and other orchestral music such as soundtracks) but getting a second Play:1 and pairing them would have been an equally good option for me. It's not that the sound on the Play:5 is not good but rather that the Play:1 is impressive indeed.",

      "text": "I'm a lifelong music lover and had Sonos recommended by a friend. I have a very large music collection (5000 LPs and 8000 CDs) and saw this as an easy way to access internet radio and all my items that were burned to disk. To start, I bought a single S5, a Zonebridge, and a ZonePlayer 90 to connect to my stereo system, plus an iTouch to use as a controller versus the Sonos controller unit. Setup could not have been easier and the sound quality is awesome. The free app for the iTouch works great as a controller, plus I use the desktop app. I liked it so much I've ordered two more S5 units! Highly recommended!",
