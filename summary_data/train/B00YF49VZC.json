I appreciate the company's prompt response and excellent customer service. We look forward to returning to the beach soon with our Beach Bub. I am changing my review from a 1 to a 4. The only reason I am not giving it a 5 is because of the hassle of it breaking the first time.",

I watched several people struggle with their inverted umbrellas due to the wind. On Easter Sunday the beach was packed and my umbrella was the only one fully upright. All the others were on the ground facing into the wind which blocked their view of the ocean. Well worth the investment in my opinion. So happy! Highly recommend!",

Very nice piece of work, and well worth the money if you don't like chasing umbrellas down the beach and apologizing.

It is super easy to assemble, even Nana can do it! We liked it so much last year, we actually purchased a second one to have more shade. It also comes with nifty towel hooks that you can use to hold your goods out of the sand. I would definitely recommend this to anyone in the market for a high quality, easy to assemble umbrella.",

I didn\u2019t think that we would use the included base as we have a sand anchor but the design of the base is genius! The umbrella was great in windy conditions at Tybee Island. We never had a worry about it flying off or breaking in the wind. Set up and take down are quick and simple. If you are in the market for a sturdy long lasting beach umbrella this is it.",
