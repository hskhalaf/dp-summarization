These definitely wouldn\u2019t fit anyone with feet wider or thicker than average, or with larger toes. The soles of my feet feel like they\u2019re being pinned against the cushion of the shoe, which makes it hard to even tell if the cushion itself is even comfortable. I have two pairs of champion canvas Keds and the 7.5 fits perfectly. I don\u2019t like wearing shoes without socks, and these would be way too tight for them. I\u2019ll return and try an 8 or 8.5.",

I had slight slipping on the heel of my slightly smaller foot, but the width across the ball of both feet was just snug enough that I don't think I could comfortably size down. The interior fabric is sewn to the top of the shoe as well, so you won't have the ability to stretch the upper leather to adjust the fit. If not for the slipping on the one heel I would have kept them. I do like the look.",

These leather crashbacks looked a lot (to my eyes) like the Frye Dylan sneaker, but at a fraction of the cost. I am a big fan of the Keds ballet style shoes (the \"Teacup Flat\", and from several years ago, the \"Eleanor\".... Ked Company, please bring them back!!!), so I decided to give these \"crashbacks\" a try. I love them! I found them both very comfortable, and extremely cute. I bought the cognac color, and plan to buy them in black as well. They fit like typical Keds, true to size, but maybe slightly wider than other shoes. Just get them, you won't be disappointed!",
