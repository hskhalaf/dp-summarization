I don't game much, but for testing purposes I ran a few on max settings and had zero issues. People have stated that putting the computer in gaming mode DOES cause issues, so I just didn't put it in gaming mode. The qaulity is superb. I use this mostly for school and work and have not been let down. The charging cable is a bit large, but it also is not flimst like a lot of cables. Very happy with this",

All my other games are handled just as good and I even noticed the microphone is pretty cool to with the directional features. Once again, another great product from Razer. Nothing less than what I expected from you guys. Thank you so much!",

System stays cool unless you block the bottom back side where the fans and heat sink are. The gtx 1060 is more than good enough for my needs.",
