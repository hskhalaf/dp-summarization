The saw has plenty of power, the expanding table works well, sawdust is as well managed as one can get with a small table saw. I bought this because it would shop to me in Alaska and was inexpensive, but man am I impressed! Over 25 years in construction too, and I'm fickle. Looks exactly like the dewalt, probably made in the same place. First thing I did was effortlessly rip a laminated beam made of 2x4s/ Effortlessly-with the stock blade. Just wow.",

Compared to the Delta, this saw has more, better designed safety features, which means I'm more likely to keep them enabled. The self-aligning rip fence, extendable table, and on-machine storage for tools and accessories are great features. The miter gauge does not have any positive stops, which is a shortcoming. Like other saws at the Skil's price point, the OEM blade is only of adequate quality and was noticeably duller toward the end of my cork flooring project. I will replace it with a Diablo blade. The folding table makes the system easy to store in my crowded garage.",
