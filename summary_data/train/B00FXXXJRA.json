      "text": "This capper worked great. Seems to be built well. Sturdy,metal construction. The key to using this is to make sure you use inward pressure on the handles increase of downward pressure. If you just push straight down it puts a lot of pressure on the bottle. If you press inward, all of the force goes to the cap. It capped screw off bottles as well (they just won't unscrew when opening). There was some mild difficult getting a few bottles free after capping, but nothing a little wiggling didn't fix. It won't work on wider necked bottles like Stella Artois or Modelo because of the low clearance neck grips. Perfectly fit Budweiser and Guinness bottles.",

It does leave a ring in the center of caps installed on long necks, but barely noticeable when used on short neck bottles. I got the correct U.S. size with 1 click ordering. So far only used to cap 50 bottles. I will edit if it breaks. If you are concerned that all plastic units may break, or shatter the necks on your bottles, then this is a good alternative. I have had no issues. Works well.",

I wanted to upgrade to this metal constructed one and i was excited to use it but when I placed a cap in the capper cup, it fell out , the center piece is NOT magnetic as my plastic one is. If this is supposed to be magnetic I'd like a replacement /exchange . If not Id like to simply return for a refund.",
