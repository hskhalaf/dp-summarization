I didn't like how a lot of other covers didn't attach at the top of the seat and you had to fold them over to rear face.

These have an adjustable strap to keep them on the seat and they go nice and high up the back of the seat. They were easy to install, and seem heavy duty. I love that there is a storage pouch on the front as well.",

      "2-PACK, ANTI-SLIP DESIGN: What good is your car seat protector if it\u2019s always slipping down? We know that\u2019s a common problem, which is why the Ohuhu Car Seat Cover is made with an adjustable strap to tie the cover securely to the headrest as well as a handy tab to tuck between backrest and the seat. This ensures that the seat protector won\u2019t slide downwards or cause discomfort for those sitting in the back. Just adjust the straps and you\u2019re good to go!",
      "WATERPROOF & EASY TO CLEAN: Leather or fabric seats can be a real pain to remove stains from, but polyester makes it painless! Not only are stains less likely to occur on the waterproof 600D polyester fabric with PU coating and a PVC leather edge, but the Ohuhu Car Seat Protector is also so easy to clean with a vacuum or damp cloth. Stains will be gone!",
      "CONVENIENT MESH POCKETS: Sometimes cars don\u2019t have quite enough pockets or storage space, so wouldn\u2019t it be nice to have just a little more? Well now you do with the convenient mesh pocket design attached to the car seat, which allows you to stash toys, snacks, drinks, tissues and water bottles so your kids can access their most important items themselves.",
      "COMPATIBLE WITH ALL SEATS: No matter what kind of vehicle you have, keep your seats as clean and nice as the day you bought your car! Use it in sedans, SUVs and trucks to protect against spills, scratches and pets for a cleaner backseat for everyone."
