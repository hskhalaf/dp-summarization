I would like to try the other models they have, but will wait for now.",

The reason I got them was to use with Dragon Naturally Speaking. Unfortunately they were not on the list of recommended headset mics to be used with Dragon. I had assumed that because Sennheiser is a well known brand name that it would be a good fit It was disappointing that it wasn't. That is much more likely to be the fault of Dragon than it is Sennheiser. It is Dragon after all that needs to be certain that their software works with other devices.",

It's just not very sturdy. But it sounds ok, and conversations are clear. It's light and comfortable. Treat it very gently and it should give years of service. The USB jack glows when the device is plugged in; a small piece of electricians tape will take care of that. The mute switch on the cord DOESN'T have an indicator light, so if you mean to mute, make sure you actually slid the switch and didn't just think you did. That cost it a star.",

The only reason I don't give five (5) stars is that I wish these were more portable - foldable and had a case. I use them with my laptop/softphone and they are cumbersome to travel with. Definitely don't fit in a laptop case.",
