I've only had them for a day so take my sound review with a grain of salt. They are definitely good for the price. However their original list was $ 200. I have other ear buds in that range which are better. But these are more comfortable for me and are more manageable for my Iphone right now. If I can tame the others these will go to my wife.",

They also won't fit everyone's ear... Do a good job of blocking outside ambient noise but not great.",

The only bad thing is fit, KEF should offer several more eartips options --I have to get a third party one to get the right fit on my somewhat small ear channels.",

And even with the smallest of tips, or different brand tips, they ended up causing a low grade ache in my ear canals. Sad, but true. So I had to return them. For sound, 5 stars. For fit, 3 stars.

They were bulky, won't fit right and constantly falling out when I open my mouth to talk/eat etc. I did a comparison with my generic earbuds that came with my phone and I couldn't tell the difference.
