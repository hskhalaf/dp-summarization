Then I use the directional antennae to focus the beam upstairs to another tv with a Fire TV stick, and downstairs to yet another Fire TV stick. Yes, there's still inter-floor attenuation (loss of signal) but not so much as to cause any display buffering. I run this router 24x7 and it doesn't need periodic reboots or any attention really.

Given this router's features, I thought this would be a wonderful upgrade. Wrong! Out of the box it sets up just fine and things kick off ok, but in no time, smart phone struggle to keep the connection alive (iphones in particular seem to have to constantly reset their wifi connection to the router), video streaming is now much worse than with the older router, and connection speeds in general are suffering. Not pleased at all, especially for the money paid. I would not recommend this router to anyone.",

It was easy to set up worked right away. I'm very satisfied with this purchase.",
