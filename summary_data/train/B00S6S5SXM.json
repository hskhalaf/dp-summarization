I tried letting my daughter get on it (using her step stool for height) and it just slid up the seat. It wasn't a deal-breaker for me, as I don't mind helping her since I have to wipe her anyway. I don't use this for travel; I purchased a foldable seat that actually covers more area of the elongated toilet and doesn't move, but it isn't padded.",

This sliding causes urine and sometimes poop to make it\u2019s way into that crease, which is then impossible to clean. I tried using a toothpick wrapped in disinfecting wipes to get in between, but was never to get everything. For that reason, I wouldn\u2019t recommend this product.",
