The light dimmer is a touch sensitive type of a surface. The finish and quality looks good so far, but it has only been a few days so far.

This is a non-flickering light (thank you!) and perfect for using for coloring with professional artist pencils (my hobby!).

It seems that the design is \"form over function.\" Goose-neck desk lamps have been around for about 100 years--users don't expect it to tip over in a stiff breeze or slight touch.

I can turn it on a dim setting and change the color temperature so it's not so bright or, like I stated above, I can light up my whole room by turning up the brightness and adjusting the neck. That is also the reason I purchased this one instead of some of the others, the neck is flexible so you can move it to any position you want. I would definitely recommend this lamp for any purpose you see fit being that it's small.",

I have one in each of two rooms and plan on ordering a third for my reading chair in the living room.",

It is very flexible, as I had hoped it would be, and offers several different light settings. It's important to know that these do much more than make the lamp brighter or dimmer - the settings actually affect the kind and tone of light being used. The color and 'temperature' of the light actually changes, making for very pleasing, yet subtle differences in illumination. The lamp is easy to use and set up and I can report (unfortunately!) that it seems to be very durable. Would happily repurchase or recommend. Thanks.",

In changing the different colors of the light, could the manufacturers make as kind in dial or slide switch to know what color is on? It is difficult to tell by just looking at the light by itself.

It will just be ready for you to press its own power button. This also means if you turn off the light switch, when you turn it back on your settings (brightness/color) will be reset. That's the only thing keeping me from five starring this.",

It works okay, but there are better alternatives out there. The touchscreen and light settings are great. If you want a basic temperature-changing light and won't need to adjust the neck or move it a lot, this is fine. Not worth the $22.99 though.",
