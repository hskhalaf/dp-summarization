But if you have some good batter, and not the cheap stuff a hotel uses, this makes a really great waffle. Make sure to pick up some whipped cream and make some blueberry compote! Oh, one thing that I did dislike was the Timer does not have a second button like shown in the picture. It is also not 'built-in' to the device. It is a removable timer that requires us to replace Batteries over time?? I don't remember reading about that anywhere, so I have to go with 4-stars.",

      "title": "Excellent waffle Iron. BUY IT!",
      "text": "Our 10 year old waffle Iron died and we've been on the hunt for a new one. We purchased two others, one of which had Teflon coated grates, which I refuse to cook with, and the other was sloppily manufactured, and terrible quality. This thing is amazing. It requires no oil/butter/spray to avoid sticking, they just don't stick. They make beautiful evenly cooked waffles that are soft and fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside. You'll be hard pressed to find a better waffle Iron. Some people have complained about the timer, but I find it easy to load, flip and start timer, then I continue on with whatever I'm doing and wait for the audible alarm.",

      "text": "I wish there was temp control, but other than that, this is a very good Belgium waffle maker. The storage upright option makes this a top selection although it is a pretty cheap peice of plastic that holds the two sides in the upright position, it seems well enough to withstand normal use. Rough use will break this fairly easily in my opinion though. The cord is a decent length and the timer is okay, although I would rather something a little more sophisticated than a simple digital one.",

With the recipe I use, it also takes about 8 minutes to cook a waffle through. BUT when they are done, and they do not stick they are perfect waffles! Waffles are a weekend treat at our house and I would recommend this machine. Just be aware that the waffles need to be thoroughly cooked, when they are, they are far less likely to stick.",

Try cooking them for about a min less but even this isnt perfect all the time. The vertical stand tabs are flimsy and dont stay.

I tried a cheap on from a garage sale that did the job but the waffles were never as fluffy as they were with this waffle maker. So when that one broke, I went back to this one. I think the secret is the flip function. I also really like the timer function, as sometimes I would forget to put a timer on and burn the waffle!",

When locked in the upright position, the waffle maker takes very little room in my cabinet.",

I really like the fold up storage feature--it fits perfectly in our cabinet above the oven with a small footprint compared to most other waffle makers. This is a simple but very effective waffle maker. You just pour in about 3/4 cup of batter, close the lid, and flip it over and wait about 4 minutes (the time my batter stops steaming). I get consistent waffles that are cooked evenly on both sides. Recommended.",

I guess I am out of 40.00 because the waffles made with this iron are not athetically pleasing at all. I have to literally pull the waffle out of the grates with a fork. I will have to purchase another waffle iron, this time from a company other than Presto.",
