      "text": "I bought an inflatable SUP a could of years ago. My original bag started to rip open at the seams. I bought this one to replace it. This bag is quite an improvement compared to my old bag. It has plenty of handles for multiple carrying options. The side mesh is perfect for letting the moisture out. The pocket is spacious enough for accessories and emergency kits. The main compartment is very spacious for my 11'6\" board, paddle, pump, and PFD. The backpack straps are comfortable and easily adjustable. There's an optional hip belt which I haven't used yet. So far so good. It has stood the test of traveling",

We can fit the board, pump, paddle, life jacket, and a rolled up wetsuit in with some room to spare. I am however worried about durability. The material it is feels awfully thin. Almost paper'ish? Hard to explain I guess. If you packed this thing to the max I have no doubt the zippers would tear away from the fabric based on the way it feels. As for now we are happy with it. Hopefully we can get a few years out of it before it falls apart.",

    "rating": 4.5,
    "feature_bullets": [
      "Grab your BPS Premium Universal iSUP bag today! Designed by an experienced paddle boarder to fit ALL inflatable paddle boards up to 12\u20196 in length and 34 inches in width \u2013 INCLUDING having the inflation pump rolled up \u2018inside\u2019 the board. It ALSO includes an especially designed roll strap to hold your board and pump once \u2018rolled up\u2019 - making it easier to put into your bag, and mesh panels to allow a wet board to dry.",
      "With dimensions of 39.37\" x 17.72\" x 14.17\u201d, BPS iSUP bag is large enough to fit everything you need for a SUP session. BPS have included four separate ways to pick up, carry or hang up this bag because real world tests showed how helpful and useful extra handles on the side AND the top of the bag are. Whether moving the bag within a room or garage, lifting from the ground into a vehicle, lifting up off an airport carousal \u2013 you will have the handle you need to use a good lifting technique.",
      "Padded shoulder straps have a large adjustment range (fits a 30 inch chest easy and a 46 inch chest easily as shown in the photo); a chest strap with a large adjustment range spreads the weight even further; a padded layer between your board and your back adds real comfort; an internal pocket at the rear of the bag (with sealable Velcro) stores your paddle where it won\u2019t dig into your back and can\u2019t catch on anything or fall out (or scuff your board); and two heavy duty zips.",
      "There are two variations available \u2013 one with an extra external pocket at the back \u2013 or one with the flexibility of adjustable Bungee Laces on the back of the bag. The extra external pocket is large enough to fit a towel, an XXL men\u2019s wetsuit, a pair of wetsuit booties and a water proof phone wallet (all zipped up). To make putting your board away super easy - you will be emailed photographic instructions on how to use your new bag and strap when you purchase.",
