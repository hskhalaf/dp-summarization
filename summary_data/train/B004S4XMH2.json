Both times for me it was easy to install and worked great right away. The sound quality is not amazing but it's not bad. You're making up for non-existent acoustics in the open air so loudness is more important to most of us than the nuances in the harmony. And these do have volume, no question about that. I usually use mine at about 1/4 of the full volume and sometimes turn it down from there. Ride safe!",

I did not have windshield on and from teh direct wind hitting the ends of tehse, they faded out the chrome paint on them.

I zip tied it to the throttle cable housing and let it protrude about 3/4 inch. You can adjust with your thumb very easily. It has PLENTY of volume. It does take some time and skill to install due to the wiring that must be routed and hidden. Very happy with purchase.",

The only thing I would advise is to include the fusable link with the kit instead of spending the extra time going to the parts house to buy one. I hope these hold out through the long trips I take with this bike. Sounds good so far.",

I recommmend you plan your installation route and connections ahead of time. I installed these on a 2005 Harley Sportster 1200C. I utilized the supplied brackets by attaching to the Lower windshield mounts. I have a friend that installed a $400 system that side by side can hear no discernible differnce in the sound quality. Really Pisses him off! I wear a 1/2 helmet and have no issue whatsoever hearing my tunes at 1/2 volume at any speed. If your looking for great affordable sound these are the ticket! Will post pics",

I mounted them low on my crash bars tho, to keep my handle bars less cluttered... the sound isn't as loud obviously because they aren't at ear level, although I did test them on my handle bars. Sound great when mounted at ear level With power to spare.. I prefer looks over sound, so I went with the more aesthetic mount.. over all, even down low, at under 60 mph you get great clear sound!

Would highly recommend and the price cannot be touched by anyone else. Saved several hundred over what's offered by HD and these look great as well. Even have a bluetooth adapter that works great as well. Buy these if you want good tunes on your bike.",

I took the bike out in a 40 mph wind going 70mph and it was crystal clear. If I could ask for two things from Boss it would be a more flexible mounting system and better instructions for where to tie in to the wiring. I ended up on a line that is always hot so I had to add a switch to turn off the amp and save my battery. Not a big thing, just something extra I had to do. Over all very happy with my purchase.",
