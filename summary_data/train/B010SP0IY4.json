I have not taken this on a trip as yet, but, the reception in my driveway is excellent, towers about 20 miles away. The included amplifier is way above anything else I have seen so don't skimp and keep the old RV Cable/antenna switch, this one is the real deal. Even has video outs. One thing to note, some instructions say there is a large plastic nut to tighten on the neck, not needed on this model with large stainless screws through the neck. Overall vey pleased so far. I was not paid anything nor did I receive anything for this review.",

This antenna is a great replacement for the stock one and you dont have to remember to put it down. DO NOT USE THE POWER AMP IF YOUR CAMPER ALREADY HAS ONE. hooking both of them inline will fry the antenna after a few min. And you will give it a 1 star. This will do as good as a batwing and not need to fool with directing it. I am very good with electonics but I gave this 4 stars because anyone could install this if it had instructions. Why don't you have instructions.",

      "text": "This antenna is great! We recently bought a new horse trailer with living quarters and it had a satellite dome installed on top. We did not want to have to pay for a receiver when we may not be even watching much tv in the trailer. My husband ripped the guts out of the inside of the satellite and hooked this antenna up and put the dome back over it so you can't even tell we changed anything. The antenna works great! Plugged it in and we have way more channels than the house antenna gets which is mounted at least 30 feet higher in the air. Definitely recommend this antenna!",

Seemed like an easy choice. Much less than some other options, and Winegard had discontinued my batwing. Unfortunately, this thing only pulled in 9 channels vs to 27 i was getting with the Batwing. Since this IS for an RV, we do stay in some out of the way places, and it just won't work for me. We ended up the the Winegard Rayzar. Almost $300 more, but it works better than the batwing so far.",

After days of searching the internet and doing comparisons with the big name brand RV antenna companies, I chose the 1byone. Wow, was I surprised at the performance of this little omnidirectional antenna. It's pulling three times the stations I was getting with my old OEM, and I know that it is getting stations from at least 55 miles from me and this is a tree lined hilly area. Great product!",
