The manufacturer very nicely send me a replacement unit but it behaves exactly the same way At this discharge rate a 225mAh capacity battery CR2032 should last about a year, mine both lasted a few months ( I assume the provided battery was not so good). Bottom line I keep the battery out when not in use which is ok for occasional use, but not for daily use.",

Additionally, it gives the readings in 1/128 units, with no ability to round it to 1/32 or 1/16. so a spec of dust on a 3/8 thickness might read 49/128 (1/128 thicker than a 3/8), and you have to now start calculating fractions to figure out what it is.",

The accuracy of this is perfect for my use. There is not any play between the measuring slide LCD display and the ruler itself - none at all. The action is smooth and easy and it retains it's position, does not move a bit when you are measuring. I am very happy with this product, it appears to be more expensive than it sold for.",

The digital display is very large and easy to read. Settings convert from inches to MM with the push of a button. Auto off function if you forget to turn it off as well. With calipers fully closed, there is button to zero out the display as well, for very accurate measurements both inside and outside measurements. Replacement button batteries are readily available. My ONLY negative is the thumb wheel that operates the open and closing could be a bit tighter fit. But overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase.",

I purchased these as a replacement for one of the ~$5 cheaper models where the battery compartment had failed in some weird way that prevented it from working with the cover attached. The design of this type should hopefully prevent that failure from occurring. The extra $5 provides a product that is incrementally better. It slides a little smoother and has less play in the mechanism. The fractional display is a nice feature when trying to sort a bunch of old drill bits, and when compared against items of known dimensions the accuracy is fine.",

Most of the calipers display this digit in a very small size. 2) The battery cover on this unit slides on and off easily. On many other units, they use a cover with a small screw to hold the battery in. I have had trouble striping and loosing this small screw. I like this simple cover much better.",

Purchased this model partly for the fractional measurements, but found it not that useful. The Harbor Freight digital caliper I bought some number of years ago, I would guess for less than half the price, gives far less frustration.",

The three display options (decimal inch, fractional inch, and decimal millimeters) are one of the main reasons I went with this model instead of other similar devices. I've found all three display units to be very useful, and the large display is very convenient. The original battery is still going strong, and it was even shipped with a spare battery. This probably wouldn't hold up to the same abuse as a far more expensive Starrett or other professional-grade caliper, but for my home workshop, it's perfect.",

You can use two coins to measure brake calipers to \"reach\" about an inch into where the brake pad touches. I will introduce my son into accurate measurements with this. That's what this is for, no more. I would buy this again.",
