The LEDS are a nice touch, green at rest and red while charging. The only negative, and it's not a big deal, is that the LEDs are pretty bright. It'd be nice it their intensity was toned down a little. Other than that, this is a nice little unit and does the job well.",

Since it only engages the bottom inch or so of the controller, the track it sits in is shorter and makes it easier to slide it in and out. Its essentially the same form factor as the OEM Nintendo PowerA dock without me having to pay Nintendo the $30.00 they wanted for it at Christmas. Switch is pretty cool but there is nothing about it that is inexpensive so I was looking for a good alternative. This is it.",
