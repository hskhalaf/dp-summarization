The user interface is a bit non-intuitive, if you haven't worked with a router interface before. On the upside, sending and receiving has consistent speed. It is noiseless. And, it is reliable. I purchased this over two years ago and it is still going strong. For a \"budget\" router, this is a great buy.",

Other than that, the unit seems to be working properly, but the data displayed by the Web based control panel is often incorrect. It often requires using a computer connected to the network, and command-line instructions to find the status of various network hardware. This is particularly true when some of the network attached items are assigned static IP addresses.",
