All of the plastic pieces seem a lint thin...Until this happened I was in love. Now to go online and search and see if the piece is replaceable.",

      "text": "This is a large unit. It\u2019s what we wanted. In my opinion it is not for daily use for unless you cook and freeze meals. Very sturdy. Rinse clean then put in soapy water for a few minutes. Then just clean off any stuck on food. We put the parts in the dishwasher. Not sure if really dishwasher safe. No heat drying. We use the unit for parties and family get togethers. Because there is some time between uses we have to re-familiarize ourselves with which part goes where. There is an abundance of parts and accessories that come with it. Make sure you buy the unit that comes with the storage case.",

Avoid the headache. Just my opinion.",
