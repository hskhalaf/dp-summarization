      "text": "Very impressed with this machine. Intelligent functionality and intense cleaning on both hard floors and thick carpets. Can\u2019t see why you need to pay the extra for the 980. Bin size is critical as this is what needs most of your attention while cleaning. Also looked at Dyson but the customer service experience was very poor. So good machine and good experience- this is a winner.",

It's supposed to go back its charging station when battery is low, but we had to find it all around the house. Even after sending for repairs to Germany, there was no improvement. It's been to Germany twice, still no improvement.The supplier and amazon has refused to replace after repeated requests. Amazon says, they don't sell it anymore, but it's there on listing. Just avoid it. I am frustrated and un-happy with this.",

Poor all round really, it might be acceptable if it cost around \u00a3150. I had to buy a handheld for \u00a330 to clear up all the crap it leaves behind.",

The machine cleans superbly, handles the carpet very well. We carry it in other floors to clean there, no problem. Very small Lego (1ers, flat pieces) get eaten but most of it gets pushed aside. Every now and then it needs the be emptied which is dry easy to do without needing to read the manual.",
