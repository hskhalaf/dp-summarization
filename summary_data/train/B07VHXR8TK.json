      "title": "Consider Ordering Two Sizes",
      "text": "While these certainly run large, I\u2019m hesitant to say you should just order an entire size down because the sizing goes up and down by a whopping 1.5 inches. That said, I usually wear a size 12, and the \u201c12 - 12.5\u201d size was a solid inch too large in both the dark gray and mahogany colors... Ultimately both of these shoes are of the usual (great) quality that comes with the ECCO brand, but this specific model does indeed seem to be sized differently/larger compared to other ECCO shoe models, so just consider buying two sizes of the same color and then return the one that doesn\u2019t fit.",
