The manual that comes in the box doesn't give you NEARLY enough information - do yourself a favor and find the full manual on Olympus' website. Pros: +++ Extraordinarily full-featured for it's price point (if you've got the patience to dig through the menus) ++ VERY effective image stabilization ++ Excellent portrait and landscape photo quality + Sturdy build and awesome, retro look + Relatively low noise at high ISO settings Cons: -- Disappointing actions shots, especially at dusk/night - Wireless photo upload app is wonky",

This camera for the price deals you can find it for now is hard to pass up. Even the downturn flip screen is useable if you are into selfies. I like the form, function, and the fact that this camera together with the Olympus 12mm, 25mm, 45mm trio of lenses will deliver some amazing images. It's a darling of a camera and I find that I take it everywhere I go. The bet part is that it makes you want to go out and take photographs. Good street photography contender.",

Olympuses will work with Panasonic lenses as well as their own, including updating firmware and using OIS, so if you're not video exclusive you should buy Oly. The Panny 25mm 1.7 is $150 as of this writing, which is insanely cheap for such a lens.",

I recently picked up the PL7 as a way to get back into photography after some time away and it is a fantastic camera that suits both casual and prosumer needs. The camera handles incredibly well in a range of situations and produces great quality images. I really like how small the body and included EZ lens is. I can slip it into a large coat pocket and take it with me on walks or bike rides.",

The menus are complex, but using the PASM touch control panel on the display makes it easy to set a large number of parameters from one screen. Very cool!

    "title": "Olympus E-PL7 16MP Mirrorless Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD with 14-42mm IIR Lens (Black)",
    "description": "Color:Black| Style:Body w/ 14-42mm IIR L| Configuration:BaseDetailed information still to come\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nCONNECT THE SHOTS\nThe E-PL7 is an interchangeable lens compact camera with a modern twist. It delivers the otherworldly image quality you expect from Olympus \u2013 no surprise there. But its built-in WiFi and upgraded Olympus Image Share app let you control the E-PL7 from your smartphone and post images instantly. Add unique features like a downward-opening touch screen, touch-screen shutter release and three-axis image stabilization \u2013 which make capturing fantastic self-portraits easier than ever \u2013 and creative tools like Art Filters (14 of them!), and you have a camera perfect for today\u2019s hyper-connected world.\n\nBEAUTY IS IN THE DETAILS\nThe E-PL7 features the same sophisticated core image processing technology \u2013 16MP Live MOS CMOS sensor, TruePic VII processor and in-body three-axis image stabilization system \u2013 found in Olympus' acclaimed OM-D E-M10. Paired with the superior optics of one of the many available m. Zuiko lenses (more on them below), this technology captures every nuance of detail and color in your subjects. We\u2019re not kidding \u2013 the image quality you can achieve with the E-PL7 will astound you.\n\nMAKE YOUR SMARTPHONE AN EXTENSION OF YOUR CAMERA\nThe E-PL7 opens up a new world of improved self-portraits with a 180-degree downward-opening touch screen that keeps your hand away from the lens, customizable interval shooting (with on-screen countdown and autofocus recalibration after every shot), and e-Portrait mode (for smoother skin tones). Even better: the E-PL7's built-in WiFi turns your smartphone into an extension of your camera - giving you even more shooting options than ever before including complete control over your camera settings, remote control shooting and instant sharing via the OI.Share app.\n\nSOPHISTICATED AUTOFOCUS FOR INCREDIBLE SPEED\nLife moves fast \u2013 but the E-PL7 is faster. Its autofocus system is so quick you can take 8 frames per second at full resolution and every one will be sharp and clear. The 81-point AF grid covers the entire frame, allowing you to select the focus area that best matches the image you\u2019re visualizing. And improved autofocus tracking enables you to pan on a moving subject and keep it sharp against a dramatically defocused background.\n\nA BIGGER-THAN-EVER CREATIVE TOOLBOX\nOlympus is known for the wide variety and extensive in-camera creative tools which puts them high on the fun factor. The E-PL7 will extend that reputation thanks to its 14 Art Filters \u2013 including the new Vintage and Partial Color filters \u2013 HDR and HDR bracketing modes, and the Focus Peaking feature, which highlights the exact point of the focal plane that\u2019s precisely in focus. Another cool feature is the camera\u2019s ability to convert individual images captured during interval shooting into striking time-lapse movies.\n\nLOOKS TO MATCH THE LEGACY\nAs you might expect from the latest model in Olympus\u2019s legendary PEN series, the E-PL7 wraps powerful photographic performance in an elegant skin. Faux leather wrapping and brushed metal accents recall legendary cameras in the original PEN series from the film days. But the amazing thing is that this compact, stylish camera provides the lens interchangeability and high-res image quality of a traditional DSLR system. Who says beauty is only skin deep?\n\nSO MANY LENSES, SO LITTLE TIME\nAt Olympus, we\u2019ve been expanding photographers\u2019 system options for nearly 80 years. It seems hard to believe that such a small camera can handle 15 different m. ZUIKO lenses. You can choose among an impressive assortment of Micro Four Thirds fast primes, telephoto zooms and macros, or go minimalist with the 9mm fisheye or 15mm wide-angle body cap lens.",
