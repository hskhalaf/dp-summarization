All i can say is it works and i have no side affects. P.S. Don't just buy any Tea Tree Oil as there are some out there that are not the real deal. I will be buying again from Healing Solutions.

I diluted a few drops within water (I think the standard ratio is 1 part tea tree, 9 parts water) in a roller ball, and would apply it to acne a few times at night before bed, after moisturizing. Usually 2-3 times would really do the trick! Pleasantly surprising. - Works for pain & feels refreshing. - So many uses! I also used it when shampooing. Works wonders. THE CONS: - Strong odor. Not a bad odor, but strong. - It would be nice if it came with a dropper! But seriously.",

I think that\u2019s normal for tea tree oil though, along with the strong scent. It doesn\u2019t have a dropper, just a small opening, which I actually prefer.

Every bottle of tea tree oil is suppose to be different because the uniqueness of the particular tree from which it was harvested guarantees that bacteria cannot adapt and gain immunity to the oil as an entirety. This is why this natural oil is effective since it is diverse and variant from bottle to bottle. Reviewers that complain of inconsistency are uninformed, the bottles must be inconsistent for maximum effectiveness.",
