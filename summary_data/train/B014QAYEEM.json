These are better quality than what they use at the majority of restaurants. These are really amazing when you are serving soups. These are larger than traditional American silverware, because they are used by putting the spoon against your mouth, and then tip the contents inside your mouth, you don\u2019t use these like traditional American spoons. So if you are not familiar with this way of eating soup, you might not like these. Used correctly, they are amazing and functional.",

My only critique is that the square corners make it awkward to get everything off the spoon... other than that they are perfect.",

And there are several items that match the color on Amazon for a full Japanese set at a cheap price. The spoons are long enough that I have 32 oz melamine bowls and they don't fall in. Even bigger or deeper ramen bowls would make the spoon hook to the side, staying clean for use in your soup thanks to the handy design. They also work as chopstick holders, which is great since I have stainless steal circular ones that roll easily.",

Someone actually asked about this in the questions section, and all the responses affirmed red. So I guess maybe there are different colors for different factory batches, with most folks getting red, but others like us getting dark orange.",
