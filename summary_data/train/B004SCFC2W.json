Don't buy these if you need a reasonably quiet non-humming ceiling fan - you've been warned in advance. That said, if you just want a great looking fan and don't care about loud hum, you're good to go with this one.",

Things I don't like: Because it moves to be level on any ceiling, when you pull the chains, it moves the fan. Not too bad but I don't like it. The lights that it is built for aren't that bright.

I love the way it looks, but when the fan is on a high setting, it sounds like it's going to break, on medium and low settings you here the motor making a humming noise. I don't think this is normal. My light switch is standard and does not have the dimming switch. That is why I am giving it a 3 star.",

I'd like to switch out to LED's, but the globe is difficult to remove. I know it will be super annoying now that it's mounted, so I'm procrastinating for bit. Once I make the swap, I hope it corrects both the heat and the dimness issue.",
