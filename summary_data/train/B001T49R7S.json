Also, the plastic soft case they came in lists/shows one of the two 8\u201d files as double cut - that is also NOT TRUE. pretty sloppy I think and brings into question the care and quality of products sold by Nicholson.

For some reason, leather and files are two of the things that it seems like the best come out of Mexico. Excellent workmanship. As nice if not nicer than anything I\u2019ve seen.

    "title": "Nicholson 22040HNN 5 Piece Hand File Set with Ergonomic Handles, American Pattern, 6\" Length, (2)-8\" length, (2)-10\" length",
    "description": "The Nicholson file set is an assortment of 5 files in a variety of shapes that have ergonomic handles and American pattern teeth for non-precision material removal in a range of home or shop uses. Attached rubber-coated handles provide an ergonomic grip. The set comes in a vinyl pouch for storage.\n\nHand files are used to remove material and smooth and shape workpieces. They have forward-facing cutting teeth and cut when pushed over either a stationary or rotating workpiece. Single-cut teeth are single rows cut diagonally across the width of the file. Double-cut teeth have two sets of rows cut in opposite directions. American pattern files have three coarseness grades. Coarse, also known as bastard cut, is suitable for efficient, heavy material removal where finish is not a concern. Medium, also known as second cut, offers average material removal and finish quality. Fine, also known as smooth cut, provides the smoothest finish. Swiss pattern files have eight coarseness grades, from 00 (coarse), 0 (medium), and 1 to 6 (fine to finest), offering a smoother finish than equivalent American pattern files. For Swiss pattern files the length of the tool is the length of the blade, not counting the tang, which is the pointed end fitted for a handle; for American pattern files the length of the tool is its entire length, including the tang.\n\nNicholson manufactures hand tools and power tool accessories.
