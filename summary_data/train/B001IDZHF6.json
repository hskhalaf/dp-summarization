Welds look ok, you can see they are done by hand not robot. Pretty much silent operation. I can lift it one handed to put it to the side when not in use. Tubing gauge is sufficient for decent life expectancy and durability. Overall better then I expected for the price. I recommend for the average user that is making an effort and trying to find an affordable option.

The assembly for the monitor was a little hard to figure out in the beginning but I found a video on YouTube that helped. Bought the 2 year protection plan just in case something happens, but great piece of equipment if you don't have a lot of room in your place for a bigger piece of equipment.

Therefore, I don't use this as much as I would like to. Is there any way to fix this at all to make it not resistant at all? Or am I just doing it wrong?",

The instruction book recommends slightly dis-assembling the tension cable to lubricate. I didn't dis-assemble it; I just sprayed the area with \"liquid wrench\" and wiped away the run-off. The squeaking stopped and hasn't returned. The highest tension setting provides a good work-out.

My favorite thing is that its small and light enough that I can actually move it from room to room depending where I want to use it, even up and down the stairs. And yet it feels extremely strong. I hate exercise but I find myself jumping on this thing frequently just to break up the day and get a quick workout in. I didn't assemble it, my very handy fiance\u0301 did, so I can't speak on that but he said it was easy. I think it's a great purchase.",

Offers good resistance so I'm breathing pretty rapidly after 100 steps.
