      "text": "The first time I played music through these I was like, arrrghhh the treble is terrible! But rather than immediately asking for a refund I turned the treble down on my phone and turned the bass up a bit, now they sound pretty reasonable. It is a shame that I have to mess with my equalizer so much to get them sounding decent, and when all is said and done they only sound decent, they don't sound great. But I love the fact that these are bluetooth, lightweight and have washable inserts, as I use them in the gym. They are also fairly cheap, so I'll be keeping them.",

I have charged once since buying them and they're still going 3 weeks later. Really impressed and would def buy again. Love the touch sensitive panel for controls. Don't hesitate, just buy it!",

They sound great,are sweatproof and are super comfy,well after a day or two they were,due to the nature of the sweatproof,washable cushions. Long story short..if like me you don't like earbuds..these are just the job. The only way they could be better would be if they were rainproof as well! Maybe Hellas 2.0 will be,eh Urbanears?",
