      "text": "This oil gave me a HORRID headache and smells like an offbrand peppermint candy tastes. I was leery to purchase this one because there are others that hold a dear spot in my heart, but I wanted to save a few bucks. I purchased two other scents (lavender and lemon) and they smell okay, but this one has been sitting in my cabinet since I pinpointed it was triggering my headaches. Won't be purchasing again. One thing I DO like that this purchase came with was the awesome dropper! Convenient, and made counting the drops so much easier.",

I bought this along with the Fractionated Coconut out from Majestic Pure as well and used in combination the very first day I got them. I use about 2 capfulls of the coconut oil and 3-4 drops of the peppermint oil (it comes with the dropper). Very good for taking away sore muscles after 12 hour days on my feet. It also helped greatly with my terrible winter time sinus infection. The services on this as well was excellent. I received the products way before the estimated time and everything was as requested. I WILL order more items from Majestic Pure. Thank you!!!!",

I soak cotton balls in the oil, and scatter them around the RV. Since doing this, no more mice signs. The only problem is that I have to recharge them about once a month, since the smell fades. Some people may not like the peppermint odor, since it is really strong. But I like the smell of peppermint, so it's not a problem for me.",
