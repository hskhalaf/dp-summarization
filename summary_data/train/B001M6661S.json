This one is not sturdy enough for that. I ended up getting a nice custom made box and giving this one away. If you are a wood worker, you will hate this cheaply made box. Don\u2019t let the dovetails fool you. When I received the package, I thought it might be empty. That\u2019s how lightweight it is. The brushes are also very small. It\u2019s a shame how quality has gone down so much.",

I was reimbursed for my purchase by Amazon, which is awesome customer service. I'm a little skeptical if I want to use Kiwi's brand for wax and polish given some of the quality issues on the box. I'll try out the product on my cheaper shoes to see if its works well first.",
