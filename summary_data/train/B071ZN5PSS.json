Not expecting alot but I tell you what hooked this up it sounds awesome. Sounds are way bigger than the speaker. Sounds like you have a separate bass hooked up. The sound is excellent. There is a voice setting that brings the voices out so you can hear but doesn't ruin the rest of the listening experience by putting to much voice and killing the rest of the background. Very good speaker.",

Make sure you tweek your TV sound settings to make output in Bitstream and DTS. It worked like a charm with my Samsung 55\" 4K UHD TV. I bought Yamaha NS-SW100 sub to pair with this soundbar as it obviously lacks on low end despite built-in woofers. But they start from 60 Hz and power is low. Adding sub made this setup very decent sounding combo for total price paid. I can't compare with other soundbars, but from what I experienced in 2 weeks of using it, I don't need anything else. That is what my guts saying.",

I originally purchased a no-name soundbar for $110 and had to return it because it had a dent and because the sound was just not good enough. Mid-range was thin and no bass at all. For not having a sub-woofer, this little bar puts out an impressive amount of bass. The mid-range is full and highs are crisp. With the surround option on it really fills the space and makes watching classics like Star Wars fun again. Highly recommend this bar!

I previously had a brand that could not handle changing from the cable provider to the TV to the DVD. This one, using only the optical connection, makes switching seamless. No loss of sound or switching from bar to TV sound.",

Using the ARC HDMI from my TV and everything works perfectly. Can also connect to my echo dot via bluetooth for bonus music. Would recommend to anyone looking for a non-sub reinforced soundbar...this ones a winner!",
