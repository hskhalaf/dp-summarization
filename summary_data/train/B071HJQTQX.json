I use this backpack for nearly all my outdoor trips, vacations or when i just need to pack a bunch of random things together (anyone say fishing trip?) My only drawback with this product is with the pocket for the water bladder. If the bladder is filled to its capacity the shape of the bladder effects the wearer to where its uncomfortable. I've had to fill up the bladder to a minimum for this. This seems like it would be a common problem but i guess one that people just deal with.",

I realized that the insulated water bladder pocket was sewn wrong. Whoever made the bag sewed the backpack straps so close to the zipper near the top of the bag that the water bladder pouch will not completely zip shut. I'm very disappointed and hope that I can get some sort of replacement. Other than that the bag seems sturdy and has lots of pockets and places for hanging your gear.",

All of the zippers worked well and it rode well on my shoulders. After 20 miles I had no shoulder or waste bruising or chaffing.
