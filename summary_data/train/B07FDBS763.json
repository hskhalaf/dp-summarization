      "text": "These would probably do great on trail - but looks are nothing special. Plenty of cushion everywhere, springy - very unique feel but in a good way. Sole grips on everything. I wear a Medium but opted for a Wide because of many other reviews stating that Merrell\u2019s run narrow and wide has great amt of room but then the whole thing just feels bulky (clumsy). Lacing system does NOT poke anywhere, nor does the design (yeah I am talking to you Danner and Under Armour and North Face). My takeaway - it won\u2019t win any awards in the looks dept, maybe once covered in mud, but form and function is definitely there - but a bit pricey.",
