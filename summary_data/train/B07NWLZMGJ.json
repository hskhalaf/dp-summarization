Fingerprints on the actual phone and slight scratches on the aluminium. 4. Started the phone and it was unusually warm on the bezels. 5. Paid for return postage for the device to add insult to injury. Clearly a customer return for a suspect unit. Very disappointed so had to return. I may have been unlucky, but it wasn't worth the risk given the price of the unit. Be careful when buying.",

Other than that I dont see much difference with S8+, so dont expect too much, there is no wow effect from the upgrade. Also the phone seems to be heavier than S8+, maybe because I opted for ceramic version. Overall makes me wonder if XS plus was a better idea.",

Wish they could improve battery life but iphone and Huawei arent better (most of them dont last as long as s10+ anyways) The biggest con. The chipset. In u.s. people pay the same price for a better phone with a snapdragon chipset. In uk Samsung used the Enxyon. Not fair at all, I'm disappointed in Samsung. Really, paying a lot for a phone is one thing. Paying the same price for a inferior product... ugh. Overall love it",

It's just intended for the eastern european market hence the cheaper price (\u00a3200 compared with e.g. carphone warehouse). You get the european plug in the box but they added a uk plug to sort this out. Can't complain for this price. There is also a charger + cable included and some usb-adaptors and headphones present in the box (see picture). There is also a factory warranty leaflet present. Would definetly recommend.",

It was delivered very promptly, and it was in pristine condition, easily seen that it had come from the factory. Moreover, the seller was very helpful and even offered me a refund for postage- costs, as I requested a refund. I have now cancelled this, owing to the scratches being on the screen protector.

I was fuming that these can be advertised as UK versions, obviously Samsung won't honour a phone warranty that has been tampered with so I don't see how this is any different. Ended up having to go to argos to get one as i was sick of the to and fro. The phone itself is amazing but I cannot vouch for these modified versions.",

I also love the camera and the features it provides and how you get an ultra-wide lens. Overall, it's the best phone I've ever had. The only reason there's a star missing is because of the packaging. The amazon box had a bash at the side and felt slightly damp but the phone was undamaged and packaged well.",
