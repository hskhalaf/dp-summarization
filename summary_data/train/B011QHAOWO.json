Belkin now makes a similar product (see other reviews) that may be worth checking out. Belkin usually makes well designed durable products. In addition, the apps for Belkin's equivalent product are free, including for Apple products. Slingbox charges $5 per Apple device which can add up. It appears that the main drawback to Belkin's product is that it is not as easy to set up. Since I already had a Slingbox, I purchased a Slingbox replacement.",

I don't know why all the fuss about ads, (I'd rather not see them, & I've never purchased an item from an annoying flash) after a few seconds on my laptop the entire screen only shows the program I'm watching. So I'm very happy that I can watch my Sat Box the way I want to watch it. To me it's freedom from a cellular company ramming their packaged media down my throat. As they say, so far so good!",
