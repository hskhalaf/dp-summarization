Don't use the included tools though I used my eyeliner brush. I did it twice to get the eyelashes I didn't get the first time but probably only need to do it once in the future now that I understand. Definitely plenty of product for future use.",

Also, I use separate mascara wands to apply the two liquids [not a q-tip and comb as the directions suggest]. Works with no mess for me. I love it!",

This is why several applications may be necessary. Since the tips of my brown eyelashes are lighter than the bases, this has made my lashes appear longer. My eyebrows look a little fuller, too.

      "text": "I have very light eyebrows and eyelashes. I did my eyebrows first. Left step 1 on for a minute and then applied the gel. Turned my eyebrows black!!! I looked ridiculous with my reddish brown hair and dark black eyebrows. For some reason I decided to continue on to my eyelashes. I had the complete opposite problem; the dye did absolutely nothing for my eyelashes! So there I was... reddish brown hair, dark black eyebrows, and blonde eyelashes. What a mess. Never ever again. I\u2019ll stick to filling in my eyebrows and using mascara every day. (Thankfully the eyebrows faded to a lighter shade within a few days)",

      "text": "Affordable and easy to use, whole process takes 10 minutes if that. I use for eyebrows, that have lightened over time (although my hair is still medium brown). Two step process, generously apply liquid to eyebrow hairs with Qtip , then comb on the gel (little brow comb provided in kit), wash off, viola! And it lasts a good month-to-5-weeks.",

      "text": "I purchased the color brown. It turned black. The comb is only good for the lashes and it globs up. It is hard to work with because it works so fast. I didn't see any difference to my lashes but my brows turned black, not the color I was going for. I went to UTube for instructions because the print is very small on the instructions. I would not purchase this product again and will probably not use it again. I'll throw it out. Waste of money.",

      "text": "Actually the photos of one of the reviewers were very helpful. Instructions do not have any. It is easy to use, takes just few minutes. I used it twice so far on my brow only. I think it lasted about 4 weeks. The color of brown is actually almost black. It stays on the skin as well so if you do not immediately clean it well from the skin you will see the final effect within 3 days.",
