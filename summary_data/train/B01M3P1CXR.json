I used the nails that came with it, but I noticed the wood leaned in a little so I used some extra scotch wall tape (that came with some wall hooks I bought awhile ago). Adding the tape keeps the wood lined up straight and more secure. All the pictures I hung on this frame are 3.5x5 inches. I was able to hang 27 photos total. I've had my camera in my friends and family faces for a year. I can't wait for them to finally see their pictures when they come over for Thanksgiving!",

I did however purchase some extra photo clips that were a bit smaller because I had so many pictures to hang up and this only Came with 30. Now I have room to add more photos and can\u2019t wait to see what I add in the future!!",

It comes in three different pieces on each side that you put together and then hang up. You can tell it is cheaply made but when its hanging up it's really cute. I got complimented on it and plan on adding some lights along the strands. I also like that you can have the strands more dangling or separate the sides more so that they are completely straight.",

      "text": "This product is made very cheaply. You have to put it together yourself; and assembly takes a bit of time. It also needs to be hung via screws, etc. I had to use push pins to display this item with old pictures for my daughter's 30th birthday, as we couldn't put nails or screws in the wall at the hall we rented. A bit disappointed at the quality/sturdiness of the picture photo hanging frame.",

The wood cracked on one part when I screwed them together and ended up having to wood glue it. It is not something I\u2019d recommend to someone who isn\u2019t handy because you very well may need to adjust a few things to make it look and hang correctly. Considering the price for how many photos it hangs up I\u2019d say it\u2019s not a bad buy but just be prepared to make some modifications.",

The two hanging rods do not run parallel because string length at the end is different from string length at the beginning. There is also less hanging space between strings than I expected. However, my 10 year old grandson was very happy with having a place to hang some of his pictures, so that in itself makes it worthwhile.",
