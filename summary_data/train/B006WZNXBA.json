He can pull up on it without it tipping over. It is heavy, much heavier than plastic ones, so turning corners needs some assistance. He loves the cogs on the side (unfortunately the only plastic part!) too, plays with them a lot. I think this would be fine for older children too who are just walking, or want something to push around with their bears in.",

In addition it has rubber grips on wheels to protect floors and slow the toy down for a new walker. The gear toys and maze toys are also a fun feature for a seated baby.

All that being said I would totally suggest getting the cheap plastic walkers. More so because the wood walkers are too heavy for little ones to turn and manipulate.

My daughter has had this since she turned one and she LOVES it. She pushes it, gets in it, puts *&^% in it, tosses *&^%out of it, and likes to play with the little toys too. It is also incredibly attractive - out with the atrocious rainforest jumperoo and in with Hape Wonder Walker! Thank heavens. Like swapping tuperware for real plates.",

      "text": "I bought this walker for my baby girl who was 9 months old at the time. We decided on this one because it is made out of wood, has a few activities on it, our baby girl can grow into it, and it has a place to store other toys. Our baby girl is now 10 months old and has started to walk around using it and hasn't fallen over yet because of how sturdy and heavy it is. She loves to play with the different activities and stick her other toys into the storage place. I would definitely recommend this toy to anyone who has a baby boy or girl.",

      "text": "Great, classy toy. I bought this for my 10 month old baby who is an accomplished couch cruiser, but won't stand or walk alone. It is sturdy enough for him to pull up on without tipping, and he walks behind it ( In a straight path only). The wheels have green rubber on them that grip the hardwood and carpet well when in use. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because when he pulls up on the side of it, it has a tendency to tip sideways because it is narrow. However, it's not really a long way to fall, so he gets up and tries again.",

I love that the wheels have rubber on them to make it slower on carpet. None of the \"activities\" on here seem to interest my daughter, but that's okay because to me the most important part is that she's not going to accidentally pull it down on herself. I also like that there's a little \"storage\" area so she can push around other little toys like blocks or stuffed animals. Highly recommend.",
