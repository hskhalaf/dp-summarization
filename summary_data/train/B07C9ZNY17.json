They connect together as well, which makes it easier to get more power. The Sony NPF battery that comes with it is small and will last around 1 hour at full power.

I actually dropped this light on the ground a few times and it still works! I love the adjustable temperatures as well. It helps for matching street lights or even sunlight in the daytime. I've used for video as well and it did amazingly. The microphone mount is a necessity. Great option for those who are on a budget!",
