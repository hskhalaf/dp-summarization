      "text": "I bought my first pair of Vasque hiking boots about 8 years ago & have logged many, many miles in them. I have a hard to fit size (9-9.5AA) and Vasque is one of only 2 manufacturers I know that makes women's hiking boots in narrow widths. This pair arrived quickly & fit perfectly! I will replace the stock insole with a high-arch version since my low-volume, high-arch feet need additional support (which I do with practically every shoe that I purchase). The style is outstanding & I can't wait to test them out on a wet, cold hike soon!",

Even brand new, I've been wearing them 8 hours a day comfortably. Still, I would recommend trying on hiking shoes before buying them, because each one is so different and it's all about what shape is right for your foot.",

In this case, they are definitely running on the small side. The quality and feel will be amazing once I find the right size! Think I will save the back and forth and try on at a local store.",

However, I am very disappointed because the wide width is still somewhat narrow in the toe box. The toe guard presses on both sides, the little toe and the joint of my big toe. My feet are just barely a wide. Very sad as only by wearing them for a time does this problem present itself. On the good side, the GoreTex lining does not leak, which is one of the main reasons I purchased them (that and the mostly leather upper boot). It fit's ok in the heel. If you need a boot with a roomy toe box, this is not it.",
