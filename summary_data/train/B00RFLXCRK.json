I bought this one because it didn't need an external power supply and is light and very easy to install. I get a lot more channels with this antenna than I did with the more expensive one. Works so good that I bought a second one for the TV in my other room.",

The one thing that is a big drawback is it does not stay affixed to the wall -- it falls off every time I close the back door which is a decent distance away. In the bedroom I got about 34 channels and almost 50 in my study. You do have to play with the location to see what works best to get the maximum number of channels, so as such I strongly recommend to do an channel scan after placing it in at least two locations.",

Also, there is no good way to test a location with this antenna before mounting it (touching it interferes with reception), and the mounting tape included does not remove easily. In fact, we had to move it after mounting, and the tape ripped a 4\" chunk of paint off our wall. Overall, we'd recommend this style and brand, but a longer reach than you'd initially consider.",

This isn't your grandpas antenna, construction is definitely on the cheaper side. But in the 6 months I've owned it, I've had no problems. Its held up to a pretty brutal winter with ice storms over 1/2\" accumulation, as well as the gusting winds of a tornado alley spring. Antennaweb quoted there were 19 possible channels in my physical location. This antenna picked up 23. I'd say that's a win, and worth the money paid for it.",
