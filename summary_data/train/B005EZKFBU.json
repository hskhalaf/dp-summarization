        "With a broad feature set aimed at enthusiasts, tilting LCD, nicely implemented filters, good performance, and excellent raw photo quality, plus a price that's less burdensome than the E-P3's, there's a lot to appreciate about the Olympus PEN E-PL3"

I own an ageing Olympus E-510 and was sceptical of the whole pen series of cameras. Now l am a convert. I took the dive because this camera and lens was so inexpensive. After a week I started to plan on my next micro 4/3 lens purchase. Well played Olympus, well played. Read the other reviews here for details as they are dead on in their assessment of this camera.",

There are a lot of modes that I do not use often (all the scene modes) but all of the priority modes I do use frequently and they work as they should. I got a fotodiox lens mount adapter and use my PK lenses on this camera with no problems! Love this camera so far, but the real test will be a trip next month.",

I noticed that extra lenses are quite expensive, so I order a lot of old OM lenses for cheap off ebay and a adapter for it and its lots of fun to play with it to get great pictures. Also its hard to get a good grip because of the slim design but I fixed that with a Flipback G4 Grip for$10 dollars and it makes a LOT of improvement.I will post pics.",

The only downside is that it's minimum ISO is 200 and the bracketing function is somewhat limited. I would recommend this camera and it is an unbelievable value for the price.",

The camera itself is about half the size and weight of a DSLR but is not a put in your pocket camera. It has no view finder. For the price I got it, it was a good deal. Makes a great travel camera.",

The only issue is that in auto mode the shutter speed was slow and lead to some blurry pictures, so I slowly practiced and worked up to using full manual mode (other than focus) and got some awesome shots. it did break on one trip but I had purchased the drops and spills warranty so once I got back to the states, I sent it in and it was fixed and back to me in no time.

    "title": "Olympus PEN E-PL3 14-42mm 12.3 MP Mirrorless Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 3x Optical Zoom (Black)",
    "description": "Color:BlackFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n> VIEW THE WORLD FROM A DIFFERENT ANGLE.\nYou love preserving memories, but you\u2019re ready for more creativity.\nMore control. More options for capturing unforgettable images. The E-PL3 inspires innovation and is perfect for those who require a versatile, portable camera filled with advanced yet easy-to-use creative technologies. Its high-resolution 3\u201d articulating LCD features a new interface that makes it easy to access the effects you want from any angle.\n\n\n\nPROFESSIONAL IMAGE QUALITY\n12.3 MEGAPIXELS\nThe new 12.3 megapixel Live MOS sensor is optimized to maximize the performance of all m.Zuiko digital lenses in any shooting condition. Improvements to the sensitivity and read-out speed of the existing sensor makes ISO 12,800 shooting and Full HD movie recording possible.\n\nSTABILIZATION TECHNOLOGY IN THE BODY, NOT toucIN THE LENSES\nSay goodbye to blurry images. Olympus\u2019 in-body image stabilization technology makes it possible to use any Micro Four Thirds lenses (or Four Thirds lens), from wide-angle to telephoto, for perfectly clear, crisp photos no matter what the shooting situation, even in low light!\n\nIMPROVED COLOR REPRODUCTION\nThe new TruePic VI Image Processor, designed specifically for the Olympus PEN, features Real Color Technology for improved color reproduction (especially colors such as emerald green, yellow, and gold) and color gradation. The faster processor also allows for a shorter recovery time between shots.\n\nFACE DETECTION WITH EYE DETECT\nNail the focus for every portrait photo, every time. The new face detection AF employs an \"Eye Detect AF\" that adjusts focus automatically on the subject's eyes during portrait shooting and can even be adjusted to focus on the right, left or near-side eye. The Face Detection function captures up to eight faces, reducing the chance of blurred subjects when shooting several people at once.\n\n\n\nBLAZING SPEED\nWORLD\u2019S FASTEST AUTO FOCUS*\nThe new FAST (Frequency Acceleration Sensor Technology) AF System is able to focus at an incredible speed and offers 35 separate focus points that are spread over nearly the entire sensor, which makes it possible for pin-point accurate focusing on small subjects wherever they appear in the frame. Selectable 3x3 groups within the 35-point area are especially effective when shooting active subjects.\n\n5 FPS SEQUENTIAL SHOOTING\nWith the E-PL3 you can take up to five photos a second, allowing you to easily capture that perfect shot, especially when your subject is moving.\n\nADVANCED CONTINUOUS AF & TRACKING With the improved AF system, the AF Tracking function locks your subject into focus and continuously adjusts focus and brightness even if the subject disappears from view momentarily.\n\nADVANCED CONTINUOUS AF & TRACKING\nHigh-precision engineering and an improved internal focusing mechanism have allowed the Olympus MSC (Movie+Still Compatible) lenses to auto focus quickly, smoothly and silently, perfect for stills and movies.\n\n\n\nCREATIVE FREEDOM\nFULL 1080 HD VIDEO\nShoot up to 29 minutes of 1080 60i HD video and stereo sound in either AVCHD or AVI formats. A Direct HD Movie Button switches you from still to movie mode with just the press of a button.\n\nIN-CAMERA ADVANCED ART FILTERS\nSix in-camera Art Filters (Pop Art, Soft Focus, Grainy Film, Pin Hole, Diorama and Dramatic Tone) are enhanced by new filter variations, art effects and bracketing. Photographers can use Art Filters in all shooting modes as well as filming HD movies.\n\nNEW 3D SHOOTING\nAdd a new dimension to your photographs in any mode from macro to landscape with Olympus\u2019 3D technology. By simply selecting the 3D Photo Mode, releasing the shutter, and slowly panning, the camera will automatically take a second image from a slightly different perspective. The 3D data is processed in-camera resulting in an .MPO file, the universal industry 3D format, for easy display on 3D televisions or laptops.\n\nIN-CAMERA SLIDESHOW WITH SOUND\nSlideshows have never been easier or more fun to create. The E-PL3's enhanced playback functions allow you to employ effective fade-in/fade-out techniques, control the movie/still mix and speed, add captivating musical soundtracks, and much more.\n\n\nEASE-OF-USE\nNEW THREE-INCH TILTING WIDESCREEN LCD\nThis bright, 614k dot high-resolution screen comes with the AF (Anti-Fingerprint) coating. You don\u2019t even need to worry about fingerprint smudges.\n\n\n\nEXCELLENT SHOTS - EFFORTLESSLY\niAuto automatically identifies the scene you're shooting \u2013 portrait, landscape, night portrait, macro, or sport \u2013 and adjusts the settings to optimize results. The E-PL3 is also equipped with 23 Scene-Select modes for effortless picture taking, including Fireworks, Sunset, Children, Macro and Panorama, to name a few. There are even three scene modes that are specific to shooting with Olympus\u2019 conversion lenses to optimize the performance of those lenses.\n\n\nUPDATED SCREEN DESIGN & LIVE GUIDE\nThe E-PL3\u2019s Live Guide system allows you to preview effects as you adjust them \u2013 before the image is even captured. Simply select Live Guide and turn the wheel on the back of the camera to slide through numerous photographic effects, such as brightness, color saturation, tone, etc.\n\nOperating the camera is more intuitive with the newly designed user interface. The on-screen graphics have also been updated with a sleeker font design and an automatic pop-up guide in the menu screen.\n\nGET WIRELESS\nNo need for cables or even a computer. Upload or email images directly from your camera with an optional PP-1 PENPAL\u00ae or Eye-Fi\u2122 card. The E-PL3 is also capable of recording stills and video to SD, SDHC, SDXC and UHS-I media cards.\n\n\n\nLOW LIGHT PERFORMANCE\nAF ILLUMINATOR\nThe addition of this super luminosity LED beam allows the camera to focus faster in low light up to almost 10 feet.\n\nINCREASED ISO SENSITIVITY\nStunning low light photos are a click away with an increased ISO sensitivity to 12,800.\n\nATTACHABLE FLASH INCLUDED\nThis camera provides the flexibility to attach a flash to your camera via the accessory port, or leave it at home for maximum portability",
