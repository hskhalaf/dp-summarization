But these have something hot wheels don\u2019t have. They pull back and race forward! My kiddo loves it. So far the cars have been of good quality For the price and no broken or other low quality issues. But if that changes I will update this review. Nab it on sale. My five year old is super happy with it so far.",

I was worried they might be cheap looking, but since the Hot Wheels calendar only had 8 cars I decided to take a chance on this set. I am so happy that I did. This is a really nice advent calendar. The box is decorated nicely and is very colorful. I opened it to make sure all of the cars were there and was pleasantly surprised by how nice the cars are. There is also a nice variety of cars. My grandson is going to love it. I would definitely purchase this item again.",

They dont break apart easily but if you are intentionally trying to do so, a kid would be strong enough. He likes to take things apart So it works for him. He still has several of them left and still enjoys playing with them after having this set for over a month. They are light weight. I would not suggest these if you have a little who likes to put things in their mouth etc, as they are small/have smaller parts that come can detach with some effort.",

Oh yeah the cars themselves are made of cheapest plastic but it\u2019s for a toddler. He doesn\u2019t know. The cars can be pulled backwards the let go and are propelled forward.",
