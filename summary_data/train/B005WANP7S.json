I enjoy this type of work, but if you don't you might consider having it professionally sharpened. It does hold an edge very well and has darn near perfect balance",

Had to work on it a LONG time with my coarse stones to clean it up to where I could even begin to put a working edge on it. Could have used a CMT Extra Extra Coarse diamond bench stone. Otherwise, the steel seems OK so far. This is a tool best used for heavy stock prep. It is not a finesse tool.",
