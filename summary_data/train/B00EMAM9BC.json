The brush separates my lashes and evenly coats each one to make them look FULL and long. I also use the waterproof one when needed and it never comes off when swimming and works just as well to coat each lash. Not sure I will ever switch to another brand!",

It doesn't apply very much at once though, so if you want a heavier application, it will take a while and will start to dry as you apply (which I hate, as it ruins the smooth application). I suspect it's best for very fine lashes (where clumping and excess product is a common problem). My lashes are on the thicker side (the actual hairs are thick, although they're sparse in areas). For me, a wetter formula works better and faster to add drama. For this, I recommend Maybelline's Full and Soft, which is still my favorite.",

I can spend all day in the ocean or swimming and at the end of the day it will still look amazing. I also love using it on hot summer days or when I go to the gym. To take it off easily I just use Vaseline and it will come right off. I tried using makeup remover but it takes more time and effort.",

This mascara is easy to apply, nice and dark (very black color), and it doesn't irritate my eyes.

I have cried and swum with this mascara without it coming off--it is the most effective waterproof formula I have tried. If you keep it on for a very long amount of time, it begins to flake a bit, but nothing too bad! Even clumping is minimal, though sometimes you may want to comb through the lashes if you really build it up. My lashes are light and sparse, and this mascara makes me look very blessed. I love it, and will keep coming back!",
