I think I know why: the indicator light (which is supposed to turn green when your waffle is ready) is in accurate. Your waffle will stick if the surface is not cooked enough and the indicator light consistently says your waffle is ready too early. The trick is to very gently try to open the waffle iron for a few seconds. If you meet resistance, your waffle is not ready and will rip if you force it open. If the waffle iron opens with a second or two of gentle force, you're good to go.",

I used a setting between 3-4, and they came out perfect. Later, I made corn waffles with a box of Jiffy mix. I will never make cornbread any other way again. The corn muffin waffles were crisp on the outside and perfectly moist (the only time you can use that word) on the inside. I did use non-stick spray, and resprayed after about 3 uses. I am so looking forward to many more waffle-shaped goodies.",

These new improved plates do not conduct the heat evenly even after allowing it to pre-heat for 20 minutes and you get a brown ring in the middle of the waffle with under cooked edges. Not appetizing at all. We returned for a refund.",

One small gripe is that this 7-1/2\" iron only makes 6-1/2\" waffles; the cooking area is reduced size.

The temperature slide control? I have three other older (over 5 years) Cuisinart small appliances -- either this is some type of knock off or their quality has taken a nose dive. I hope for the former.",

      "text": "Perfect! I searched forever for a waffle iron that would 1. Cook quick 2. Make crispy, thin, light, waffles 3. durable 4. easy to store 5. ease of waffle removal It is all of these! I make homemade waffles every Sunday morning, we all look forward to this tradition! This iron makes it easy and delicious! We set in on level 4 and it also cooks them quick, with 6 people you still want to get to eat together, but also eat it right off of the iron- and this allows us to do it. For a while we had two, so we could keep up. We only need one now, and they are really crunchy!",

I would say the only downfall of this waffle maker is that it doesn't have a little beeper to tell you when the waffle is done, the light just switches from red to green.

    "title": "Cuisinart WMR-CA Round Classic Waffle Maker, Silver, 1",
    "description": "Color:Silver| Package Quantity:1\n\nCUISINART WMR-CA ROUND CLASSIC WAFFLE MAKER\n Get ready for more of a good thing with the Cuisinart Classic Waffle Maker. Bake delicious waffles fast with this gleaming stainless steel appliance. Nonstick plates, indicator lights and a regulating thermostat make operation easy while the five-setting browning control mean your waffle will always be baked to perfection. Top chocolate waffles with ice cream for an update on the ice cream sandwich, or try cheddar cheese and chive waffles as an out-of-the-ordinary complement to soup or chili. It\u2019s time to break away from breakfast!\n\nFEATURES AND BENEFITS\nBrowning Control Adjustment: Five settings to customize waffle maker from light to deep golden brown\n\nIndicator Lights: Signals when waffle maker is ready to bake and signals when waffles are ready to eat\n\nWeighted Lid: Lid will not rise as waffles bake\n\nRubber Feet: Prevents marking countertop and keeps unit steady\n\nBrushed Stainless Steel Covers: Clean and sleek look for any countertop\n\nCord Storage: Cord wraps under bottom for easy storage \n\nCLEANING AND MAINTENANCE\n Once you have finished baking, remove plug from electrical outlet. Leave top lid open so grids begin to cool. Never take your waffle maker apart for cleaning. Simply brush crumbs from grooves, and absorb any excess cooking oil by wiping with a dry cloth or paper towel. You may clean the grids by wiping with a damp cloth to prevent staining and sticking from batter or oil buildup. Be certain grids have cooled completely before cleaning. If batter adheres to plates, simply pour a little cooking oil onto the baked batter and let stand approximately 5 minutes, thus allowing it to soften for easy removal. To clean exterior, wipe with a soft dry cloth. Never use an abrasive cleanser or harsh pad.\n\nSTORAGE\nWhen waffle making is completed, simply store your maker with the cord wrapped securely around base. Plug prongs fit into the special grooves on the side of the waffle maker. For compact storage, stand waffle maker on opening end so Cuisinart logo is facing you. The waffle maker has been designed with a special latching feature so the lid stays closed during storage.\n\nTIPS ON HOW TO MAKE THE PERFECT WAFFLES\nCuisinart recommends the heat setting #3 for golden brown waffles. If you prefer crisper, darker waffles, increase the browning control to setting #4 or 5. For evenly filled waffles, pour the batter onto the center of the lower grid and close the cover. We recommend using 1/2 cup batter per waffle for evenly filled waffles. Waffles are best when made to order, but baked waffles may be kept warm in a 200\u00b0F oven. Place in a baking pan or wrap in foil while in the oven. Waffles wrapped in foil may lose their crispiness. Baked waffles may be frozen. Allow to cool completely, then place in plastic food storage bag. Use waxed paper to keep waffles separated. Reheat in a toaster or toaster oven when ready to use.\n\nPRODUCT FEATURES\n *  Bakes one large traditional-style waffle\n *  Five-setting browning control\n *  Regulating thermostat \n *  Nonstick baking plates\n *  Brushed stainless steel housing \n *  Red and green \"ready to bake/ready to eat\" indicator lights\n *  Instruction/Recipe book included \n\nSUGGESTED TOPPINGS\n * Syrups: Maple syrup, fruit syrup\n * Sauces: Chocolate sauce, fruit sauce, warm fruit compote\n * Powders: Powdered sugar, cinnamon sugar blend\n * Nuts: Chopped almonds, walnuts, pecans, macadamia nuts\n * Fruit: Any variety of berry\n * Dairy: Whipped cream; ice cream; sorbet; yogurt",
