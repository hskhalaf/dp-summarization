Now i wont get my money back but i can let you know is not worth it. It makes good wofflea and has great heat. However i have to give it less starts than what i would like. The cover of the light popped and broke and the little pieces on the attached pic ended up inside the woffle some how this was just after the second use.",

I've had it over 6 months now and the iron isn't cooking as eventually as it was in the beginning and suddenly started sticking and not properly cooking waffles every time I use it. Overall, it's not even getting the job done and a waste after only a few short months. I regret this purchase and wish I had listened to poor reviews I read prior to ordering.",

It was easy to use. I sprayed it with vegetable oil at first and never have to spray it again. I have no idea what the green light was doing because it stayed on all the time but I timed my waffle and took it out on my timer. Clean up was easy, light soft cloth with dish washing liquid and wiped it down and it is ready for my next use. I highly recommend this product!",

A couple hints: let the batter thicken 30 minutes and then adjust viscosity with a few drops of water. Use a spray on shortening to keep the waffle maker really non-stick. Enjoy!",

      "text": "Make SURE YOU USE QUALITY NON STICK SPRAY. Cheap butter ones will still leave your waffles broken inside and stuck to the plates . Kinda hard to clean but makes a great well cooked waffle. Beware the smoke and smell lasts almost forever even though the instructions say they go away. Definitely worth the buy. Use Stainless steel cleaner for top surface",
