      "text": "This is a great printer. I am an HP fan and have been for a long time... but this Epson PictureMate Deluxe Viewer Edition Photo Printer is fantastic! When you buy this be sure to buy the optional Battery... then just take this printer along where ever you go and you'll be the life of the party. The Quality is fantastic! The ink cartridge prints many more photos than advertised (A nice change indeed). The operation is simple and very straight forward (My seven year-old Daughter just loves it) With so many options built into this printer you may never hook it up to a computer. I can not praise this printer enough! Bravo Epson!",

It prints very hight quality photos, and has a lot of editing options available, so you don't have to go to your computer first to edit. One drawback is, when we use a 1 gigabyte jmp drive, it searches the whole thing for photos, and this can take a while. At first we thought it wasn't working, but it found all the photos, even searching all the subdirectories. The printer is very easy to set up and very versatile, given that it prints up to 4x6 inch photos. So far, we're quite happy with it.",

The ease of getting started within 5 mins of getting it out of the packaging was also great. My photos have never looked better. The only thing I would like is more border options such as blurred edges and such. My husband who did not think this was a smart purchase loves this printer now.",

This is much better than going to a store to have it printed. NOTE: I used two SanDisk SD memory cards and only one of them worked. After calling Epson technical support for this printer, I was informed by a helpful, knowledgeable representative that this printer cannot recognize SD cards over the capacity of 2.4 GB. So this card:didn't work in this machine. The other card I used was 2.0 GB. Other than that, this machine works quite well, and I highly recommend it.",

Fun for all ages from 10 years and up. Even my Mom loves it! If you are using a Cybershot, you will need the card adapter. It accepted the Olympus card without an adapter.",
