Great product. Unfortunately, they do contain soy and I found out my son has a dairy and soy protein intolerance and these upset his tummy:( otherwise, I loved them!",

      "text": "I was excited when New Chapter came out with this postnatal multivitamin because during my first pregnancy I took the New Chapter prenatal and felt great. However, my experience with this postnatal was unfortunately not good. I became severely nauseous when taking these, and to make sure it was coming from the postnatal I took it for three days with no other vitamins or fish oil. After stopping I was immediately relieved from the nausea. Although it did not work for me it may work well for others. I liked the fact that these are non-gmo, the herbal blend is organic, and it is easily digestible even on an empty stomach.",
