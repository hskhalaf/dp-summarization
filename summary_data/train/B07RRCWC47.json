These are used for Olympic lifts. Inov-8 never lets us down. All of their shoes are made as intended and if you have plantar fasciitis this is the brand to try and stick with even after you heal. Best support all around and I\u2019ve tried many shoes. Give their running/cross trainers a try too. Best color variety as well.",

The sneakers have stiffer than average soles with a wide and stable base. They are ideal for deadlifts and other weight lifting exercises where you need a stable base. These are definitely not running shoes, but they work fine for HIIT type exercise routines. They are very supportive around the ankle and well cushioned. In a size 12.5 they fit my husband's long and narrow feet well. He usually wear a size 13 sneaker and these fit fine. All in all... great weight lifting sneakers.",

These keep your feet flat and stable on the ground so you don't injure yourself. They fit a bit snug as they should but not tight where they are uncomfortable. They have laces as well as additional velcro strap to keep your foot from moving. The color is a little more green in person but no big deal. They are made well and should hold up. Again they aren't for regular average wear like sneakers, these are designed for weightlifting.",

The solid foundation that they gave me was astounding and definitely keeps me safer in the gym while wearing these particular shoes. Definitely worth having.

    "description": "Inov8 Fastlift Gamma 360 Training Shoes Offering stability and flexibility the Inov8 Fastlift 360 Training Shoes is ideal for high powered lifting and functional training. Inov8 Shoe Fit Scale For technical footwear, a good fit is essential to enhance your performance. Inov8's new Shoe Fit Scale makes it easier to find the perfect fitting shoe. All Inov8 shoes are designed with Met-Cradle technology to lock down the mid-foot for a stable hold, where they differ is in the toe box. The shoes are now graded from 1 to 5, Grade 1 representing their closest, most precise fit and Grade 5 representing the widest fitting toe box. The lower the number on the scale, the narrower the fit, which ensures minimal internal movement of the foot when running fast on technical terrain. Shoes with the higher numbers on the scale will suit athletes with a wider foot and those wanting that extra comfort in the toe box. This wider toe box allows the toes to splay for increased stability when lifting heavy weights. It's also perfect for longer runs and races when toes begin to swell. Inov8 have graded the Fastlift Gamma 360 Training Shoes as Grade 4. Protective Upper Constrcuted using a super-durable yet flexible material, the upper of Inov8 Fastlift 360 Training Shoes offers added protection whilst still allowing the foot to flex naturally. The upper works to protect your feet from knocks and bangs and remains super durable so you can use it time and time again. It also allows for freedom of movement so you can lift and squat with comfort and ease. Additionally, the fabrication also features perforations which increase airflow to keep your feet cool, dry and comfortable at all times. The increase in airflow creates a perfect microclimate for your feet to thrive in and reduces an uncomfortable heat build-up. Ballistic nylon overlays have also been used on the upper to provide support and structure as well as increased durability. As well as this, the heel features an External",
