It lost the first star for the worst assembly instructions I have ever seen and it lost the second star because of the bolts that are longer than they should be but are restrained by their \u201cM10 Nylon Nut\u201d. This makes the foam pads where your legs are loose and unsecured, doesn\u2019t instill much confidence when you\u2019re upside down. It\u2019s also not clear how this can be folded and stored. So close to having an excellent product. The metal is nice quality and the upper pad you rest your hips on is quite supportive. Hopefully my feedback will help them refine a solid product.",
