At first I had thought the batteries needed to be replaced, but after replacing them with fresh ones, the unicorn never moved. The only thing that happens when you switch it on is the eyes and mouth stay closed shut and there is a musical chime. I can also hear what seems to be the motor struggling to get things going, but it just never moves. I had to order a replacement and will have to swap the broken when my daughter doesnt notice.",
