      "text": "These are great burp cloths. I will give them 5 stars but will say this: They get a little misshapen every time I dry them. It\u2019s like the fleece interior is not totally attached to the cotton exterior and rolls up inside. I have to remove them promptly from tumble dry low and vigorously shake them out. As if they\u2019re covered in dust and I\u2019m shaking the dust off. This seems to help prevent the inner fleece from rolling around the edges but some of the burp cloths are still not perfect and have lumps inside. That being said, they are super huge, super absorbent, love the designs, and I would still recommend them.",

One critique is that when you wash them, the batting in the middle can shift and cause wrinkles. Instead of drying them in the dryer, I shake them after the washer and line dry them. This eliminates the wrinkles, but is annoying to remember to remove them from the dryer load.",

They\u2019re thin enough to wipe the baby\u2019s face carefully, but thick enough that nothing is going to soak through them. Plus I\u2019m pretty sure they were priced the best too. I use them under the baby while side-lying nursing, to mop up a massive spit-up, to dab her mouth after a small spit-up, or to lay across my breast if I\u2019m leaking and one of these is within reach.",
