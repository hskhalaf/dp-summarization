      "text": "On my old stovetop, I could use any brand degreaser to remove oil stains easily without have to use much elbow grease. However, with this new stovetop, the degreaser that work perfectly with my other stovetop no longer gets the job done. I had to buy some expensive stovetop cleaner which is the only thing that will get the oil stains out of the black stovetop. If it was easier to clean, I would give it 5 stars. Besides that, installation was easy and everything works fine.",

      "text": "Best price, but design has some flaws.. however the cut length was larger than my prior GE unit, so had to cut half inch more from my counter. The pipe connection comes underneath the unit and not quite in a corner, so it was obstructing the cabinet drawers below from sliding. Had to cut drawer size to accommodate. The gas flow seem to be large than my previous unit, however the grates are little too tall from the flames so cooking time is more than my previous GE unit.",
