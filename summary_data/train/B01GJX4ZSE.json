      "verdict": "The Saucony Linchpin was meant to be an all-around running shoe for users who are casually active. Considering the make, the quality, the price and the features of the shoe, it seems to do the job in the all-around category. It can be a good choice if a moderately pronated runner is looking for a reasonably-priced stability shoe for road running, casual wear or light workouts.",
      "pros": [
        "A few reviewers felt that the Saucony Linchpin had enough arch support",
        "Most reviewers felt that the Linchpin is priced moderately despite it being a stability shoe",
        "Several users mentioned that the shoe provided the right amount of comfort to their feet",
        "One user observed that the design of the shoe catered to wider feet",
        "She appreciated the extra room in the toe box",
        "Many testers appreciated the functionality of the shoe",
        "Most used it for work or for gym sessions",
        "One user mentioned that the shoe is of decent quality despite the price being inexpensive"

      "cons": [
        "Various users felt that Saucony skimped on the design of the shoe",
        "They described the design as unappealing",

        "One reviewer mentioned that there wasn\u2019t enough cushioning and that the sole unit felt rigid",
        "A tester mentioned that the shoelaces did not tighten enough to provide a snug fit",
        "One of the shoes in a pair turned yellow, said one reviewer",
        "It caused her to stop using the shoe and find another pair",

On the face of it they are supposed to be a step up from the Grid Cohesion in that they are claimed to offer better support/stability. They are priced significantly more. The support claim is true. But they run much smaller and much tighter than the Grid shoes. And they quickly develop tears in the cushion lining on the upper front near the last lace eyelet and tongue.",
