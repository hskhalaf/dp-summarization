I have a small room so i dont have a lot of space for a small office desk and a chair so this works well and its sturdier than i thought. I recommend this to everyone.",

It is sturdy enough for my 17\" laptop and using it as a rest for my hands/wrists as I type. When fully extended, it is slightly wobbly, but nothing I've been concerned with. The gray raised bumpers at the bottom (lower edge) of the desk are detachable, which is excellent. The bumpers got in my way, so the removal of these items make this desk much more flexible.",

      "text": "After working from home for six months I was missing my standing desk in the office. My desk at home is too small to accommodate most of the set ups to work standing up and this does the job perfectly. It is the perfect height to use as a standing desk when fully extended and has an adjustable tilt. Plenty of room for my laptop and a mouse. It\u2019s light and easy to store away under my desk when not in use. I also have used it on the bed and it works great for crocheting or knitting as well.",

Received it a couple nights ago and quickly put it together. It has made a terrific difference in the soreness in my neck as I'm now more ergonomically positioned. I spend a lot of time sitting on the sofa with my laptop and honestly, I can feel the difference. Plus, my lap is no longer feeling the heat from the computer.",

After about 12 different types, I found two I swore by for durability, stability, and function, this is one of them. I like that you can tilt it and it has many different height settings. I was worry about this one falling over when I needed to set it down as my laptop is large and heavy. So far I have not found any reason to doubt its stability. I am very happy with this and will purchases more when/ if needed.",

I do wish it had an adjustment to make it just a little lower, as sometimes it seems a little tall to me even on the lowest (shortest) setting. I've never used any setting other than the shortest. I guess the taller settings are for if you want to use it on your desk so that you can stand up while you work. Highly recommend!",

I wish it could go a bit lower though, as I end up kind of having t-rex hands when using it on the couch. Tilting it diagonally helps, but my lappy is quite heavy, so it's not ideal.
