She did not like the wheel so we have her little one on the top platform. She was chewing on the water bottle plastic so we took her old one and attached it to the outside, problem solved. The cage comes apart fairly easy for cleaning. I recommend this cage to anyone with a mini hamster!",

Bummed that we are out of 60 bucks. Wish that the description would include what size hamster this would be appropriate for.",
