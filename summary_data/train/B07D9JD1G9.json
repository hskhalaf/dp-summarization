The only thing about this shoe that seems to even qualify it as a tennis shoe is the thick sole. It's basically a slipper with a thick sole. I wore them on the court twice and rolled both my ankles... I have never had ankle problems in my life. If you move around on the court aggressively, these are not for you. Bought these banking on Adidas living up to some reasonable standard, but these fall well short.",

These shoes give solid footing and a wide base to avoid being able to do just that. I highly recommend them if you are interested in finding a new shoe for the pickleball court!",
