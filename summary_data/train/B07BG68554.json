They squealed and jumped with joy when we surprised them with this sweet little house. The directions were easy to follow and we were able to assemble it in under an hour. The simple styling and soft colors made this an easy purchase for me, as i\u2019m not a fan of the bright, tacky colors. Thank you Step2 for a high-quality toy, that doesn\u2019t make a dent in my wallet! My kids, and their friends, will no doubt be spending many hours playing in this adorable house!",

It\u2019s a bit plain but it was the most affordable one I could find. The only thing was that the step 2 sign fell off right away. Otherwise it\u2019s held up fine and only took about 30 minutes to assemble with a drill.",

It took my husband less than an hour and is very sturdy. It currently is in our play room and I love the color scheme. I was going to put it outside but may just keep inside because they enjoy it so much!",
