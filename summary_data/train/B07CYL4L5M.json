We used all the decorations for the baby shower and people were impressed by the look and designs. Inflating with the straw took some getting used to but it worked.",

The banner looked a bit cheap but matched my expectations based off the item photos so I was not disappointed when it came in the mail. The poms are always a struggle for me to pull apart and puff up but these I was able to do without ripping any. Overall great purchase for the price!",
