      "text": "It arrived promptly and had enough charge after an hour to tackle the front lawn which was horribly in need of edging. The tool was powerful enough to cut through pretty thick blades and vines as well as easy to use. Those extremely large vines has to be cut with a shovel as this tool and line aren\u2019t strong enough to handle the job. Overall it\u2019s priced great and I\u2019d certainly purchase again. After more usage I\u2019ll update this review.",

I had forgot to charge the battery the night before, and only plugged it in for 30 minutes, but it quickly charged and I was able to finish my small yard before it died. Hopefully it lasts because I know my dad used to regularly replace his electric trimmers.",
