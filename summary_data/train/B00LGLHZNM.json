I like the depth, though, because it allows me to make pies with extra fruit. (So far, I've only used them for fruit pies and the occasional brownie.) The bottom crust also seems to crisp up well in them. I haven't had any problems with the plates exploding. I usually bake them 30-60 minutes in a 350*F-375*F oven. -- (Daniel's wife)",
