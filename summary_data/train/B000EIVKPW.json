      "text": "This is a great little camera. I love to take photos, and for years struggled with f-stop exposure, shutter speed, and all the other settings that always caused me to delay my shot and thus miss the perfect photos. Now, I just put it on Auto and shoot away. Downloading the images to my computer is fast and easy. Timed shots for including myself in group photo shots is super easy, and so on. I have now worn out 2 of these cameras and ordered a 3rd. While I take most of my shots wiht my iPhone now, I still find the Lumix the best way to get some shots.",

      "text": "Was looking for a camera with a optical zoom greater than the normal 3X, but small enough to fit in your palm. This Panasonic was the perfect size and am still learning all the features. Pictures are the best of all middle range digital cameras I have used--Sony, Nikon, Fuji, Olympus to name a few. The stabilization feature makes using this camera a snap. Very intuitive features, good support software for the computer. I was especially amazed at the video quality. Battery life is much better than expected and have not yet exhausted the intial battery charge over the holiday usage.",

It is a good size, not to big like most cameras with this much zoom. It's not a small sassy thing, but I really wanted a good zoom. The multiple picture settings are great, even takes awesome night shots. There is virtually no blur in the photos. I don't take great pictures, but with this camera I have been impressing myself. Highly recomend this camera. I recomend getting extra battery so you always have a charged one available.",

I can take professional quality pictures that are sometimes up to par with my friends' $1000 professional cameras! My mom is an artist and bought this camera to take pictures of her artwork and art subjects because it takes \"true color\" photographs, meaning the color that comes out in the pictures was the actual color she saw with her own eyes. Many other cameras at similar price wash out the color a lot or make the picture look very grainy. I love this camera!!",

      "text": "My shopping criteria included a wide zoom range and image stabilization in addition to good image quality. This camera does a good job at all of these. One thing that is a little different with this camera is that you use a half press on the shutter button to engage autofocus. If you just snap away without doing that you might get some out of focus pictures. I happily accept that since the 10x zoom gives you incredible flexibility composing shots. The image stabilization also seems to be very good, which is pretty much a requirement for hand held photography with a zoom range like this. I purchased this with a Panasonic branded SD card and the combination works great.",

I was prepared for lower quality images indoors without a flash, but the Lumix does not do nearly as well as my Canon Elph in identical lighting situations. The flash is good, but if you want a camera to shoot indoors without flash, be prepared for fairly noisy images with a lot of artifacts.",

I thought not having any manual controls would be a minus - but there are so many pre-set scene modes that it hasn't been an issue. I love, love, LOVE the zoom and the fact that it fits easily in my purse or a jacket pocket. I definitely recommend this camera to anyone who wants a small camera with lots of zoom!",

My main complain is about software: I can not choose diferent flash intensity levels (shots in not well iluminated indoors are really poor)and I can not choose the ISO mode (to avoid bad pictures of objects in moving). Besides the night shots mode is not as good I expected. My general opinion is that this camera could be really better if the software would be more versatile.",

Please remember to buy an extra battery, the first charge lasted an impressive 180 pictures, but with out another battery, you're done for 3hrs (charging time). Quick to turn on and use, extra quiet and can be very candid without using the flash. Enjoy!",

      "text": "The camera took great pictures in daylight, but had some kind of flash sync problem that resulted in 75% of flash pictures coming out completely dark. Since the problem didn't appear until a month after I purchased the camera I couldn't return it to the store. Panasonic acknowledged the problem and I sent in the camera for repair. The repair will take a full month. They had to order a board from Japan. I find it ridiculous that they have no stock of spare parts in the US. This is my first Panasonic camera and likely my last. I've been very happy with four Sony digital cameras in the past.",

    "title": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ1S 5MP Compact Digital Camera with 10x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Silver)",
    "description": "Color:SilverFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ1S 5MP Compact Digital Camera with 10x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom features a refractive prism lens unit that allows zooming to occur horizontally within the camera. This makes it possible to pack a powerful 10x optical zoom -- equivalent to a big 35 to 350 millimeter lens on a 35mm camera -- into a compact camera. The Extended Optical Zoom function, which magnifies the image with minimal deterioration by using the center part of the high-resolution CCD, boosts the zoom power of up to 12.5x.\n\n The Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ1S produces crisp, clear shots of moving subjects with the ISO 800 setting and high sensitivity mode, thanks to the camera's Venus Engine III. The higher ISO setting lets you use higher shutter speeds to minimize the motion blur that can occur when you're shooting a moving subject, particularly in dim lighting. Even indoors, you can get crisp, clear, beautiful shots of children, pets and other subjects that won't hold still. You can also help avoid motion blur automatically by using high sensitivity mode.\n\n Choose from several auto focus modes -- spot, 1-point (normal or high-speed), 3-point high-speed, and 9-point -- to suit the scene you're shooting. The Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ1S also introduces a unique linear AF system. Using a linear motor to drive the zooming, this system makes it possible to shift the 10x optical zoom from wide angle to full telephoto in a few seconds. You get the kind of quick zooming and fast focusing that lets you catch every shooting opportunity. Plus, the AF Assist Lamp helps when focusing in dimly lit places.\n\n Thanks to the Venus Engine III, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ1S takes just 0.5 second to start up after the power is switched on and has a release time lag as low as 0.006 seconds. The camera can also fire off consecutive shots at a swift three frames per second and offers unlimited consecutive shooting, so you can keep shooting until the SD memory card or built-in memory is full. \n\n With its 2.5-inch diagonal size and 207,000 pixels, the high-resolution LCD monitor makes it easy to see text and small thumbnail images. Even bright sunlight isn't a problem. If it's difficult to see the display on a sunny day, simply press the power LCD button and the display becomes about 40 percent brighter. The world's first developed high-angle LCD mode also provides easier viewing when you're holding the camera high to shoot over the heads of people in front of you. \n\n With a convenient built-in 14 megabytes of memory, you can take photos even when you don't have an SD memory card on hand. A travel date stamp function lets you input the time and date of your departure before you leave home, then you can use the camera to capture all the best moments of your trip. When you view the photos later, the camera will display them according to the day of the trip each photo was taken. You can even set the date and time for both your present location and your destination, choosing from 162 cities around the world in 32 time zones. A calendar view lets you arrange images you've shot by the day on which you shot them. This can be a big help when you have a large number of images to organize.\n\n What's in the Box\nDMC-TZ1S digital camera, battery charger, battery pack, lens cap, AV cable, USB cable, and strap.",
