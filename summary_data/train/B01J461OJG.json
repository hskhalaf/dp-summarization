I mostly wear a size 9, and occasionally need a 9.5. My last pair of adidas golf shoes were a 9. I initially ordered size 9, and they were WAY too small. Returned them successfully, and ordered 9.5. The 9.5 was still a little tight at first, but pretty much perfect after I broke them in over a couple rounds. Given that most golf shoes cost between $80 and $200, you just can\u2019t beat this value. I plan to load up on them in the future.",

Since they are designed more like a running shoe I've not had any discomfort while walking courses either. I wish the cleats were just a little stiffer, but they will handle just about any terrain with great grip.",
