Dislikes are simple wish while in (stop watch) mode the time showed.. second dislike the first mode it goes to is the (tide) mode..wish it was at least stopwatch first and maby the tide mode could be last!! But with all the pluses and $62 bucks it's a small dislike!! Over all beautiful and SIMPLY amazing.. would recommend!!!",
