The flash is very bright and the best range is about 6 - 10 feet. This camera is pretty easy to cary around and uses AA batteries that you can purchase anywhere.",

    "title": "Canon PowerShot SX1IS 10 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 20x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.8-inch LCD",
    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nPut your hand around the perfectly-shaped grip of Canon\u2019s sporty new PowerShot SX1 IS and you\u2019re ready for a shooting experience that\u2019s advanced in every way. Superb still images powered by Canon\u2019s DIGIC 4 image processor, evolved Face Detection Technology and a wide-angle 20x optical zoom are only the beginning. You can also create Full HD movies and see every detail on your HDTV thanks to the HDMI output. Plus, the 10.0-megapixel SX1 IS is the very first PowerShot equipped with a CMOS sensor, a hallmark of Canon\u2019s lauded EOS line. \n\nPowerShot SX1 IS Highlights \n\n\n\nCreate Full HD movies with your camera\nIf you long for the convenience of an advanced still camera that also creates superb movies, the new PowerShot SX1 IS was developed with you in mind. Movies shot in Full HD (1920 x 1080 pixels) capture your memories with clarity, realism and brilliance. The PowerShot SX1 IS also makes it easy to enjoy HD movies and photos on your HDTV with a mini-HDMI cable for direct connection to a high-definition monitor. This allows you to enjoy the full quality of HD with no degradation of image or audio in the signal, but also improves playback functionality, letting you view up to 130 still images at once. \n\nThe first PowerShot to feature a 10.0-megapixel Canon CMOS sensor\nCanon\u2019s proprietary CMOS sensors were formerly reserved for its storied EOS line. The PowerShot SX1 IS is the first PowerShot that gives you access to the astonishing imaging power of this technology. Unlike the CCD sensors on most digital cameras, CMOS sensors convert and amplify signals before they are transferred to the image processor. This enables the CMOS sensor to produce exceptionally clean image data, free of the stray signals that can mar images. The resulting images show a notable brilliance and clarity. \n\nWide-angle 20x optical zoom lens with Optical Image Stabilizer\nThe PowerShot SX1 IS features Canon\u2019s precision 28mm wide-angle lens that allows you to shoot any scene from wide-angle to telephoto. It lets you capture more in every frame, so everyone fits in a family gathering shot. When it\u2019s time to take a closer look, a 20x optical zoom (35mm film equivalent 28-560mm) greatly minimizes camera shake and maximizes the brilliance of every detail. The camera uses a USM (Ultrasonic Motor) for high-speed, quiet, energy-efficient lens movement with precise control. Focal length is conveniently indicated on the lens barrel. \n\nThe SX1 IS is equipped with Canon\u2019s acclaimed Optical Image Stabilizer Technology that automatically detects and corrects camera shake--one of the leading causes of fuzzy or blurred shots. Even when zoomed in, you can get steady, crisp, brilliant images you\u2019ll be proud to shoot and share. And Canon\u2019s Optical Image Stabilizer Technology is convenient to use. It functions perfectly with or without a flash. \n\n2.8-inch Vari-angle LCD widescreen plus viewfinder\nThe camera\u2019s 2.8-inch LCD widescreen gives you the big picture, whether you\u2019re shooting, reviewing or showing off your images. This high-resolution screen offers a crisp, clear picture to make shooting, playback and using the camera\u2019s menu functions especially convenient. Clear and bright, it also features Night Display for easy viewing in low light. It also has an electronic viewfinder that provides sharp images when you shoot close-up with the Super Macro shooting mode. \n\nFull range of shooting and recording modes including RAW + JPEG\nThe PowerShot SX1 IS\u2019s RAW mode lets you shoot images without JPEG compression. It gives you clearer images and complete creative control in editing. RAW images are transferred directly to the computer where they can then be edited using image adjustment software or a processing application to adjust your images as you please. The camera can also be set to allow the simultaneous recording of both RAW and JPEG images while shooting. \n\nA World of Advantages with Canon\u2019s Technology \n\nCanon's DIGIC 4 image processor has evolved Face Detection Technology that tracks the faces of moving subjects and lets the shooter enter the frame seamlessly with the Face Detection Self-Timer. \n\nDIGIC 4 image processor Canon\u2019s most advanced image processor, DIGIC 4, delivers evolved Face Detection Technology that keeps every face in every photo looking its very best. The technology finds and tracks the faces of moving subjects until you\u2019re ready to shoot, then delivers perfect focus. In addition, exposure, flash and white balance are compensated, so that faces exhibit natural skin tones and backgrounds are properly exposed. \n\niSAPS Technology is an entirely original scene-recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos, iSAPS works with the advanced DIGIC 4 Image Processor to improve focus speed and accuracy, as well as exposure and white balance. \n\nA Face Detection Self-Timer automatically detects an increase in the number of faces and makes the appropriate adjustments. For instance, to include the photographer\u2019s face in a group shot, there\u2019s no need to rush in. Just put the camera on a stand or tripod, specify Face Detection Self-Timer, and the camera will wait for the photographer\u2019s face to get on-camera before it takes the shot. Motion Detection tracks moving subjects in a much larger range, and the Servo AF retains focus on a moving subject after the shutter button is pressed halfway--allowing you to wait for the perfect shot without refocusing. \n\nIntelligent Contrast Correction\nDIGIC 4 also makes possible the i-Contrast (Intelligent Contrast Correction) system, which controls the compensation level in pixel units to brighten dark areas while leaving bright areas unchanged for better images for more natural transitions when the main subject is dark. The PowerShot SX1 IS can even use i-Contrast in playback mode to adjust images that were shot without the setting activated. \n\nRed-eye Correction provides three options for removing red-eye from subjects in flash pictures:\n1) Red-eye Correction during shooting actually identifies and corrects red-eye in human subjects as pictures are taken. \n2) The PowerShot SX1 IS can be set to automatically detect and correct red-eye during image playback.\n3) You can manually locate any red eyes in a scene during image playback on the LCD screen, and command the camera to remove them. \n\nLife doesn\u2019t give you second chances to capture special times. That\u2019s why the PowerShot SX1 IS features ISO 1600 and High ISO Auto settings that reduce the effects of camera shake and sharpen subjects in low-light situations, giving you greater shooting flexibility. ISO can be expanded to 3200 when you select the ISO 3200 Special Scene mode. \n\n25 Shooting Modes including 12 Special Scene Modes\nWhen you\u2019re taking pictures, the only thing you want to think about is your subject. With the PowerShot SX1 IS, you can count on exact focus no matter where your subject is in the frame. You\u2019ve got Shooting Modes including Special Scene Modes that give you breathtaking, exhilarating pictures even when shooting conditions are tough. \n\nThe Complete Print Solution \n\nPrint/Share Button for easy direct printing and downloading, plus ID Photo Print and Movie Print with select PIXMA Inkjet Photo Printers and SELPHY Compact Photo Printers. \n\nThe PowerShot SX1 IS\u2019s Print/Share button makes direct printing easier than ever. Simply connect the PowerShot SX1 IS to a Canon PIXMA Inkjet Photo Printer or SELPHY Compact Photo Printer or any PictBridge compatible photo printer, press the lighted Print/Share button and print! Also use the Print/Share button to transfer images to a computer (Windows\u00ae and Macintosh\u00ae). \n\nPrint your own ID photos in up to 28 different sizes or use the Movie Print function to output multiple stills from a recorded movie on a single sheet with a Canon SELPHY Compact Photo Printer. \n\nWhat's in the Box\n\n * PowerShot SX1 IS body \n * AA-size alkaline battery (x4) \n * Neck strap (NS-DC7) \n * Wireless controller (WC-DC300) \n * Digital Camera Solution CD-ROM \n * USB interface cable (IFC-400PCU) \n * Stereo video cable (STV-250N) \n * Lens hood (LH-DC50) \n * Lens cap \n\n\n\n\n\nREVIEW FROM DPREVIEW.COM\n\n\n\n\nLearn more about this camera\nat DPReview.com Canon PowerShot SX1 IS: Recommended (just) by dpreview.com \n\nCanon's popular superzoom range of cameras began with the release of the PowerShot S1 IS back in 2004, and has been incrementally upgraded each year with more features and more pixels, with the last update being the PowerShot S5 IS announced in May of 2007. In September of 2008 Canon announced dual successors to the S5 IS. The cheaper of the two models is the Powershot SX10 IS, which features a 10 MP CCD sensor behind a 20X image stabilized lens, with the more expensive camera - the SX1 IS - adding RAW mode, a CMOS sensor, faster continuous shooting speed, and HD 1080p video recording. \n\nCanon pioneered the use of CMOS sensors in digital SLRs (starting way back in 2000 with the EOS D30) - and they have long been used in cheap imaging devices (such as mobile phones and no brand 'keychain' digicams), but until now they haven't made their way into mainstream compact cameras. The reason has been simple; they just haven't been good enough. CMOS sensors have more circuitry built into the chip itself than CCD sensors, leaving less room for actually capturing light. This isn't a problem when you're working with a sensor with a large surface area, but at very small sizes it means lowered sensitivity - and that means noise and all the image quality problems associated with removing it. \n\nAny problems with CMOS on large (DSLR) sensors were fixed long ago, and it is now the dominant technology in all but the cheapest models. The quest to fix them for smaller sensors has taken a lot longer, but it's one that continues because the possibilities offered by the on-chip processing capabilities of a CMOS sensor are simply too enticing for camera manufacturers to ignore (quite aside from the fact they use less power and are, in theory, a lot cheaper to mass produce). The SX1 IS, along with Sony's HX1 and the Ricoh CX1, is the first in a new wave of CMOS-sensored 'serious' compact cameras, and though few claims are being made about how the use of CMOS will affect image quality per se, they all sport unique features (high speed capture, HD movies, clever image stacking modes) which are only possible because this technology. \n\nLike every camera in this range since the original S1 IS, the SX1 is designed to be a 'hybrid', combining stills and movie photography in a single device (the S1 IS was one of the first cameras to feature a dedicated Movie record button). But the use of a 16:9 format screen and viewfinder - plus the use of a CMOS sensor capable of full 1080p capture - means that the SX1 is unique in the range (and different to the SX10) in that it gives almost as much weight to movie capture as it does stills. \n\nPowerShot SX1 IS vs PowerShot S5 IS - key changes  * Higher resolution sensor (10MP vs 8MP) \n * New 28 - 560 mm equiv lens \n * Digic 4 processor (S5 IS was Digic III) \n * Larger, higher resolution LCD screen (2.8 inches vs 2.5 inches) \n * HD movie recording at 1080p (1920 x 1080) \n * 'My Menu' system \n * Greatly increased continuous shooting (burst) speed \n * RAW file format is back \n\n *  Read the full Canon SX1 IS review at dpreview.com",
