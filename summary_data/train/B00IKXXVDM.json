I just smell more like a \"clay\" smell, which is probably coming from the ash in the product. Overall, for myself personally, I felt like it was over rated and expected more from a product that had almost 5 stars.",

    "title": "Jack Black Deep Dive Glycolic Facial Cleanser, 3, 5 and 10 Fl Oz",
    "description": "Size:5 Ounce\n\nJack Black Deep Dive Glycolic Facial Cleanser is an exceptional multifunctional, clay-based cleanser that washes away dead skin cells, pore-clogging oil, and build-up. Consistent use of this two-in-one facial cleanser and mask leaves skin fresher, smoother, and firmer. The PureScience formula is recommended for normal, combination, and oily skin and is safe for sensitive skin. Jack Black PureScience formulas are free of synthetic fragrance, colorants, and parabens and include certified organic ingredients.\n\nJack Black Deep Dive Glycolic Facial Cleanser is packed with powerful certified organic ingredients that work together to exfoliate skin and leave skin smooth and firmer. Glycolic Acid is a highly effective chemical exfoliant that removes dead skin cell buildup for noticeably softer, firmer, and clearer skin. It also helps to prevent ingrown hairs. Volcanic Ash is included in the formula and boasts revitalizing antioxidants and natural particles that work as a gentle physical exfoliant to help smooth and resurface the skin. Kaolin Clay is a natural clay that draws out skin impurities, oil, and dirt and works to control oiliness due to its natural absorption properties.\n\nAll Jack Black products are carefully formulated with the finest ingredients to be highly effective, yet easy to use. Every Jack Black product is dermatologist tested, paraben free, cruelty free, and free of harsh surfactants. Almost all of the products in our line are vegan, free of artificial colorants, safe for sensitive skin, and made in the USA. Jack Black Deep Dive Glycolic Facial Cleanser can be used as a cleanser or mask. When used as a cleanser, apply a small amount to wet hands, work into a creamy lather, and apply to slightly damp face using a circular motion. Immediately rinse. To use as a mask, spread a small amount onto dry face and evenly apply using a circular motion, avoiding eye area and lips. Allow to dry approximately 5 minutes then rinse.",
