In fact, the room got darker when I replaced my 40 watt incandescents with these LEDs. The light in the back still has 3 incandescent 40 watt bulbs and even with a cover is giving off better lighting. I gave it 3 stars because it looks better in my fixtures outside. I think I prefer the \"daylight\" bulbs outdoors only.",
