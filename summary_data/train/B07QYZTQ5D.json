As you\u2019ll read in some reviews, the blade is sharp so be careful and let it finish its revolution before pulling it off the machine so you don\u2019t cut yourself. I\u2019ve got long, semi fat fingers, so I\u2019ll let my partner do it for me. She gets it done easy then as they get done, I move to the juicer. Teamwork makes the dream work definitely!",

I did cut a couple of bad spots off my apple before taking the picture so you'll notice a couple notches taken out of it. It peels the apple and doesn't waste any of the apple! The coring device also works really well too. Overall, they are both super easy to use!",
