      "text": "I bought this primarily for productivity reasons - as a programmer, having 5 1080p screens in front of me is wonderful. However its a TN panel so the viewing angles are not the best (media is fine viewed head on though and black levels are very good) and, if I'm honest, 28\" is just that tad too small for 4K productivity unless you have 20/20 eyesight. I'm looking forward to the 34\" ultrawide QHD monitors dropping in price but I'm reasonably happy with this until they do.",

The screen is clearer than any other I have used, brilliant for gaming (played games such as Dota 2, GTA V, DayZ, NBA, Fifa, etc.) and i have had no issues thus far. If this changes i will edit my review accordingly but so far I haven't looked back :^)",

      "text": "Let me start off by saying this monitor is what i expected for the price. 4k provides excellent picture and more screen real estate. Colours were good for a TN but this monitor is not without problems. The biggest dealbreaker for me was ghosting, especially seeing as the monitor has an advertised 1ms response time. Coming from a samsung with a 5ms response time it seemed much less fluid. The audio pass through also didn't work but that wasn't an issue for me. For a good 4k experience, look elsewhere.",

Makes a low hiss noise even when the speakers are set to mute. Monitor turns off randomly for a few seconds at its own desire while am watching a movie or playing a game. I do not recommend this monitor for anyone looking to spend 400 gbp.",

It functions admirably in that respect as the image is sharp and the colors outstanding. Haven't experienced any issue but to soon to comment on longevity.",

It would be the perfect monitor for me, however it introduces ghosting issues in gaming and fast moving scenes, objects moving from light to dark scenes which is very noticeable in things like GTA V playing in 4k, that's a big issue for gamers and probably some movie watchers, it may not bother some people. Also note the 60hz value is ONLY for the new DisplayPort 1.2 NOT the HDMI port which runs at 30hz.",
