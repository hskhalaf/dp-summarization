After 2 weeks outside (on coverered stoop) the edges are all curled up and the mat is wavy. Thowing away since it is a hazard to anyone who may trip on it. Total waste of money.",

It's also quite thin and a bit stiff, which is acceptable to me at this price, but if you are looking for something more supple and that doesn't form a persistent crease in itself when draped over a chair (which I did to air it out on our deck), then you should look elsewhere. Regardless of the thinness, the smell was a deal-breaker for me all by itself.",
