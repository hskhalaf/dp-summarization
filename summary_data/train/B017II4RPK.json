I had to go to lowes to by 2.5\" 1/4 20 screws because the screws were too long for our counter tops but that's about the most complicated portion of the install. I was very worried about installing this because I've never done anything remotely close to it before however the instructions were simple and the setup was SUPER easy, even for a 1st-timer like me. Highly recommended.",

A lot of parts weren\u2019t needed because we ended up using it as a commercial beer kegarator. Either way, the instructions were \"barney style\" with photos. Super easy setup. We were able to fit a 7 & 5 gallon commercial keg, along with the Co2 bottle in the kegerator. As far as how loud it may get, you WILL NOT notice it via sound.",

I opted for Cornelius kegs vice the commercial keg setup, so once I cut the lines, added in quick release connectors, tightened the fittings (oops) and re-pressurized the system all worked extremely well. Documentation was easy to follow and lays out a number of setups. If you have any experience with homebrew kegging at all you'll find this easy. I opted to change out the faucets to Perlick style to reduce cleaning, everything was a snap. Nice, compact, easy.",

Thus, I had to go out and buy $80 worth of connecting hardware. My suggestion would be to make the difference more clear in online sales information. It also took me awhile to adjust co2 correctly, thus compromising some beer early on. That too was operator error. But overall I'm pretty satisfied. Oh, and I also received prompt assistance from the merchant when I pointed out a broken home brew coupler.",

Well, when this happens your tap becomes loose and beer everywhere. Lost one keg and CO2 waste to this defect and almost another, heard the hissing and caught it in time. Support was good however they should have sent me a whole new tower. Sent me two new rings however a defect like this just wastes money and beer. It's obviously a defect, I don't run much pressure through the lines. It's still in use however since purchased an Edgestar and haven't had any issues.",

Very stratnge then that the beer line included (pre-attached to the taps) dont have ball lock disconnects, instead having three sankey coupler disconnects. But the kit comes with ball lock disconnects which are'nt compatible with the sankey fittings. Weird. Also, the beer line is only 3' long, usually this would be 10' to prevent foaming etc. So right off that bat, that all needs replacing. Then there was a weird mix of gas disconnects so I had to buy a couple more. Not cool.",
