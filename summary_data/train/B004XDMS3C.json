The Master Chocolatiers of Lindt are experts of this craft. For more than 165 years, Lindt has been developing innovative chocolate recipes with meticulous craftsmanship, resulting in superior tasting, high quality premium chocolate. \n\nLindt Chocolate uses only the finest ingredients, and is one of the few chocolate manufacturers that control the entire production process \u2013 from roasting the cacao beans to producing the chocolate. \n\n\nTHE LINDT STORY\nIn 1845, confectioner David Spr\u00fcngli-Schwarz and his inventive son, Rudolf Sprungli-Ammann, owned a small confectionary shop in the Marktgasse of Zurich\u2019s Old Town. They dared to try something new- a fashionable new recipe from Italy for manufacturing chocolate in solid form.\n\nIn 1879, Rodolphe Lindt, one of the most famous chocolate-makers of his day, developed a technique by which he could manufacture chocolate unique to others in aroma and melting characteristics. Lindt used the \u201cconche\u201d he had invented to produce chocolate with delicate flavor. His \u201cmelting chocolate\u201d soon achieved fame, and contributed significantly to the worldwide reputation of Swiss chocolate.\n\nIt was in 1899 that Spr\u00fcngli\u2019s private company \u201cChocolat Spr\u00fcngli\u201d acquired the small but famous chocolate factory of Rodolphe Lindt in Berne. This brave step transferred not only the factory but also the manufacturing secrets and the Rodolphe Lindt brand name to the young Spr\u00fcngli company which now changed its name to \u201cLindt & Spr\u00fcngli.\u201d\n\nIn 1986, Lindt & Spr\u00fcngli (USA) Inc., was activated and a manufacturing site and administration building were commissioned in Stratham, New Hampshire where it has expanded and successfully operates today.",
