So far I've only spun lettuce from 1 romaine heart lettuce head (enough for 2 people) at a time, but it looks as if it can fit double that amount. Need to make a large salad, no problem - just use it twice! Tip: you can also use it for washing and drying fresh herbs. Wish I'd bought this a long time ago!",

That said- it works, and I love the size which is perfect for 1-2 people. Other spinners I have purchased are just too big.",

The spinner basket also doubles as a colander, which is nice. Great for one or two persons.",

The pot-handle on the side and the pour spout makes it extremely easy to handle and makes clean up a breeze. It's easy to rinse out in the kitchen sink and set it out to dry on the dish drainer - where it's ready to go for the next day. Very glad I made this purchase... definitely healthier eating for me!

Now I am very selective in picking my greens, just enough to fill this spinner, all to be eaten the same day they are picked. It does an excellent job of getting the water out, aided by the pour spouts. It then keeps the greens fresh in that same container until its time to mix up a little salad magic",

I fill the bottom bowl with water & swish the herbs or small amount of arugula for a sandwich, then pour into the basket & spin. My old spinner's basket's openings were too wide spaced for such jobs. I'd use paper towels to dry, which is not necessary anymore. I like that it takes so much less room in my cabinet. Great price for such a handy, used a lot tool.",
