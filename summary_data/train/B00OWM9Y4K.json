It is a deep navy blue which sometimes looks black or green in certain lighting. This makes it, surprisingly, more versatile for complimenting her outfits. The only con (not really a con) was that the band was too big, which made it look way over-sized...but once we got it refitted by removing a few of the links, it looked great and even petite, yet large faced...which gave it that \"boyfriend's watch\" look.

You can't really see the face of the watch since its so black (Not that my boyfriend cares, he just wanted it for the looks). Also, the dates are off when there are the 30/31 days in a month. So every other month your watch will be off by the one day. Not a huge negative, but would have been nice to know before the purchase. Other than that, he loves it and wears it all the time!",
