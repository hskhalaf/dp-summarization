Several times a day, close the lid which traps all the flies inside, take it outside and open to release them, and return the lid to the cracked position inside.

      "text": "We have suddenly had a huge infestation of all kinds of insects in our kitchen which is not the most \u2018appetizing\u2019. So we purchased a bunch of traps to help us alleviate the problem. These tiny apples have been placed right by our fruit bowl and atleast a dozen fruit flies have been captured in a day. They were driving us crazy between the trash and the ripening fruit so now we have a little more sanity in the house (picture a grown man cursing out the flies and getting super excited to squish one!)",

I would much rather be able to empty out the drowned fruit flies and refill with a bit of cider vinegar, and repeat this cycle.",

But I didn't want to fuss with creating the structure, so I was happy to purchase them premade. I will definitely keep using the apples and refill with soap and vinegar after I run out of what they provided.",

With the TERRO Fruit Fly Trap, you can get the best of these annoying household pests in no time. This fast-acting trap uses a liquid bait to lure adult fruit flies inside.

Meanwhile, a built-in window allows you to keep an eye on catches and lure levels.\n\nWhen trying to eliminate fruit flies, the key to success is locating their breeding areas. You\u2019ll typically spot fruit flies swarming around kitchen fruit bowls and near garbage cans. For best results, place traps behind or under kitchen counters, sinks, dishwashers, near unrefrigerated fruits and vegetables, and any other location where fruit is stored.",
