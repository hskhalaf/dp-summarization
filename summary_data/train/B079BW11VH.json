      "text": "Have had these for a month now and have walked, run and yesterday did a 400m interval session with them. They are excellent, and while taking some time to adjust, for me in particular, as I came from Hoka One! My feet are stronger and this has made my base more stable when squatting and deadlifting (I\u2019m also wearing them for that too). You do feel the quality of the surface you\u2019re walking on and when running, some large stones are felt. The fact there is no support in the sole, means you have to change your running gait to land on your forefoot or risk slamming heel on the ground if you don\u2019t.",

Very well made and they look like they'll last, but time will tell. They're expensive, but you get a top shoe. I've had a few different barefoot type shoes and these are proper minimal. They've replace my adidas toe shoes, which have worn out, they'll be a big change if you're moving from a normal shoe, but pretty close to the toe shoes.",

Would definitely recommend these if you're looking for that barefoot feeling with an everyday shoe.",
