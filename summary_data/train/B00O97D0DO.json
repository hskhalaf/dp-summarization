If you do small curd cheeses, line with a cloth that is quite a bit larger so you can pull up the corners, tie, and hang drain the curds as the tiny holes with a cloth don't let it drain very fast.

This looks like a well built tool. I like it especially that it is made in America. Hard to find these days. Note: He had been given three other colanders in the past, all made in China. They were either cheaply made but most of all didn't have enough holes at the bottom so they didn't drain well.",

No more scalding myself because my old colander required me to hold it out of the sink so that the food did not sit in a sink full of cooking water. I am very pleased. Thank you for a terrific product.",

Like most colanders, it isn't super easy to clean, but it isn't necessarily difficult either. I don't have a dishwasher, but I am sure it would hold up well to being washed in one.",

It is mesh, so it's not going to take a heavy beating without getting bent, but under normal use it should do just fine. The base of the colander raises it up off the floor of the sink high enough so that you won't end up with a lot of the water backwashing into the colander. It was less expensive than many others that looked exactly the same, so that is a selling point, too.",

I do get excited about little things when they work well.
