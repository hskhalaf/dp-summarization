I can honestly say a couple of doses of this form of zinc got my body in gear to fight off this cold. Apparently this form of zinc is more readily available than other forms I have used. Definitely will be switching to this product.",

      "text": "I\u2019ve always taken zinc tablets when I felt cold or flu symptoms coming on. My family started using these drops for prevention before the flu season along with natural vitamin c spray and vitamin D drops. Everyone around us has been sick, but we haven\u2019t caught anything. My immune system is weak and I\u2019ve stayed healthy even through this plague. I also noticed my hair is healthier and stronger.",
