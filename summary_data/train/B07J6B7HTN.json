Update: Have transferred from iPhone 6 to Pixel 3 and though it was tricky to transfer my data, was able to do it successfully including contacts, texts, music, photos, notes and most of my apps. Battery lasts more than 24 hours, and all phone functions are great especially the cameras and the speakers. The pure Android 9 software is a delight to use and much smoother than iOS based devices.",
