I'm very happy with the backpack, especially when you consider that it only costs $20. Material is light and flexible, but strong. I LOVE the deepness of the mesh pockets on the sides. So many other backpacks have pockets that are too shallow and don't hold. The mesh pockets also look to be pretty strong.",

The material is soft but not padded, so unless I placed a towel or shirt before placing anything else in the bag I could feel the bag's contents shape/surface while walking (not painful, just uncomfortable if not properly arranged/packed). The bag was easy to clean (soft wet cloth) but was not water proof, just water resistant so you would need a protector over it in case you get caught in the rain. However, the fact that it was collapsible made it super convenient and the colors were true as pictured",

This HIKPRO fits all the criteria! We carry two water bottles, raincoats, two lightweight vests, phones, keys, glasses cases, hats and so much more, and no one's shoulders or back gets painful or sore. Happy to find just the right pack at the right price. Nice job, HIKPRO. Keep making good products that are useful!!",

The water bottle holders aren't big enough for a nalgene, but they're big enough for something smaller, like a 16 or 20 oz bottle.

I love how you can fold it back up for quick storage. Once the trip was over (:O( ), I took everything out, folded it up, and tucked it away back into my suitcase. I love the side pockets and ample space inside. It's also washable (air dry). Great buy! I highly recommend.",

The 2 backpacks are very light but big enough to fit ponchos, change of t-shirts for the 4 of us, flip flops, my camera, and water bottles. It\u2019s about the same size as a standard jansport backpack. The best part is that it folds up to roughly around 4\u201d x 4\u201d. The 2 sockets on each side can fit a standard water bottle, the pouch inside can keep your wallet/car keys safe. The only downside is it\u2019s a bit warm on the back and you can feel the objects on your back. But overall satisfield with the backpacks.",

Overall, it's a lightweight pack and the side water bottle pockets make it super easy to reach my arm around and grab it and slip it back in when I'm finished. I love this bag!",

The shoulder straps have an anti sweat material too. Pretty easy to fold up, and is about 6x6x2\" just like picture.",
