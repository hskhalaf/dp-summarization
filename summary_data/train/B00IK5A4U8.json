This product claims to be 2X better than Brita so consumer beware. I get a much lower reading from bottled spring and filteted water so I'm back to buying bottled water. I feel truly scammed.",

Just replaced this with the Brita Max 18cup filter and it's amazing how different they are. The Brita completely filters in about 10-15 minutes, not 2 days.

PUR filters are easy to install and this 18 cup tanks is super easy to remove and clean. You can access everything easy with a big brush.

We have had to change filters on this quite frequently, but that is probably a function of the quality of water around here and not of the filter itself. For people who are environmental, this is also very good because it saves a large number of plastic bottles.",
