I\u2019ve heard horror stories of mold in coffee machines. I went to England to visit my in laws and my brother in law had a Nescafe\u0301 machine. I instantly fell in love! The coffee was amazing and it was convenient and so much faster than the keurig. So I had to come home and buy this! This machine is PERFECT. It\u2019s made from a high quality brand, easy to set up, easy to clean, easy to use, and the coffee is amazing. I\u2019m so glad I waited for the perfect machine.",

I had already tried just about every single cup coffee machine out there, including those that sell at $1000 plus and chose this one mostly because there is simply NO coffee that tastes like the Dolce Gusto. I see lots of people complaining of issues with water pump etc, I had NO problem at all getting the machine to work. I just wish it was sold in stores along with the coffee capsules. It's a bit frustrating having to buy it from Europe, specially the Cafe au Lait, not sold anywhere in the USA.",

Easy to use, fast brew, and hot or cold. Absolutely brilliant, and a great price, which was due to me buying a first gen. brewer.
