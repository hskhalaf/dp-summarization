I wasn't sure at first because I really missed having a cup of coffee ready from my timed unit (which bit the dust after 10 years) I've been using it for 8 months now and got to say I love it. There is something about this filter that does an amazing job of extracting the flavor out of the coffee. It is small so it takes of little space on the counter and it looks good too! I'm even getting to enjoy the ritual of making coffee",

Making coffee with this is a zen experience. I will purchase more to give as gifts to coffee loving friends. This is great for coffee snobs with high expectations! It took a couple weeks to arrive but was well worth the wait. Best coffee maker ever.",

We purchased it mainly because it didn't require a paper filter and the extra steps in using them. We're impressed with the quality and it makes delicious coffee. I would definitely recommend the HIC pour coffee maker to anyone looking for this type of device.",

    "description": "Style Name:Pour-Over Coffee MakerHIC\u2019s Pour-Over Coffee Maker, 4-cup capacity, is specially designed to brew the best tasting coffee using the manual, pour over coffee method. Practiced by coffee lovers worldwide, this time-tested Japanese coffee brewing method, also called hand drip coffee, allows complete control over coffee to water ratio and brew time using a slow, precise water flow that\u2019s critical to extracting a consistent, rich quality and distinctly flavorful result. Each detail of HIC\u2019s Pour-Over Coffee Maker is designed to help master this coveted technique. The high-heat borosilicate glass carafe resists shock and breakage and won\u2019t absorb odors or transfer flavors between brews. Its bamboo handle offers a comfortable grip for pouring each delicious cup. The unique stainless steel coffee filter, with pierced exterior and fine mesh lining, allows the natural oils that contribute to coffee\u2019s complex flavor to infuse the brew, while filtering out more sediment than traditional reusable coffee filters. Eliminates using paper coffee filters, which can strip out these flavorful oils. Water levels marked on the carafe ensure a precise measure. Brew only what\u2019s needed, single cup coffee to 4-cups, for consistent flavor with less waste. For best coffee brewing results, boil 6-ounces of water per serving. Place the filter into the Coffee Maker and measure in medium-grind coffee with the handy coffee scoop. Using just-boiled water, wet the grounds slightly and let stand for 30 seconds to expand or bloom coffee and extract its most robust flavor. Slowly pour over remaining water in a thin, steady stream. Allow coffee to finish dripping and set filter aside to cool before discarding wet grounds. Total brew time should be about 2.5 minutes. Serve coffee immediately or chill for coffee drinks or iced coffee. A must-have of coffee gifts and coffee accessories, HIC\u2019s Pour-Over Coffee Maker is safe for stovetop use. Not microwave or dishwasher safe. Hand wash in warm, soapy water.",
