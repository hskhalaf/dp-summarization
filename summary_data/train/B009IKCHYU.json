HELPFUL TIP: put the cord over your ear Quality is great, the cord is longer than normal and headphones have held up for months of hard use at gym, running etc. with no damage whatsoever Sound is warm and full, the highs are not annoying and the bass isn't overemphasized which allows you to listen to them over extended periods of time. Probably the best sounding pair of in ear headphones I've ever owned",

As others have noted, the earpieces are somewhat heavy and can fall out. Since I walk, not a big deal. Can also get water around earpieces which makes them slipperier and can mess up the sound. It is a shame that the white models were two and a half times the cost of the black ones, but who cares if I am not color coordinated. Bought based on good reviews in CR. Overall, very good earphones for the money.",

The only reason for not giving it 5 stars is, as somebody else mentioned, they don't sit comfortably in the ear and when I start sweating they frequently pop out. I've used a variety of different size and shape buds but the problem persists. They're great if I'm sitting around or even doing house work, but if I am exercising I can count on having to re-position them frequently. I really appreciate the heavy duty-ness of the wire sheaths though!",

These are probably some of the worst earbuds for working out period. These headphones are good for none physical activity and lounging around. Bottom line is for this price (only 11 dollars) i would recommend anyone to buy these earbuds solely b/c of the great price.",

For the price, these are fantastic and I'm considering getting myself a pair. I went 4 stars due to the heavy bass and it not sounding real balanced, rather just, let's make the highs really high, too.",

The flat wire makes it much easier to keep from getting tangled up and straighten if they do. I also like the sound that comes out of them. However, I am not a true audiophile and I would consider myself far from an expert on stereo sound.",
