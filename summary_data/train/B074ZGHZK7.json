I blend it in my Ninja blender for 20-30 seconds and the works out pretty well. Flavor is good, not overly sweet. For someone who usually drinks his coffee black with not additives I was afraid it would be to \"flavored\", not the case IMO. The reason I gave it a rating of 3/5 was how it arrived to me yesterday. It had been rough handled in shipping and the container had 2 significant dents in it and the cap was broken. I had to split the container in half and scoop contents into a tupperware container for storage.",

I'd never noticed that before and really enjoyed ghee before using this product. I was, consequently, unable to enjoy ghee in other ways.

Also I don't think it should be called creamer because it doesn't give your coffee any creamy or milkyness at all. Your coffee will just be black. It wasn't the worst and it wasn't the best.

I also wish it was a bigger size, as it\u2019s amazing how quickly I seem to go thru it and I\u2019m only putting it in one tablespoon to a 20oz coffee.
