I have found the green one to be not quite as nice in the yarn itself. The blue holds it shape so nicely, the green stretches out almost immediately and is \"floppy\". The workmanship on both sweaters is very nice however. The blue is nicer quality yarn, sometimes yarn, the same yarn, with different dyes can react in different ways; maybe the darker colors effect the material more? Don't know. I am still quite happy with both sweaters.",

I got the color mint and it is bright like the description photo, but I don't like using the camera flash on my dog's eyes so it looks darker in my photo. I would definitely order more Stinky G brand sweaters for her again. This sweater does have a leash hole and is thick enough to keep her warm outside during late fall or early spring, but not warm enough for the middle of winter (at least not here in Wisconsin).",

Now if only they had more colors available for males in this size! :) :) No complaints (other than wishing for more colors). Soft, warm, seems comfortable, and good quality. Thanks!",
