Exit fold up was super duper simple. They are rather heavyweight, but again I was cabin camping. I feel like I got extremely lucky with selecting these two bags. I could not have written a better outcome in terms of our experience with the Coleman White Water Adult Sleeping Bag. 5 Thumbs UP. BUY, BUY, BUY is my personal recommendation.",

These sleeping bags took up little room while packing up my small car, giving them an added bonus in my world. I find them to be easy to roll back up into their small, compact package, and then toss back into the trunk.

One thing I will note, it has kind of a funny plasticky smell when I first got it. I spread it out on the bed in my guest room for a week before our trip and that seemed to help.",

Also, and this has been pointed out already by other reviews, it's not a back-packing sleeping bag. It's quite heavy (and large). It also doesn't seem quite as long as described. Still long though.",

    "description": "Sleep comfortably in temperatures as low as 30\u00b0F with the Coleman White Water Sleeping Bag. Intended for people up to 5 feet 11 inches tall, this extra-wide camping sleeping bag offers plenty of wiggle room and features an extended contoured top to keep your head off the cold ground. Featuring a brushed polyester cover, a cozy liner, and a ComfortCuff that surrounds your face in soft, warm fabric, this sleeping bag helps you sleep well in the great outdoors. On warmer nights, open the 2-way zipper to ventilate the bag. On colder nights, zip the bag up completely to keep yourself warm. The Thermolock draft tube helps prevent heat loss through the zipper. Plus, the patented ZipPlow system plows fabric away from the zipper to prevent snags and frustration. Thanks to its Roll Control design and Quick Cord patented no-tie closure, this backpacking sleeping bag is easy for one person to pack without assistance and is machine washable for easy cleaning.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\nIdeal for cool weather camping where the temperature range is between 30 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit, the Coleman White Water large sleeping bag is durably constructed of a polyester cover with soft, cozy cotton-flannel tricot lining. Four pounds of ColeTherm insulation keep you comfortable throughout the night, and the oversized bag measures 39-by-84 inches (W x D), fitting taller campers up to five feet, eleven inches tall. \n\n A unique scoop shape creates a comfortable headrest, keeping your head and pillow off the ground, while QuickCord storage means fast, tie-free closure of the sleeping bag when it's time to strike camp. \n\n The White Water sleeping bag includes Coleman's ComfortSmart technology, meaning it's full of features to keep you warm and comfortable, such as: \n\n * ZipPlow: Prevents zipper snags by plowing fabric away from zipper \n * Roll Control: Locks bag in place for easier rolling\n * FiberLock: Prevents insulation from shifting, increasing durability\n * ThermoLock: Reduces heat loss through the zipper, keeping you warmer \n * Certified Temperature Rating: Independently tested for temperature accuracy \n * Zipper Glide Tailoring: Allows smooth zipper operation around the corner \n * Comfort Cuff: Surrounds your face with softness\n\n\n\n The Coleman Limited Warranty\nColeman has been in business for more than 100 years, and continues to produce high-quality, affordable tents, lanterns, table-top stoves, and more. All Coleman products have a warranty against defects in material and workmanship, and the White Water sleeping bag includes a limited five-year manufacturer's warranty. \n\n About Coleman Outdoor Products\nMore than 100 years ago, an entrepreneurial young man named W.C. Coleman had an idea for manufacturing better lanterns in Wichita, Kansas. A century later, Coleman's current catalog features a wide-ranging array of products that make spending time outside a pleasure. The company crafts coolers that keep food and drinks cold for days, airbeds that are comfortable and won't deflate during the night, a complete line of bright and long-lasting LED lights, powerful portable grills that cook with an authentic open-grill flame, and more.",
