This is perfect if your are doing a work out where using gloves or straps doesn't work or if you are working on grip strength. Crossfit is all about grip strength so this is perfect in place of the straps I normally use on heavier bar lifts.",

But a word of caution if you are going to be using this for grip work such as the ironmind hub and rolling thunder wet your hand and dry it mostly before plunging your hand into the chalk. Crushing it to a powder before using and storing in a bucket works much better transfering to the hand than rubbing the block on your hand.",

If I buy a block, I want a block, not a crumbly mess. This stuff is super lightweight and breaks extremely easily. I would resort to taking some of the small chunks and just crushing them between my hands. I have since switched to another brand that has blocks that don't shatter so easily. Like I said, it's chalk, and it's fine, but it's not good as far as bar chalk goes. I still keep this chalk in a big ziplock, crushed up. Gave some of it away with craigslist gym equipment sales.",
