The little tools could really come in hand for those little issues that require a tool, but you don't carry around a tool belt everywhere you go. If hard presses in an emergency the fire starter will come in handy, and if that doesn't work there is a magnifying glass. It even has a small push knife for those who want to carve out a fire making set out of wood. Really cool, would make a great stocking stuffer gift for anyone.",

This item will not come close to fitting inside a credit card sized sleeve. It\u2019s larger than a credit card. If your sleeve is essentially the same size as a standard credit card or just barely bigger, this item will not fit. In my case I was hoping it would fit in credit card sleeve I have attached to back of phone. No chance. With respect to build quality, etc, I\u2019d say typical. Not bad but not exceptional.",

The knife seems decent, the whistle is functional, and the tweezers and the toothpick will doubtless come in handy, but the sharpener grit is already partially scraped off (definitely not solid stone, more like an emery board?) and the fire starter won't spark. Like, on anything. Three stars because at least it comes with everything it says and it's mostly functional, but the most survivor-centric items are not. It's still going in the kids' stockings because at least in that case, having a non-functional fire starter is actually kind of a plus.",
