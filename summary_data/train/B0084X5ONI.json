The Trapper T-Rex has helped us to control the rat infestation. The traps are lightweight... Some of the rats were able to drag the trap away for many feet before they perished. I fastened small 4\"x4\" sheet metal electrical box covers to the bottoms of the traps to make them a bit heavier to keep occupants from dragging them away. The electrical box cover I used is called a \"4S\" cover, and you can get it at any hardware store for about $1.00.",

I recommend attaching a loop of twine to the trap then put a sturdy stick through the loop to keep trapped creatures from moving it. I also cover the trap with a cheap wire trash can turned upside down. I cut out an entrance hole in the wire then put the stick through the wire basket and into the loop on the trap. It will insure you won't accidentally trap any birds. Keeps others from touching the trap by accident too.",

They are sturdy but twice, they did not kill the rat. I prefer live traps anyway, but needed to use kill traps in this instance. So finding the poor animals injured rather than dispatched humanely was of course grim. And these were not huge rats: they were perhaps 7 inches long, not including their tail. So if you have smaller rats, these are great, but otherwise, forget it and get more traditional traps. And manufacturer, please put more powerful springs in these T-Rex's!",

    "description": "The Trapper T-Rex Rat Trap is a state-of-the-art mechanical trap that offers superior rat capture. Patented interlocking teeth make rat escape virtually impossible. With T-Rex you'll get the perfect combination of trigger sensitivity and trap velocity - speed and responsiveness that ensure a successful and deadly capture. Easy to set and safer to use than traditional snap traps, the T-Rex can be placed directly in a Protecta Rat Bait Station ( Sold Separately), or tied to pipes or beams that rats may use as highways. A bait cup in the center of the trigger pedal makes it easy to add baits including Bell's new Provoke Rat Attractant. (Sold Separately) USE: Place trap along baseboards or in a corner for best results. You can use nuts, nesting material like a small piece of cotton, or small amount of nutella in the trap for bait. Trapper T-REX offers superior rat capture. Patented, interlocking teeth make rat escapes virtually impossible. The trap is a perfect combination of trigger sensitivity and trap velocity -- speed and responsiveness ensure capture. Extensive field and laboratory testing fine-tuned Trapper T-REX to optimum specifications. Safer and easier to use than competitor's snap traps, Trapper T-REX can be readily set by foot safely on the ground. Press the trap open like a pedal, keeping fingers free and safe. Bell included a removable bait cup that inserts from the bottom of Trapper T-REX. The cup can be withdrawn and re-inserted without the trap being set, which greatly enhances safety and ease of use. You can use Trapper T-REX along a rat pathway. Or you can insert it into a tamper-resistant bait station.",
