This was a great buy and I can\u2019t recommend enough!",

Usually, you get plastic cases that only last a month or two. I have had these for 6 months and the case still works great. Great Product Tekton",

I hung the storage pouch on the door of my service truck for easy access. Unfortunately due to hard knocks of 3-1/2 years of going off road and the excessive speed bumps... My wrench bag pouch has taken a lot of abuse and needs to be replaced. I'm trying to find out if I can purchase a new one. I'm sure this would have lasted many many more years hanging on my garage wall... But I needed them in my truck more. Supremely satisfied....Great Wrenches",

Went that route and am happy to have more wrenches plus the pouches--in case I ever want to take the wrenches out of my tool boxes with sliding drawers and transport them to work site in pouches within tool bag. Was a little cheaper but not by much (lol).",

    "description": "Size:15-pc. (8-22 mm)\n\nThe TEKTON 15-pc. Combination Wrench Set is a complete series of every size from 8 to 22 mm. Classically lean and quietly refined, TEKTON Combination Wrenches provide a sure fit on fasteners and multiple options for working around obstructions or in tight spaces. To reduce the working swing arc, the open end is angled 15 degrees so the wrench can be flipped over with each rotation to engage the fastener twice as often. The 12-point box end doubles the access angles of a 6-point. It's offset 15 degrees, creating clearance for your fingers and extra space to slide past whatever might be in the way. To prevent round-off, it contacts and applies force to the flat sides of fastener heads rather than the corners. The wrenches are compactly organized in a premium roll-up storage pouch with a tailored cover that keeps them from sliding out when you're on the move. To prevent scratches on finished surfaces, the pouch has fabric hanging loops rather than metal grommets.\n\nSet Includes:\n\n * (15) combination wrenches (metric): 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 mm\n * (1) roll-up storage pouch, red",
