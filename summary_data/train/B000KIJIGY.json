I removed the protective cardboard from the handle but upon placing my hand on the handle to pick up the poacher pan, I sustained a cut to the palm of my hand from the very sharp edge at the end of the handle. I also noticed a smaller cut from the metal seam on the bottom of the handle. This was enough for me to return the poacher.",
