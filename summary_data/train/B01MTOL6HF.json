I was then able to inflate the tire and then take off the adapter. The adapter looks just like the valve already built into the front tire.

I got just less than 6 miles from full charge. And that was without the headlight being on, which drains even more... so be careful on the range, especially when you'll be riding at night when you'll need the headlight.",

Open it out of the box and charge it up. It charges fine. Had to adjust the brake levers. Fine. The seat is installed crooked. Thats the first thing that went wrong. There is no way to straighten the seat. The back tire wont hold air. Come to find out that the valve stem is crooked and is rammed up against a bolt. Cant add air. Cant move valve stem. Stuck with a bike that my wife cannot ride.",
