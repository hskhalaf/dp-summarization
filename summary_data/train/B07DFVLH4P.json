The carrier works great for him; It is too long on my body and either the baby's head is hitting my chin constantly or strapped around my legs instead of my back- it is a long and big carrier,e ven with adjustments made. So, I only gave it four stars instead of five. However, Daddy and son do enjoy using it and it is helpful. It was easy to get the baby in and out.",

If she's sleepy she will let me wear her that way but she certainly prefers to be outward facing so she can see and explore her surroundings. I had the original Ergo and was unable to use very much for this reason. We decided to splurge on this one for vacation and I'm SO glad we did. I wore her in the airport, on the beach, on walks, etc.. She seemed super content and comfortable every time she was in this thing. I would most definitely recommend this over the Original; it's worth the additional cost!",

      "text": "Now that I figured out how to put it on and get my baby in and out I love it. It is not as self explanatory as the Baby Bjorn but it is much more comfortable especially for prolonged wear. I carried my 5 month old around Walt Disney World for 4 days- he weighs 16lbs and we walked about 8 miles a day. No pain between my shoulder blades or lower back like when I use the Bjorn. I'd certainly recommend this product.",

I wish the wasteband wasnt velcro though because its noisy and if i need to tighten it i have to undo the velcro and re-do it. This carrier is still worth it though because you know you are getting a safe and ergonomically healthy carrier for baby...and you can carry baby FACING OUT!",
