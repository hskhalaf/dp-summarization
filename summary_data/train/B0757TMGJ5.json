The safety feature of holding the top down while depressing the on button is a bit annoying, but I found you can let go of the top after the blade starts so perfect then.

Really like the variable speed trigger, versus most units hi/lo switches. Set came with a whisk attachment which is way useful, more than expected. Only negative (tiny) is that motor unit has a \"safety\" button on the end which has to be \"bumped\" before trigger will operate. Button times out in only 1-2 seconds. Didn't expect the timeout initially, was perplexed. On company/delivery, was speedy. One attachment was shattered on delivery. Placed ticket with Braun along with pic and order #. Received a replacement from Braun via speedy delivery.",
