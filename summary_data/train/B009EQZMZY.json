      "text": "I had worn Rykas back when I was doing Jazzercise, so I was familiar with them. I normally wear a 7.5 B and that is what I ordered. Perfect fit, plenty of room for toes and comfortable on heel. Using them for Zumba and dance aerobics and have plenty of support for the bouncing and jumping and yet very light and easy to move across the floor, even on carpet. Really like the pivot spot on the soles. Colors are terrific, bright and energetic! I had looked at and tried on other brands' dance aerobics shoes (Nike, Reebok, etc.) but they just didn't feel \"right\" on my feet. Happy with my choice and would do it again.",

That's about 8 weeks of good wearing; she wore them once a week for one hour each week. By mid-September they provided less support; by the end of the month the outer shoe support was pretty much gone. The description of the shoe made me believe we could expect more from the shoe. I don't know that she'll be able to wear them for other classes since her foot ached after the last class. We buy workout shoes frequently so I feel qualified to judge workout shoe products.",

I noticed that the Influence has a ton of padding on the back of the shoe above the heel. I wonder if that contributed to the strange fit? I have a high arch and narrow heel.
