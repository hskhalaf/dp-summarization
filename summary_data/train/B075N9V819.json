He loves it just the same. My favorite thing about this charger is it has the extra pegs so you don't have to charge your battery with your controller. We can switch out the dead battery for the charged one and put the dead one on the charger and keep playing.",

The connection is getting harder to manage and I'm having to wiggle the battery or push it hard to get it to connect. I'm sure it's just a faulty one but I can't do anything about it now since it's outside of my 30 days. I do like the ability to charge the batteries by themselves or with the controller attached. However, finding the right position for it to work is difficult.",

If you have your setup in your basement of living room then this might not bother you. 2nd star off because the batteries just dont have enough juice. The batteries wouldnt last me a full day, however, i do game longer than most people. If you game for a prolonged period of time id recommend looking elsewhere.",
