I've probably worn these for 60 days total since they're very breathable and not good in cold snowy weather and this is winter in Wyoming. I'm very disappointed since these are not cheap shoes to buy. I wouldn't recommend. The left shoe has completely torn the right is just starting.",

      "text": "This is my second par of Astral Shoes. My first pair I got at a local outdoor INC & I totally LOVE them(they don\u2019t have the size written on the tongue,like most) so I had no idea what size, so I went for 11(I\u2019m normally a 11) they were way to small. I sent back then looked to re- order I found it odd that the size 11 are $89 yet a size 11&1/2 is $120. No they weren\u2019t on sale when I first ordered them. I understand it might take a little more material for a 1/2 a size bigger only $40 worth \ud83e\udd14 can anyone explain. I\u2019d appreciate it & be very Grateful",

      "text": "While it may seem blasphemous (given the rave reviews that Astral shoes normally receive), I have found these shoes to be underwhelming. For perspective, I purchased the shoes for general use and occasional water-laden use. I had read assorted comments here and elsewhere about how comfortable these shoes are for any type of use, including just traipsing about, but my experience has been quite different. Even after normal breaking in, I find these shoes to be stiff and non-conforming to my feet regardless of their position and movement. These shoes may serve you well in your needs, but that hasn\u2019t been the case for me.",

      "text": "I bought these to try something similar to the Altra shoes. These are quite comfortable. I wear them for casual work everyday. I drive alot for work. So far been wearing them everyday for 3 weeks. My feet are not too sore. The soles are stiffer then I'm used to but I feel they have good support for my arch. Little tight in the toe box. I'm used to of the wider toe box with the Altra but still a good shoe. I can't comment on the shoes for outdoor activities. But these are great so far for normal Walking and driving for work. They do squeek sometimes on certain floors.",

They are super lightweight, breathable, and durable. They resist odor because you can spray them out with a hose and they dry very quickly. The only flaw with the otherwise grippy soles is that a couple of small edges have separated from the shoe, but a little gorilla glue and they\u2019re ready to get back out there! As good on the trail as they are in the water, these USA made shoes will not let you down!",
