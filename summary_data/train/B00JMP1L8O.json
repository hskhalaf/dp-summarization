I requested to return it and they agreed but don\u2019t pay for return shipping and it costs more to ship it back than the thing costs. Please do not buy this if you need a jack go to local store so if there\u2019s a defect your not stuck with a bunch of useless metal",

      "text": "On lifting the 5th sheet of 1/2\"x48\"x96\" drywall to the ceiling, I heard a loud bang and discovered that one of the hinges for a tripod leg had broken. Inspection showed that the bottom of that hinge had been tack-welded in place, but the complete weld had not been done. Took it to a local welder who reinforced all of the hinges for me and hopefully it will be fine. None of the welds were what I would judge to be good quality. Looked like I did the welding, and I know what a good weld looks like, but not HOW to do it.",

If I had to pick one thing that I did not like; it's the lower quality rubber pieces on the support arms of the lift. They are soft and they don't mar, but they do leave black skid marks on your drywall. No big deal if you are painting your drywall... so, only a minor gripe.",
