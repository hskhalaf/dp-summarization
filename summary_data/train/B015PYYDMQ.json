      "text": "Bought it 2 years ago and still works perfectly. It is always so silent even when gaming. It is easily expansible. I use an external monitor with it and fps on games is still flawless. The only issue I have with it (and many other buyers of this laptop) is the left corner pops up where the charging port is. The plastic falls apart and you have to open the laptop and screw the loose screw back in its place. I do this monthly as dells warranty specifically doesn't cover this. I wonder why \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14 Overall great laptop, even if it has its quirks.",

Sound of it is not loud and everything is good so far. If u want a buddget gaming laptop, this one is good on 1080p games. Anyway , worth for this price.",

Connect an Ethernet cable before you turn it on so that it starts installing all important updates immediately - this cleared all problems people seem to be having including wifi and graphics issues. Plays most current gen games at max graphics, doesn't overheat though the fans can get quite loud! Excellent display but has light bleed on the edges of the screen - only noticeable on start up, lowering screen brightness helps. Would highly recommend this laptop to the budding gamer or 3D modelling artist. For the price it's a steal!",
