Taste is a little on the chalky side. Just like it was in the 1990s. This stuff was cutting edge when it came out, and I'm sure it's still decent. With all of the latest to come out of sports nutrition, I'm betting you can find something better for the money - because this still seems just as expensive as it used to be.",

It is not exactly cheap, $60 for 40 packets but isnt bad for what you get. Definitely one of the best protein drinks around.",

Using a blender results in similar clumping and makes the blender a pain to clean. The flavor is fine, and it is filling. Just the mixing.",

      "text": "This is not the first time I've purchased Met-RX meal replacement powder, and it will not be the last. I have yet to find a meal replacement that tastes better (I use 2% milk, personally) or that fills me up better. I can easily make it several hours on a single packet and not get hungry. I find these especially useful on busy mornings where I know work is going to keep me running all day long and lunch is a \"maybe\" instead of a sure thing. Would highly recommend to anyone that is looking for a good meal replacement or for an easy way to add some additional nutrition in their diet.",

I would recommend this if you are also looking for an alternative to some more expensive shakes. The price is reasonable considering how much I got.
