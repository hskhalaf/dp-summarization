Pro: Very powerful, lightweight, cut nicely, much quieter than the gas power, and no nasty gas fumes. Con: The tip broke off when cutting Ivy and Black Berries branches. In my opinion the front end of the cutting blade is a bad design. See pictures. I would have give it a 5 stars if the tip didn't off during use.",

It\u2019s an absolute engineering failure. There are dozens of connectors and fasteners that would work better and I wish Greenworks had looked harder at that critical function. The balance of the unit is off as well making this a very tiring trimmer to work with. Customers may be better served with a lower voltage unit. I would advise people to look elsewhere until that connector is re-designed. Most people will need to take it apart after each use.",

I am fit and regularly lift weights but it was truly a workout using this machine. I will not return it for its convenience considering I will only use it once or twice a year. I do have the Greenworks chainsaw and leaf blower and these items are amazing but the hedge trimmer, unfortunately, falls short.",

The hedge trimmer makes trimming shrubs seem easy (after getting used to handling it). It is heavy however. We also purchased the trimmer which is another great purchase.

The death of the cord is finally here. 80v batteries are the only way to go. Forget the 40v, 20v, and any other battery.....they simply are not as good. My only fault with the hedge trimmer would be it's weight. With the 80v battery installed, your arms will get tired. However it's not a huge problem, since I tend to cut in shifts anyway. And, no more electrical cords to accidentally cut.",
