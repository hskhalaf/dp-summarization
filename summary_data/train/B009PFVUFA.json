There are other brush sets you can get on Amazon that are much better for around the same price. Don't get sucked in by the quantity that you get with this set because the quality is horrible.",

All new brushes need to be \"groomed\" to remove loose bristles. After that, no shedding. The larger brushes are soft, the angle brushes are perfect for lining and contouring eyes. Each brush is not labeled, but if you're experienced at all with makeup, you'll know what they are for - fan brushes, angle brushes, powder brushes, concealer and foundation brushes, several eye color brushes and applicators - plenty of variety for every makeup application. As a makeup artist, these are a good addition to my kits. For the price, anyone could afford this set.",

It is a great price and I am sure she will get much use out of the majority of brushes. I would like to maybr see an insert describing the brushes and their use included in the pack.

When I opened the package I will admit there was a smell, but to me it smelled like paint, which is a pleasant smell to me. I left it unrolled in my room for about an hour and the smell went away. The case it came in is wonderful. The brushes are very soft and easy to use. Make sure you wash them though before you use them. I haven't had any trouble with them falling apart. I'm so glad I purchased this.",

Although the price is very good for the amount of brushes you get, the quality is definitely not worth it. Especially if you have other more expensive brushes to compare it too.

Whenever I received the brushes they were all very well packaged but whenever I began to take them out of the packaging some hairs from the brushes kept falling. Even when I clean them a couple of brush hairs fall out. I wouldn't but this product again.",
