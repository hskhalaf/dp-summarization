I own an antique railroad pocket watch, and I had never seen anything smaller. As it turns out, I like the smaller size. It is easier to carry around in my pants pocket. Finally, the watch comes with its own chain. When I ordered this watch, Amazon immediately offered me a new chain, which I also ordered. It was slightly nicer than the original chain; but was completely unnecessary. Overall, I am pleased with both this pocket watch, and the additional chain I ordered.",

The build quality on this Gotham is nothing more and nothing less that what you'd expect at under $100. Pleased. What gets the 5 stars is that this watch survived a drop into about 8 inches of water. Complete submersion for several seconds. 48 hours later going strong, no fogging, no condensation, no signs of interior dampness at all. It's not advertised as water proof, and I'm not suggesting you try my accidental test, but I'm pleased with how tightly constructed this watch is.",

If you have to set them very much as when they first arrive or when daylight savings time changes, advance the time one hour past what you want, depress the stem and let them tick of a few seconds, then pull the stem and back them up to the time you want. Otherwise when you set them, they assume that they are keeping poor time and self-adjust their rate.",

I carry it in my pocket with keys, change, a small pocket knife and so far I can detect no scratches on the very clear face. I have not checked the time displayed but without having reset it I find it in agreement with my home clocks -- close enough to exact time for my leisurely ways. Over all a very neat, efficient, clear and useable pocket watch.",
