My main issue with the shoe is that they are hard for me to put on her and impossible for her to do on her own. They are tight to stay on the feet but they dont have a pull tab or other way to force them on. I bought an almost identical pair in a different brand but they were easier to get on",

They are easy for him to get on/off but not too easy that they fall off! He loves them and never complains of discomfort. They fit a tiny bit larger than his normal target brand shoes I typically buy but I would still suggest ordering the normal size you typically purchase as I feel if I ordered a size down they may be too snug! The gray color is nice and I\u2019m going to be ordering the navy color soon! Highly recommended \u2b50\ufe0f",
