      "text": "The product smells amazing and gives such a smooth shave without drying my skin out. I've been using this for about six months and am so glad I switched from regular shaving gel. As other reviewers noted, this goes on more like a lotion. If you are used to traditional shaving gels, you definitely have to adjust to using less and rinsing your razor more frequently (or it will clog your razor). My biggest complaint is that the bottle design prevents the pump from getting out like the last 1/4 of the product - wish they would fix the bottle design.",

I shave regularly and have used other soaps/creams that never did me as much harm as EOS Ultra Moisturizing Shave Cream, Vanilla. Yeesh.
