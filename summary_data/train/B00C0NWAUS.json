After spending several days & phone calls to Buffalo Tech, they finally admitted to me on the phone today that the DDR 3 drive is incompatible with Windows 7 Backup. I also spent several days searching the internet for solutions to Windows 7 Backup errors with the Buffalo DDR drive with no luck. There is nothing about this incompatibility on the Buffalo site. How convenient. Of course this is my last Buffalo product. The company just cannot be trusted.",
