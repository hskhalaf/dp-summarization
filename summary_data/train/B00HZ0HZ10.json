      "text": "Warm and sturdy. The main problem is that they've been useless in the snow -- the snow just clumps up on the bottom and then creates a snow block on the bottom of the boot that my son can't walk on. Four different snows (admittedly wet snows) and it has happened each time. My guess is that the tread is too deep and when the snow packs into the tread the sole is too stiff for a toddler to flex while walking so the snow doesn't break off 'naturally' --- it just builds and builds until there's a snow block. I'm now searching for boots with more shallow tread or a more flexible sole.",

As far as look and fit, they work like a charm, my 4 year old with a size 10 foot, can fit these with no struggle and they cover a decent of part if his leg to protect from rain and snow. But when it comes to playing in the snow, forget about it. As you can see from my pictures, they are not durable. Mind you, these pictures are from the FIRST time he wore them in the snow and it's as almost like they melted.....literally. I would not recommend these to anyone!",

After at least an hour out in the snow, my 3-year-old\u2019s feet were still toasty warm. I thought the deep tread on these boots would be a good thing. The problem is that the snow builds up on the bottoms and makes it extremely hard for her to walk around. I had to scrape the bottoms of the boots after about every 2 minutes of walking around. This was the first time she wore them, though, and I\u2019m hoping that once the rubber gets a bit worn, the snow buildup problem will go away.",

They're her go-to pair no matter the weather or location we go to. She finds them very easy to put on, and enjoys the \"clomp\" sound they make on hard floors. They are very effective on rainy days in keeping her feet dry and snug and warm.",

After a walk through the snow the bottom of the boots is basically a slick round ball from all the snow that has collected there, and she falls down if she tries to walk on a flat surface.

      "text": "Great boot. Kept my little ones feet dry. Fit to size and were easy to get on and off with the zipper down the front. Only thing I did not like is that they were a little heavy for my little one. She handled them well, but would have been nicer/more comfortable had they weighed a little less. Overall great product though.",
