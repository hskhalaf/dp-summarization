My house is smoke stank free now!! I luv this product. I do not use the air freshner with it - I've smelled enough smells. Would definitely recommend this product.",

As for the smell I don't like strong perfume odors as it causes eye irritation with me and this doesn't.It's clean faint and doesn't overpower.

The filter for the machine can be cleaned/vacuumed between replacement (about 4 months). Replacement filters cost about $20 for 2. Indicator lights will tell you when it's time to change the scent and filter. Notice this is a HEPA-TYPE purifier; it is not a true HEPA.

The scent part of it doesn't make a big difference, but we weren't buying it for that reason anyway so I'm not going to replace scent filter after it's used up. 3 settings are available which I alternate which one we use. The 1st setting is nearly silent! I have not tried other brands to actually compare it to, but very happy with febreeze brand purifiers!!",

I have a newborn son that I didn't want to be inhaling too of it, so I bought this air purifier to get rid of some of the dust and pet dander, and I must say it is definitely working. We keep it on low and it's enough to keep our floors with a very significant and noticeable decrease of dust on the floor.",

Then I switch it to \"low\" and it is quiet enough to allow me to go to sleep without any problems. I do notice the change in air quality and it has helped my nighttime stuffy nose a lot. The only drawback is that it does not have a timer, which would be useful to me.",

I have the smell turned way down as I don't really like the Linen smell that came with it... smells off to me however I'm pregnant and my nose hates pretty much everything... It does make noise however it's a FAN so was expected. I do think it's disappointing that filters have to be changes every 4 months when the other helps filters I have or at least 6 months... I will update later as I have it for a longer period of time",
