After taking the camera to my local camera store I was told that the shutter count was 430.000! The D3 shutter is rated for 250.000. I now have to send the camera to a shop in California for a shutter replacement. This will coast me an additional $860! The Camera worked as advertised, the shutter count was not listed. I should have known that a camera listed as acceptable would have seen heavy use. Buyer beware!",

It's 12 megapixels, but that's plenty of pixels on a full frame sensor. The lowlight performance, staggering ISO range, and autofocus do very well for a 12-year-old camera. I bought a 444 page manual from Nikon, I needed it. I'm very pleased with my D3. $500.00 is a good price for a D3 in good shape, and it's better than paying over $5,000.00 for new.",

    "description": "Designed with sports photographers and photojournalists in mind, the Nikon D3 introduces an astounding list of brand new features and technologies that make it the most sophisticated and advanced Nikon digital SLR to date. In addition to the new FX- format CMOS sensor, the D3 incorporates Nikon\u2019s new EXPEED Image Processing System that is central to the blazing speed and processing power needed for many of the D3\u2019s new features.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nManufacturer Description \n\n Designed with sports photographers and photojournalists in mind, the Nikon D3 introduces an astounding list of brand new features and technologies that make it the most sophisticated and advanced Nikon digital SLR to date. In addition to the new FX- format CMOS sensor, the D3 incorporates Nikon\u2019s new EXPEED Image Processing System that is central to the blazing speed and processing power needed for many of the D3\u2019s new features. \n\nThe 12.1 effective megapixel D3 features Nikon\u2019s new FX-format CMOS sensor, measuring 23.9 x 36mm, which is nearly identical to the size of 35mm film. With the fastest start-up time, shortest viewfinder blackout time, and shortest shutter lag of any digital SLR camera, as well as the capability to shoot up to nine frames per second at full FX-format resolution, the D3 is the world\u2019s fastest digital SLR camera in its class. \n\n\n\nImages taken with the D3 reflect exceptional overall quality, broad tonal range and depth, along with extremely low noise throughout its normal ISO range of 200 to 6400. By setting the camera to its built-in options of Lo-1 or Hi-2, the ISO range of the camera can be expanded to the equivalent of ISO 100 or ISO 25,600 respectively, offering unmatched versatility in practically any shooting situation. The D3 also features an entirely new 51-point auto focus system with Nikon\u2019s 3D Focus Tracking feature and two new LiveView shooting modes that allow photographers to frame a photograph using the camera\u2019s high-resolution LCD monitor. The D3 uses the world\u2019s first Scene Recognition System to greatly enhance the accuracy of auto focus, auto exposure and auto white balance detection in the camera by recognizing the subject or scene being photographed and applying this information to the calculations for the three functions. \n\nThe D3 is designed for professional use in demanding conditions. The exterior of the D3 is crafted of magnesium alloy and the camera\u2019s shutter mechanism is tested to 300,000-cycle releases. The 3-inch LCD is strengthened with tempered glass and the D3\u2019s comprehensive array of rubber gaskets and seals protect vulnerable entry points from dust and moisture. \n\nNikon D3 Digital SLR Highlights \n\nNew, 12.1 effective megapixel FX-format (23.9 x 36mm) sensor The D3\u2019s new and original 12.1 effective megapixel FX-format CMOS image sensor features a series of technologies that enable it to deliver superior quality pictures throughout the camera\u2019s exceptionally broad ISO range. In addition, the sensor\u2019s high-speed 12-channel readout allows the camera to shoot 12.1-megapixel images at up to nine frames per second. \n\nWide sensitivity range The camera\u2019s ISO sensitivity range is extremely broad, allowing photographers to shoot low-noise photographs in a variety of situations. The camera\u2019s normal range is from ISO 200 to 6400, and this range can be extended using the camera\u2019s built-in settings of Lo-1 and Hi-2 for the equivalent of ISO 100 and ISO 25,600, respectively. \n\nHigh-speed performance The D3 is designed to deliver high-speed performance in virtually any situation. With a shutter release time lag of only 37 milliseconds, camera start-up time of 0.12 seconds, and continuous shooting speed of up to nine frames per second with full resolution 12.1 megapixel images, the D3 is the world\u2019s fastest digital SLR camera in its class.* The D3 is also capable of shooting at up to 11 frames per second when using the camera\u2019s DX- format mode, with 5.1-megapixel images. The Nikon D3 is also compliant with UDMA memory cards, enabling recording speeds of up to 35 megabytes per second. \n* As of August, 2007; among cameras featuring an imaging sensor similar to the size of 35mm film. \n\nNew EXPEED Image Processing System The D3 features Nikon\u2019s new EXPEED Image Processing System that is central to the speed and processing power of the camera. EXPEED delivers optimized performance for the camera and its features, and ensures high-image quality and high-speed image processing. \n\nVersatile new Picture Control System Nikon\u2019s new Picture Control System, featured in the D3, allows photographers to fine-tune and adjust fundamental rendering options for their pictures so they can define the exact tone, sharpening, brightness and saturation they prefer. They can then port these settings to any other Nikon camera featuring the Picture Control System, such as the recently introduced D300, so that even when shooting with different cameras, they can get consistent tones for all their pictures. \n\nNew 51-point auto focus system The D3 features Nikon\u2019s Multi-CAM 3500FX auto focus sensor module, with 51 AF points, including 15 cross-type sensors that are located in the center of the frame. These cross-type sensors work with all Nikkor lenses, including those with apertures as small as f/5.6. The D3\u2019s auto focus system is closely linked with the camera\u2019s innovative Scene Recognition System to deliver greater accuracy in subject detection and focus tracking performance. \n\nRevolutionary new Scene Recognition System Nikon\u2019s D3 features a revolutionary new Scene Recognition System that greatly enhances the accuracy of auto exposure, auto white balance detection and auto focus in the camera. The Scene Recognition System uses the camera\u2019s built-in, 1,005-pixel RGB metering sensor to recognize the subject or scene being photographed and detect any movement. This information helps optimize exposure and white balance settings for the recognized subject and also enables the camera to assign appropriate AF points based on any movement of the subject, ensuring highly precise auto focus tracking performance. \n\nSuper-density, 3-inch VGA, TFT LCD monitor with 920,000-dot resolution The D3 features a gorgeous, ultra high-definition 3-inch LCD monitor with 920,000-dot resolution. The monitor provides a 170-degree viewing angle and is very effective in confirming focus on pictures as well as framing a shot using the camera\u2019s new LiveView modes. \n\nLiveView shooting with two optimized modes Two new LiveView modes in the D3 enable photographers to compose their shot using the camera\u2019s ultra-high resolution LCD monitor. The Tripod mode is designed for precise focus and accuracy when the camera is on a stable platform and the subject is not moving. In this mode, the camera focuses on the subject using focal-plane contrast and any point on the LCD screen can be selected as the focus point for the picture. The second mode, called Handheld mode, allows photographers to use the camera\u2019s conventional TTL focusing system, with all 51 points and 15 cross-type points available. When using this mode, the camera activates focusing immediately when the shutter button is pressed, to ensure accurate focus. \n\nActive D-Lighting Nikon\u2019s D-Lighting feature in its digital SLR cameras has proved to be a popular way for photographers to quickly compensate for dark areas of a picture after it is taken, without adversely affecting its highlights. The D3 now features an Active D-Lighting mode that when enabled provides remarkable real-time highlight and shadow correction with optimized image contrast. Active D-Lighting produces broader tone reproduction in both shadows and highlights by controlling highlights and exposure compensation while applying localized tone control technology to achieve a more pleasing level of contrast across the entire image. And because the advantages of Active D-Lighting are applied as images are captured, image editing time can be shortened. \n\nDual CF slots offer memory flexibility Improved usability Several aspects of the D3\u2019s usability have been refined to offer professional photographers a satisfying experience when using the camera. The camera\u2019s optical viewfinder offers a large, bright image with virtually 100 percent frame coverage and 0.7x magnification in FX-format. The D3 accepts two CF (Compact Flash) cards simultaneously for a myriad of recording options as well as the ability to copy images between the two cards. Display images on your HDTV via the HDMI port An integrated HDMI port offers the ability to view images from the camera directly on a high-definition television. The D3 also features the world\u2019s first virtual horizon level indicator that uses sensors incorporated within the camera to indicate the inclination of the camera relative to the horizon, on the LCD monitor or inside the viewfinder. \n\nReliable and durable The D3 is designed to perform reliably and consistently under the most demanding conditions. The exterior of the D3 is crafted of magnesium alloy, and numerous seals are used throughout the body to protect the camera against dust and moisture. The camera\u2019s shutter employs blades made of a hybrid of carbon fiber and Kevlar and is tested to 300,000 cycles. The camera also features a Self Diagnostic Shutter Monitor that ensures the accuracy and precision of the shutter at all times. \n\nFine-tune adjustment for auto focus Photographers who need to make small adjustments to correct differences in focusing can do so using the D3\u2019s built-in capability to adjust focus specific to a lens. The camera offers the option of either setting compensation for a specific lens so adjustment in focus is only enabled when that particular lens is used, or the camera can apply a uniform level of compensation for any lens used with the camera. Users can store settings for up to 20 different lenses if they prefer to fine-tune the camera\u2019s focusing based on specific lenses. \n\nDesigned for ergonomics, by Giugiaro The D3 is built around the central theme of ergonomics and the camera\u2019s exterior form is designed by world renowned Italian design house, Giugiaro. Every aspect of the D3 is fine-tuned to be ergonomic and help photographers seamlessly work with the camera. Its slightly inclined command dial, comfortable hand-grip, and curves on the pentaprism top, grip and side panels are all part of a new design theme.",
