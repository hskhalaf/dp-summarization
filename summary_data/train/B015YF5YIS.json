This took me beyond a month for the purchase, and when they agreed to replace it they refused to pay postage because it was \"beyond a month of purchase\". Amazon would also not take it for the same reason, An Amazon supervisor was supposed to call me the same day, and it is going on the fourth day. So I have a useless piece of electronics sitting here. This is the first bad review I have done of a product on Amazon!",

I was worried about the noisy fan and hot unit that other people reported when buying roku4 but went ahead and bought it. I do not hear any abnormally high fan noise. In fact the unit runs very quite. Also it only gets as hot as my other roku which is roku2. Remote finder is a nice addition. No hidden remote anymore. Like roku2 set up is a breeze. My only complaint is for this price they could have included the HDMI cable.",

Of the few hundred apps present at least half are for periodic live-streaming only public access tv type content. Many features included for free on other players require a subscription channel (app). Roku must make it easy and low cost to create channels. On balance, there are a lot of channels with periodic content from local non-profile organizations like churches and charities. Plays 1080p H.265 encoded files well.

For the record, I do have it placed on a wall mounted shelf with plenty of ventilation. In regards to the device itself, Roku is awesome. I use it for HBO Go, Netflix and Amazon and it has worked flawlessly. I also like the fact that it can be accessed over Wifi using Anymote on my tablet/phone. It's also cool that the remote itself has a headphone jack so that you can still use it even if you need to be quiet.",
