It really came down to me not performing the steps in the proper order, which are: 1) turn on drone. 2) turn on remote. 3) connect remote to device (i used a micro usb-lightning cable). 4) turn on app. So much fun to fly.

I've recently purchased a DJI Mavic Air and DJI Mavic 2 Zoom and this drone still has surprised me in both video quality (even though its only 1080p). I have yet had a chance to fly it outside due to the current weather but will update this review if I experience any negative or concerning issues. I am curious as to the range and video quality at a far distance. Thanks!",

It\u2019s less the half the size and weight, includes a gimbal mounted camera and offers flight telemetry. It\u2019s also much quieter and even a bit faster along with twice the flight time.",
