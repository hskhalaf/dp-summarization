The original product is sulfate free so it will not lather easily. This prevents your hair from getting dried out from the chemicals. This product is filled with sulfates. There were SO many bubbles and it dried my hair out so bad. Half way through I was scared that my hair was going to fall out. I am reporting this seller to Amazon.",

I love the professional L'Oreal Kerastase line so didn't expect this shampoo to be so bad.

The second (and last) time I used it, my hair was left coated even though I rinsed it far longer than usual. I ended up putting my hair in a messy bun that day because it looked and felt so bad, like greased out and dirty hair. No thanks!",
