Pros It does clean through the main machine. Very heavy. Very loud Cons. Leaks water when stored even though all tanks emptied. Hose fitting packed up after one use. Power cord gets in the way and catches when in use. Not worth the money.",

The Vax Platinum shampoo that is included with the machine is recommended without reservation, amazing cleaner. I would give this machine 6 stars if it were possible, a great product at a great price, well done Vax.",

When machine works it does a fantastic job according to personal opinion. Cons: very heavy, 2 broke when using hose attachments, can flood or completely stop working and over heat. Pros: hose does clean very well when working. Cant say nothing about the machine been used on carpets as broke before had chance to clean them.",
