I do appreciate that P&G is realizing that plant-based products are highly important to those of us who are label readers & wanting to know what we are using for our families. The White Tea & Lavender is much milder than the Orange Blossoms. If you are sensitive to smells (like me) try this one first. I believe you will be happy!!!!
