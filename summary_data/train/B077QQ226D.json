This summer, I have been tutoring and broke out the colored rulers I purchased. They worked so well! I was surprised at how successful they were, and now I can\u2019t wait to share them with my fellow teachers. The darker colors had more success than the lighter ones, but I can\u2019t wait for school to start next week so that I can really get some use out of them! What an excellent tool to encourage learning and the love of reading!",

It takes a little bit to get used to using them, but once you do you can start to work on increasing your reading speed by moving the ruler down the page a bit faster, \"forcing\" your eyes to follow it. I've been reading a lot more since getting these. The different colors don't seem to make a difference for me, but it's nice to have multiple to leave in different books as bookmarks. Don't forget to take off the protective coating, they're murky otherwise.",
