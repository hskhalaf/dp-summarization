We mostly use it for taking him outside for some morning sun to help set his circadian rhythm - it's really nice to have something you can carry him in and set him down in, and he doesn't mind hanging out in it for a little while. It's handy, feels sturdy, and looks cute!",

My 2nd child was only 17 months old so I wanted something fairly rigid in order to keep his little not-so-gentle hands at a safe distance from new little one. This carrier was absolutely adorable, SUPER soft inside and had a decently rigid form while still folding down somewhat flat. The shade was nice (and less face it, downright adorable) but not being able to lower it was the only thing that was somewhat of a \"con\". I think it would do the job to have somewhere to sit baby on the couch, floor etc when they are small and would be more than adequate.",
