Basically, pay$30 to see if your $60 suitcase *might* be covered by warranty. I gave up and came here to write a negative review instead because it was just too complicated to figure it out (they require SKU# just to start). Forget it unless you're good with only six months of use.",

I ended up finding a case that was more than double the price, but it was also as big as you could fit in a carry on bin and it has locks and compartments.

I didn't think TOO much of it, as it still had another handle on the side, where I put my luggage tag and my name tag. The second handle broke off somewhere between check in and baggage claim. I found it without any tags, and it's handle was somewhere else on the belt all by itself. Such a shame. Returning.",

Minor scuffs occurred when I checked it, but nothing was broken inside (pottery). It also has a good set of wheels and handle. A carry on shuffle fits on top.100% would recommend as a good carry on at this price.",

I've has spinner luggage in the past that seem to get off balance and become hard to roll while upright if they were packed in a certain way, but I can pack this one any way I please and it still rolls smoothly. It seems durable, but I have only taken it on a few flights and can't attest to its longevity yet.",
