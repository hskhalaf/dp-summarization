I found this a user error, not a product defect.",

The ring is great until the strength of it becomes loose. It usually break within a year so that's pretty good. 3. The magnet is useless because it doesn't work for my car. The air vents are angled so it's impossible for me to look at my screen. 4. The magnet is not removeable so I can't do wireless charging. It's still overall great. I bought this twice and I plan on buying it again when it breaks. It's just that the adhesive glue is weak.",
