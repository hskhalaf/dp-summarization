However, my skin flaked off within a few days and I had very raw and red skin on my cheekbone area. Additionally, I had a lot of irritation on my neck. I kept wondering if it was something else with my skin, so I tried to use this over the course of a few months with the same result each time. While I would recommend every other DE product, this is not one of them.",

Alas, cosmeceuticals are not FDA regulated, so otc products are a bit of a dice roll. i've since gotten a prescription for tretinoin, the tried and true gold standard in anti aging topicals",

    "description": "THE DRUNK ELEPHANT DIFFERENCE\nWith a mission to deliver clinically-effective, clean skincare products formulated with both cutting-edge synthetic and natural ingredients, Drunk Elephant knows that every ingredient should directly benefit the health of your skin or the safety of the formulation. \n\n A-PASSIONI\nA daily dose of nourishing vitamins for your complexion, this cream infuses passionfruit, apricot, marula and jojoba oils to nourish and moisturize your skin, while kale,winter cherry, and xanthophylls protect against environmental stressors. \n\n Suggested Use: We recommend applying a pea-size amount (or less) to a clean, dry face, avoiding the eye area. Limit initial use to once or twice a week, day or night, gradually increasing frequency to every other night, and then every night as tolerated. Always use a broad spectrum sunscreen. \n\n NO FRAGRANCE\nAfter carefully balancing the best ingredients available, Drunk Elephant doesnt have to add anything to mask their natural scents. When you smell their products, you will likely detect nothing but a glycerin base with slight hints of Marula oil, Zinc Oxide, Thermal Mud, Fruit Enzymes, and Vitamins for a refreshing and reassuring scent. \n\n COMMITTED TO CLEAN\nDrunk Elephant is committed to using only clean ingredients that either directly benefit the skins health, or support the integrity and effectiveness of their formulas. Youll never find the Suspicious 6 (Essential Oils, Drying Alcohols, Silicones, Chemical Screens, Fragrances/Dyes and SLS) in their products.",

      "SENSITIVE VS. SENSITIZED. When skin is exposed to irritants and sensitizers, damage can be imperceptible and cumulative, leaving it in a reactive mode. \"Sensitive\" skin is often just skin that has become sensitized over time by harsh additives",
