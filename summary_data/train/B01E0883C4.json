It is repairable, but why should I have to fix a new product? Update: I received an entire new unit from the company. It was unexpected as I was expecting replacement parts.

It fits the poles beautifully and it's very good and solid high quality wood with a nice finish on it. I was looking for cheaper options but the wall mount ones although cheaper took up more room than I wanted in my garage and this you can put right into a corner if desired out of the way of everything and with 16 available spots I won't outgrow it. I highly recommend this if you have multiple fishing poles. Beautiful product worth every penny!",

I find that I cannot find multiple rods/reels of the same size (spinning) next to one another. I can get 16 in there but only if I stagger various sized rod/reel combos so that the reels are higher/lower from slot to slot. Overall, would purchase again though.",
