The bottom plate is fine, but the top plate has completely failed. I do a lot of searing so my thoughts are that might of damaged the top plate. I have always followed the directions of cleaning the plates, and like I said the bottom plate has no problems at all.

It is quick to cook meat and leaves a nice sear while also draining all the fat off the meat and into the tray for dumping. The only struggle I have run into is determining the proper cook time for the meat since the thickness changes the cook time and the machine tends to cook the outside of the meat fairly quickly. It seems to be a trial and error process for me, but otherwise, has been a great purchase!",

I don't want to buy an new one every two years, so back into research mode I go. I don't know if this was a fluke or if it represents the workmanship of the product.",

I think I'll go back to my pressure cooker. That way at least, the meat comes out juicier AND mostly fat free.",

We have made chicken breasts twice now and each time the chicken has been so moist and tender. The waffle plates are also great. The plates do not need greased at all. The waffles just slide right off! We will definitely be buying some of the other plates that are made to go with it so we can really see what this baby can do! It is a must buy!",

I have been able to clean them easily with a short soak in the sink. The only issue I have had is that it slides a bit on the counter when opening and closing and I have to constantly push the drip tray back under so it doesn't make a mess.",

Difficult in knowing when the waffles were done. Regular waffle irons beep. Also the cookbook doesn't give temperature or time guidelines so that was a waste of time and money on the manufacturer's part. If you're looking for a two-sided grill for meat I'm sure any brand will do just as well.",

I still use it when the stove is occupied with other foods. Slow, but works as expected. The sear feature is nice.",

If you are an avid Foreman fan my advice is learn to cook on a real grill. This product is no longer a worthy substitute.",

So, I set my temperature then have to use another timer to time my meals. Secondly, the hinge on right side is intact but doesn\u2019t bend the same as left hinge causing scrapes on the nonstick surfaces of the grill and difficulty in closing the top. Disappointed in what should have been an awesome purchase!",

      "Digital Control Panel- Delicious grilling starts with precise temperatures. The digital control panel displays the cooking time and grill temperature, which you can set from 325\u02da-450\u02da, plus a special button for the 500\u02da searing burst.
