Good thing we found some left over screws from other projects. It doesn't match the stand but it'll do. One side of the stand is not welded/glued (see picture) but it shouldn't be a problem since there are metal slats under the wood that will hopefully keep it together.",

Because the edges of the TV stand are surround by the iron frame, you don't have problem with bad quality wood not being fined thoroughly that hurts your hands. The surfaces of the wooden boards are smooth enough. The only issue with assembly is that you definitely need two persons, because you need one person to hold the broad in-place while the other person puts all four screws in.",

I would assemble it while it\u2019s laying on its side if you\u2019re by yourself bc the shelves are quite heavy to hold. It\u2019s holding our 42\u201d tv well, it\u2019s not wobbly at all. It was a perfect cheap tv stand for our apartment. There was a little bit of wood scratched off on one of the corners, but we put that side nearest to the wall so it\u2019s not noticeable. It really is only noticeable if you look for it. It came packaged neatly and we are really happy with it!",
