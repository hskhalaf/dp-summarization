I used the floor specific knee pads and they worked fine for a few hours, but the longer you're working the less comfort they provided. My leg hair was not ripped out, but my knees were in a lot of pain. Site did say they would take my criticism into account and work on making a better product.",

Great price, great customer service, superior comfort and only a small quality flaw that is backed by the guarantee with a replacement.",

The problem I had was that in order for them to stay in place I need to tighten the straps fairly tightly. I tried it with straps crossed and uncrossed, no difference. Unfortunately, the tightness causes the elastic to bunch and take several permanent creases. Instead of being a 2 inch wide strap it's now about 1/2 inches. This caused significant chaffing and blistering on the backs of my knees. Ouch! The pads themselves are still very comfortable but I can't wear them for any length of time anymore due to the creases in the elastic.",

On grass, mulch, concrete, and other places, they were great. Also, the buckle strap system is nice, no issues with the \"buttons\" falling off or anything. I also like that I can pop them off easily when I'm done with them. Overall a good product.",
