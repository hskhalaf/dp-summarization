      "text": "I viewed many pocket watches to find one with the right 'look'. The color scheme & design combined, give it a nice 'rich' appearance. I was looking for a costume prop piece & this fits the bill nicely. The softer/duller brass, woodgrain & roman numerals are perfect for more of an aristocratic, heirloom watch. So far the function has been flawless & even though I bought it for a prop, this is definitely worth the price for daily use. One drawback for me, and I think another reviewer mentioned..... the hands on the watch are too short. They are hard to see....hence the 4 stars.",

I do say we are very happy with the company. Upon getting our feedback they went out of their way to personally email me and ask to replace the watch free of charge. It is very nice to see a company care about their customers. My father has had the watch for about a month or two now since getting it replaced and has had no issues with it since. Thank you again for replacing the watch!",

It's more fun and easier to read than a wristwatch, though a digital watch would be easier still. That said, with the digital watch you don't get the very visible intricate clockwork. You can watch it move and listen to it for a satisfying feeling you don't get with newer timepieces.",

Only about 10 days after I received it. Stem winder broke, so I can't wind it, and it is stuck so it only changes the hands. Kinda sad. I liked the watch! Fit and finish is why I give it 2 stars. Would have been 5 if it hadn't broken so soon.",
