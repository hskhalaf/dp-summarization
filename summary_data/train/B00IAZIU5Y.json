On my outlet, the screw on one side seems to be stripped or dislodged from the clamping mechanism. It will not clamp down on the wire. Thus, there is no way to hold the wire in place.

      "text": "I purchased two of these. I installed the first with no issue. The second one has been in the box until today, several month later, and it turned out it is defective out of the box. The screw to tighten the hot lead is broken and will not hold the wire. It's too late to return it... The first one which I've now used for a few months is OK. The USB ports charge devices with no issue. My complaint is that the AC outlets are not easy to plug/unplug. You have to force the plug in, which feels like poor quality. I can't recommend this product.",

I bought a pair on special and gave the other to my bro in law, they charge various Android devices and an iPhone and they've had no issues. Their phones and tablets charge faster too.",

If it holds up to the abuse of 5 kids and my wife constantly pluigging/unplugging and pulling the cords at all angles I will buy more. This is just a trial. It was nice that it came with two types of wall plates. Sucks that I ordered a wall plate for like $3 with it as I seen it was in the combo purchase section in amazon for this product. My own fault for not researching.",
