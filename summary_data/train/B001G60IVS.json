It's a struggle to push it, like trying to push a nail into a wall. If you push it all the way in, the tack pokes out the back of the bulletin board and into your wall because the cork is too thin! Not okay. We didn't notice this until we had already unwrapped the board, discarded the packaging and hired someone to hang it. Too much of a hassle to return now, but if this review can save someone else, that would be good.",

Every one complaining about the quality... it is 20 bucks, what do you want? Go to Staples and pay $40-50 for a larger, better board. I would buy again. ~ the wife",
