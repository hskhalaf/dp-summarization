Then a friend recommended this product... AMAZING! The included scrubbers and scrapers really make the difference. As others have said it will leave your cooktop shiny and new... Even marks that had been on there for years came almost completely off... 98% better. The key is to use very little product... Let dry to a haze and wipe with a clean dry cotton towel. (Just like waxing a car). If you aren't getting a mirrored finish it's because you've used too much product and not enough elbow grease to polish off.",

I found that when you are anxious to clean your stovetop, you can actually apply the cream and turn the burner on low to medium high and let it dry up. That usually removes tough stains quickly. But just don't leave the burner on. You should remain in your kitchen to be on the safe side. What I like about the tools is opportunity to use a little \"elbow grease\" tough spots without turning on a burner and buffing the stovetop as the last phase takes less time since the stovetop is cold.",

Plus the razor swivels left and right while scraping and pops out of place. Save yourself a little money/hassle and just get the cleaning product by itself and get a better quality razor scraper. Just use a rag to apply the product or a dollar tree sponge. Way better than the crap included with this great cleaning product.",

The razor blade is ok, very cheap made, but works fine for what its used for.

Every time I use this it looks like my stove could be brand new.",
