I work in construction and currently doing a renovation job in a building, so I'm not in one area, room, floor, etc for to long. Cart seems pretty solid so far, a lot of space for my tool box, extension cords, tools that I use often and the most important tool of all..... my cooler! I had to order another for my friend after he seen mines.",

      "text": "A great cart but there's two things I would like to see changed. I wish all of the wheels swiveled (instead of just two wheels). I also wish it was put together with bolts instead of screws. Something about driving a screw into plastic never seems right to me -- I'm worried that I'll strip the plastic when putting it together or, even if that goes ok, it seems like it will eventually rip through (and would then be hard to fix.) But as long as this doesn't happen I think this cart is quite nice!",

The standard casters are inside. I read numerous complaints of this happening and thought I had overchecked my order to be sure it wouldn\u2019t be something I had messed up in ordering - but evidently Rubbermaid doesn\u2019t QC their own shipments or something. Returning unless it can be fixed but I needed them for Monday morning and it\u2019s Friday. And of course There\u2019s no number to call anyone.",
