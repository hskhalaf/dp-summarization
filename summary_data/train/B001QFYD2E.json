No jams (as some others report) and very easy to reload in cramped quarters. this gun has been rolled around in the dirt due to the confine space and is still functioning well.

Other than the crucial problem, the case and gun look great and were brand new. Perhaps mine is defective?",

Having more floors to do, will make a jig to work better. I have used the stapler in another application and it worked great. It is relatively small and easy to handle. I did not give this stapler 5-stars because of Amazon's delivery. For an \"in stock\" item, it took nearly a week to get it even though it was eventually shipped from a neighboring state. Unacceptable in my opinion.",
