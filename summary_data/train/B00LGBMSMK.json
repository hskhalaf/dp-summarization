You have to train it to use the restroom, clean up after itself and get ready for bed. There are also classes that they have to go to until they pass and it just makes it so interactive and fun. Compared to the IDL and the P's, raising your baby into the character you want is very simple and I like that.",

I was skeptical at first due to the language barrier (Japanese) but it seriously only took me an hour or so to get a feel for everything. There's plenty of guides online to help as well. I honestly think that the Japanese language/font only adds to the cuteness factor of it. Loved it so much that I ordered my husband one as well (we were both Tamagotchi fans in the late 90s. It's a simply beautiful product, and not nearly as needy as the ones I remember in my youth.",

Lists of compatible devices can be found online. Someone once described the 4U has having a more \"sophisticated\" feel compared to other Tamagotchis- I completely agree. The gameplay is more complex than other Tamagotchis with the player being able to \"train\" this Tamagotchi to learn basic skills and more advanced skills (such as training the Tamagotchi to brush its own teeth).

If you have an android smart phone that can download the app it's worth it. However, the app does not work on all phones, or any iphone. But it's a cool game@",
