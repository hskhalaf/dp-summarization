The blade slides easily and is surrounded by a metal shield. The lock button works as it should, although it does take a bit of finess. The knife uses standard 18mm blades. The blades change easily as the entire knife breaks down into 4 parts. My only quibble is that the end cap doesn't have a slot to snap off a blade section. An excellent utility knife!",

I like that you get 3 in the pack and the bright color makes it easy to find in a drawer. I would definitely recommend these box cutters.",

I like that the blade can be adjusted somewhat to uncover just a small point, so as not to cut too deep to prevent piercing packaged items. If heavier cardboard, just push blade farther out.",

On the minus side: The button to extend the blade does not have a lock setting, so you can extend it accidentally. You could not safely carry this in your pocket. Also, the comfortable shape of the grip is somewhat offset by the position of the button, because when I grip the handle firmly, I have accidentally pressed the button that makes the blade extend.
