This beverage tote comes with six neoprene compartments/seperators, one for each drink, as well as a space in the middle for a small ice pack. In my case, since I bought a cooler pack that was larger than the compartment designed for a smaller ice pack, I had to rip out all of the compartments so that I could fit the ice pack and six drinks without over-stretching the tote. I have attached photos",

This would be a great product if it were made larger. Not sure why Amazon recommends the igloo bottle/can ice pack in the frequently purchased with are. That ice pack alone would not fit in the carrier.",
