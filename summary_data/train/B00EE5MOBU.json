The non-skid letters and dots on the bottom of them immediately start to fall off the very day I wear a new pair. I bought these mostly for comfort and safety, but the non-skid stuff will be gone within a few wears. I feel ripped off. :-(",

      "text": "I love these. I wear a US Women's size 7, and they fit perfectly and stay on. The elastic doesn't itch or bind at all, at least on me. The only problem is that lint keeps coming out of them forever, every time you take them off, and after a lot of wear and washes, they get kind of felted on the bottom and aren't as soft or fuzzy anymore. The lint doesn't stop coming until they aren't soft and fluffy anymore. I love the fuchsia and gray the best. Wish there was a pack without baby blue and especially pink, but the feel is more important than the looks.",

They are plush but not very densely woven, so they will not keep your feet warm if there is a cold draft around. Mine arrived as four individually packaged pairs, great for sharing. Made in China.",
