The forks work better with bread than the two prong forks do. I bought this after having used a stainless steel fondue pot for a couple of years, and getting frustrated with the burning of the cheese. I found out it was really better for meats/oils, the ceramic better for chocolates, and the enamel ones were better for cheeses. The pot can slide a bit on the stand, but the raised edges keep it from sliding off.",

The oil from the cheese had a tendency to separate but I kept stirring and the oil once again blended back into the fondue. Next I will do a chocolate desert fondue. Yummm!",

It is made of heavyweight enameled cast iron and the stand is sturdy so I had no worry either of scorching from the heat source or tipping from a flimsy set up, both of which I've experienced with other pots. It is also a good, generous size, plenty enough capacity for the recipe I followed. Another nice thing is you can use the gel burner packs or you can fill the burner with liquid fuel, both will work. The black finish is nice, it goes with anything and doesn't give me flashbacks to the 1970's!",

Because it is cast iron with an enamel interior, there are no hot spots and every easy to clean. And the six fondue forks are three-prong instead of two-prong which are in many sets. The three-prong arrangement makes them great for dipping items heavier than just bread; like small potatoes or veggies.",

For the first timers, I would recommend buying fondue kit on grocery store instead of making everything yourself. Also, do clean it right a way; otherwise you going to have bad time.",

      "text": "My wife was craving cheese fondue so I shopped around and decided on this one. Sooo much better than the el-cheapos that were all over the place. The heavy cast-iron heats up evenly on the stove and it has a nice comfortable handle. Clean up afterwards was easy. The stand is solidly constructed, quite stable, and protects the tabletop. The burner works well with gel, though it takes a half dozen wooden matches to get it going enough to sustain the flame, and goes down to a good simmer. About the only minus I can think of is there's no way to tell the forks apart.",
