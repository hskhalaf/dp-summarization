These Casio scientific calcs are just fine for 90% of what we do, so I bought 10 of them to let students use them if they don't have a graphing calc. They are really top-notch scientific calcs. By the way, I do NOT recommend the Casio graphing calcs such as the Casio fx-9750. On first glance, they look comparable to the TI-84s, but they are inferior and students who buy them are usually disappointed.",

Working with it on a desk you can't see the numbers unless you are directly over it, almost perpendicular to the screen. This means that after entering something you have to pick it up and tilt it towards you in order to read it or use it in an almost vertical position. When not directly over the screen, all you can see are the \"8888s\" and lcd modules, not your numbers/calculations. Very disappointing for a Casio product. It will be returned.",

Since calculators have a habit of wandering off occasionally, it's always good to have a few extra on hand. At least this style won't make you go broke if you have to get a couple of them. It's nice and easy to use. It won't graph, but it will do most basic things needed for an intro chemistry course. (log functions, etc) BTW, it took me a while to figure out how to switch modes. I wish they made that a little more intuitive but it's still a decent calculator.",

This calculator is fantastic, affordable, and has everything a biochemistry major who can't bring a graphing calc to an exam could need. The exponents, logs, and stat tests are all easy to use (though, you will need to read the manual for the stat tests) and the solar power works great. This is my favorite calculator, and has served me well through my college years. It's super durable, and the only reason I need to replace it is because I lost my other one (a very sad day).",

Any more than a slight tilt and all you see are the LCD lines, making it unreadable. I have calculators that I have received for free that are more easily viewable at an angle. If Casio were to fix that minor issue, it would be a 5 star item for sure.",
