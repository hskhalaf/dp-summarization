Passes for a 14\" or 15\" pillow. Good fabric, poorly sewn, certainly not overstuffed. Sorry I did not have time to sew them myself. I also bought a two pack of \"Pillow Perfect\" brand indoor/outdoor pillows on Amazon for $1.15 more. MUCH, much better quality, corded edges, true to size and overstuffed. Photo is of my Greendale Home Fashions 17\" pillow next to my \"Pillow Perfect\" 18.5\" pillow. See for yourself!",
