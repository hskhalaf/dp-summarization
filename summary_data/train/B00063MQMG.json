      "text": "This crate is fairly straightforward to assemble, and the divider panel is really essential for crate training a puppy. The only major downside of the crate for me is that neither door opens and lays flat against the sides of the crate. This is most noticable and annoying with the side door, which also opens out to the left (into open air) as opposed to the right (flat against the crate), which requires more space. The crate design could be improved if either the doors opened vertically or layed flat against the sides of the crate.",

If you have a dog that is a little taller in a sitting position this really makes a difference to make sure they can sit comfortably. It's heavier in weight than some of the other large wire kennels.

My new crates are much stronger so I would recommend if you have questions about the gauge of wire used you call Midwest first.",

Now she loves her kennel and she can be left alone indoors for up to a 1/2 day. fits snuggly in a corner of his bedroom. and the double door did come in handy became of the orientation of the room. sturdy, easy to clean. easy to take down and put back up. He has moved once and it worked very well. They use a folded sheet for a cove on 3 sides and the dog seems very content with her abode. Recommend a buy and a rebuy.",

The crate is durable and feels sturdy. It also comes with handles that you can fasten to the top, so if you need to carry it somewhere you can grab those making it easy to carry. I would recommend.",
