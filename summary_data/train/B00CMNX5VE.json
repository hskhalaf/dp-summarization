      "text": "My daughter was very excited to receive this for Christmas. It seems to slide it very well, even after three months of use. The only complaint I have is that there is no volume control and it is very loud. I would love to be able to turn this all the way off so that she could use it in the car without driving me crazy! I love that it comes with stencils because it reinforces her ability to learn her letters and numbers. It also allows for complete creativity on her part when you take away all of the stencils and allow them to draw whatever they want",

I also saw an on-line review of it on Youtube and the Lambie didn't sing, although the person was still drawing. - As someone has also mentioned here in the reviews, the stylus cord is a little short for a left handed. Still not a big deal, in general, it's fun.",

Our 2 year old (25month) toddler really enjoys the toy on car rides as they can change stencils. It is a great learning tool through tracing letters and audio reinforcement of what is traced.",
