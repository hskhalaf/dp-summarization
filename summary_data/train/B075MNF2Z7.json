The fragrances smell nice and the automator works with my glade dispenser. The only thing is that you cannot spray it as you want and it's apparently motion sensitive? But even at the most frequent setting, I cannot determine what the schedule is. Which is fine, but if you want the dispenser to spray at exactly a certain time frame, this is not the item for you. The room the dispenser sprays in is pretty small so I am uncertain as to how effective it would be in a bigger room.",
