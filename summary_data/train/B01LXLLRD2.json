They work well, just can't fill to the top or it will leak out. I'm not sure how practical bamboo is against water though. My dogs are messy drinkers and there are water spots on the top.

I can see how this might eventually damage the wood, but for now it seems to wipe up easily without leaving any water stains behind.",
