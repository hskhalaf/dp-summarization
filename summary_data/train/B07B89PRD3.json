To get max shade required installing two 8-foot posts at the far corners of the deck and anchoring the third point to the house. If you plan to keep this up for long periods, invest in quality metal turnbuckles and hardware that will stand up to intense sun, wind, or rain.",

The shade is not 100%, but the difference in temp is noticeable, and in direct sunlight, it provides excellent relief from the heat. Setup was easy once we got the correct hardware and installed the eyehooks in the right places. It will take some trial and error, so be prepared to use some rope to rough out the design.

I love the aesthetic of it and it really does put a barrier to things falling from the tree and the sun. One unexpected issue, my dog is terrified of it.
