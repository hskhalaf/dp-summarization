The seller even included two batteries. Thanks. It was advertised and arrived in excellent condition. It was well packaged and arrive promptly. The pricing was more than good. Thanks Amazon. I'm happy and taking pictures AGAIN!",

My one complaint, but not enough of one to deduct a star, is that it is a battery hog. I might get several months, more or less, out of the batteries that I use. I have never used rechargeable, as I do not want to wait for charging. So, in a nutshell, I am happy, happy, happy with this camera. I even had one of my bird pictures published in a bird magazine.",

I passed down my other camera's to my daughters to use, and the pictures are still great quality in those too. I really haven't used the Z712 enough to really know what all it can do, but I love the zoom on it already with the stabilization installed. The EasyShare software with the online storage is worth every penny of it. I will continue to buy the EasyShare cameras and would recommmend them to anyone.",

It makes the camera much more \"user friendly.\" The only problem I still have with these cameras is the \"lag\" time that you get when taking a photo. What you see on the screen when you take a picture is not what you get when the camera finally snaps the shot. I have a two-year-old, and he doesn't stay still long enough for those quality photo moments. I haven't tried outdoor shots yet, so maybe these will be better, since a flash is not usually needed. Overall, a nice camera for the price!",

I don't believe any other product could provide this much camera for the money. Great pictures, great zoom, nice and compact, just great. Only drawbacks I've noticed: The supplied battery isn't rechargeable, and you can't recharge the battery inside the camera - you have to buy a rechargeable battery and an external charger. However, please note that I purchased the camera for $192. I see that it is now priced at $402, which I think is too expensive. Boy did I get a deal!",

He owns a graphic design company so he's very picky about his electronics, especially his cameras. We love the pictures it takes. It's also very easy to use. I'm not at all technically inclined and I can easily use it. It looks a lot bulkier in the picture of it, but it fits into his back pocket easily. We really love it!",

I was told it would cost $100 to repair plus shipping and taxes. 100 bucks to repair a 200 dollar camera is crazy. I now will buy the Panasonic of my dreams. By-by Kodak!!",
