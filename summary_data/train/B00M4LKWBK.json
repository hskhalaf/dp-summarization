I use my fire pit to burn the fallen branches and small trees, sometimes keeping the fire burning for days at a time. After a couple of years doing this, my EP Henry wall stones were taking a serious beating. These rings will protect them, hopefully for many years to come.",

Also, ignore any negative review you see about shipping issues because they changed the way they package this now. It is completely wrapped up protecting all corners with strong cardboard caps on all corners and it is boxed up nice and tight. Other than this thing falling out of an airplane during shipment, this thing will not come damaged in any way!! Love it!!! Great great addition to our backyard.

You'd think with all the reviews mentioning this the manufacturer would care enough to fix the issue. This issue also caused some of the black coating to expose the bare metal. Hopefully that doesn't cause corrosion. Assembly was easy but top rim seams didnt all fit together the same. I had to bend the damaged tips to flatten them with coated pliers. I paid extra for this item hoping for better quality. We will see how long it lasts.",
