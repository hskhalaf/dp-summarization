Update: 9 months now and still not leaking again. Have not had to add any more fluid and steering worked fine through the freezing winter and now hot the summer with no issues. 10 month update: developed a major leak this time. This time it worked to turn it into smaller issue but I need to add some every day. Looks like I have to spend the$1500 now, but this stuff definitely worked for almost a year.",

I used a baster and pulled out the old PS fluid and added the Lucas stop leak. Kept an eye on the leaking for 2 weeks, it appeared to be slowing down. I used the baster again and pulled out some more PS fluid from the reservoir and topped it off with Lucas stop leak. At this point I had added about 1 and 1/2 12 oz. bottles of Lucas. Not long after this the leaks stopped. I haven't had to add any additional fluid since May. So far so good! Would recommend.",

Maybe I needed to completely replace the existing power steering fluid which was leaking? Either way, the leaking stopped. It had been a steady leak which caused my power steering fluid reservoir to empty in about one week. I refilled my reservoir twice at Jiffy Lube before I accidentally discovered this product on Amazon. It probably saved me $300-$500 which I would have had to spend to replace the power steering pump/reservoir. I keep pinching myself thinking the leak will come back, but it's been about 4-6 months and nothing has changed. :)",

This Audi requires mineral oil and when using products in the steering reservoir, anything else will cause ugly sounds and eventual failure. The Lucas works just as normal fluid and really has saved many hundreds of $. Great product!",

      "text": "First let me say the rack on my 01 CRV and 03 Pilot both leak. So, facing over $1.5k in repairs, I thought I would give Lucas PS Stop Leak a shot. Did this product stop the leaks? No. Did it slow them down? A little. But, I will admit that it smoothed out the steering and that was noticeable. On both cars. Let's be honest, if you rack is leaking, it's probably because of the seals and this product isn't going to save you from an expensive rack replacement. It might buy you some time. So 3 stars because I was foolish enough to think this would actually fix a leaking rack, but it's not a bad product.",
