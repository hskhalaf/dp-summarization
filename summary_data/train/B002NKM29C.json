If you want both on an m43, I recommend this lens. This can still even be squeezed indoors for some general use whereas the Olympus 60mm macro almost completely loses that capability. I know the Oly has more visual guides on the lens itself, but aside from that I think the Panny is more versatile while still providing sharp images.",

The autofocus is fast in the macro range, and I've been very pleased with my macro shots. What I wasn't expecting is how much I'm using the lens for non-macro work. It's fast and compact, and it's on my camera a lot. If you want a good macro for a \u03bc4/3, you really can't go wrong with this lens. It takes advantage of the benefits of \u03bc4/3, like size and image stabilization. I'm very glad I bought it!",
