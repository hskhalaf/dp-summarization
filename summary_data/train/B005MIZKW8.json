Supports many filetypes, doesn't have awful advertising/proprietary crap, does everything I want it to and then some. I've never had a dictionary built into my books before and I'm addicted. It's fabulous. The only downside is it occasionally bogs down somehow (not quite clear on what triggers it) causing page \"turns\" to slow to a crawl, although rebooting fixes it. I just wish they made a bigger one!",

I really cannot face returning it again and in any event not worth the expense as I live in Cyprus but i think I will avoid Sony products in the future, I was most disappointed in both the quality and the after sales service.",
