The carrying kit fits easily into my carry-on bag and the lenses themselves were intuitive and user-friendly. I appreciated the free video tutorials that came with it too. As you can see, so far I've used the macro to take very important images.",

I am pretty sure all of these lens' from any brand have one or more of these issues. Maybe the more expensive ones like Moment work, but, Moment requires you to buy a case that fits your phone and every time you change your phone you will need a new case.",

The macro lens does have a short focus drop off point but I like the effect it can give. (Example attached). The lanyard is a great idea too and so is the info thumb drive/business card.

Now, my review on the lense : Pros: - material quality (aluminum and lens) - lens covers Cons : - the wide angle lens is bulky and heavy. - inpractical storage - gimmicky led light - very narrow hole, that is easy to miss or vignette. I believe there are better solutions for wide angles..",

But when I used it for some photos of interior design projects, I saw the problem immediately: the edges of the photo are blurry and contain weird light distortions. The photos looked fine when viewed on the phone but not when blown-up. I was very sad since the product seems well made and customer support was good, but the photo quality is pretty unacceptable.",

The lens works perfectly. As advertised, no distortion in the images and using my Note 9 and iPhone 8 I'm able to take very smooth video and wider photos with it. I highly recommend for a quality photo add-on to a flagship smartphone.",

These lenses have a very high quality feel to them. And the packaging and instructions are impressive. It even comes with a little usb that gives you several well made video tutorials. Also comes with a carry case (well made), a clip on light, a carry lanyard...the works. Could not be any happier with this lens kit.",

Even with an older phone, the picture seemed just a little better than w/ the stock lens. The wide angle was nice and it didn't warp the image. The macro lens, I have not had a use for yet, but seems pretty cool. The only issue I had was the clip that attaches to the phone is much larger than most clips. This limits your options when using your phone with certain rigs as the clip won't fit within some stabilizing rigs. Overall, I like it.",
