One awesome other thing is the fingerprint reader is incredible and can read your print with the briefest of taps.",

Haven't had any issues with the touch pad. And the fingerprint sensor is lightning quick. Overall, the laptop is fast. It says cool most of the time if you're just surfing the web or something like that. The bottom can get quite warm even if the computer is just windows updating. However, no sound since it's fanless. I think if you bought this laptop that you probably weren't going to play intensive games on it. It does the internet surfing, writing documents, etc perfectly.",

This is the best display I have ever seen on a mobile device and the 3:2 aspect ratio is perfect for work. I run without scaling for 12 hours a day and do not have eyestrain. I strongly prefer this even over my Retina MacBook 12 due to the aspect ratio and superior tactile response of the keyboard. My only complaint is that it scratches pretty easily even compared to the MacBook. Highest possible recommendation. If you are thinking about buying, do it. You won\u2019t be disappointed.",

There are only two things that I don't like about this model. Firstly, it doesn't have an embedded SD card reader. The laptop is thin, but one could have been included. For most people, this is a very minor issue. Secondly, and far more importantly to most users, the screen is EXTREMELY glossy. I prefer matte screens, but it's hard to find them nowadays. If the screen wasn't so obscenely glossy, this would be a five-star computer. I can't give half-stars, so take my rating as 4 and 1/2.",

So instead of buying the product once (because you bought it when you bought the computer) they got greedy and make you subscribe every single year just so you can use Word, Excel, Power Point, etc. I can't even type or copy paste, all I can do is view my documents.

I'm not even doing anything crazy on it, just web browsing or streaming video most of the time. I've noticed it stays at a decent temperature if you use it on a flat hard surface, obviously, but if you place it on your lap while using it, you will feel it. I worry it'll overheat sometimes, but so far it's been working just fine.",
