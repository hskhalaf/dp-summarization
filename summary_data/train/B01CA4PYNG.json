Unfortunately, it is toast. I understand the concept of having its own dedicated GFI and reset around surrounding water, but here is where the issues start. Was working fine yesterday, go to plug and turn on today and the relay reset will not function properly. I should not have to take the time to bypass the reset, being this is a brand new product! Ridiculous. Will be staying away from Greenworks products from now on... Hope this helps!",

Attach garden hose to the power washer, turn it on, then turn on the water and wait for 30 seconds to get rid of Air Bubbles. *Don't forget to turn of the water before detachment.

You have to put the nozzle nearly an inch off the ground to get it clean, which could take us days and days to clean the backyard concrete if not longer. Just not efficient. When you bring the nozzle further away to get good coverage, the water pressure just isn't powerful enough to clean the dirt out of the concrete.",

I want to be able to clean my outside entrance way and stairs, sidewalk and patio and this has not disappointed. Once I got it set up, water was coming out of it like a hose so I was very confused. Directions didn\u2019t really show you the two different valves you connect to the end. You select either the green or white one which is on the motor and then snap it on the end of the nozzle. The video provided in the photos of this product really helped me figure that out. Happy pressure washing!",

Paired it with a 1.1 mm orifice foam cannon from Amazon and it works plenty well enough for my car without me having to worry about too much pressure that it could damage the paint. Been in use now for 4 months with no issues. Since then have also used it to manage to clean our concrete balcony floor with and some vinyl siding which I was surprised. Thought I would need a higher pressure washer but it still got the job done.",

After a second pass it was completely clean! I was also able to get up paint droplets from when my house was built 6 years ago. Very awesome! Very easy to use and SUPER POWERFUL! I love it and definitely recommend it!!!",

There is a lower-pressure carwash nozzle and bottle for detergent. My only beef is that it took a lot of research to find cleaning solutions appropriate for each application...I wish the instructions would have been more helpful. Unless you need an industrial-quality high pressure unit, this is more than adequate, and inexpensive, to boot.",
