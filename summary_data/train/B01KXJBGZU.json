Item was intact and all pieces were included. Study feeling material, with a soft foam top to the zip in platform \u2018bed\u2019. It appears easy to take apart for cleaning. Dogs have \u2018dug\u2019 in bed part (breed specific behavior) and it\u2019s held up with no issues. I take it out of my vehicle and keep it at home as a step-up to my bed when I don\u2019t take the pups with me. Overall money well spent!",
