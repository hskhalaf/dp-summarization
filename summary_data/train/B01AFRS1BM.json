I invest in serious watches for this modern fashion loving man of mine, and I know he is going to love preserving them for future wear in this stylish box. And? It meets the anniversary requirement for 5 years! (Wood, if you are wondering. The modern alternative was silverware...you read that correctly. Modern=silverware. Not.)",

I did take a star off my rating due to the fact that, as mentioned by other reviewers, two of the foam cushions that hold the watches inside the box are quite a tight fit into the provided slots. Other than that, a really nice way to store your watches, especially if you have solar or eco-drive.",
