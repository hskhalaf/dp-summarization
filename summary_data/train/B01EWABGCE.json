Horse still rubs a bit, but nothing like before. I have used it twice and will continue to use it throughout the spring & summer when itching reaches its peak. Container still feels heavy as if I haven't used any, so it should last for some time. Comes out foaming so all you have to do is work it into the wet coat & rinse; very easy to use.",
