That being said this product does contain Aldox as a preservative which some people may have allergic reactions to. Thimerosal is used as a preservative by other companies and can also cause allergic reactions such as 'burning' or 'stinging' of the eyes. Thimerosal is a mercury-containing organic compound (an organomercurial) and was at one time used in flu shots as a preservative but do to allergic reactions has been weened out of most vaccinations. Check the label provided by the manufacturer to see which preservative is being used as this can greatly reduce the chances of allergic reactions.",

The exclusive 2D formula containing Polyquad and Aldox helps disinfect and wash away microorganisms that could result in eye infections and irritation. The TearGlyde reconditioning system that works with tears to help create a barrier of comfortable moisture and constant comfort.

Opti-Free Replenish solution will help to remove unwanted debris and particles, keeping contact lenses cleaner and clearer. Opti-Free Replenish solution works with silicon hydrogel and soft contact lenses. For the best results, rinse and rub each side of the lens with solution for 20 seconds.

These lenses may be left in the solution and in an unopened case for up to 30 days before having to clean and disinfect again. Opti-Free strives to continue providing patients with the newest and most effective contact lens products on the market for dry and irritated eyes.",
