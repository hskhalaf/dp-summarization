The sight is excellent quality with multiple settings. There's more than one reticle ranging from dot to cross hairs, you can choose green or red as well as adjust the brightness. At night the reticle is nice and bright and during the day can still be seen. Customer service is absolutely amazing and even followed up with me a couple days after to check in. Would recommend this product and company any time.",

Well with Dagger Defense you support a veteran business and you also get quality control so that is a plus. Easy to zero in and holds zero pretty well, adjusting it is easy. Make sure to loctite your mounting screws as you should anyway. My only gripe is one of reticle is blurry, it is the circular dot with crosshair. Theres too much going on with that reticle so I dont mind, I use the circular dot and plain cross they are crisp.",

The rotary knob is a rheostat that allows you to continually adjust the intensity. It seems to be common at this level that changing reticles requires re-zeroing. You should consider picking one and staying with it. Make sure the w/e lockscrew is loose before making adjustments and remember to tighten it after. Once zeroed, I was able to hold a respectable group at 50 yds. At a fraction of the cost of the high-end sights, it did its job quite well, which makes it a pretty decent value.",
