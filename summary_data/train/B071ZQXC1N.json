I got these because they are supposedly the lightest running shoes around and should feel like running barefoot but I just don\u2019t feel the lightness. I usually wear canvas Keds and that could be the reason because canvas sneakers are already light and not to mention much cheaper. I also feel these won\u2019t last long because the material is so thin. Anyway will update review if they prove me wrong but for now only 2 stars because I\u2019m just not impressed with the lightness.",
