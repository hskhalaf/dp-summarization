      "text": "Paper, while still two ply, is thinner. Ugh ... who wants that??? Size is smaller .... height of roll is at least 1/2 inch shorter .. ie smaller sheets .. ugh ... who wants that either?? Am very disappointed in these recent changes. And as someone else mentioned... too many options in packaging.... two would be plenty... Probably changing over to a lesser product... not worth paying for the high price spread when you get inferior product than in the past.",
