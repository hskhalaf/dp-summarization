One side of the paper is treated with a non-toxic coating that prevents water from penetrating. The coating is effective even when the paper appears wet. Large coreless rolls provide a convenience to commercial users and contractors. HORT WRAP is 100% biodegradable. Install by wrapping the product around the trunk of the tree tightly by stretching the product as you wrap. Overlap the wrap by 2 inches as you wrap the trunk. Secure the ending of the wrap with tape or tie to prevent the wrap from unraveling from the tree. Single season use.",
