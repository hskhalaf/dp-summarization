Nikon brings an evolution in imaging technology, starting with a newly developed Nikon CX-format super high-speed AF CMOS sensor that powers every capture. Ensure image precision through the new, compact interchangeable lens system featuring image stabilization (VR) and superior fast and quiet autofocus motors built on the NIKKOR heritage of optical excellence.\n\nFOCUS THAT\u2019S AS FAST AS YOU\nCAPTURE ALL THE ACTION\nNot a moment is missed with a camera that keeps up with you!

Remember the feelings you had while watching a wave crash to the shore or fireworks exploding overhead? Make those moments come alive in a single click using Motion Snapshot. Reveal the essence that can\u2019t be captured in a single photo.\n\nSHARE A RICHER EXPERIENCE\nSIMULTANEOUSLY CAPTURE FULL HD (1080P) MOVIES AND PHOTOS\nThere will be moments when you\u2019re recording a great movie and an opportunity to grab an amazing photo comes along. Capture both at the same time! Start your movie recording with a touch of a button. See that great still? Hit the shutter even during record mode. Autofocus keeps everything sharp, working double duty to simultaneously capture both movies and photos. Infuse even more personality into multimedia creations by adding slow motion. For times when photos alone are not enough, family and friends will appreciate your expressions brought to life.\n\nGET THE BEST OF WHAT\u2019S SEEN\nLET THE CAMERA DO THE WORK WITH SMART PHOTO SELECTOR\nFor all the times you wished your camera could capture those great spontaneous moments while they unfolded in front of you, there is Nikon 1.

Engineered for fast and easy swap-out, stay photo-ready all the time. Compactness brings portability, whether using the single focal length 10mm or the 30-110mm telephoto. 1 NIKKOR lenses feature vibration reduction (VR) to keep photos sharp, extending a heritage of precision symbolized by durability, superior image quality and optical excellence.\n\n\n\nEXPEED 3 PROCESSOR\nEXPEED 3 marks the culmination of years of dedication to advancing digital imaging technologies. At the heart of Nikon 1 is EXPEED 3, with dual image processors, to deliver outstanding system performance, high-speed processing, state-of-the-art phase detection autofocus and the fastest data transfer rates. Witness outstanding image quality, tone reproduction and advanced autofocus at unprecedented speeds.\n\nLOW LIGHT\nAn advanced, innovative Nikon super high-speed AF CMOS imaging sensor, wide ISO range and option to select the best lens for the job give you even more control over the light. Produce amazing photos in all those moody environments. Tap only ambient light and open the most artistic doors to photographing on the dance floor, nabbing dramatic sunsets and candlelit moments.\n\n\n\nLCD MONITOR\nCheck your creativity: frame and share your creations on the large and sharp three-inch LCD color display. An ultra-high resolution screen featuring 460k-dots shows every detail to precision. An anti-glare coating renders easy viewing of photos and HD movies, even outdoors.\n\nINTUITIVE SIMPLICITY\nEasy access to advanced features are hallmarks of the Nikon 1 system.
