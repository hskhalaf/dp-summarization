Mine is shooting great the Crosman premier 14.3 grain pellets, which is great I can buy them locally everywhere. I usally buy JSB pellets but seens that with this pistol I dont need them since the Crosman pellets work great. I highly recommend it, goes great with a UTG Leapers 3-9x32 AO scope.",

This is a design flaw that could have been fixed with a plastic pin or additional screw. The second issue is there is no hard sites and the clip sticks up above the barrel. If both of these were fixed I would give it 5 stars. If anyone knows how to fix the loose stock with out duck tape I would be interested.",

Down side is how many shots you get - i get 25 or so before the gauge gets to 2,000 psi. the carbine buttstock doesn't fit perfect, it moves a bit, and it feels a bit too light. i'm thinking of getting an aftermarket wood one. the only thing that i think would really improve it is to get a bit more speed out of the pellets. But, it deserves 5 stars, it is very light, very quiet, and shoots very straight.",

I can shoot 24 good rounds per fill, maybe more but 3 magazines worth is enough. No need to fill to 3000 psi. Great fun!",
