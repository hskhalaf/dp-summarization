It's hard to understate how small this is. Take out your iphone, smaller. Did you ever have one of those old indestructible Nokia phones? smaller. I don't think that this adversely affects any game I have played. The text is all still very readible. Be aware if you are looking for replacement faceplates, you're going to have a hard time.",

The gameboy micro is way too neat, and rare to not buy one and keep it for a life time. I would recommend this for anyone that is a collector, or just a casual gamer. Thanks for reading.",

If you're a collector or Nintendo fan or even if you have some GBA games you wanna play again, I suggest this. It's small, has an awesome battery life, head phone jack, adjustable brightness and sharp image with nice colors. Perhaps the best GBA model?",
