At 5 and above, the minimal leverage you can get while seated makes it extremely difficult to pedal much at all. However, I reached out to 3D Innovations, and they say a new \"Ellipse\" model coming in November will have a linear resistance curve. This will hopefully give the product more flexibility, so consider waiting for that model to release. Aside from this issue, the DeskCycle is a phenomenal product.",

This works as I am only 5'2\". I can study on my laptop for hours while getting a bit of exercise.",
