      "text": "its not a bad cleaner. that said, it takes quite a bit more effort to clean up because even the tiniest bit is very soapy- like the equivalent of putting dawn on your counter and smearing it everywhere. and you have to rinse the cloth several times between each pass because it gets really sudsy as well. the cleaner doesn't say its concentrated or anything so idk what gives. you can't use a paper towel for this reason. will not buy again.",
