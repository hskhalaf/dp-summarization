      "text": "Great fan -- pushes a ton of air and looks amazing. Four stars because the company cheaped out on the rubber dampeners between the fan bracket and the fan box--caused a horrible hum for 3 months until I finally figured it out and unwired and dismounted the fan and replaced the cheap square rubber dampeners they gave me and put in some quality round thick ones I had left over from another fan installation last year (different brand). If you've got that loud hum that gets louder as you increase the speed I'm betting that is your problem as well. Hope this helps!!",

A third one is being inspected/tested by Minka and is on it's way but I am REALLY TIRED of installing and shipping back defective fans. What a hassle!!!! The third one arrived and right out of the box it had the same high hum on med speed. RTV and time to find a new fan from a new manufacturer.",

Contemplated getting a replacement but it looks like it happened to people on multiple units that were sent to them. Not worth the risk or additional installation cost. Returning.

The remote is kind of useless for me with no light kit since I can't imagine needing to turn the fan on high ( it blows the doors off) and you can't reverse direction via remote.",
