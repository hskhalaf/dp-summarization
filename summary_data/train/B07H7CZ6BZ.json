The real test was the sound. Pairing it to my phone and iPad was easy and I was able to play music immediately. The sound was perfect! Plenty of bass and no distortion. The treble was good, too. And, if it wasn't, the bass and treble are easily adjusted. I love the simplicity of the speaker, too. Worth the price and I definitely recommend it.",

If I forget to charge, 20 minutes gives me a great boost and ability to play for over an hour. That said, this speaker plays long and strong. I love the easy to carry leather handle.",

I'm probably unfairly comparing this to my $2500 B&W speakers, but that's what I consider audiophile. To take the mud out, I turned the Bass down to 4, and crank the Treble.... much better. It would be nice to have a mid-control, but for a small, relatively affordable speaker, it sounds good. The speaker is fairly light, and the handle is useful. It linked up to my bluetooth device easily. The built-in amp does not have a lot of volume for use in larger spaces.",

I raised it with amazon but they suggested me to ship it back to US from Singapore which was again kind of pain. Contacting Marshall directly didn't helped.
