I've uploaded a photo to show the size compared to a Switch game case. Before I had this set, my family would complain that the controllers were hard to hold. After I ordered these, I had a party with my friends and NONE OF THEM mentioned that the controllers were uncomfortable. That makes this a top notch product to me. Triggers work great, and they are perfectly ergonomic. The colors match perfectly also (once again, see my uploaded photo).",

I immediately bought a Pro Controller and then bought these matching grip. These are so easy to slip on and off. My 3.5 y/o can do it himself. Stop the madness and get these to save your hand/fingers. These are a tad smaller than you normal controller but anything is better than using those joy-con!

Great if you're playing co-op and have larger hands than what the base joycon+strap can give. They pair really well with the Skull & Co Splatoon 2 caps. The official Nintendo Splatoon caps aren't as great. (P.S. Sorry about all the attached images but I know theirs people who rely on customer images for their purchase.? (P.P.S. Mad props to FastSnail for actually having the correct color joycons in the item's picture. Really appreciate it.)",

I ordered two sets of neon yellow grips and was very pleased to find that they are virtually an exact color match to the neon yellow joycons - they blend in perfectly! The grips have a soft velvety texture and are made of a light material that seems to insulate very well, keeping my and my friends hands cool and comfortable during long play sessions. It's finally possible to play with a single joycon without cramping or hurting your fingers, and the addition of extended trigger buttons is fantastic!",

As I was happy with the grip, I contacted the seller and asked if I could get a replacement part, but they never responded. It was not the main product, and could be a small issue, but I was not happy with their quality control and their unresponsiveness.",

If I put the + or - one on wrong, it was very difficult to get to slide back off. And when I was done playing 2 player, sliding off the adapter was always super hard. Using these grips is much more intuitive as well. My grandkids could never get use to the OEM adapter method for 2 player mode. Now they can play and not have difficulties with the controls or holding it. Easy for adults too. If you are playing 2-player games you need these.",

Must have for games like Mario Kart, Mario Tennis and others.",

This is not a criticism, and if anything it helps that they are so light; I was just expecting something heftier and found the practical weightlessness of the grips to feel somewhat strange. This is simple to get used to but for those with rambunctious children, the grips might not be as durable as you would like them to be. All in all, it was a worthwhile purchase and I heartily recommend this product to other Switch users.",

Some people are saying that the shoulder buttons are hard to use with these but I have not found that to be true. Drifting in MarioKart has never been easier. I will probably be picking up another pair once I get more joycons. Also the blue and red colors are almost identical to the joycon colors which makes it even more attractive to use.
