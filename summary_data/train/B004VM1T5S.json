I do like that it has full RCA jacks to connect to the stereo amplifier... but it's not worth it.",

I tried to use it with my iPhone during a small house party. It worked 70% but would cut out at times if the signal was blocked by too many people. Nice and compact and really easy to set up though. Would probably test out a couple other similar devices to make sure it suites your application.",

It's basically idiot-proof. Just be aware, you may have to go into your phone/tablet's Bluetooth settings to select this adapter if you have paired more than one gadget (such as a Bluetooth headset). Like any other Bluetooth device, the sound occasionally cuts out for 1-3 seconds and resumes, but for casual listening, this is no problem.

I use the Logitech adapter at a distance of about 25 feet, line of sight. Sometimes, if someone walks in between the device and my phone, I get a stutter in the music.Bluetooth just isn't a strong enough signal. Other times the phone gets busy also causing a stutter.

Sadly, this adapter loses connectivity far too easily for a Bluetooth device. I'm aware that I can't be too far away from the device itself but I shouldn't have a problem at distances like 12ft. Also, I've noticed that at as close as 5ft away from the device and my phone or laptop, if a human body comes directly between the two, the connection will be seriously affected. I may just buy a portable bluetooth speaker to enjoy music while outdoors.",

It's probably just psychological, but I wince every time I crank the volume that high, knowing that if I were to switch inputs to another source without lowering the volume I might blow the furniture to the other side of the room.",

However, if you want to watch movies or online video using your bluetooth connection, you may notice a small lag. The audio falls about 100 milliseconds late. Compared to DVD Player on my Mac, playing movies in VLC and delaying the audio -100ms solves this problem. Watching YouTube videos is not as bad, with only a slight delay.

Oh yea ... other device had an optical output. Don't know how many devices this can pair with but Ihave paired this with my Android phone and tablet.",

The device could be about $10 cheaper but overall I am very happy and have not had any issues with it. I have hooked up my iPad and iPhone to it and it worked great. I would certainly buy this product again.",

      "title": "Stable powerful bluetooth signal",
      "text": "This is a very high quality adapter with stable connection. If you have any problems, I suggest you check out your output device like your phone or tablet. Example: My HTC One S has a syncing issue with video and bluetooth audio. So during conversations in a movie, the audio would be delayed. My Acer Iconia A100 has an issue with the bluetooth disconnecting after extensive usage, so I have to turn off the bluetooth and then on, and resync.",
