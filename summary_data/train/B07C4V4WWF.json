Ruined my morning because I had to go to a print shop to print because even though my black and white ink are 90% full, the printer can't print a word document. The feature renders the printer useless and makes this a one star purchase.",

After it says the cartridges are empty if you pop the covers off they are 75 percent full. You can refill them. You just have to buy more.

So far it has been absolutely excellent. It prints very well, works well printing from our iPhones and is very easy to use. It used very little ink as well surprisingly.

It doesn't really run out but that chip makes the printer think that( shaking it and hearing ink sloshing inside means theres more in there) and wont work until you replace. I don't fall for that ink scam so I simply throw it out and purchase another cheap printer with ink. I've thrown many perfect printers out do to the corporate greed to rob ones money to fool you into buying 35cents worth of ink for anywhere from $17.99-$40.00 or more just for black ink. It's odd how when one only use black ink to print out pdf files the yellow & canyon ink seems to deplete first.",

Besides, the aftermarket ink is really affordable and available on Amazon. In fact I already ordered a set as backup. It is fast and easy to install.

We've printed sparingly in color but at this point it's looking like this was the best pre-pandemic purchase we could have made. The range on the wireless seems to be solid as well. We've got this situated in the basement and sending a print job via phone from the main floor has never failed. I would gladly recommend this printer to anyone in the market.",

The flatbed scanner is also capable of scanning photos at up to 1200x1200 DPI. The only drawback is that Windows doesn't recognize the capabilities of this scanner, so you need to install the proprietary Brother iPrint&Scan software. Fortunately, it isn't terrible, and it even makes OCR quite easy.",

The machine is much quieter than the HP8620Pro that it replaces and the output is superior to the other machine, as well. I really can't think of anything negative to say about this MFC-J491DW All-In-One duplex color inkjet printer. I'm delighted with this purchase.",

But my husband likes it. So I bought a more expensive printer in the same series. Addendum: I finally figured out how to get it to print straight from my cell phone. One must have WiFi direct on/connected & then the cell phone can print to printer. So it's a nice printer for the price.",

Laser is always good but this one does the job we need.",

Although it does print from my phone, it appears that it will only print from my gmail email account, not my other and way more used accounts. I cannot see a way to include them for printing. It's a big hassle to have to forward to gmail in order to print. Otherwise, it does work just as advertised. Wireless is quite awesome.",
