The face pieces are nice quality - thick, felt material, no creases, seemingly nice adhesive. The only \"real\" issue is that the Mrs. Potato Head hat actually says Mr. instead... It's not a huge deal to me so I'm just going to go over it with a marker & add the 's.' Otherwise, I'm really pleased with the quality!",

These stickers were a great solution for those of us wanting to dress up on a budget (without going all out). These are stick ons and hats that do NOT include the shirt. The stickers are sticky enough to stay securely fastened to the shirt. Make sure you use a shirt that you do not mind ruining. We plan to just keep the stickers on the shirts in case we may need the outfits again.",
