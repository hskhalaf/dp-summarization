This was the only thing that got my kids to happily cooperate throughout their lesson, as well as while the other was going, since he would let them play with it once the lessons were over. This stingray glider is awesome and swims so well. Take it to the bottom of the pool, let go, and awhile it goes. My kids were so sad when their lessons were over that they weren't going to be able to play with it that I decided to get one for our house. This has been a big hit on our pool every time we go swimming!",

The inside of them are actually open/hollow all the way around (see pic), but it allows them to sink pretty well despite their weight and material. They move along the bottom of the pool easily but it's a nice challenge for my teenage kids to search for. The video shows me tossing the rings in the center of my pools (approx 5 feet deep). You can see they sink fairly quickly. Overall, I'm satisfied with the purchase. I was expecting them to be the hard plastic style but these work pretty well too.",

      "text": "This is our 3rd attempt this summer, but this design appears to have too many weaknesses and breaks quickly. The main the head, side wings (needed to stabilize) and tail are each glued to the main body of the float. The tail seems to tare away first as it sticks up at an angle. Next, the side wings tare away and this beautiful peacock looks (and floats) like it has been in a war. Buy it expecting it not to last - unless you or others in your pool are especially careful.",

My daughter was holding the ring out for her friend to catch it when she got to the bottom of the waterslide, and when the friend got to the bottom of the slide and pulled the ring out of my daughter's hand, it gave her a pretty bad cut. Small but important design flaw.",
