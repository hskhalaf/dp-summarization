My crossbar bent already just trying to get it on it's wheels. The drawer liner stank so much I could not use it indoors. The top is nice solid rubberwood, but the finish is very thin so that it would not hold up well to heavy duty. Mine also has a repaired knot on it that really stands out, that should not have passed QA.",

We are using the table in our kitchen as we like an industrial look yet it is understated-industrial, so it works in kitchens. Or pretty much anywhere you need a work table. It's too pretty to put in a garage. Only slight critique would be to have 4 locking wheels, not 2. Having said that we are still very pleased.",

The only real problem I had (other than man-handling this heavy baby) was getting the drawer onto the sldies at the end of assembly. The booklet doesnt really explain that aspect. A quick call to the manufacturer and bingo, assembly completed. Wheels work great, beech-wood top is thick and heavy, and the frame has some beef to it. Overall, excellent purchase.",

After discovering and correcting my error, final assembly went quite well. The only suggestion I could offer is that, because not all concrete floors are completely level, a way to level one or two of the casters would be nice to compensate. Well done!",

All the components in the assembly lined up so perfectly that I was about to hand spin all the bolts in before tightening.",

The table top is very well made, and I appreciate it being solid maple. The top is very flat with no indications of warping. Assembly was easy, and all the bolt holes lined up perfectly, which says a lot for Chinese QA/QC. Drawer slides in and out very smoothly, although could have done with higher quality slides, but as I'm using it inside as a work station for my 3D printer, I have no issues with it's operation. I may be buying another one for the garage.",
