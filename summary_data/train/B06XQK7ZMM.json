      "text": "Since taking a cooking class in Italy, we don't buy pasta anymore - we make it from scratch. One problem had always been that the pasta would tend to \"clump up\" when it was sitting before we put into the water. This drying rack was the perfect solution. It takes very little room on the countertop but provides a convenient place to put the pasta. Plus, it's incredibly easy to slide it off the arms and into the boiling water. A definite \"must buy\" if you make your own pasta!",

It's super handy that you can just set it up and then fold it down so small when not in use. For a cheap plastic rack, it's actually a pretty nifty idea.",
