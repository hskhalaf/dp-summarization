In light of this, I have started a return for the last 2 cases and will switch products because it's a hassle have to send back food items. Too bad too because the product tastes good.",

I do occasionally get a spoiled one, but not often - and I drink them daily. We always do a \u201ctest\u201d sip just to make sure. I think the quality control has improved, as it happens so rarely now. Also a great option for the elderly instead of the other well-known brands that are full of sugar and other nasty ingredients.",

Many complain about quality control, but it has amazing ingredients at an affordable price, so I don\u2019t mind refrigerating it to avoid any issues. Tastes great, very chocolatey.",

Now I use it for post-workout and I can say that in the area of flavor, content, and fullness-feeling(?) it certainly satisfies. It's smooth without being too sweet or thick. The fact that it's organic ingredients gives me peace of mind and I don't feel like I'm still starving after my work-outs. These are sold in several stores so if you can find cheaper, go right ahead and test it out but there are coupons occasionally on Amazon which makes the purchase decision much easier.",

Mocha is okay, never had the strawberry.",

I bought this mainly because I wanted to gain muscle weight, and as a vegetarian, I was having a difficult time doing so. I also drink it because I'm too lazy to prepare my own shake more often than not. I like the chocolate flavor and it's not so thick and gooey like other protein drinks, it's more like plain chocolate milk.",
