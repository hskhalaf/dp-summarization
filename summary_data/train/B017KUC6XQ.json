In my day a decent mechanical dial caliper would cost a few day's pay or more! I still have several of my old measuring tools and their standards. This measures the standards at least as well as the old mechanical stuff. Not quite as elegant or familiar, but light, accurate so far, and handy just the same. Welcome to the new world!",

Many times the one off switch will not turn it off, fortunately it will eventually time out and turn it self off, or it would kill batteries.

I use it maybe a few times a month. Hence, if I need to take 2-3 measurements to make sure the result is consistent, then that's just fine with me. I would do this even with high-end calipers. So far the results have been consistent so I am not concerned about the accuracy/reference point. Also note that for my needs I really don't need the most accurate measurement. If I am within 0.1mm (about 4 thou/mil) than that's plenty accurate enough for me.",

If it's set correcting at one end of the slide, it is way to tight or loose (depending on travel direction) at the other end. I consider it a minor but slightly irritating complaint.

I'm not going to get in to how they work because it's obvious there good the past Aerospace calibration and got certified as the pictures shows. There not as nice as my Mitutoyo's but there $300 plus. But for the price of these you can't go wrong. Even if they only last a few years. You can buy a few of them and still be under the price of the top brands and they work just as good without a doubt!",

They've got less wiggle than other budget calipers, and slide really smoothly. The other thing that I really like about them is the carrying case. It snaps shut very securely, and has rubber pads to hold the calipers in place so that they're not getting bumped or jostled around when you carry them. I've owned a few pairs from HF Tools, and a few knockoffs from overseas, and these Vinca calipers are my favorites out of the budget models that I've tried. Great value for the price, and a nice solid feeling tool.",

I measured 500+ bullets, eight different calibers ranging in size from .224 to .338. Once completed I spot-checked 10 from each group and found 100% consistency in my random sampling. As anyone who reloads knows accuracies to the thousandth is critical when measuring bullet diameter. I would buy the VINCA digital caliper again should anything happen to this one.",
