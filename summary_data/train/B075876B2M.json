The stamps are clean, bright stainless steel with well defined letters, numbers, and symbols. These are perfect for our needs. Shipping note: Amazon shipped these in a padded envelope and the stamp container opened some time during shipping and the stamps were floating around the envelope when they arrived. All the pieces were there, but I think Amazon could do a better job securing these when they ship them.",
