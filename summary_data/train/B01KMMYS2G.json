I\u2019m learning that if you sweat, it can take a few extra seconds to remove the band. Overall the quality is great, it\u2019s well made, very comfortable, fit is ideal for running or jumping.",

The only negative things about this type of holder is that it\u2019s not very easy to access the phone quickly, and your phone is basically sitting in a wet holder for the duration of your workout if you sweat. But for what it is, this is a great product. I\u2019ve used this every day for 2 weeks and hand washed it each time after use and it hasn\u2019t affected the elasticity yet. Time will tell how well it holds up, but the material is pretty good so I\u2019m not concerned.",

Once the music devise or phone is put within the armband, you will not be able to access it again until after your run or workout - so if you want to change your playlist or check your time, etc, this is not the armband for you. I found it difficult to get the device in and out of the pocket and then slipped onto my arm. I could not then slip the devise back out of the armband during my run. This is a good choice if you are going on a long run and don't need to change up your music.",

I can put it around my wrist or around my bicep, depending on what exercise I'm doing; and I can use it for any phone or even mp3 player (which I've been using more often in gyms with less-than-ideal wifi/network connection.) It also seems relatively sweat resistant. Much better than keeping my device in my pants pocket, where they tend to get slightly foggy. Makes my life easier, so I would buy this again.",

      "IT\u2019S A [GAME CHANGER]: While other running armbands for women and men are bulky, have an uncomfortable fit due to fabric, plastic and velcro components and don\u2019t accommodate a variety of phone models... our workout sport armband takes a totally different approach by giving you ultimate comfort with our lightweight performance fabric that is velcro free and can FIT ANY SIZE PHONE with slim-line case (up to 7 in.).",

It is so light you won\u2019t even know it\u2019s there. The flexible fabric stays firmly in place so you won\u2019t have to pull, tug or readjust while maintaining your active lifestyle.",
      "WHAT OUR [CUSTOMERS ARE SAYING]: \"Phone fits nice and snug and is really comfy. Great quality armband. Holds my phone and key fob. More comfortable than my plastic and velcro holder. Great for hands free walking while listening to music. Hold my phone with case on it. LOVE IT! Very comfortable for running, cycling. I use a wireless headphone so this is perfect when I'm on my mountain bike or tri bike. As advertised - breathable, easy to use, stays in place during light runs or gym workouts.\"",
      "PROBLEM [SOLVED]: No more chaffing, no velcro, no pinched skin, no slipping, sliding or banging! You will love how easy this armband is to slip on and off; keeps you from having to carry items in your pocket; doesn\u2019t weigh you down; and keeps your hands free of clutter. Additionally, your visibility will be enhanced at night or in low light with our M\u00dcV logo!",
      "FIND YOUR [FIT]: To find your perfect fit, please measure your bicep and choose accordingly: SMALL: <11\", MEDIUM: 11\"-14\", LARGE: 14.5\"-17.5\". We recommend if you are close/in between sizes to choose smaller size for a tighter and firmer fit."
