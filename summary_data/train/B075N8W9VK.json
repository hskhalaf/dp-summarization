I wonder if perhaps this toy was down-sized from its original and no one bothered to re-engineer it once scaled down. For the pictured projects, only some of which there are enough parts to construct, pieces interfere with other pieces so they cannot go together or the wheels turn in the configurations shown. My kiddo can still put pieces together in ways that satisfy his desire to build but we will pitch the instructions to spare him frustration and disappointment.",

The only regret that I have is not buying the largest pack. 101 pieces is more than enough until you get another kid or two to play, then I think that the larger box would have been a better option. Regardless, It is a value purchase, sturdy pieces and tools, vibrant colors and it was delivered before I even expected to receive it. Five stars.",

At first we were a little disappointed it didnt have step by step instructions but once they practiced their skills keep getting better and better. My only problem is that the kit needs more big pieces. I feel like double the size of the big blocks instead of all the extras that you cant use if you have something built. 8 had to buy 2 sets just so my sons can build more cool things. And when I tried to buy extra parts that was not an option so yeah kinda sucked. But other than that my kids really love this!",
