Why feed you pet discards from the human food chain? This product has the organic label that appeals to me as chemical free is important. This is the first dog food she has taken to and we have tried many. We do use another canned brand that is also of high quality when we are traveling. I highly recommend this for anyone who has a small breed dog.",
