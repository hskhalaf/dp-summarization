      "text": "This is my first paslma cutter. Here are some thing I discovered that might help you. 1. You have to tap the metal to get the cut to start. It should just take a tap of the tip to the metal you want to cut. 2. If your plasmas cutter doesn't start cutting try turning down your air pressure. Around 40psi worked for me. 3. Make sure that the white cap on the gun is tight. My cap was loose at first and it cut terribly. Once I tightened the cap it started cutting much faster and much cleaner. Hope this helps.",

(Cheap idea for a cutting surface for this as well is corrugated steel roofing/siding. I cut and tacked together 2 pieces to keep damage to any other surfaces to Zero) (really chews up concrete as well HAHA!!)",

It takes a little getting used as in different metal thicknesses for matching speed with cutting but a little practice and you get there. I will say it works better using 220 vs 110 but that again depends on metal thickness, 110 is good if you have a 30 amp breaker installed. Is it worth the money? Absolutely .",
