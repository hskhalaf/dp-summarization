The most important thing it does is draw the fumes from away from going straight up into your face. I can't believe the charcoal filters can remove all of the smoke, but the air does come out the other end transparent. Couldn't be happier :)",

With the solder smoke absorbers I've used in the past, I had to be immediately next to them to get any effect, but this works at a few inches away with no problem, and even grabbed smoke up to a foot away. I can't say for sure whether this is the best value, but it exceeded my expectations, and it'll definitely get the job done. If you need a solid solder absorber and are okay with spending a bit for what is just an activated carbon filter and a fan, this'll work perfectly.",

There is sufficient air flow to create a suction effect that will draw soldering fumes away from the work area and blow them out the back. I suspect a small fan blowing across the work area would work just as well at a considerable price difference.",
