I used it several time on the hunting lease and it worked really well for what I needed it for, which is to trim down the brush around my feeder and blind. It cut through thick brush like nothing! Very impressed! The batter pack is great switching between my Ego weed-eater and 14\" chain saw.",

This is obviously heavier than your typical trimmer, because of the battery. But if you are strong enough to hold and manipulate it, this is very good\u2014even if a lot more expensive than electric trimmers. One thing you can't do is use it with only one hand.",
