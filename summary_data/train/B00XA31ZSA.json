They lasted a long time, but it was eventually time for another pair. I'm happy we went with the same brand. Our daughter was able to put them on and start skating immediately without any difficulty. They are comfortable, easy to adjust, and have great wheels (not the cheap plastic type). Would definitely recommend!",
