In case you're wondering these aren't solid stainless steel they have liquid in the middle which probably makes them stay colder longer than a solid piece of stainless steel would I'm guessing make sense to me. And the tongs are a good idea for handling them when they're frozen have you ever seen the Christmas story with the little kid his tongue and the flagpole LOL. Once they're in your drink they're fine but right out of the freezer you want to use the tongs. The whole set-up including the plastic case they come in is all really sturdy and well-built.",

I put these in with ice and even if I finish my beverage I can still sit in the pool or hot tub and take my time going back to the kitchen to get another. These seem to keep the ice from melting hardly at all. I haven't tried these w/o ice but it's amazing how long my ice lasts and my drink doesn't get super watery.",

Always use the tongs to carefully lower the cubes into your glass. Don't simply drop them, as they may easily crack or break your glass. I do like that the drinks do not become weak due to the cubes not melting down into the drink, however.",

Whatever liquid substance I place these cubes in whether water, soda, or ethanol it barely changes the temperature ever so slightly and remain that slight lower temperature for only a mere minute or two. If you want something cold that will chill your drink that won't dilute your beverage with water, I suggest a similar product which is BPA free silicon or plastic cubes filled with liquid. At least these cubes transfer its cold properties a bit better than these.",
