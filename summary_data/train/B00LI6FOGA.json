Over the years, I've learned to not purchase brand name watches usually because of my track record. Basic Timex watches have served me well, and I usually go for the ones without bells and whistles. Why spend money on something you're going to lose? But saw this Seiko tank-look watch and remembered a tank watch I had years ago that lasted forever, but could not be repaired (can't believe I held on to that one so long). Anyway, if you love the look of a classic tank watch, this Seiko is for you!",
