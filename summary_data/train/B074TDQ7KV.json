The size is perfect for trips lasting up to a week, and the rugged material allows for a guaranteed fit on most flights. It doesn\u2019t expand which limits the use of some carry on bags. My only problem is that the weels are slightly jiggly, which is a pain when walking long distances in airports. It has fit easily in all overhead bins (regional jets to wide bodies). Overall great choice for a carry on bag.",
