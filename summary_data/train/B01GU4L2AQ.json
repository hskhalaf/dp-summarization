      "text": "I purchased this as a sample before an elementary school library remodel to compare with hokki stools. We've had two 12 inch and two 15 inch hokki stools for a year, and I purchased one 18 inch Learniture active learning stool a couple of weeks ago. I asked my second and third graders to sit on them both and compare, not exchanging information until I asked them 15 minutes later. The consensus is that these stools are more comfortable that the hokki stools, even though they don't wobble as much. I love it, as these are about 1/3 of the price! Win for my school library and the kiddos!",

The students love them, the teachers love them, and I was able to get many more chairs for the money than the other ones I found. The teachers have said they have really helped children with ADHD another learning disabilities be able to focus on their learning. BEST Product and an amazing price.",

It took some convincing to even try it, but now he prefers it over his regular chair. I really like how it arrived as one piece vs. another similar chair that arrived in multiple pieces. This has a lot sturdier construction. I like the padding on the bottom, too, which other similar chairs lack. I'd buy this again and easily recommend it to others. The only question is if your kid will give it a try or not.",
