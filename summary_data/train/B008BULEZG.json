      "text": "I love getting frozen and deli pizzas but I hated how unless I cooked them directly on the oven rack the center crust would be soggy. They would stick to the rack and drip making a mess most of the time. This pizza pan is a life saver. I got this one because it's bigger than the other ones I was looking at. It has fit every pizza that I've put on it so far. I get golden crunchy crust throughout and all the pizzas slide right off. I only hand wash it but it's holding up great so far.",

      "text": "This pan is exactly what I was looking for. It is made of a metal that absorbs the heat very well and along with this, the holes ensure a nice crust. Many other pans are made of a cheap aluminum which does not absorb the heat well enough to get a crisp pizza crust. As for the non-stick surface, it is very durable. My teens have used a metal pizza cutter several times and it has held up well. I have since hidden the metal pizza cutter as telling a teen not to do something repeatedly does not always ensure the result you are looking for:)",

The holes in the pan allow the heat and air to get through the bottom of the crust, allowing for a nice, crispy crust. We have really like how the pizzas back on this pan.",

No need to heat up the dough and then place sauce, cheese toppings. etc on later and heat again. I also purchased it because of the size 14\" which creates a good size pizza with 8 slices.

If the pizza sticks, just use an oil spray to gently coat the pan before laying the pizza dough on it. pros: heats evenly, good size, easy to clean cons: wish these were made heavier as they tend to warp in the high heat but return to their original shape after cooling, not made in the USA",

The interlocking nonstick layers are designed to prevent sticking, while the heavy-gauge steel core resists warping and heats your pizza evenly.
