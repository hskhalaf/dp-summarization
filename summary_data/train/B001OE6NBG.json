Normally, when I hang a new toy in his cage, he spends the next hour or two ignoring it and then the following 30 minutes reducing it to splinters and frayed rope, usually leaving only a single chain hanging in its place. When I hung this toy in his cage, he immediately went at it. It's now some 7 hours later, and he's been gnawing on that thing on and off. But aside from an impressive pile of rubble in the bottom of the cage, the toy looks pretty much unscathed. THAT'S impressive!! ;o) In all seriousness, I wholeheartedly recommend this behemoth to anyone with a larger bird. It's well worth the px.",

When I first bought it, he was really apprehensive about touching it, but after some time (I say about 2-3 weeks) he learned that it was a safe toy, and has been showing interest in it (on and off) since. The toy is very durable and is still holding up after all these years. I highly recommend, great buy.",

It's a nice, large size, so I anticipate many hours of play ahead for him with his new chew toy. Surprisingly, he went right to this one, too... it usually takes him a couple of hours to size up the new invaders to his domain, but he hopped right on this one and went to swinging. Maybe he's mellowing in his old age?",

As soon as i put it in there cage they ran to play with it, it keeps them occupied and i love that the wood pieces are seperated from each other and not on one strand of rope. I say that because I've had some of the toys that have 6 wood blocks on one strand of rope and it is not fun after they chew the rope and all the wood lay on the bottom of the cage.",

The rope in the toy is course, so he does not spend as much time on the rope. Experts say rope toys deter a bird from plucking, but the rope is too course so he is not inclined to play with it. If you are looking for a toy that will take the bird longer to get through (and distract from plucking), I recommend ones with a softer rope/big knots.",
