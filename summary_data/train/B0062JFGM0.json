This has come in handy during my son\u2019s at home sessions, Percy has even warmed up to it, it\u2019s spacious enough for him and his toys. I bought this used like new and it really was like new.

I got one larger than what I really need in case we travel so they will have plenty of room. I can easily attach a water bottle to the front door as well. FAR better than some of the so-called \"small animal\" carriers that are marketed and in my opinion, far safer and much more secure.",
