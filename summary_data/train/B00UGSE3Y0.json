The floating yellow bobber never made sense to me, as their are wrist straps out there of neoprene that float and are more effective, but it works. The strap sets are thin and cheap, made for a small person and very little motion, but it will work until you decide to upgrade to a quality set. The case is a little small for my taste, it held everything, but could use a zip up liner for the cover instead of the net, so everything doesnt fall out when you open the case.",

Only problem is that the 3M sticker wasn't strong enough and the floating sponge failed to do its job so I lost my brand new camera in the ocean the first time I used it. I had my camera attached to my surfboard using the Curved Surface Mount with the Release Buckle Mount. I also had the Floating Sponge on my camera incase it came off. It took 2 waves just fine but tore off on the third. We looked for 2 hours for my camera but never saw any sign of it. Very disappointed.",

I'm sure I just received a bad suction mount and they wouldn't all be like this but if you're ordering this one because of the case be aware that it may not be as it seems in the picture.",

Protective foam is of poor quality and design barely fitting in case. Good for a cheap item but if you want long lasting and durability perhaps spend a little more and look elsewhere.",

My biggest complaint was the suction cup accesary is cheap, mine doesnt stick to items very well and the plastic tightening screw stripped on it. Other than that not bad for what you pay for.",

Once i saw the girl looking for her GoPro at the bottom of water that was 30 feet down, I was glad that I bought this accessory kit. Even though she only lost the 99 dollar GoPro is still would make me mad. This a great investment if you have the 500 GoPro Black like I do.",
