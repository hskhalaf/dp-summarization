The reason I purchased it was to add more maps and have the SD card slot for additional maps. Unfortunately what is not made clear is that the pre-loaded maps take up 92% of the 8GB storage leaving only the SD card slot. This is the reason I returned it.",

To move around on the map, a little joystick is employed and it is either too insensitive or too sensitive, so movement is awkward. I later opted for the GPSMap 78s model, which has the added benefit of floating in water.",

The controls are terrible. It doesn't even play Snake. Adding maps and setting up Garmin Basecamp is a huge pain. Don't waste time or money on this. It might be durable, and the only reason I can see bringing this along is in case your phone breaks or you lose power and your battery bank loses power. I regret buying this.",

I think I d just get an Android with my 200 bucks and it will for sure works better. I hope some other company can come up with decent portable gps and kick Garmin off the market forever.",
