It\u2019s also really cool looking; the mouse has a fabric wire which is really nice to have, and both cords are very long. I really love this set and I\u2019m really happy with my purchase!

You can cycle the rainbow, but it looks pretty rough because the LEDs appear to be in groups, rather than independent. As a result, customization is also limited. The one CON about this keyboard for some however, is the keys are slightly stiffer than one may like for fast typing or games. Other than that, for the price, it's great and will make any kid (or adult!) very happy. You get what you pay for, though!",

Just plugged it in, adjusted it to how I wanted it set, and was gaming in no time! The keyboard and mouse are very comfortable to use - especially for long periods of time, like raiding! Above all, the price is excellent!!!!! As cheap as this was, I wasn't sure if I'd like it. I will definitely get the newest version when I need to replace this one! Red Dragon, you have my support! Keep up the great work!",

Many features don't work with Mac and you have to reprogram keys from your System Preferences but the basic functions work that way. That's just a simple warning for Mac users if you're a dummy like me, but this really is a great keyboard and mouse that I enjoy using, which is why I ordered a second one in the first place!",

Of course because it lights up, but he also like the fact that he can change the mouse dpi setting with just the click of a button on the mouse. He was also impressed with the removable weights in the bottom of the mouse. Overall it\u2019s a pretty good keyboard and are very happy with it.",

I like the keyboard a lot as well and the feeling of the buttons is pretty nice, so if you are on a budget or just looking for a good but cheap gaming set up, I'd go with this.",

Cons: If i could give the mouse a zero by itself I would. the wheel does not have enough of a spin on the computer screen for scrolling. It also does not change colors.",
