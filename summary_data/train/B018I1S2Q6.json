With the led lights, it made it so much easier for her to focus on smaller things. She is happy to see the buttons on her microwave again. This product is just what it says it is and is so easy to use and to handle. It is very easy for an older person to use as it is a lighter weight. I would recommend this product to anyone needing a good magnifying glass.",

After some careful searching I came across this set, and I can't believe I didn't buy this years ago. The interchangeable lenses give you the entire lens to magnify with (so no smaller inset magnification). Having the option to swap out the three lenses, which I found to be a good variety, combined with the LED light on the handle makes this the magnifying glass I always wanted. Serious thought and love was put into it's design. I highly recommend!",

The 16X magnifier has a very short focal length, yet it provides a clean and clear image for close work.

They are very handy, coming in a carrying bag that\u2019s easy to drop in a drawer. The small one is particularly handy because it\u2019s small enough to put in a purse or large pocket so it can be taken along when shopping. I\u2019m very happy with this purchase. These magnifying glasses ticked all the boxes.",
