      "text": "I love giving mini treats to our 10-year-old pug dog, Babu, because we really need to watch his weight. Pug dogs tend to get fat, so understanding what goes into Babu's belly is a must! Each treat is less than 3 calories, so it gives us peace of mind when feeding them to our dog. They are a perfect size for training as well! My favorite part of Zuke's Natural Training Dog Treats is that they are made using real chicken and avoid any artificial colors or flavors. If you're looking for a quality training treat for your dog, I would highly recommend these ones from Zuke's!",

They are tiny little bites that are perfect for training. They are each ~3 calories so you can give your pup plenty without worrying about making them chubby. They are corn, wheat and soy-free and have vitamins and minerals. I like that they come in a re-sealable bag for safe keeping. I also like that they're made in the USA - in Durango, CO! I've been giving them to my 13-week old mini Goldendoodle and she hasn't had any stomach issues with these. I would 100% recommend and will certainly order again!",

At home, my dog loves treats and would rush from anywhere he is to get them. When he smells this (or fail to smell anything), he just turns around and leaves.

They have a strong (in a good way) fresh smell. He always knows when I have them and gives me his complete attention. The size is perfect for training - you can use quite a few without feeling like your overfeeding your dog. I just bought my third bag. I have tried the salmon and chicken versions - I was worried the salmon one would smell fishy but it didn't. Great treats!",

Also, if they do happen to go through the laundry they don't stain or squish into your clothes (thank goodness!). This is also the best price I have found, both online and locally!",

I now have a huge bag full of these that will go to waste unless I can find another dog that likes them! Fingers crossed.",
