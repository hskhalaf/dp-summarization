The camera is excellent and it's got the all important micro SD card slot. A nice extra touch was a free dropbox subscription for 2 years :)",

It is a bit daft that you can't charge and listen to music at same time, as port same for both, but the phone charges really quickly. Aux headphone adaptor didn't work at first but when I tried different pair of headphones it prompted an update of firmware for the adaptor. Pause function works on my aux headphones but volume controls don't.",

Pretty sure I'm not muting the phone inadvertently but, I have to restart the phone to be able to receive calls again. Still investigating.",
