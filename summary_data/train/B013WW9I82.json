Only problem is if you let coffee sit on it too long it leaves indelible stains. Also, these chairs get dirty easy. We've had some large folks sit on them and they've held up. So besides the dirt issue, they're space-saving and great for groups.",

Tip: When the chair is folded, there is no space to slip your hand through, to carry several at one time...just dip the chair upside down and carry several that way. 2 When closing the chairs up, kick the back legs of the chai inwards. For some reason they are hard to fold close, using the seat.",

Since I use it in the shower all the time, it is showing no rust and folds relatively easily (since everyone else does not need it, we fold it to get it out of the way).",

I did lots of side to side movements and legs off the ground tests while sitting in these chairs and they didn't budge. At 6 feet tall these chairs sit standard height off the ground.
