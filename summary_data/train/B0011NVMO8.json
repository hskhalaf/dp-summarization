While I would love a bit more zoom, the stabaliziaton is definitely necessary even at the 250mm zoom. For most photography purposes, this is enough. I like to photograph wildlife, and can fill the frame with a small animal like a bird from about 20 feet away at 250mm zoom. Excellent lens and I highly recommend, especially if you're between this and the 300mm zoom. Thanks!",

The stabilization is great, but sometimes the focusing is a little slow. I haven't missed any shots because of it, and at last resort, you can put it in manual focus and go from there.",

Third is a cropped pic of the Moon, again a handheld shot. I'm kind of a noob, and can't compare it to other lenses from personal experience (except the Canon 18-55 kit lens that has it's own merits), but I love this thing. I don't see how you can go wrong with this lens, especially at this price ($125).",

Reason I gave it 4 stars is because, yes it has a motorized AF when stock don't, but it is a little noisy when moving. Nothing bad. Not a reason to not bad. Im a perfectionist sometimes but very good lens for the money. Especially since it has IS on it. Recommend",

I enjoy taking portraits and capturing facial expressions, and for that, this lens provides plenty of zoom and great bokeh at a low aperture setting. The only downside to the lens is the speed of auto focus. Also, the subject has to be at a considerable distance to ensure correct focus, but considering the zoom ratio, this is expected. All in all, great introductory lens for a beginner (like me) yielding professional results, at least, for portraiture.",

It's also very affordable for it's capabilities. A reminder: Make sure to research if the lens is good for photography or film. The camera 70D has auto focus but most lenses are not good for film, they make too much noise and will ruin your fotage if you don't have different sound recording source.",

We used it with our Canon rebel SLR. We already had a 20-55mm lens and needed another lens with more zoom. Overall totally worth the money.

The Seller also included lens hoods and UV filter, all of this with sufficient packing and labeling. I gave the seller five stars. However, give the product in general four stars because even though the lens is pretty good and the seller(who I would buy from again) was excellent, this current version of the Canon EF-S 55-250mm f/4.0-5.6 IS II is not as noiseless as its successor, the Canon EF-S 55-250mm F4-5.6 IS STM, which is almost completely silent.",

I have not had any issues with lens creep but one issue I did hear about when researching this one is that there may be some vignetting at 250mm.

I take mostly landscape and wildlife photos so the maximum aperture of 4.0 may not give you the fine background blur of a portrait lens.

My only complaint, and this is towards Canon themselves and not the lens, is that Canon doesn't provide a hood with the lens; Canon must realy think highly of their hoods as they are ridiculously expensive as an accessory. I bought a nice Hoya hood for this lens at about 25% the cost of the Canon hood.",

    "description": "Style:Base| Product Packaging:Standard PackagingFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nIncorporating Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer technology, this Canon 55-250mm telephoto zoom lens captures long distance, low-light shots far better than many comparable lenses, helping you photograph the far-off action of athletes or zoom in for an intimate portrait with a blurred background. The high-zoom-ratio lens is equivalent to a focal length of 88-400mm in the 35mm format (when used on Canon EOS cameras compatible with EF-S lenses). More significantly, the image stabilizer effect creates an equivalent shutter speed of roughly four stops faster than the same size lens without an image stabilizer. In other words, if the slowest shutter speed you can hold a 250mm lens steadily is normally 1/250th of a second, this Canon lens will let you hand-hold shutter speeds as slow as 1/15th of a second. The lens also boasts a UD-glass lens element to correct chromatic aberration to create excellent image quality throughout the zoom range. Delivering an excellent performance at an affordable price for all photographers, the 55-250mm lens carries a one-year warranty. \n\n Specifications\n\n\n * Focal length: 55-250mm \n * Maximum aperture: f/4 to f/5.6 \n * Lens construction: 12 elements in 10 groups, including one UD-glass element \n * Diagonal angle of view: 27 degrees (at 50 feet) to 6 degrees (at 15 feet), with APS-C image sensors \n * Focus adjustment: DC motor, gear-driven (front focusing design) \n * Closest focusing distance: 3.6 feet (0.31x maximum close-up magnification) \n * Filter size: 58mm \n * Dimensions: 2.8 inches in diameter and 4.3 inches long \n * Weight: 13.8 ounces \n * Warranty: 1 year \n\nThis telephoto zoom lens is designed with Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer technology while retaining compactness and lightness, in response to demands of photographers. This high zoom ratio lens is equivalent to a focal length of 88-400mm in the 35mm format (when used on Canon EOS cameras compatible with EF-S lenses), and the image stabilizer effect equivalent to a shutter speed about 4 stops faster than the same size lens without Image Stabilizer. In other words, if the slowest shutter speed you could formerly hold a 250mm lens steadily was 1/250th of a second, with Canon's 4-stop stabilization correction, you could hand-hold at shutter speeds as slow as 1/15th of a second. It also uses a UD-glass lens element to correct chromatic aberration for excellent image quality throughout the zoom range. This new EF-S telephoto lens with great features delivers excellent performance at an affordable price for all photographers.",
