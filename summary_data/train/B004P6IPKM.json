      "text": "We love this 12 X 12 Pergola. We bought it for the new cement area in our backyard. We plan on putting a table and chairs set under it for outdoor eating and hanging out. It is very beautiful and really makes our yard look great. We did use Amazon Home Services to have someone put it together for us. It is a big pergola and it would have taken a full day or two for my husband to put together by himself. In fact, the Amazon Home Services sent 2 people to set it up and it took about 5 hours. We highly recommend this beautiful pergola.",

      "text": "The New England Arbor's 12' x 12' Regency pergola was a great purchase and the Amazon price was a steal compare to comparable pergolas I found elsewhere. From the prompt delivery (in perfect condition) to the easy assembly, I could not have asked for more. Took me about 10 hours from start to finish to assemble everything. You really need the assistance of at least one strong helper to lift the beams and rafters into their proper location. After assembly I bought a canvas weave canopy (also made by New England) ... provides great shade.",

The manufacturer went above & beyond to help with the product & provided a replacement for one of the main columns which had a 4x4 stuck inside during installation. Five stars to the product & customer support!",

      "text": "One of the finest quality products you will ever purchase. Probably the clearest assembly instructions I have ever seen. The hardest part was digging the footings. Took 4 experienced men a day to erect. Started at 8am, dug footings, added cement for the 4x4 posts and then started. Probably would have doubled the amount of cement from 4 bags to 8 bags - 2 per hole. Use Quickcrete red bag, sets in 45 minutes. Entire project was complete at 6:30 that night and this included cutting brick pavers. Manhattans served at 7pm under the new pergola. High quality product and absolutely no cutting. Remember the old adage - \"start square and end square\".",

I priced many and this was the most economical one for me other than building a custom one. Keep in mind that you must purchase the wood that goes into the vinyl. That obviously added to the cost as well as purchasing the anchors I needed to drill into the cement patio. This year I purchased the shades that get weaved through the top. That was a much needed addition for me since I get full sun on my patio.",

My only suggestion for installation of the bolt down brackets is to not use Tapcon screws to screw into a concrete base, I had nothing but trouble (but not the fault of New England Arbors). Use a different concrete fastener.",
