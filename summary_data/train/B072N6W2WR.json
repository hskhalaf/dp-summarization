Ordered 3 bars with glee for the savvy price. OMG horrible. Why? Super medicinal smell, completely gone in less that 15 showers, ooozes a black sludge down my marble shower and even etched the finish off the marble tile after one bar! Uber bad folks. So wanted it to be amazing but not even close hence a review that I seldom offer.",

It lathers nicely, smells really good and it lasts long...all of the things that \u201cother\u201d soap lacks. What\u2019s better is that my skin looks and feels great, which is why I switched to pine tar soap in the first place. I am totally hooked and am off to go buy more!!",

      "text": "While this soap may contain pinetar, marketing it as \"pinetar soap\" feels very disingenuous. The smell is much more spiced and herbal, doesn't have the same mellow musky natural smell from other brands. The constant black run off also makes me question the integrity of the ingredients, I've not had other pinetar soaps do this, gives me the impression that there's something artificial about the color. Finally the texture quickly softens, going to move the bar to the soap dish after finishing showering the texture was almost gelatinous. Overall there's nothing inherently wrong with this soap as far as soap goes, it's just not what's expected when you but specifically \"pinetar soap\".",

Some may like this, but it is completely different than the 9 other bars I have gone through 2. They've removed the rough bits for exfoliation. It is now a smooth soap, which is not how this was marketed for all previous orders. 3. They've changed the shape. This seems to be an improvement as it will make the soap easier to hold. However, I didn't test this because of points 1 and 2 above. I won't order this product again.",

I use this soap for hand washing to keep my skin from cracking in cold weather, and when I have eczema blisters to soothe and moisturized them. I also wash my face with it morning and evening.

The only downside I've found is how easily this pine tar soap can dissolve if left in wet areas or, if you're like me, have other family members use the shower. That said, I just purchased a very affordable porous soap holder and moved the soap where it won't be in direct contact with water. Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase and highly recommend Oliver Rocket.",

My only issue is it comes wrapped in plastic, so make sure to open the package when it comes in. Natural soaps, unless fully dry, won't last as long. If you want the bar to last longer, open the package and let it air dry for a month or so before using. Plan ahead :)",

However, the fact that it dissolves so quickly is also great because it washes off of your skin in seconds and leaves no oily feeling behind, unlike some pine tar soaps I've used.",

If you have oily skin, this will definitely dry you up, but I discovered that using it for days in a row would lead to itchy, dry skin fairly quickly.",
