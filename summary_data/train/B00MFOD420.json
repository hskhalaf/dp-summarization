      "text": "While I'm not a \"regular\" golfer (i only get out a couple times a year), this driver is FANTASTIC! I have been able to hit the ball extremely straight and far enough (150-200+ yards) for my liking. With more practice, I know I'll increase distance over time. The driver is extremely light and has a great, quality grip. It also came with a beautiful, Callaway leather cover. I purchased this as a \"like new\" quality and it arrived better than expected: I could not tell of any scratches on the club before using it. A great buy for $89!",

I take great care of my sports equipment, so I was shocked this occurred. I purchase this from Amazon.com directly in September 2015, so apparently there is no recourse for a replacement from Amazon nor Callaway. While the driver served me well when I used it, I certainly cannot recommend this equipment, nor its purchase from Amazon.com directly. Go to your local golf equipment dealer where they will most certainly honor the replacement of such a simple but problematic club failure.",
