The way the lid is designed, it apparently does not have to fit tightly to prevent steam from escaping. Works beautifully! Some reviews indicated they were so thin they bent easily and seemed cheap. Mine is not so thin that I would worry about dents at all. It is actually a nice looking and very functional lid.",
