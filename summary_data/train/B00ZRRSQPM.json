      "text": "Finally installed this awning. Was easy to assemble after following instructions carefully. Took two persons. Installing it to exterior wall took 2 hours. Package came with long anchor screws and rope. It is manually retractable without a crank. But we like it down. We mounted ours low on purpose. It shades our door entryway very well. And it is also water repellent. We like it a lot. Just that if you look underside of the awning fabric, you can see the loose fabric threads. We hope this awning will last at least a few years. Looks great over our door and now the door feels cooler not get cooked by the summer hot sun!",

      "text": "These are beautiful. Two men installed one in about 30 minutes, so they installed quickly and easily. I ordered three eight-foot awnings for the west side of my house, and even the neighbors have commented how pretty they are. I also got lucky that they match my green house perfectly. Also, the fabric is thin/light enough to allow light to come into the house without having direct sunlight hit the drapes and furniture. I'm very pleased with these awnings.",

      "text": "It can be very sunny and intense sun at 9,200 feet, so these awnings are super. Gives us more privacy and keep the rooms cooler. We used rope & eye hook to fasten corner to wall so doesn't flop in wind. We can only use 4 months, but so far we love them. One picture shows you the corner piece that holds 2 together. We used super fine sandpaper to clean the inside to knock off the burrs so would screw in better. 1st unit took 4.5 hours; all of the others took 2 hours. We are happy with the purchase",
