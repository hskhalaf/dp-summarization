The probes which go into the ground look like they are just copper-clad circuit boards. All of the ones I have corroded very quickly. All three show very different readings (from 12 % to 40%) even when set right next to each other or in a contained bucket of soil. The website and receiver units seem fine, but the most important parts are the sensors. Very disappointed! The web site has been promising a new product called Lush.... forever. The old units are all sold out. Buyer beware.",

I feel a little silly putting a $35 sensor in a pot with a plant I spent $5 on... but this is more of a \"fun\" thing than anything. Update - the 3rd sensor worked after replacing the batteries. However, the pairing process is very poor, so I'm leaving it as 3 stars. 1 of my 3 paired quickly (10 mins), another took an hour, the 3rd (one with the replaced batteries) took about 3 hours. I'll still buy more though because I think this is pretty 'neat'.",
