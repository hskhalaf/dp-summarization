Even not self-propelled, the lightness makes the mowing easier. For the blower, lack of dropcords saves tons of time. Both products run 20-30 minutes on a charge. Charges are quick. Quality seems good, though not professional grade. Very impressive. Thinking about adding the hedge clippers and pole saw to the collection.",
