They only allocate one drive letter, for the actual card that it plugged in.

      "text": "I'm satisfied with the with the dongle and the speed at which it reads data and pictures. I also really like the design and the fact that the top lights up when It's writing or reading data. I appreciate this fact a lot because it lights up brightly and it's easy to see. I don't have to search on the sides or bottom for a read light like my other card reader. I'm very happy with it. These are initial impressions.",
