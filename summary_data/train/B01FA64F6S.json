If this is a problem for you, which you aren't willing to relieve by occasionally standing or removing the legs from the knee rest, then no \"kneeling chair,\" not even this very solid one, is for you.",

The seat cushion slants so it doesn't hurt under thigh. The frame is very sturdy and strong. It not only adjusts in height, but it can be adjusted from seat to kneeling with a three hole choice. (the only one that had that) This is what really sold me. I was able to find that perfect position of sitting/kneeling which allows my back to naturally straighten. Thanks to Amazon's return policy I was able to investigate first hand.",

It has some limited options to adjust the space between the kneeling pad and the seat (I am at the shortest setting and am 5'0\" - it is working for me fine) and to move the seat up and down. I am only giving 4 stars rather than 5 stars because the foam is HOT. My knees are very comfortably sinking into the very deep foam (really nice that it is soft and so thick), but my knees are also really over-heated.",

      "text": "I had hip surgery and sitting in a regular chair at work was killing me! This chair has helped tremendously, i can sit all day long now with no hip pain. I've also noticed that i can sit in a regular chair longer before my hip starts to hurt. Only problem I've had is that 2 of the wheels seem to lock up and not roll as freely as the others. If you have back or hip pain this chair can help!!!",

      "text": "The chair is built well. I only have two issues with it. The seat is too slanted, even after adjusting the height. Because of this I'm continually adjusting to push myself back up on the seat. The other issue is how much cushioning is on the knee pad. This causes my knees to slip to one side or the other. So I usually only sit with one knee on and the other extended. Other than that it's a good chair and has relieved some back issues due to sitting.",
