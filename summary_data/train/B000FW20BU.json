It's now September (5 months later), the paint on the rim and metal components is peeling, it's getting rusty and corroded. I did see other had reviewed this item with concerns as such, however, the number of positive reviews made me buy it. I regret it now and wish I would get a refund. I would not recomend buying this item.",

The only thing that made it was the base and backboard even the rim rusted. Now am looking for a new basketball goal. Would not recomend. Face it metal and water do not mix.",
