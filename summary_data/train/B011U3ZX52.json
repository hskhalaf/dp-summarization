For safety reasons, I threw them out although my cat loved them the most. They were the red and blue sparkly wrinkle toy. It just shed a lot of metallic pieces. I didn't want my cat to choke on something or get it in her belly. Other than that, she loves all these toys. She especially enjoys chasing the little mice around. She throws them about the house. I really like how much she enjoys these. The balls are also great. I would recommend this to others.",

If I had it to do over again, I'd probably just buy some toys individually (but I liked that it came in a cute package).",
