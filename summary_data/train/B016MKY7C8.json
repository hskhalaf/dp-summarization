I purchased this mat for the temperature control aspect on the thermostat since I\u2019ve had issues with regular heat mats getting too warm for my seeds that need to be at 80-85 degrees. The same problem has now occurred with this mat where the mat will heat up and show from 95 up to 118 on the thermostat for the temp even when I set the heat to the lowest setting of 68. Not worth the money if it\u2019s only going to work for less than a month of use.",

This works so well that, once set, I never have to adjust anything until time to remove the bottles from the box. In fact, it works so well that I am thinking of buying another mat & thermostat to use for the gallon jars, as this works so much better than the belt-type heater I have for them.

The difference was plus or minus about 5 degrees or so but it depends on how deep the probes are. Like one is at the very bottom of the seed cup of course thats gonna read higher than the top side. Overall it great to have a durable matt for seeds to bloom.. Will buy again for sure for more planta next year.",

The thermostat turns off power to the mat when the set temperature is reached and turns it back on when temperature (as measured by an accompanying prob) falls 0.5*F below the set temperature, so the resulting temp is quite steady. My original mat produced wonky results, so I reached out to Vivosun for an advice. After a few prompt responses I've got a replacement in like 2 days and it works great now. That's how I know the customer service is great too.",
