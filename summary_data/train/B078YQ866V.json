Anyway, it's got him reading more, reading bigger words, and trying to remember what he's been reading so he can do the detective stuff. Goal accomplished. He even likes to tell us what's happening in the story after he's played a bit! Yay!",

I thought this game was for a wider range audience but it seems like it was designed only for toddlers or small children. The only redeemable feature is pikachus older man voice.",
