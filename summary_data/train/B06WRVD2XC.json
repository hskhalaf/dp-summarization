The very NEXT day, UPS shows up at my door, takes the slippers and hands me a receipt. Then, the next day, I had a size twelve delivered! They fit! These slippers are very nice, but very narrow and sized incredibly wrong. BUT, they are nice! I'm pleased with how efficient the return process is. You always take a chance buying shoes online, but how easy was it to get a different size???!!! Very impressed!! Just order larger....",
