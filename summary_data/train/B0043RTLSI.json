The MoGo is always with my phone which is very convenient. I am also very impressed with the sound quality. It sounds better to me and to those with whom I am talking. The only improvement I would suggest is to allow the headset to be charging at the same time as the phone, not as it is currently designed, to be charged separately. I recommend this item highly.",

FYI...I would definately check out other ear pieces before giving this one a try. Especially in the case of wanting a longer battery time.",

The only reason I have it 4 instead of 5 stars is the case is a bit slick. The grip of the shell has greatly improved over the previous edition but still needs some work.

    "description": "MoGo Talk XD is the only high performance Bluetooth headset and case custom designed for the iPhone 4. When in action, the headset sits comfortably in-ear and delivers high fidelity crystal clear conversations. The headset also features Talk and Dock functionality enabling the headset to fold flat and snap seamlessly and securely into an accompanying, low-profile iPhone protective case.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\nThe MoGo Talk XD for iPhone 4 combines a Bluetooth headset and a protective case in one thin, seamless design. The compact headset snaps directly into the case, where it can connect to a charging system, so it's always ready for use. The headset is equipped with SmartAudio technology for noise reduction and SoundShape Ear Buds for a comfortable fit.\n\nMoGo Talk XD\nAt a Glance:\n\n * Bluetooth headset stores and charges right on your iPhone 4\n * Flexible SoundShape Ear Buds form to your ear\n * Voice enhancement technology enables clear conversations\n * Balanced armature drivers provide high-quality sound\n * Rugged case with grip edge protects your iPhone 4\n\nMOGO TALK XD BLUETOOTH HEADSET AND PROTECTIVE CASE FOR IPHONE 4\nProtect your iPhone 4 against damage with the hard polycarbonate case.View larger.The Bluetooth headset snaps onto the included Grip Case for storage and charging (a separate cable or dock is required to charge the iPhone).View larger.INTEGRATED HEADSET AND PROTECTIVE CASE FOR IPHONE 4\nThe MoGo Talk XD keeps your iPhone 4 protected while delivering clear, high-fidelity audio. This integrated communication system includes a Bluetooth headset that folds flat and snaps directly onto the included Grip Case, where the headset can be stored and charged using the included micro-USB cable (a separate cable/dock is required to charge the iPhone). The felt-lined case cradles your iPhone 4 and protects the back and sides of the phone against drops, scratches, and bumps.\n\nThis innovative, all-in-one design means your headset will always be exactly where you need it--attached to your iPhone 4. The headset sits flush in the case and is so thin and light you'll barely know it's there.\n\nPOWERFUL AUDIO TECHNOLOGY FOR CLEAR CONVERSATIONS\nFor outstanding fidelity, the MoGo Talk XD employs SmartMonitor in-ear technology, which uses the same balanced armature drivers usually reserved for professional-quality in-ear monitors. The built-in SmartAudio system provides sound enhancement, wind reduction, active noise compensation, and echo cancellation. Simply put, the headset lets you enjoy clear, crisp conversations. Plus, with four hours of talk time and three full days of standby battery life, staying in touch is easier than ever.\n\nThe MoGo Talk XD headset is easy to use, thanks to its simple, one-button operation. And if you have multiple phones, you can utilize the headset's multi-device pairing technology to connect up to five devices.\n\nCOMFORTABLE HEADSET, STORES AND CHARGES IN THE CASE\nThanks to a SoundShape ear tip, the headset's ear buds naturally fit the contours of your inner ear, while the headset itself is adjustable to fit the shape of your face. The ear tip provides more than 15 dB of passive noise cancellation, blocking ambient noise and offering a rich audio experience with full bass response. Storage and charging is easy--the MoGo's headset boom collapses flat--to a thin 5 millimeters--and snaps right into the case.\n\nRUGGED CASE PROTECTS YOUR IPHONE 4\nThe Slim MoGo Grip Case is made out of hard polycarbonate, providing a protective shell for your iPhone that is both durable and stylish. The felt lining adds cushioning, while the shock-absorbing, soft-touch edge grip offers a secure hold. Controls and connectors remain fully accessible when using the case.\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\nMoGo Talk XD Bluetooth Headset iPhone 4, MoGo Dock protective case, SoundShape ear tips (6 sizes), quick-start guide, and Micro USB charging cable.",
