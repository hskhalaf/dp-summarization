It was installed in May, and we had a very hot summer, so the heat function wasn't used much until mid October. That function has already burned out, and with winter almost here, I'm going to need it soon. I'm concerned as to how to proceed from here. I'll be without a light and fan too, if I remove the unit to send back for a replacement. Help!",

But my last purchase with Amazon.com, for the exact same unit, was $59.98. Quite a savings compared to the stores. Plus the convenience of having it delivered within two days of purchase with Amazon Prime is an added bonus. The unit itself is fantastic for remodeling an older outdated unit. I'm replacing an old exhaust fan and a huge 3 bulb/heat lamp type unit. The switches were already wired into the wall so all I had to do was rewire the existing wiring to the new unit, plus some sheetrock work, but that's to be expected.",
