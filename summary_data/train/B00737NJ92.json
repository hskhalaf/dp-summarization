Anyone looking for a good wheelchair with a lot of good options, small enough to maneuver around the house and light enough to easily fold and lift into the trunk of a small car. This is a very good choice all around. Debated for too long on which chair to purchase. I'm glad I chose this one. Even better quality than expected.",

The box is very thin & tore beyond use while trying to get the item in because it was a very tight fit and I could not get the bars and leg rests in the box. After calling four places to find a bigger box, I found a UPS store and they had to use two boxes put together to fit everything. It costs $28.00 to return ship and another $64.00 for the two boxes. ($32.00 each). Total Nightmare and not worth the hassle. Giving one star was too generous of me!",

Other than that, it is fairly comfortable for long hours, very maneuverable, and the arms lifting up and out of the way is a convenient feature. I'm also a fan of the desk-length arms, which allow for comfortable computing, dining, etc. For being so inexpensive, a solid chair all around.",
