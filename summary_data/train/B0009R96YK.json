The mirror had been installed a short time ago, but was over the Amazon return period. The idea and design is top notch, but at the time my unit was produced, something was not to spec and products produced were SUB-PAR. Purchase with caution and be prepared to fix or return.",

I wish there was a quick release version so I can take it off the folding bike when needed. Currently, I can fold the bike with the mirror attached--but very carefully.
