      "text": "Really good kickstand for balancing a bicycle with heavy packs. Very durable with lightweight tubular metal construction, solid welds. It fits my old Schwinn road bike extremely well. The feet are height-adjustable. The spring tension for putting down the stand is very light, but not so much as to cause rattling when riding on moderately bumpy surfaces. Two slight issues for me: The height-adjustable plastic feet come completely off or can move at the accidental press of the buttons on each side, not relatively secure. There is some chain interference when using larger sprocket gears on my road bike, no way to adjust the kickstand angle any further downward, if needed, when not deployed. Otherwise, excellent product.",

Great price too, Buyer be aware it said it would fit bikes from 24-29 inches, my hubby's bike tires are 29\" but the frame is a small, which means it is lower to the ground so the kick stand after install makes the front tire lift off the ground. It is adjustable but you can only go so short. Measure from the ground to where your kick stand attaches to the bike before ordering.",

Also my bike chain just barely drags on the kickstand while riding and it would be very helpful if the manufacturer included the ability to adjust the retract position or provide a shim(s) to correct the problem. If not for these issues I would give this product 5 stars.",

It currently holds my bike upright but the slightest bump will topple it over. I guess that the feet are close to each other is so that they don\u2019t extend too far out when uptight. I still would buy it again if needed. Having a kickstand operable from both sides of the bike is awesome!",
