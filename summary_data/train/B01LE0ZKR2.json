There is a cowl for the PSU and the backplate offers a reasonable amount of space for cable management. The back plate can be pretty tricky to get back on properly which makes me hesitate to get back there to fix a few minor things. Apart from my minor complaints, I'd buy this case again.",

It's pretty much like a one way mirror effect, too. So it's a black box until I turn it on, then all the goodies become visible.

The power supply cover Inc the bottom lights up to show a Corsair logo. There is not exhaust fan but another shouldn\u2019t cost more than $20. Be sure to buy the same fan as the ones included with the case as these only have lighting in the center and do not have the RGB ring around the fan itself.",

The top of the case does not have enough clearance for a radiator if you are using anything other than specific low profile ram. one of the front case fans has an LED that has gone out already and considering the price of these fans it may be a bit before I can replace it. Considering the brand and the price I expected a little more here. The gap at the front is nice for air flow and the color scheme is nice but the lower build quality is already starting to show after such a short time.",

Assembly was quick with simple directions. Though cable management might be a challenge for inexperienced builders. All in all, I totally recommend this case, especially if you can get it $70 off retail price like I did.",
