I wear size 30 jeans and ordered a 34 belt to make sure it was big enough. With my holster and 4 mag pouches added the 34 was just right. I use the Blade-Tech Tek-Lok gear which adds a little bit to the length needed. I wouldn't want to go any smaller. If you run a 3-gun setup you may want to go even larger to accommodate the space the shotgun shell holders take up.",

Set the outter belt up so it connects on your back, it will keep bulk down in the front where you are working and be more comfortable.",

The outer side has Velcro. 2) Outer firm nylon belt that mounts the accessories. Once performed, you overlap the outer nylon belt, aligning it with Velcro, to secure. There is a Velcro strap that serves as a belt buckle but it just keeps the straps secure. This is sturdy and stiff. It fits very well. It is recommended to go one size up from your conventional belt size. I went two sizes larger, and I was still okay. Overall, it's a great system for your holster and magazine carriers.",

There's an inner belt which you wear like a normal belt, and an outer belt that you clip all your equipment onto (holsters, pouches, etc). The outer belt simply sticks to the inner belt via heavy duty velcro. Both the inner and outer belts are firm, and feel great. What looks like a belt buckle in the photo is actually just decorative... you don't have to use it. Sizing is important. I wear a 44 waist, so according to Bladetech, I needed to order a 46 belt. I'm happy to report that Bladetech's advice is right on the money regarding sizing. You have to go up.",

The extra 2-Inch is for the extra space from the inner belt, pouches and holster. If you follow this guideline it will not fail. DO NOT use your pant size.",
