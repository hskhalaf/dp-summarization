      "text": "Living in Minnesota, it's normal to go below -10F a few times during the winter and remain below 32F for weeks in a row. This De-Icer has done an incredible job. I've checked on my koi a few times with a flashlight at night and I still see them slowly swimming. This was much easier than trying to bring them indoors for the winter. My pond can be buried in snow, but this de-icer continues to keep a consistent size open hole in the water and I appreciate the red light on the top so that I can see it's functioning just fine from within my home. I'd highly recommend this product.",

I feel ripped off and I probably have dead fish. I'll let the seller explain that one to my kids. Updated review 1/13/2020 Amazon accepted the return. I got a replacement heater. Going on the 2nd year of use. It continues to work and has been very dependable.",

As I have another device also plugged into this outlet, I have found that to be working properly, but when the pond de-icer is plugged in, the circuit disconnects, so the problem is in the de-icer. The metal part of the underside is somewhat corroded which is surprising after only 2 months use. Perhaps that indicates where the problem is. Contacting Laguna via phone didn't work, so trying email. I can't recommend this unit at this point. $80 for 2 months is not worth it.",

I was expecting to get at least 1 season out of it but it looks like we need to find something different to keep our smaller Koi pond from freezing. It definitely should have lasted more than 2 months in a firly moderate winter we are having. Very disappointed.",
