Of course it is more orange but thats with any bleach. This product is to prep not to color. I have short thick hair and still needed 3 boxes, so definitely order more just in case. The product did not seem to mix well and stayed clumpy for me but that didnt change the outcome. I left it on for 30 mins and my hair is not damaged or too dry.",

Healthier, and it will also last you a lot longer. This is only good for one use. Separately will last you 4-12 bleaches depending on what you're doing and hair length.",

After two rounds with this stuff and then violet toner, my colors are eye wateringly vibrant. Easy to use, comes with a free brush I then used for dyeing.",

Be sure to take the necessary precautions when using this bleach. Rub some Vaseline around the edges of your hair, put on a old shirt and/or towel, gloves, etc. Try not to leave it on TOO long because it will burn your skin. If you happen to then just rub some milk on the area that burns. This'll briefly relieve it. This is a very strong bleach! Be sure to buy argan oil or any other recommended oil to treat your hair! Happy bleaching!",
