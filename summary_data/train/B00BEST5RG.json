      "text": "I absolutely love this tent. I have two tents - one 2p Big Agnes tent that it essentially weightless and is great for intense backpacking (but pricey and super small). However, THIS tent is fantastic if you don't have to hike too long, or are okay carrying around the weight. It's a 3p tent and feels super spacious inside. I love the style/shape, which feels unique and makes me happy. It has a window/door on each side so the cross breeze is also fantastic. I use the tent with the footprint to ensure the tent lasts as long as possible and to keep things as dry as possible. Great purchase - I am very happy.",

Recommend you also get the Extreme 3 floor saver or a comparable tarp for under the floor. All in all, a really nice tent!",
