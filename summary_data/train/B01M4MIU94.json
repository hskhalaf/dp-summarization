The fps went from 30 to 70 and my son said it was the best christmas present ever! It is very small, good for computers with not much space inside, and low power consumption. So good, we bought another for my other sons computer. Would definitely recommend!!",

It easily plays most (but not the really high RAM requirement) modern games at 1080p, 60 FPS at High (some Ultra) settings. It plays all eSport games at Ultra settings at way above 60 FPS. Great card to use if you want to reinvigorate an older small form factor PC.",

With newer title games, of course you won't be able to max out settings, you'll probably get the best performance on Medium settings on all the AAA games. But with less demandiing games like Fortnite, CS:GO, Rocket League etc. you'll be just fine.",
