They fit great and have quality fabric, not the cheap, thin, high shrinkage fabric that other big name brands have switched too recently.

I normally wear a size 16 to18 pant and wear a size 8 in these panties, which is 2-3 sizes less than other brands. These Jockey panties are not tight, they have a gracious fit, fabric covered elastic for comfort and don't shrink that much after washing.",

Some of the newer prints aren't quite as soft and are only printed on the outside. These are tagless now, which I love so they're even more comfortable than before.

Most women in the US know that talc is carcinogenic and will not use it. Not everyone is aware that it is one of the leading causes of ovarian cancer.

Soft and quality made. These will last so I feel the higher price for this brand is worth the extra cost .",

I always wash them before wearing and given that they are 100% cotton they typically shrink up a little so it balanced out fine! Now they fit perfectly! I've been wearing this style and brand of underwear for years! Love these panties! :-D",

The tag should say \"Elance\" but as you can see in the picture, 100% cotton. I will keep because you can always use undies, but will look elsewhere for the correct style.",

This is the first time I've noticed that Jockey markets size 8 as a \"plus size.\" I can live with that, but not with baggy knickers under my yoga pants!
