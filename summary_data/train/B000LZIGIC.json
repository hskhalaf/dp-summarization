      "text": "I came across a box of old negatives (from the 1930s and 40s). They are irregularly shaped and there were lots of them and I wanted a scanner that could not only scan odd shaped negatives, but lots of them. This scanner does an amazing job. The entire scanning bed can be used for negatives (verse just a small portion). A lot of the negative reviews on here are old and outdated. Sicne this scanner came out they have developed drivers and additionalsoftware to ensure it works. I used this on both MAC OSX 10.5 and 10.6. Any complaints? Not really - its bigger and bulkier than most scanners but then again, this is also a negative scanner.",

My suggestion is to read first, then jump in. You will save yourself much lost time. I would buy this unit again.",

Sent unit back as faulty, but ordered another. The next unit had no light leaks, but still poor sensitiviy. Still would only do three or four slides even with updated software. HP tech support claimed that was just the way it worked, and nothing much they could do. Returned this unit, and are sending our slides to Costco to make DVDs.",

You can divide a scan into separate files after one scan. The lid is flexible so that you can place thicker items on the screen. You can actually get a bit more of the document scanned than the specs state. Highly recommend this scanner.

Scan speed unacceptably slow for adequate resolution of medium format positives. Did not live up to specifications and fell far short of expectations, so it was returned immediately. I am very disappointed in this product and it does not seem to live up to usual HP standards.",
