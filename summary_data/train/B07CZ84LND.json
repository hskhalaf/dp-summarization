      "text": "I absolutely love these vertical crib liners!! My little one is quite the mover in his crib when he sleeps. Every time I heard his head smack into the wooden crib rails, I cringed. I didn\u2019t want to use the traditional crib bumpers so I searched online for alternatives and came across these. THESE THINGS ARE AMAZING!! Not only are they made from quality material and provide just enough padding, they look great too! I am so happy I found them! My little one still moves all around his crib, but at least now he\u2019s not smacking his head against wood! Thank you so much for making this product!!!",

It did not make a difference if there was any tension on the zipper as when it\u2019s applied to the crib or if the zipper was tested without tension. I\u2019m very disappointed and returning them right away.",

It doesn't allow me to publish the pic so I add a video",

      "text": "these look nice, however they are about 1 cm too narrow from our crib. We have flat bars on our crib not round ones. If these were just a tad bit bigger it would have made a HUGE difference. My fingers are straight up raw from pulling the zipper so hard. It said you can zip 2 together, but then they are HUGE. So they look okay, but they are a nightmare to put on. It took my husband and I both working together to get them on.",
