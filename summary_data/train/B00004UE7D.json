She said it's the best one she has used in all her years, that the metal beater blades are slimmer than on a traditional beater which allows them to turn swiftly and do a thorough job. She is impressed at how sturdy yet light this egg beater is. If any kitchen product earns Mom's high praise... it must be A+A+A+ !!!",

Our old one had the flat blades while the end that goes into the whip cream on this one is just round metal rods. The end result is that it splatters more and takes longer to whip the same one. It would cost $6 to send it back so it's not worth it. But considering that it also feels very cheaply built I am not confident about it's lifespan. TL;DR: You may want to buy something else if you're going to use this for whip cream.",

Fast rotary Action to easily beat eggs, blend batters, whip cream or egg whites and much more! Hand crank beaters are not fitted to a particular mixing bowl, so you can use in any type of bowl! Includes two heavy-duty stainless steel beaters! Body and gears are polished aluminum. Plastic handle allows for an easy grip. Quick and easy cleanup!\n\nAMAZON.COM\nAn old-fashioned hand beater comes in handy even if a kitchen is equipped with electric beaters and mixers. Sometimes the chore is too small or the need too urgent to bother with electric cords and elaborate cleanup. When those times arrive--beating eggs, blending pancake batter, whipping cream or egg whites--this sturdy tool is just the ticket. Its beaters are heavy-duty, 18/10 stainless steel, so they won't interact with acidic foods. The handle and gear are polished aluminum, and both grips are tough plastic. Dishwasher-safe. --Fred Brack",
