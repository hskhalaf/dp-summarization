The lids fit reasonably well (it's not Tupperware tight, but still pretty good), and the quality of the bowls feels good. Assuming they hold up over the long term, they are a good investment for any kitchen. Update: After 4 months of use the lids have begun to warp. They won't stay on the bowls if put into the refrigerator. The lids have always been hand washed-never in the dishwasher. They fit okay until put into the refrigerator, then they warp because of the cold temperature (38 degrees in our fridge). Short term they were okay, but long term they begin to show the poor quality.",

Now I spent money on more bowls that have no lids. Extremely disappointed",

These bowls have covers, come in 4 sizes, and have a nice non-skid bottom that helps when using them. Even though I really like the bowls I gave them 4 stars not 5 only because sometimes the lids take a little work to get to seal. However, I really like that the lids are inset when on the bowls and that makes them easy to stack in the refrigerator. Good product.",
