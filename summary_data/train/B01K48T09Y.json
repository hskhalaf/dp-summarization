They led us to believe it was a problem on our end, $150 later the election says everything is fine and it is the echo bee. After 4 months of this we give up and have a different brand working just great. It is so hard to just stand behind your product?",

Once grouped, the web interface or the app do not state which thermostat's schedule will be followed, nor does it give an potion to choose the schedule.

The only thing I feel it's missing are settings to adjust the interface/default layout. I'd love different color options or an option to have the weather pop up first. Installation was also a breeze since I already had the C cable run to my old thermostat. Since this is the lite version it doesn't have a couple of options the more expensive ecobee has so make sure you know what you're buying!",
