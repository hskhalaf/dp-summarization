      "text": "This is my first set of lights and are a great beginners set. I am new to photography, but this set ha really helped get the desired lighting in my pictures, even when I have low natural lighting available. The set comes with two umbrellas, with stands and light bulbs, and a shorter light stand and light bulb. The bulbs have their own night case and Styrofoam to keep them safe and the stands and umbrellas also have their own bag. The setup is very easy and it all breaks down just as well and fits nicely into the bag. Such a wonderful lighting setup!",

Its great for beginners to experiment and start studio portrait photography. I have posted an unboxing video for this product which shows you how exactly you will receive this product. It is a strong build, the tripods are metal and are very sturdy. It comes with 3 600w white light CFL bulbs which can fill in the shadows moderately. The light is bright enough to be used in a small studio/room space. Also, please check out my youtube channel (New york elite picture) for a complete review video.",

Then finally, my last stand lasted about 4 sessions before it started to smoke and stopped working. I contacted this companies customer service, and they said there was nothing they could do. They did not apologize nor did they offer to refund or replace my item. ABSOLUTELY AWFUL.",

I tried wiping the stands with soap and water and just letting the gear sit outside of the packaging but it became too much of an issue. I enjoy breathing more than I need cheap lighting. The stands are lightweight which is to be expected for the price. But your really need to have the lights right next to your subject.",

I used it to conduct video interviews for a documentary, and the video turned out very good. The bulbs are not very bright, so you may need to supplement in certain environments to avoid shadows. Strangely, there are three bulbs and holders, but only two umbrellas. Note that the whole kit breaks down and fits in a single provided duffel, except for the compact florescent bulbs which have their own container. This is not pro gear. But for the occasional shoot for indoor situations, recommended.",

I attempted to place these lights in multiple positions - facing me, on my side and nothing worked. The bright diffused light was bothersome. The unit did exactly what it said - the light on the face was fantastic. However for one plus hour calls it ended up giving me a Severe headache",

Your company took great care in packa ging the items separately. I would definitely recommend purchasing this equipment for most photography & video projects. I wish it would have come with the stand for the backdrop, but it was my fault I didn't click every photo and read carefully. Therefore I had to go in & purchase the stand. So, if you're reading this make sure you know the stand for the backdrop isn't included. You will need this, in my opinion. Again, it's not the company's fault, I should have read clearly,",

With the umbrellas out they are pretty big and I knocked it a little tipping it over and broke one of my bulbs :( it was my fault but if the stand was sturdier I don't think it would have tipped over.",

You kind of just have to deal with what you get here. However, it's exactly how I pictured it. remember, these stands aren't strong enough for outdoor stuff. They're very weak. For sturdy stands you'll need to drop 3X what this whole kit costs. Worth it for the bulbs and light sockets alone though.",

A friend had this set and I immediately sold my other one and bought this. I love it and recommend it to all of my photography students (I teach iPhone Photography and Instagram Strategy Classes). It is such a great set if you are trying to take high-quality product or lifestyle photos in your home for your business or blog! Grab yourself 3 pieces of white foamboard and you're set.",

I am still using it with great enthusiasm, with a couple of add-ons for better results. l appreciate the stands-they have standard 1/4\" screws at the very top for most photo accessories. The umbrellas do make a nice soft glow and overall the equipment is sturdy. 5.2015: One of the bulbs included is acting odd with turning itself on and off. (The switches and such are fine.) This bulb still works with nudging in the socket. CONCLUSION, 7/2016: If the quality has stayed relatively stable for this product, I urge ALL amateurs to purchase this for very rudimentary portrait work or still life photos.",
