Received a reply from the seller- the Seller asked me to crawl up inside the hood to photograph silver labels inside the hood and then take a photo of the whole product. I did so and then was told they no longer make the product but I could purchase some other product to replace it from someone else. What the heck is that? Dissatisfied.",

It doesn't keep correct time, it creeps forward a few minutes each day. When the touch pass controller did work, it made a very loud beep noise every time you touched a button. Not just loud, obnoxiously loud so everyone in the house and back yard can hear it. This is priced this low for a reason, if you never plan on using it and don't mind the incorrect time displayed on the bright led display it's a good show piece, nothing more. Two years later, doesn't work at all",

We do a lot of steamed cooking and I think that is causing the electronics in the switch to fail. The pc board is inside a plastic box and I don't think it is well enough protected. I do like the hood, installation was simple. Yea great customer service, replacement part being shipped tomorrow. Any suggestions on how to prevent steam from getting into the components is appreciated.",
