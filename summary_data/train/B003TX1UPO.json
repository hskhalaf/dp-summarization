So very glad that I bought the Evolution!!! Like a knife cutting butter, I have cut through tube-steel, 1/4 inch bar, 2-inch angle iron, 3/4 inch rebar, and copper tubing with no problems whatsoever!! The design of the quick-detach or tighten vise works very well. Good luck to you guys. You have my highest recommendation.",

      "text": "This saw is fantastic for cutting steel. I made approximately 40 cuts on some 1/4\" wall, 2\" X 2\" steel tube and it made fast straight and angled cuts that were almost burr-free. This is so much faster than my horizontal metal cutting band saw. The blade is still cutting like it did for my first cut. My only negative is changing the back stop to cut angles. The angle guide gets you close. I have to bring the blade down to set an accurate angle with a protractor; then it's hard to see and it's cramped, but I eventually get it, so it's a minor inconvenience considering the time saved by the speed of the cuts.",

The vise is much better than my abrasive cut off saw but I would have paid more for one with a vice that securely locked into preset detents, at least for ninety degree cut-offs. No reason to think this will not be a durable product but at this time I only have about 50 cuts, the thickest in 3X3 1/4\" angle iron it cuts like butter. Make sure you make first contact with the steel very slowly then add pressure. Very happy with this purchase.",

I used to do this with an angle grinder and in addition to being a mess, the cuts were never straight or clean. I would suggest purchasing ear plugs or a low cost set of ear muffs maybe like these ( as it is loud when cutting and not good for the ears.

Gap will be at the top by 1mm (in my case) with a 3 inch square. Luckily, 4 bolts hold the saw to the base. I loosened those bolts and shimmed the right side with a 0.63mm shim (.025 inch). I didn't bother putting holes in it and running the bolts through... since the extra thickness of the mount is exactly the width of a feeler gauge. Hope this helps with anyone trying to wrestle with the saw, and at least it's a starting point to accurately shim.",

Not sure what happened, whether I hit a hard place in a piece of steel or what, but I was unable to make many more cuts before having to go back to abrasive cutoff saw. Like I said, no problem with saw but this is not cost effective at the price of the blades and the amount of cuts that I made with it. Good luck!",
