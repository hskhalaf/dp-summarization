Idle drops into the 30C range. You'll definitely want to enter your BIOS and modify how fast the air intake fan runs based on your CPU temps. Test how hot your CPU gets (not your CPU core temperatures), and set your fan to run at 100% power when your CPU reaches that temperature. For example, my processor roughly tops out at 55C, so I set my fan to run at 100% power when it reaches that point to keep my core temperatures down by an extra few Celsius.",

This model installs so much easier than the H55. A back plate is installed using four stand offs, the pump is set atop the CPU and four knurled knobs hold the pump to the backplate. A little care, and even a gorilla fingered hobbyist like me can install this without bending any radiator fins. This is my second build using the H60. Very happy.",
