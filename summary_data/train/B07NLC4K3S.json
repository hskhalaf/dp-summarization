But you do notice the quality difference between these and more expensive Nike trainers if you try to run more than 5km at once in them. The cushioning wouldnt be as high quality. Also, the soles take wear more quickly than more expensive Nike, some of the black grip is already starting to peel away from the white sole after 6 weeks of wear. I got these for GBP35 so for that price I'm happy, but probably wouldnt pay more for this model.",

Later I slipped on an old, manky pair of Nike Challengers from 10 years ago and found those to be a much softer and lighter shoe. I don't like the feeling of the Revolution 5 at all.. Very chunky material and too rigid. They're not like I thought they would be at all.",
