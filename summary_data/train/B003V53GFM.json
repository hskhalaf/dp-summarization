However, I'm puzzled as to why it's called a Tundra 65. I mistakenly assumed the 65 in the model name referred to its capacity. That's fairly standard for coolers and there is nothing in the description to indicate otherwise. However, its capacity is actually only 52 quarts. Also, I'm surprised the lid will not remain open unless held in the open position which will make it difficult to remove items.",
