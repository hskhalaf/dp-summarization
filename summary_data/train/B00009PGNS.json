This TE cooler one is of right size and a narrow width that fits perfectly between front & back seats of even a compact car. The operation is simplicity itself. I only used it as a cooler, and found that travelling on a hot day, advertised 40 deg maintenance was not really possible. So great for cooling drinks, etc., but not so much for keeping refrigerating food, e.g., milk. In the latter case, suggest supplementing with ice or cold slabs. You will also want the A/C adapter that is sold separately, so you can leave contents in and run this when at a hotel.",

The insulation was sufficient to keep everything cool for a few hours while off. We pulled it into our motel room each evening and used a 110AC adapter to keep it running - only a steady, low fan hum which was drowned out by most motel's AC/heat systems.

Motel rooms are noisy anyway, so no big deal. we definitely love it and highly recommend it to anyone traveling using motels or friends and relatives to keep it cold while the car is off.",

One of the protruding appendages on my cooler is misshaped and fails to hold, so the door tends to lift off my cooler when opened. The cooler still cools, but the words \"cheap piece of sh...plastic\" flash across my cortex whenever this happens. Still, I guess it's good enough.",

      "text": "Use mine for two weekend excursion and very please with the performance. Plugged it in using the multi-purpose adapter the night before loading the unit with drinks and food. Plugged it in the DC outlet in the car and the Koolatron worked perfectly. Used it on the hotel room and it worked better than the mini-frig in the hotel room. Why the 110AC to 12volt DC adapter is optional doesn't make good sense.",

I did purchase it with an electric outlet connector so we could keep it running at the hotel as well. It fits perfect under the child seat behind the driver's seat in a VW Passat, and it is not so loud that it keeps anyone up during the night when it is running. Highly recommended.",

We mounted the Kooler in the space behind the driver's seat in our 2011 Ford Escape where it could plug into the center console. There is plenty of cord length to have reached into the dashboard receptical if it was necessary. We look forward to many years of use.",

I don't unplug it unless I'm not running my car/truck for many hours. Brought it into the motel/house overnight to plug in. Even when not running it keeps my food cold for several hours. I did plug it in to get cold before loading--took only 1 1/2 hrs to get cold. The handle is recessed so it's easy to remove if the front seat is back against the cooler.Love not having to deal with melting ice!",

Its a bit inconvenient to have to reach to the back seat to unplug it or change it from cool to heat or vice versa. A relatively simple addition of a switch would make the product nearly perfect.",
