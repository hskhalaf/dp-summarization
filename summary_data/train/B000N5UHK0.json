I got tired of lugging around my old Craftsman 33 gallon air compressor for small jobs and I needed something that's more easily portable. This Porter Cable Pancake Air Compressor fits my needs, works very well and is much easier to carry. It is still somewhat noisy, but it does maintain good air pressure, which is not bad for a 100 Dollar air compressor. It arrived in excellent condition and on time. I am very pleased with my purchase.",

Make sure you hold your compressor on an angle to drain any water build up each time you are done using it. You don't want any rust to form inside your tank and cause it to burst later on because of misuse. This tank builds up pressure quickly and doesn't need to run for very long to keep constant pressure. I use this for 3 main purposes, a 3\" framing nailer, a 2\" finish nailer and for blowing dust and dirt out of various items. I highly recommend this air compressor.",

Today, I looked back at the product on Amazon and found they removed the picture of the kit and added an option button to purchase WITH the kit. Now I have to buy a kit but won't be buying from Porter Cable! So the product is now $99.99 WITHOUT the required kit. Not happy!",

      "text": "Great value for the price. It takes about 2 minutes to reach 110psi from an empty tank. Depending on what you used it for, but it had allowed me to complete framing a 2000 sqft basement using it primarily for a pneumatic nail gun shooting 3inch nail without the nagging wait between shots, shooting texture on sheet rock, all trim works, and finally, painting. And now it's a perfect tool to have around the house for a variety of jobs. Strongly recommended!! Get the Ampro A1460 18 piece air tool accessory kit too while you are at it. Perfect match between them.",

It's probably paid for itself with the savings of not having to replace my purifier filters alone). I have no air tools so can't speak to it for that (though I imagine it's fine if your fine with it running a lot). I'd recommend getting a moisture filter if you need super dry air though as at least here in SoCal it condenses moisture.",

Filling tires and using compressed air to blow dust is all I've used it for, but it pressurizes rapidly and doesn't seem to need to run often to maintain pressure. I followed the break-in procedure described in other reviews posted here, so it is my hope that the product will provide years of trouble free service.",
