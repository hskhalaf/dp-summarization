      "text": "Synopsis and full disclosure: I've not purchased the tri-hone version, only this two-sided hand-held version. This is a good sharpener and I like it, but it's best suited for light touch-up in the field. When concealed in the handle, the sharpener has a tight fit. However when the sharpening stones are exposed, the interlocking handle has some lateral play. The slight play throws me off enough that I have a slightly uneven edge between the two sides. Typically, I perform bench-top sharpening on a fixed stone and my edges are even/straight. Because of this, I believe I would have been better off spending extra for the tri-hone.",

Unfortunately, since a handle is the interface to a device like this, a broken handle means the devices usability is greatly reduced. That is why I had to rate this so low.

It puts a great edge on a knife and is very handy to use around the house or in your hunting kit. I've used several of Smith's sharpeners in the past and this is one of their best.",
