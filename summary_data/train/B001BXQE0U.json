I spent the weekend after my camping trip drilling holes into the cooler and filling the lid with spray foam. Shame on you Coleman, your name on a product used to mean something...",

The ice stayed frozen 2 days and when the ice melted, the water stayed cold two additional days. The cooler has nice, rotatable handles and a little plug to let water out easily without having to take anything out of the cooler. I highly suggest this for camping trips, road trips, or any trip!",

Plug was easy to remove to install 1/2 stainless steel valve and bazooka screen. So far I have used it to brew three all grain batches and it has held the temperature well. As other reviewers have noted, the hinges are kind of flimsy. I removed them to make it easier to add grain and sparge water and simply place the lid on the cooler while mashing.",

Have to be careful how far back you open the lid because this stresses those plastic \"hinges\" and it looks like you could easily break them if you push it very far up and back. But as I said, it works fine considering how inexpensive it was.",
