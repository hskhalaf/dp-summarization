I've played my xbox one x on it for a number of hours and there doesnt appear to be any motion lag or ghosting, games do look incredible in 4k. The only boxset I've watched so far is Planet Earth 2 in 4k HDR and it looks out of this world. Decent brightness, no lagging, colours are incredible. So far I'm very impressed with the TV. However they do upsell their speakers a bit, audiophiles might want a soundbar",

This appliance is beautifully designed- it\u2019s body is only about 10mm (less than 1/2\u201d) thick for about half the tv and would grace any surrounding environment or decor. Easy set up and tuned itself within a few seconds. Large, well appointed remote is genuinely \u201cidiot-proof\u201d. Enough said. Delighted!",

Firmware updated very recently, and from previous experience with hisense gives me confidence that this will be kept up with this set. Sound is reasonable, has additional optical audio for surround sound. It is a 2 person lift though. It's expectedly heavy - the screen is generally slim, with the lowest 20% including the main electronics being thicker. Bezel reasonably thin. I love this set.",
