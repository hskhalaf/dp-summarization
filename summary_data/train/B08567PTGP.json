      "text": "I love my Shark steam mop, cleans both my wooden floors and my tiled floors brilliantly with different levels of heat and steam for the different surfaces. Brings a gorgeous shine to the wooden floors as I sometimes found a traditional mop and bucket would leave streaks on the floor this doesn't. Love it highly recommend and very reasonably priced. Very easy to use, nice and sturdy not at all flimsy and comes with 2 mop clothes which can be thrown in the washing machine",

I bought a couple of spare pads as we have a dog and floor constantly needs cleaning especially in dirty weather.",
