It\u2019s iconic black-and-white design and fold-over tongue caught the eye of old-school players. It is innovative, comfortable, and durable enough for goalkeepers, wingers, and defensive-minded players. If you are someone who wants value for your money, then the Puma King Top di Firm Ground might just be the right soccer cleat for you.",

      "text": "These are my second pair of Puma Kings which suggests that I like them, which I do. I have always preferred the older style/classic fit of football boots from years gone by as opposed to the lightweight/streamline football boots used nowadays. They aren't the lightest but perform admirably on grass pitches and easily see out a season of steady football. My only problem is I always use an ankle brace when playing and in doing so has damaged the inside of the boot lining, but that is too be expected as they are not designed with wearing an ankle brace in mind. Would recommend for those who prefer a classic fit football boot.",

May be worth going up half a size to be sure. Design and manufacture wise I can't fault them otherwise. They've had some hard use, but clean up well (no irritating mud in the stitching), and the stitching is still intact. A good purchase, shame they haven't given and rub on the heel. Were this not the case, definitely a 5* purchase.",

Very disappointed, expected them to last a lot longer than a year for this price.",
