They weren't the BEST gift, but there was always one or 2 people who liked spicy foods and wanted it. It was good for the price range. Speaking of, immediately after, I found similar items at Walmart for half the price. DARN. One of the people that took it home said he liked it, but it wasn't super spicy. It was still fun for his group of friends to try and compare though. Would I buy it again? Sure, if I had a friend who liked hot sauce and trying new things. Not something I'd buy and keep around the house regularly.",

It send he knew the sauce, as he'd seen it featured on a TV program somewhere. I checked in with him last week and he'd had a chance to use one of the sauces on some wings. Needless to say, he was thrilled and overjoyed in a way only a crazy hot sauce lover can be! I'm totally grateful to you guys for putting this set together and at such a great price. You made the giver and the receiver both very happy!!",

It's been a lot of fun. The Zombie sauces are probably going to be a permanent addition to our home pantry.",

Requires a fair bit of dumping out onto your food to get an adequate taste. Garlic: The added garlic rounds the flavor nicely, I'm a big fan of garlic. Unfortunately it is the same base as above, which requires more than a dash to get the flavor. Needs to coat the food. Lagniappe: Base sauce plus a sweet barbeque sauce \"The Antidote\" - extra spicy: Spicier, but also smells sweeter. Does not end up tasting twice as spicy, more like 50% spicier.",

The flavors are unique enough to give these sauces characteristic flair while not being too strange to scare away regular hot sauce users. I normally prefer regular red, cayenne pepper sauce but this product adds a good flavor which I would reach for again. The name is unique and the background story is excellent albeit somewhat brief. Think somewhere between Franks and Tabasco with a mild flavor boost. Not real hot.",

      "text": "This is without a doubt, the most flavorful, delicious hot sauce I've ever had in my life. I've gotten my daughter and her fiance eating it or cooking with it every night, and as for me, I put it on practically everything. I have to admit, when I sent the first variety 4 pack to my daughter as a gift, I selected it because of the name and her annual \"zombie pub crawl\" at Halloween. But this has become Numero Uno for all of us now: IT'S JUST THAT FREAKING GOOD, even if you're not a Zombie!!!",

My favorite is the thick lagniappe style - very mild but sooo flavorful. The garlic infused sauce was great on home made Indian food. Not hugely hot but lots of flavor. Also fun packaging and a good time to taste each one.",

The garlic sauce is great on eggs and chicken; it has the classic vinegar spiciness that is common in Louisiana style sauces with just a hint of garlic. The Lagniappe sauce is actually my personal favorite; this one is loaded with flavors and has been awesome on everything I have put it on. I would definitely recommend set to anyone who wants to try some hot sauces that add a little spiciness from variations of classic Louisiana hot sauces.",

      "text": "Didn't know what to purchase my son-in-law for Christmas and then I found the Cajun Hot Sauce Gift Basket while browsing. People in Louisiana use a lot of hot sauce so I thought this would be perfect, and it was. He likes all the flavors but the garlic especially. I do not care for hot sauce, being from the north, but I am tempted to try it myself. This was the perfect gift.",
