I later ended up selling that K70 due to workplace change. The K95 had speed switches and they were just too shallow and easy to press. I had too many fat-finger incidents and my typing was hampered. I like the brown switches more than the reds. They can be a little loud but I am fine with that. They are pleasure to type on. To any one considering the K95 or speed switches, please get this instead. It smashes the speed switches both in feeling and functionality.",

Cut my errors at least in half because of them, very satisfying keystrokes, and the design is phenomenal. Only had this for a day but I know it will be very easy to clean, no recesses that will trap particles, hair or dust. Some people complain about the wrist rest, I think its great but that might vary based on your desk, posture and personal preference.",

Maybe I'm being paranoid but I'd probably just get another K95 Platinum if I had the chance.

Anyhow minus one star since the letters on the keys have started to scratch off, just replaced the a s d and w keys that came as extras with the keyboard, but still need to replaced the O L M and N keys, i may have to contact Corsair to get those if its possilble at all, so for now down to 4 stars",

      "text": "Just received this keyboard as a replacement for my old razer blackwidow and I regret not picking this up sooner. The keys feel very precise and work well for both gaming and word processing. The media buttons are surprisingly useful, and the volume scroll wheel is a fantastic feature. I highly recommend this keyboard to anyone looking for something that is good at everything and does not need or want the RGB lighting.",
