IMO I think they are heavy duty and will last me a very long time. Update: Its been almost a year since I got these and they are still holding up very well. I even found a new use for them, as safety straps during bench press. I just take the rings off, sling them over the pull up bar on my rack and put my barbell through them. They have saved me from 225 lb falling on my neck!",

That is certainly true, but the texture is really sharp. I actually knocked it down with a little sandpaper and now my wife can also use these. The texture is fantastic for creating callouses, but pretty tough until you have your hands built up. Straps were super long, which is helpful if you want to hang from a really high ceiling.",

The original straps did the job for many years but then started to slowly come undone as I exercised. After reading the good reviews, I decided to give these a try. What I immediately noticed was these straps were wider than my original straps. This gives the straps a more secure feel. The buckle cam is of very good quality making the straps easy to adjust. I have not noticed any strap slippage when I am exercising. I do expect these straps to last many years without a problem.",

I do weighted chinups with rings so I'm putting a LOT of strain on the buckle, and I can confidently say after using these for a few weeks they are stable as you could ever need rings to be. I've gone upside down, done 70lb weighted chinups (BW is ~165lbs) and have not noticed a single bit of movement in the straps. Bodybuilders looking for a strap to do weighted ring chinups with, look no further. Get these. They'll last a life time and are cheap.",

This strap is made for those individuals who show up to train, not talk. With a weight limit of over 550 pounds, they are as hardcore as your workouts. \n\nFrom the Muscle Up to the Front Level, there are no exercises this ring set cannot handle. \n\n\n\n- Heavy duty solid abs rings \u2013 FIG spec for comfortable grip \n- Straps and buckles included - Hook up in seconds \n- Diameter: 9\" \n- Inside diameter: 6.75\" \n- Ring thickness: 1.11\" \n- Strap length: 15ft \n- Strap Width: 1.5\" \n- Weight: 4 lbs \n- Capacity: 550 lbs",
