This is a good product that should be used with care, caution and common sense.",

Some people end up dumping hundreds of dollars into this gun because it's such a great platform for customizing, but I've already solved the trigger pull issue for free by filing off a few rough spots and polishing with a Dremel tool. I'll probably add a steel breech and a red dot sight for about $75 total, and then it will be as perfect as I want it to be. At least for now....",

Accurate (put every pellet into a tennis ball sized group at roughly 50'), has zero kick - I mean none, fairly quiet (not much louder than my Gamo Whisper rifle), and most importantly - it fits my big left hand. It almost seems designed for south paws; can pop open the pump, check the chamber, set/release the safety all with my thumb and/or forefinger without releasing my grip on the weapon.

This is a very tight, very accurate pistol, and surprisingly easy to pump. I immediately added the carbine stock. Love it. This will sit proudly with my old 760 Pumpmaster and Sheridan.",
