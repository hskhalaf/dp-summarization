One of the main screws that postions the headrest up or down will not tighten. Not sure if it's the threads or what but it is a main component as without this piece secure, the clients head is not properly positioned. Going to contact the company for a replacement or I'm sending it back, as you cannot use it this way. Sad as it's super amazing in every other way!!!",

It has held up well and clients have found it comfortable. It was easy to set up and adjust. Th lightweight of the chair is a huge plus. The bag seems sturdy enough. I am sure I will continue to get use out of this chair over the next several years.",

I almost lost one the last time I pulled the chair out of it's carrying case. Other than that... this is perfect.

If this could be improved upon, I would rate it 5 star and recommend as an alternative to renting a vitrectomy chair for recovery from macular hole surgery.
