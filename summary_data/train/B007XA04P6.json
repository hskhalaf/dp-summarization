You need to put extra padding to be able to handle the deep pressure. I enjoyed the chair anyway and now after a few years it is not working. BTW it never had heat like it says it does. I have contacted the company a week ago and they have not returned a response. I now have a 300 pound chair in my living room that does not work and I am so disappointed that for the money I spent the company can't even respond???",

The chair itself is a gamble, theirs (parents) works well, ours never worked 100% correctly. I would look into other options if possible.",

My ONLY complaint is that the instruction manual is kind of hard to follow, as it wasn't written in very good English.
