      "text": "This is a really solid 2-in-1, a joy to use, but ASUS decision to tether the keyboard to the tablet exclusively with Bluetooth keeps me from giving it 5-stars. The keyboard and tablet physically dock together, but ASUS doesn't take any advantage of this fact. At the very least, the keyboard should charge from the tablet without needing a separate cable, but it would be even better if the keyboard acted like physically attached keyboard and USB hub when docked--and gave access to at least one full-sized USB-A port. I simply don't understand this design decision in an otherwise excellent device.",

Then a micro usb runs from the right side of the tablet around to the left side of the keyboard. It makes an otherwise slick machine look a little cluttered.
