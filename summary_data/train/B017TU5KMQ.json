The one I tried from iKross (they make several) was good for phones, but the ledge was too small for even small tablets. Pretty soon, I'll be able to write a book on these things. ;-)",

To my surprise, it actually works quite well - both for phone and tablet. We've used it for kid Zoom sessions and watching movies. I wouldn't trust it for something interactive like online schooling in which you'd need to repeatedly tap on the device, but for ordinary watching / video chats, it works great.",

For example if you are getting glare on your screen you can easily change the angle to prevent glare. It doesn't slide but seems like it would stay still in most places.

It should have been advertised for just the phones and not the tablets, as it is a little less stable on the larger platforms, especially when you consider they are touch screens and we are touching them all the time. It does the job of being a vertical (portrait) stand for iPad. The case we had already gave us a horizontal (landscape) stand. For reading books in single page mode, it made more sense to get a portrait stand. The price was right and it was delivered on time. Perhaps they should consider making a slightly larger, more stable, version for iPad and other tablets.",
