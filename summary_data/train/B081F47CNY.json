I also like that the hub for the RGB headers doesn\u2019t need SATA power like other hubs I\u2019ve installed before in computers. The lights look great as well, and all of the effects worked flawlessly with RGB Fusion. I am using the fans for exhaust and the airflow inside my case is really nice with these installed. I would definitely recommend these for anyone trying to add more RGB into their setup while also looking for an affordable cooling solution.",

Needless to say I was able to improvise to get everything wired up and working properly. I'm deducting a star for the non standard ARGB connectors.

The only real downside (though it's entirely unavoidable, so no real issue with these fans in particular) is that two cables per fan (RGB + power) starts to add up in a hurry, so you'll need a good place to cable manage.",

This issue went away once you get the cables locked down, but it was a bit of a pain to get it in the right position and having the pins contacted properly to power the fan. Once installed, I haven't had any issues yet. Update: The LEDs on one of the fans kind of just died out.",

Not the worst set of instructions I've gotten though that's for sure. For the price, though, I'm pretty happy. My PC temps have definitely went down, at least when idle, and I chalk that up to the new fans. I have replaced all of my old case fans with these, and it made a noticeable difference.",

I highly recommend these fans for anyone on a budget, wants RGB & Quality!!!",

It only supports 3 fans, there is no possible way to daisy chain them together without having to buy a seperate rgb hub. The 5-1 comes with a hub that supports up to 8 fans. Better off getting that and maybe a 3 pack or a single fan depending on how many today rgb headers you need. If you only need 3 fans then this would be fine",
