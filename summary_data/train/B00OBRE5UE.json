I finally went online and found the version of migration software that ships with the SSD is older and does not work with Windows 10. If you go to  you can grab the latest version and BOOM! Everything worked perfectly after that. The performance improvement is incredible. Well worth the effort.",

The free \"Magician\" software that comes with the drive supposedly boosts drive speed astronomically, but I haven't really used the computer for heavy demands, like gaming or video editing, to see much of a benefit with that software. I'm sure in a higher-end computer this SSD will really shine. It was extremely easy to clone my HDD and install the SSD. And Samsung is a quality brand.",

Get a couple differently sized Samsung drives over the years and you won't know which is which unless you've labeled them manually or taken the time to unscrew everything and verify. Doesn't seem like it would be all that difficult for them to correct either.",

It is on the CD, it is not the very limited instructions that are provided in the box. Make sure that the source disk is in good condition. Cloning does not fix drive problems! In addition make sure that you have at least 10% of the capacity of your source disk free. If you don't the cloning process will, most likely, not be successful.",

Loads much faster than the internal hard drive and still runs great years later even though it's constantly near full capacity. The only issue I've come across is that if you're installing a new game to it while playing another game off of it, the hard drive will disconnect and the game you're playing will crash. I assume it's from issues with - or the inability to - read and write at the same time. A workaround is to just install to the hard drive first, then moving to the solid state from there takes very little time.",

The drive was purchased in 2016 to update an aging DELL and after its system board finally died I transferred the drive to a newer HP and it is still going strong. Great upgrade for any magnetic disc machine (if you still have one) and the longevity is pretty awesome. Installation into both machines was seamless and improved the performance of both units by a factor of 4 to 8. A good deal in any case if you want to give a few more years to an old favorite piece of hardware.",

      "text": "I've bought 2 of these. Installed one on my mid-2009 MacBook that was at 90% capacity on the 160 GB HDD, and it's like I have a brand new computer! Everything runs super fast and now I have plenty space for photos & videos. I use Parallels to run Windows so I can use Quicken Premier (Quicken for Mac just doesn't have the functionality) and I have no issues using Quicken and multiple iOS applications simultaneously. I installed the other SSD on my wife 2012 MBP (also upgraded the RAM from 4 GB to 8 GB), and its performance has improved significantly as well.",
