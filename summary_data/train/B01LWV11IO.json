The best thing about this camera is the digital screen and the option to print or not print the pictures. I didn't want a camera that printed every time the button was clicked.

A search online for a battery turned up nothing. We took it to a battery specialty store and they can't find one either. For the price of this camera, this is unacceptable. I left a message at the number Amazon listed for replacement parts, and if resolved I will update this. But for now...do not waste your money on this.",

It does take 30 seconds or so to print the picture which is why having the option to print later is great!",
