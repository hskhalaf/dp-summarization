On my new one (replacement), the optical sensor quit working after about 3 days.... WOW!!! My previous vivoactive worked for over 2 years and two of these have had infant mortality issues... NOT what i've come to expect from Garmin. Spend your money on something else is my opinion.",

Things that don\u2019t work, or don\u2019t work reliably: Step tracking- apparently I took 100 steps sitting still in my chair. Heart rate tracking - I promise my resting heart rate is not 45 beats per minute. Less then half of each day even has heart rate data. Sleep tracking - Apparently I haven't slept in days. Stair tracking - 15 flights of stairs, counted as 9. Stairs are 12 feet tall, so not a short stairway problem. This device is terrible. I am returning it.",

The heart rate is good and maybe the shape is not as great, but the whole thing is so much better - responsive to touch, functions much more accessible, comfortable, reasonably attractive and seems to be very sturdy. Battery life at 5 days is a little less but still better than most alternatives and connection to bluetooth has been flawless.

No issues connecting to her bluetooth headphones, definitely more accurate than her FitBit watch was on tracking distance, and it holds a charge pretty well.

This watch has all of these things. It makes trying to get in shape both fun and portable.",

I asked Garmin why this is the case and they have no answer - almost like their product team didn't realize that people sometimes walk on a golf course. The whole point of the watch is a moderately accurate representation of activity so this is a big gap.",

This watch (and the aftershokz trek headphones) make running a breeze. The initial set up is super easy, the interface is extremely accessible, and going from leisure to working out just takes a press of one button. The battery charges relatively quickly and lasts for a good couple of days (depending how you use it).",
