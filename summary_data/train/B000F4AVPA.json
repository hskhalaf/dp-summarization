The bounce is something that entices them to try to jump and capture it in the air. It\u2019s a worthwhile addition to their toy box.",

Just prior to this one I had tried a very solid ball, thinking it would last a long time and keep her entertained. I was wrong. Because it had very little give, it didn't evoke that predatory instinct and she quickly lost interest. This one, however, she absolutely loves. I've had it a couple of months now and she only just managed to put a rip in it. That's with constant use every day. Soon I'll break out the second one and order new ones. Excellent value for money. :)",

It still bounces good and we have lots of play left in it. It's actually been a couple MONTHS! None of her other balls have lasted more than a week. Great job Chuckit brand and to whoever's involved in this particular creation!! Only downside is my fault, I bought the medium size because it was on sale, unfortunately it just fits under the furniture. So I'll be buying it again in the bigger size :)",

Dogs can only see shades of blue and yellow, so orange and green are the same shade of grey to them. The blue they can see, and the orange WE people can see! The rubber these balls are made of are better than the fuzzy tennis ball that the Chuckit came with. That ball got gross, fast. These balls you can rise off and dry. Nice!",
