      "text": "This thing is very spacious and easy to build in. It also maintains a great flow of air through the main chamber, and the stock fans have little white lights, which are nice and basic. There is also room for a 120mm-240mm water cooler radiator on the roof, to help keep your PC cooled off if you are overclocking like I am. Also the back compartment makes it easy to keep your wires tidy, allowing for better cooling efficiency and an overall nicer look inside the case. My only problem is with the delivery, it seems that a small corner in the bottom was damaged, but it is no big deal for me.",

I bought a new 140mm LED fan to replace the non-led one. Overall, great box to use when wanting to showcase your hardware.",

Just use the port located on your motherboard if you want to use analog headphones/headset. Its really not that big of a deal and you might not even have this problem with yours if you so chose.",

Like other buyers yes I do wish it came with a filter for the bottom of the case instead of leaving it open.

Additionally the case is ULTRA-quiet. Really, I couldn't be more pleased. If your desk has the real estate space for a wider than average case, I totally recommend this one. She's a keeper!",

Cable management is much easier because the back panel is deep enough to hide the worst cable management. The white LED fans in the front are a nice touch. CONS: The plastic trim parts are a bit flimsy and breakable. The front panel is clear acrylic and therefore more flexy than ideal. My first case was crushed like a forklift ran into it, but the RMA was easy and fast. Only 2 x 3.5\" HDD bays (but 6 SDD). MidTower design is a little cramped if you are used to Full Towers, but the added width makes up for it.",

I still think there should be some sort of fan on the power supply side to pull hot air out that builds up behind there from the drives and the psu and everything else.",

The dust filter for the fans on the front is amazing as well as the additional slots for more fans located at the top of the case. Even though this case is fairly large, it is definitely worth it if you're looking for a case that provides excellent cable management, airflow, and overall easy installation of parts.",

I'd recommend this case for anyone who still needs an optical drive, but doesn't want to an overly large case taking up a lot of desk/floor space.",

The whole case besides the PSU panel is made of plastic but it's not one of those cheaply made plastics either.
