So far, I\u2019ve already dried some veggies to store for a rainy day. AND I made a large batch of homemade jerky, which if purchased would have cost mot than this dehydrator. Other that the electricity to run it, from here one out, dehydrating is at no cost. Best of all, I have food for travel, hiking and emergencies available.",

I think it was well worth the money. I just want to say the fan or drying part is a little loud, but I put mine in the garage on top of my clothes dryer perfectly. I would recommend this Presto Dehydrator to anyone who asks. Very Very Happy!",
