I\u2019d return but this was a gift from \u2018Santa\u2019 and my 7 year old doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s been jipped however I feel differently now having to run out and purchase items that should have already been included to make these things have a purpose. Are \u2018ALEX toys\u2019 used??? I won\u2019t purchase again from this seller unless they do the right thing.",

      "title": "Fun inexpensive craft",
      "text": "Fun for all ages - both me and my 11 y.o. had fun with this. For less than five dollars (Amazon sale price), this kit is an awesome value, as there are at least 20 different shapes included, as well as the colored pencils, pipe cleaners, and magnents. And unlike traditional shrinky dinks, these are pre-cut shapes (sooo helpful), and the holes for pipe cleaners and such are also pre-cut. We shrank them in the toaster oven, but you can also use a traditional oven. Would buy again for gift giving.",
