There were good reviews on this site that helped me make my choice so I'm adding another hoping it will help someone else. I got extended financing which helped too. The delivery team was professional and congenial and they had to take it into the basement, which wasn't easy. It arrived right on time and the install was a breeze.",

You have to wash the washer to clean it all out, and make the laundry smell fresh again. They sell special detergents for just such a thing, but this washer has a little tray you slide out, fill with regular household bleach, then set the machine to auto clean. (I don't think youd want to leave any clothes in the washer while it's running its auto clean cycle) But, no special trip to the store required. Would buy again, and wouldn't hesitate to reccomend this washer to friends or family.",

    "description": "The Kenmore Elite 5.2 Cubic Foot Front-Load Washer is designed to tackle your toughest loads. Take on large loads of clothing, bulky sheets and towels, and even oversized comforters and bedding.\n\nThis tough washing machine features Steam Treat, which helps eliminate the need to pre-treat stains. It uses steam for a deep clean to tackle common stains. If you have little ones, the Kids Wear Cycle will be your new best friend. Optional cycle scrubs set-in stains and runs the load through second rinse cycle to ensure clothes are clean and clear of dirt, detergents, and tough stains. No more pre-treating, scrubbing, or overnight soaking to get your clothes looking like new again.\n\nFeatures Smart Motion Technology to get your clothes clean while still treating fabrics with the care they need. This advanced technology blends up to 6 wash motions for customized care of every fabric type. Give your clothes some TLC with 9 custom cycles, 5 soil levels, 5 water temperatures, and 5 spin speed options. The NSF-certified Sanitize cycle kills up to 99.9% of certain household germs and bacteria, perfect for cleaning a load of cloth diapers or soiled work clothes. With Accela Wash, the washer can get more loads done faster. It reduces soak, wash, and rinse times without sacrificing cleaning quality. The Active Spray and Active Rinse nozzles work together to speed up laundry time.\n\nAlso features a quiet Direct Drive motor and an easy-to-use LED touch-button control for a more responsive and quieter washing machine. Matching dryer can be purchased separately to complete the set. The matching dryer model is the Kenmore Elite Front-Load Dryer 81962 or Gas Dryer 91262.\n\nKenmore recommends measuring your space to ensure the front-loading washer will fit. Washing machine should be installed on a flat surface for best results. Kenmore does not recommend placing washer on casters due to the washer's weight.\n\nDIMENSIONS: 33.9\" L x 29\" W x 40.8\" H\nWASHER CAPACITY: 5.2 cubic feet \nCOLOR: White.",
