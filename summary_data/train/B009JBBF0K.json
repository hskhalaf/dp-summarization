I've never owned an impact driver before, and wow, was I missing out! I recently build a 22' x 48' barn for my chickens. Everything was screwed together. I estimated I must have used over 4,000 screws, and this drill worked flawlessly. When/if this thing ever quits working, I'm buying another.",

Comes with a hard case 2 batteries and a charger. It's small and compact has a cool guide led lioght that comes on when you slightly press on the trigger. I would not use something like this to put Ikea furniture together, but for projects like installing a flagpole outside your house for drilling in rock or concrete or 2x4 wood and stuff. Does hold the charge for a long time and has a cool battery level indicator on the device itself.",

Husband uses his in his 2400 square foot cabinet shop, I use mine on renovation here in the house.

The light does stay on when you press the trigger slightly which gives plenty of light for viewing your work area in the dark. I purchased this for automotive work. I'll circle back and re-review once I get some time behind the trigger. Only con I have is it is slightly louder then my previous impact driver.",

      "text": "This was my first impact driver and was blown away by how powerful yet lightweight it is. I am currently redoing my first floor of my house and had to put up new beams and this little guy drove in 3\" screws like it was going into hot butter. I also used it for putting down the subfloor and could drive in 100's of screws before I needed to change batteries. It came to me looking like it was brand new. Love this tool.",
