I have a somewhat unique situation in that my chair is about 75% on hardwood floor (which is fine) but also runs over the corner of our living room rug. Since I didn't want to move anything, I figured this nice mat could protect it and it does just that. The chair rolls on and off the mat nicely, with a very minimal bump, but one which requires no extra effort. Also, bonus points because it required no time to unroll from the package. Nice and rigid and floor ready within seconds.",

The spikes underneath are pretty small, but I've found that it is much preferable to the big spikes, even on medium pile carpet like mine. This is because big spikes break off easily, whereas these smaller ones have not broken off yet. Overall, very good mat for the price.

Also, my rolling chair sinks into the plastic a little bit when I'm sitting in one spot for a while. This creates little valleys that hold the wheels in place. On one hand, it's nice to not be rolling around *too* much, but on the other, you have to work a bit to roll out of the valleys.

My fault for not paying attention to where I was stepping but it would have been nice if there was some grip to it. And I've tried both sides, thinking I had it upside-down. It's still a good product for what I wanted. It doesn't slip while my chair is on it...only if it lays alone. I'll have to figure out how to keep it from slipping when my chair isn't on it.",
