Biggest dog is almost 30 lbs.Unless they get so confident that they start launching off it at 40 mph...quick shipping, after searching and searching, I'm thrilled with this purchase.",

So we ended up ordering those again and they came in 2 days but unfortunately the emergency passed because our cat passed away exactly on the day we received them.

I also like that it covers the entire set of steps- it makes it easier for her to negotiate the stairs. There is no problem with sturdiness- she is only 3 lbs so I don't think she will ever squash the foam. This is the second set of foam stairs I have purchased over the years with Yorkies.

      "text": "Bought these for my 10 year old toy poodle after she developed arthritis in her shoulder. She learned how to go up and down in about a minute and now uses them without supervision to get on and off our high profile bed. The foam is quite firm with a lambswool type cover and non-skid covering on the base. These do not move out of place even after multiple uses. We also bought the shorter 3-step version so she could get on and off the sofa. While these are pricey they have helped tremendously making them worth every penny. She no longer limps with her front let raised. Thank you for a quality product!",
