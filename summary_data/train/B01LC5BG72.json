It also covers the entire patio. It's not a 12\" subwoofer but the sound is very good. I am particularly pleased with using it on my bicycle for long rides -- it is easy to fasten to most anything with the flexible band and it has very long battery life. A four hour bicycle ride didn't run it out. It paired immediately and pairs without any difficulty time after time. I just love this thing. I bought a second one for our granddaughter.",
