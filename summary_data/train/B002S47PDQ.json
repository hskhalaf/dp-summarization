I bought small bathroom mats (no rubber backing) and put it on plastic kennel tray and have been washing pee pads ever since. Tried this brand and can\u2019t believe how FABULOUS they are. No smell at all. Fold and put in plastic bag for disposal. Easy as that! No more years of washing smelly and heavy pee pads from now on! His tray is in my bedroom but you would never know it. So glad I found this brand. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",

You may want to get a larger pad if you have a large breed dog. My puppy is not extremely attracted to peeing or pooing on the pad, but the pad does do its job when he does decide to use it.",
