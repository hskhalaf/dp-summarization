I didn't play with any of the adjustments yet...Just switched to MPH. Unit turns on with car and turns off with car. Toggle switch in back seems a bit weak...hopefully it will last. Pretty nice for the money. I would recommend to friends and family.",

When I plugged in the device, it just said \"connecting\" and then the device would turn off. Either I received a lemon or this device can not support J1850 Protocol, which is found in many domestic vehicles. Having a obd2 interface in your vehicle does not mean that this device will work. There is more to it than that and it should have been explained better in the description. There also should be better instructions on how to remove the pins.",
