This system even senses when the vehicle has started without using a tach wire. *The functions are vehicle-dependent, YMMV.

Not a DIY install unless you are real comfortable with splicing into your factory wiring and can read wiring diagrams well. Bulldog security makes some T-type connectors that will work with certain vehicles so that you don't have to cut into your factory wiring. I am not sure what they cost, but I would say that would make a DIY install easier if they have them for your vehicle. Great price though! Much cheaper than anywhere local, that is for sure!
