If you want to really control the dust, I would recommend hooking up a shop vac to the dust collection attachment on the sander. I am using a cheap Home Depot \"Bucket Head Shop Vac\" snapped onto a 5 gallon bucket. Remove the dust collection bag from the sander and set aside. The Bucket Head hose slides onto dust outlet, secure with a little tape. Run the vacuum at the same time you are sanding. This GREATLY reduces the amount of dust created.",
