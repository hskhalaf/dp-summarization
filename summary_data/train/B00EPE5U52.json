Also, when he brings it inside with him and runs around on the wood floors, it doesn't leave scratches, so that's good. I've only had it since june, and he's visited 4 times already - i suspect if he COULD have broken it already, he would have!",

So...don't pull the cord too hard. Otherwise, very satisfied. But I was pretty disappointed about the gears, since I specifically got this one because it made noise without batteries.",

We decided it should be an outside toy since it is kind of noisy, but that's not a bad thing because that's exactly why he likes it. He is scared of the real lawnmower, but this is perfect for him to help daddy and mommy mow the lawn. He has trouble pushing up the hills in our yard, but that's to be expected with plastic wheels on a toy. He loves it, so it gets five stars.",
