(Maybe even a little too well, it removed almost all of her undercoat in January - oops!) but she is so comfortable now! I cannot see myself using another brand after this!

Heidi is a German Shedder par excellance and all the slicker brushes I've used weren't really good, and seemed to irritate the dog more than anything else. This rake-style tool is unbelievably good. Doesn't irritate the dog at all, and removes unreal amount of hair quickly. Very easy to remove the hair from the teeth, too. My GSD actually looks thinner without all that undercoat hair, and not seeing as much loose hair around the house now. I think this is better than a Furmenator, and maybe a bit safer for the animal, too. My highest recommendation if you have a double-coated breed.",

My long-haired Irish Setter hates to be brushed, but she will allow me to work on her coat for at least 10 minutes without protesting when I use the rake. The rake has made working on her coat almost enjoyable. The other two dogs don't care one way or the other, so nothing to report about them except that it works well on them too..",

I instantly threw the furminator away! The handle was coming off anyway, so it was time. This brush has a solid wooden handle and fits perfectly in either paw (hand). It's a solid tool and I think it will last a long time.",
