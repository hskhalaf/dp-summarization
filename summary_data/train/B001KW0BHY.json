      "text": "I've been looking for something that I could use to store/organize my DVDs/Blu-rays/video games, and this does the job quite nicely. The product itself is high quality and sturdy; once it's assembled, you may be surprised by how heavy it actually is. Because I placed it on carpet I used the optional wall screw/zip tie securing feature, which is great if you have kids (as I do). As you can see in the picture, there's a lot of storage available, but I filled it up almost immediately. Basically, I underestimated how much media I have. If you have a lot of DVDs/etc., you may want to opt for something just a bit bigger.",

I had to manually drill holes for the screws, which was a total guessing game for me (I'm not terribly handy with that kind of stuff). The rest of the unit had the correct pilot holes in the right areas and the manual indicated the bottom piece should have had them too. It was frustrating and, although it's standing, I'm afraid it's going to collapse once I load it up with my movie collection.",

They're made by our neighbor to the north (in British Columbia, Canada). I'm going to have to disagree with the other review posted for this item: it is better to have two pieces for the back rather than one. Why? If it were one piece, you'd have a difficult time lining up nails for the back with the vertical midsection. It took me about an hour to put this together. It's helpful to have a dust buster since there's plenty of sawdust to deal with (from the engineered woods / medium density fiberboard).",

I don't need a 14te shelf because I am storing a mix of CDs and DVDs. If I intended to fill it with only CDs the last shelf would be a necessity. Otherwise - a good item.",

The only reason for not giving a 5 star rating is that the materials are just laminated particle board (heavy but fragile), and could stand to be a bit more durable, but otherwise it works as a nice looking media shelf. The item I ordered did have some damage that occurred either during shipping or at the warehouse, but when I contacted the company about the issue they promptly responded and took care of sending me replacement parts for the one's that were damaged. Based on the excellent customer service, I would recommend items from this seller.",

I didn't notice until I was all done that I had put a few nails poking out of the finished side panels, messing up the finish slightly. Because the wood is so narrow where you hammer the nails in, you have to be super careful to hammer in the nails perfectly straight.",

There is only one down side--\"some assembly required\" is understated. The instructions are clear if you know how to put things together, understand the downside of a cam, know how to use a drill gun and drive a nail. You must be able to get on your knees and have a space large enough to put the unit together. The assembly is not for a novice but the CD storage is great for the price. I would buy this again.",
