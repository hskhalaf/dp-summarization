The only thing I wish it had is a pocket for a laptop but I\u2019ll just put her laptop with the books and it will work fine. Typically a 1st grader wouldn\u2019t have a Laptop but with the situation, distance learning spans all grades....",

The backpack itself looks sturdy and very nice colors, definitely does not look cheap. The lunch bag was definitely a great pair but unfortunately, the velcro on the bag ripped after about less than two months that she used it. I am glad I invested in insurance for this and was able to get her a replacement. It was the same design but the accent color (pink) was blue, which was not that much of a difference but it would have been nice to find a matching replacement.",
