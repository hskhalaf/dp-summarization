We have decided to get rid of it since we want whats best for the baby. However it was so beneficial during the first 6 weeks (i had a csection) that to me it was worth it.

Also, the sounds and vibration are run on batteries, so make sure you have a Costco stock of batteries because it drains them every week ( we just stopped using that feature). all in all- if you want an unleveled product and to buy a $50 insert purchase this bassinet!",

We added a two pads to it and put it on a slight incline and that made a difference as well. Also very disappointed with the battery life of the functions.

I a toddler had run and trip and bang her head against the floor because of it. Inherently, there is a design flaw where in order for it to swivel safely in 360 degrees, it has to have wide foot print of large legs to make it stable. The problem is that they become completely tripping hazard. For a product that is designed for babies, the legs can trip an unsuspecting parent. This product should be recalled completely.",

I place my baby on the pedestal side of the mattress and every time she ends up with her face in the mesh on the OTHER side of the basket, which of course wakes her up.

Also there are no wheels on this one, so not easy to move base which is good for sleeping baby, easy to move swivel if needed to go to the bathroom at night. Will write another review once used.",

This has been a saving grace for new parents (most appreciated is the heartbeat sound feature) and especially great for pre-term babies who need extra soothing and are too tiny for bigger cribs!",

Also, the bassinet isn\u2019t tall enough to hover over our master bed as our frame is to high. While this is not Halo\u2019s fault it is something other Mom\u2019s should be aware of.

In a dark room they are way too bright to shine in his eyes. The vibrate feature definitely helps when you just feed your baby @ 2am and need them to calm down. Works like a charm..",
