This tea pot worked great...until I noticed that the spout must have broken, but I have no idea how or when. I have 2 toddlers, and I then had to worry about where the missing shards of glass were. I'm disappointed because I want to buy another one, but this one only lasted a 6 weeks. Not sure if it was a defect, or if they just don't make the product as well anymore.",

I had to replace it with my old truly stainless steel infuser. I am really disappointed at this time. For the price they should have made quality stainless steel infuser infuser.",

Also, the spout is perfectly designed and does not dribble hot tea out while pouring. The price is fantastic, too.

It takes even boiling water in stride, and has held up to months of daily use with multiple steeps per day. It's easy to clean, and even though it feels like awfully thin glass (for a teapot) it's held up without a scratch or crack. I definitely recommend this one!",

I only give it four stars because it is not especially well insulated, but I drink my tea right away, so for me this is not an issue.

Writing this review 4 months after I cracked my first one. It still worked for 4 months cracked until the split got too long. Even with the shortcoming, I can't find a better teapot. Reordering now.",

So I returned home and bought TWO of these teapots for my two houses. They are clear, clean and just right for our two cups of loose leaf tea - with some left over for a last cup (we use glass tea cups). BIG basket for optimum tea exposure to water. I have been using them for about a month, on granite countertop, with no breakage. And you can see the beautiful color of the tea.",

For glass, it seems very durable, however I like that it has a small spout because I tend to be clumsy and I feel a long elegant one would be at hazard of breaking. The built in strainer works perfectly, even for the finer loose leaf teas, and the handle does not transfer heat. This is a breeze to rinse out / wash. I typically make anywhere from 12 - 16 oz of tea in this at a time. This is a great value for the price and I've already recommended it to several family members / friends!",
