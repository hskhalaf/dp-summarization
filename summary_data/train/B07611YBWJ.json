Having said that, I am pleasantly surprised at how powerful it is and how long the battery life is. I have a big yard with lots of things with borders (trees, flower bed, etc.) and needed move between them over a fair amount of distance. The battery wasn't close to running out, and the line lasted a long time. I wasn't constantly having to let out more. I would recommend. A-",

I have yet to run out the battery and I even bought an extra because I didn't expect it to last long enough to do all I needed to do. More than enough power. It even cut through very thick stemmed weeds like that of a thistle plant. Love that you can change the handle position easily. The wheels that you can attach didn't work like I expected but it's so lightweight, I could easily hold and swing it about. I would definitely recommend this product.",
