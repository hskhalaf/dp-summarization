The spray is very easy to use, my boy didn't mind it at all. I was able to clean him quickly - his coat is shiny soft and I live the smell (which lasts for days). I'm so happy I found this spray and to be able to clean my senior boy without risking him being injured in carrying him upstairs and into the bathtub.",

However, after learning about Miracle Coat Spray On Waterless Dog Shampoo and its natural ingredients, I decided to give it a try. Result? Amazing! My Chow-American Eskimo mix Lexi has a very thick double coat with layers upon layers of fine long hair. She was very comfortable as I spritzed on the waterless shampoo, rubbed it into her coat, and toweled it off. Her damp coat brushed easily with no matting; quickly dried into a clean, lush, soft, and fresh smelling coat. Lexi truly looks as if she had a \"regular\" water bath. A must have grooming product I will never be without.",

Even though you really don't need water to use, I still take a wet cloth and dampen their coats first - seems to help reduce the amount needed to really get a good lather going. It doesn't leave any residue, and dries nice and clean while leaving my dogs' skin conditioned. A must have in my opinion.",
