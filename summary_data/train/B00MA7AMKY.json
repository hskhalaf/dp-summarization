I have yet to find something that it won't play. I'm sure I will at some point. but for the price I'm stunned at how good it is. I did maxout the ram and may put an ssd in it as some point but really it's all about the graphics card. it's quite good. I would upgrade the ram at the very least though.",

I was never a fan of Kodi, so ideally Hivemind was not going to work out for me. Also I fixed it so now when the Alpha boots up it goes straight to desktop mode instead of the UI. I like this for school and casual gaming. U can also upgrade over time and is a pretty good buy for the money. Only four star for the UI I didn't like, but that's just me.",

      "text": "I wanted mini-PC with good video card so I can occasionally play few modern games and having upgrade options, cause good PCs are all about options. The item fits my goals neatly. You can use any Haswell CPU (not just T models, but also S and plain) and SATA SSD drives, any DDR3L ram available on the market. The cooling system is pretty quiet and effective and you can also play a bit with Intel XTU software to undervolt CPU.",
