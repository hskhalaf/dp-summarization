This stuff is so incredibly tasty and easy to administer, that I just triple or quadruple my dosage.

      "text": "Love it! Buying another! I am definitely noticing a positive effect on my energy level shortly after a spray. So it's worth it just for that extra push to get me to either start the day or keep the day going. I also keep mine refrigerated and clean the spray pump and cap each weekend. The taste is great to me, keeping it cold may be helping that. Better than getting a needle shot at the doctors office and definitely more noticeable (to me) than the pill or chew-able supplements.",
