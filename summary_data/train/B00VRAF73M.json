I'm disabled, its hard for me to stand for long so I really appreciate being able to just grab one of these little pods and drop it into the washer. It's a big improvement over taking down a heavy bottle of detergent, taking the top off, measuring the liquid, etc. It weighs a lot less than a bottle of detergent. I really wish these had been around when I was a young mother and didn't have my own washer/dryer. It would have been so much easier than lugging detergent to the Laundromat.",

I only use 2 pods for extra large loads of the adult's clothes or super dirty stuff. I'm using a newer Samsung front load washer (their entry level)",

I love Amazons delivery and not having to worry about forgetting to pick it up. I have ordered every few months so I never give out. These dissolve and clean even if I use cold water.
