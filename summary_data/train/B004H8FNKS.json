Another positive thing, it has remote accessibility function to take pictures from your phone. this is handy if you want to take yourself a picture from certain distance without any help from other people, but not too close as selfie, you can view, and take the shot through your smart phone.",

    "title": "Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-W570 16.1 MP Digital Still Camera with Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar 5x Wide-Angle Optical Zoom Lens and 2.7-inch LCD (Black) (OLD MODEL)",
    "description": "Color:BlackFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n Sony DSC-W570 \n\nFeatures and value all in a slim design with the Sony DSC-W570. Capture your videos in 720P HD and use Sweep Panorama for breathtaking images. Add more features like iAuto, and Optical SteadyShot image stabilization and this camera is jam packed with everything you need. Sony DSC-W570 Highlights\n\n16.1 Megapixel Super HAD CCD Image Sensor\nA powerful 16.1 megapixel \u00bd.3-inch Super HAD CCD image sensor helps you capture gorgeous images with superb contrast and clarity down to the finest detail. With 16.1 megapixels, you can create stunning, photo-quality prints up to A3+ (13x19-inch) size, or crop your images and still come away with high resolution shots.\n2.7-inch Clear Photo LCD display (230k pixels)\n2.7-inch (230K pixels) Clear Photo LCD display features sharp, natural color that makes it easy to compose shots, read menus, and view photos, even in bright sunlight.\n720p MP4 HD Movie Mode9 \nIn 720p MP4 movie mode the camera shoots 1280 x 720 high definition movies at 30 fps, which is the format when working with a PC. Users will create high quality movies with full use of optical zoom in files small enough to transfer to compatible PC or Mac. Once transferred to your computer you can effortlessly upload your media to popular photo and video-sharing websites such as Photobucket and YouTube. (Compatible computer with internet capability required)\nSweep Panorama Mode\nReach beyond the traditional wide angle lens, and capture more breathtaking shots with Sweep Panorama Mode. Simply press the shutter button and sweep the camera in the desired direction and the camera continuously shoots at a high speed, then seamlessly stitches the images together with automatic position adjustment to create one stunning panoramic image. Available in wide and ultra-wide options, the camera can take panoramic shots of up to 235 degrees. Now capturing wide landscapes is as easy as press and sweep.\nOptical SteadyShot image stabilization \nOptical SteadyShot image stabilization uses a built-in gyro sensor to detect camera shake and automatically shifts the lens to help prevent blur without sacrificing image quality.\nIntelligent Auto Mode\nUnlike traditional auto mode, Intelligent Auto (iAuto) mode thinks for you, recognizing scenes, lighting conditions, faces, and adjusts settings resulting clear images, faces with natural skin tone and less blur. Take advantage of all the technology without leaving Auto mode. Kids on the playground, landscape shots, a beautiful flower or an indoor birthday party; result in clear images without leaving auto mode.\nSoft Skin Mode \nYour portrait subjects will thank you for this. Soft Skin mode recognizes skin tones and reduces the appearance of blemishes and wrinkles without affecting the rest of the shot. \nNatural Flash \nConventional point-and-shoot camera flash shots just don't capture colors the way the eye sees them. Natural Flash mode takes a reference shot without flash and then uses that reference to correct the color, for far more lifelike images.\nSelf-Portrait Timer \nSelf-Portrait Timer helps take the guesswork out of self portraits by utilizing Face Detection technology to recognize when your face enters the frame. Once the camera detects your face, it triggers a 2-second timer, and then snaps a picture.\nIn camera guide\nTake all the guesswork out of photography with the in camera guide. Its convenient step by step instructions lead you to the perfect shot.\nFace Detection technology\nFace Detection technology detects up to eight individual faces and adjusts focus, exposure, and white balance to help deliver crisp, properly lit images of family and friends.\nSmile Shutter technology\nSmile Shutter technology captures a smile the moment it happens. Simply press the Smile Shutter button and the camera does the rest. You can also select adult and child priority and indicate the degree of Smile Detection Sensitivity. Intelligent Scene Recognition can now be used together with Smile Shutter mode when the Intelligent Auto mode is on. This means that beautiful smiles can be captured with settings optimized for the particular scene, even in difficult conditions such as twilight and backlighting.\nCarl Zeiss Vario-Tessar Lens with 25mm wide 5x Optical Zoom\nThe high-performance Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar 5x optical zoom lens brings distant subjects closer for video recording as well as for outdoor, sports, and travel photos, and Close Focus shoots close-ups up to just under \u00bd-inch from the subject. A wide angle of 25mm wide-angle lens allows you to take wider shots of the scene or group in crowded spaces.\nAnti-blink Function\nIt\u2019s frustrating to think you\u2019ve captured that perfect shot, only to review it later and discover one of your subjects blinked just as you pressed the shutter. The Anti-blink function works to help counter blinking and squinting. When the camera is set to Soft Snap, the Anti-blink function captures two images, recording only the photo with less squinting. If a blink is detected in other shooting modes, a warning will be displayed after you take the shot. \nDynamic Range Optimizer Standard and Plus\nDynamic Range Optimizer (DRO) Standard and Plus uses a sophisticated algorithm to help recover shadows and highlights. The result is more natural images with clearer details that more closely match what your naked eye sees. DRO is particularly effective when shooting backlit portraits or any scene with a dramatic contrast between background and foreground lighting. DRO Plus allows for even greater optimization by analyzing each region of an image and performing additional image processing.\nIntelligent Scene Recognition (iSCN) Mode \nIntelligent Scene Recognition (iSCN) Mode automatically detects eight different types of scenes and, within just 1/30th of a second, selects the appropriate camera settings: Backlight, Backlight Portrait, Twilight, Twilight Portrait, Twilight using a tripod, Portrait, Landscape and macro. iSCN has two modes: Auto and Advanced. In Auto Mode, the camera takes a single shot using the optimal settings. In Advanced Mode, the camera takes a photo with the optimal settings and, if in difficult lighting (low light or back light) immediately takes a second photo with another optimized setting so you can choose which to keep.\nHigh Sensitivity Mode (ISO 3200)\nHigh ISO allows for faster shutter speed, so you can take photos indoors or in low light without the need for a flash. In addition to High Sensitivity Mode (ISO), you can select up to seven ISO settings (Auto, 125, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200) when shooting in Program Auto Mode to adjust sensitivity to your shooting conditions.\nEasy Shooting Mode\nWith Easy Shooting Mode, even beginners can take great photos. In Easy Shooting Mode, easy-to-understand basic instructions are displayed on the LCD screen and the camera switches to all automatic settings, removing several function choices and allowing you to focus on just your subject. Since this mode works together with Intelligent Scene Recognition, the camera selects the optimum setting for each scene. In addition the easy mode simplifies preview mode.\nIn-Camera Retouching Tools\nRetouch and enhance your photos on the go with in-camera Trimming, Red-Eye Correction, and Unsharp Masking functions.\nPHOTOMUSIC\nPHOTOMUSIC combines images with music (4 tracks, 5 minutes per track) to produce fun and entertaining slide shows with standard visual effects (Simple, Nostalgic, Active, and Stylish). Select from pre-loaded tracks on the camera or transfer your own from your compatible computer (sold separately).\nIncludes Sony PMB (Picture Motion Browser) Software ver. 5.32\nSony Picture Motion Browser software offers a simple, intuitive way to transfer, sort, and view your video and still images on your compatible PC. In addition, multiple output options let you burn your memories to DVD using an external DVD burning device (sold separately), as well as take advantage of one click upload to a number of popular video and photo sharing sites (such as Facebook and Sony\u2019s Personal Space). Using the new 5.3 version also enables playback of 3D images taken on the Cyber-shot camera.\nIncludes Sony PMB Portable software3 \nWith the pre-installed Picture Motion Browser (PMB) Portable software2 the DSC-W570 makes it easy to pre-select videos and images in the camera and conveniently upload them from the camera to a compatible PC and popular Internet sharing sites4 without the need for any additional software or install. \n 1. PMB Requires Microsoft Windows XP SP3/ Windows Vista SP2/Windows 7. Not supported by Mac OS.\n 2. PMB Portable (ver 5.2) for Windows is pre-loaded. PMB Portable (ver 1.2) for Mac is available at www.eSupport.sony.com. PMB Portable requires USB cable (included) and PC with internet connectivity. 64-bit environments not supported.\n 3.
