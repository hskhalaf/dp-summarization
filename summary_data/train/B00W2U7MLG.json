The white of the leather contrasts so much with the now grayish/brown color of the shiny nylon part which looks pretty gross honestly. If you are going to get these shoes be prepared to work to keep them clean and nice looking. The gum sole is very nice.",

However, the price is pretty competitive on Amazon so I've gone through about 3 pairs already (different colors) in about 3 years. If you never had Reebok Classics, the comfortable level is comparable to Nike Air Max. But I've notice the sole inside does wear off as the time goes by.",
