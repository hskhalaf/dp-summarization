Last picture is the bear on my oldest daughters lap. She is 13 and 5\u20195. They make the bear look larger than it really is sitting in front of the girl and she must be holding a different size bear in the standing photo. Or it\u2019s a good illusion. This is an average size bear. Giant it is NOT!!!",
