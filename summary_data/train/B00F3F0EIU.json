Despite my limited knowledge of photography, I can take extremely professional looking action shots and crystal clear panoramas. I have used this GoPro for snorkeling, rock climbing, kayaking, mountain biking, surfing, and hiking. I don't often shoot video because I find them laborious to watch later, so instead I take a lot of pictures in motion. They are hardly ever blurry.",

I wish the field-of-view could be adjusted, but the free GoPro Studio editing software offers the option to reduce \"fish-eye\" effect or barrel distortion. Some menu settings can help minimize that and experimentation will tell if I can get the results I want to achieve. Very happy with it so far.",

The first video we took was of the dog tugging on his chew toy. One of the coolest features of this camera is the remote operating that you can do via your Android device or tablet. You can even get apps for it on the Apple store if you have an Apple device. The video editing software that GoPro provides you with works really well. It is a fun and tough little camera.",

      "text": "I like the GoPro SIlver, I only ever use 720p 30fps recording as that is the best balance of battery life + quality for me, and I get 3 hours worth of video in that setting which is enough for most sporting events. Lots of good addons too, but its alittle expensive compared to the competition.",

It's super fun!",
