It can handle a bit of rain, even without using the rain cover. Why I don't like it: the zippers stick often- it's quite frustrating a lot of the time. The shape of it is strangely more wide than deep and that limits the number of books you can fit into it. In fact, for how large it is, it seems like it would hold more, but no. overall? It's a good bag, esp for the price, but I don't know if I'd buy it again!",

My son's previous backpack (same brand and almost the same model) last from 2nd grade through 6th grade. This is why I purposefully sought this one out. Unfortunately, within 6 months one of the shoulder straps' stitching started coming off. Now it's just a matter of time before the whole thing is unattached. I was really hoping this would last at least 2 years until my son made it to high school, but it doesn't appear so. Very disappointed.",

If this occurred after years of use, I would have given this pack 5 stars. However, failing after less than two months is unacceptable.",

Problem is, this one is nothing like my original one. The seams inside the backpack started coming undone right away. Openings between the different compartments are so frustrating. Actually, this backpack is falling apart from the inside out and very cheaply made with no quality control. Thanks a lot, China. Don't buy this one.",

The many pockets and compartments allow you to adapt the backpack for a variety of uses -- carrying a laptop or a hydration pack, separate places to hold keys, phone, checkbook and pens, etc. This one has a waist strap, which is very helpful in distributing the load when hiking. The newer version apparently lacks a waist strap, which would make it a non-starter for me. If these packs were put together with stronger zippers and stitching I would have added an additional star. They tend to last about three years with daily use.",

I also really like the waterproof rain cover, I just wish it wasn't so bright yellow.",

If you pack this bag heavy like I did with textbooks and a laptop, you need to use the little straps that pull the backpack together, otherwise too much weight will pull on the top part of the bag, and the stress will eventually rip the top pocket from the seams. It is a nice bag though. So long as you don't carry around a ton of weight every day, it should last you many years.",

And just tonight I noticed that the liner in between the two main compartments is wearing through and there is almost a hole between the two compartments. Bottom line is that it was good while it lasted but I won't be buying another one.",

Also the laptop hole barely fits my 15'' as well as other reviewers. Don't buy for 17''. I am really happy with it for my purposes - packing teaching supplies and laptop and lunches and water bottles all at the same time on public transit.",

Some stitching on the straps had to be resewn but in general, it held up well. I bought the same brand because I thought it would be well made. Wrong. After 3 months, the stitching between the large zipper and the bag came apart. The last bag had withstood 1.5 years of high school text books great. The only reason for replacing the last one was because of ink stains and zipper breaks.",

The rain cover is a added bonus that is something beneficial for rider but I have not had to pleasure of trying out yet.",
