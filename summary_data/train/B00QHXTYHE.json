I am able to fit my BlenderBottle and umbrella in each of the side bottle holders. Plenty of space for my phone, keys, phone charger, portable charger, protein bars among other things such as a small camera or my GoPro! I love the color too and it sits well on my hips. No more dealing with backpacks when I go on a hike! Yaaas!",

      "text": "This is a great pack, flexible fabric, easy to adjust, comfortable, room for two water bottles. It won\u2019t really fit a rain shell with room for much else but an emergency poncho is a good substitute. The one flaw is that when you have it on it is hard to get the water bottle back in its holder. Surprisingly hard. The waist strap goes around the outside of the bottle, and that tension and the different sections of fabric on the holder creates the problem. It\u2019s pretty annoying when hiking actually but I like the rest of the design enough that it\u2019s still 4 stars. I keep hoping I\u2019ll find a way around the problem.",

The biggest problem is if you put more than 3lbs in the pack, the strap adjuster slips, loosening the strap. The pack constantly loosens while walking.

It's comfortable carrying my gear in front or when I don't take my camera, I wear it in back. I just had to knock off a star though for the annoying logo and slogan. Got some fabric paint and covered it up.",

If they had used a slightly shorter zipper so that the pulls stay on top of the bag, it would have been perfect! Otherwise, the bag is perfect! I use it for walking my dog everyday. I put her 30' long lead into the largest pocket, and poop bags in the small pocket and a few essential items in the middle pocket.",

I had to purchase a bag at the theme-park. I'm fortunate I was not using this while camping or hiking. It would have been more inconvenient to break on that kind of adventure.",
