My only complaints are that, for outdoor garden use, the spout could be a bit longer and the holes in the sprinkling head are way too small. It takes forever to empty the can. This might be good for watering small bedding plant, but not for my well established outdoor potted plants or when I am planting larger plants. I am going to try to enlarge the holes in the sprinkling head and hope that will take care of the flow problem.",

It's also hard to clean out debris. If you try to blast it out with a jet spray, you end up with water all over yourself because it's so hard to direct the spray into such a small hole.",

It's obvious that the item isn't completely \"finished\" smooth after the molding process because there are some very small particles of plastic peeling off the edges around the opening, though nothing that affected the item's utility whatsoever. Also, as other have commented, there was one hole in the white spout that wasn't fully punctured, but a metal skewer quickly finished the job. The yellow color pops nicely, but I noticed a couple very very faint red/green stain lines on the outside of the can which are almost completely unnoticeable unless you get really up close and inspect it.",

When the can is full the handle is very helpful to assist, plus it holds enough water to make your watering more efficient without having to fill up several times. I can't imagine a better watering can!",

The nozzle does leak for a couple of seconds after bringing it upright right after watering so I'd be careful when watering indoor plants because it could leak on the floor but it's really a small price to pay for this great lil' thing.",

Using both makes it easy to regulate how fast the water sprinkles.

I got the dark green so I can leave it out in the garden (when I'm feeling lazy) and it won't compete visually with the plants. All in all, very acceptable. I would recommend.
