I was also trying to match a set of recently purchased flatware that I absolutely love. The 18/8 stainless steel is very high quality. The spoons are delicate, yet sturdy with a good heft in the hand. They have been through the dishwasher maybe 20 times and still gleam like brand new. I'm not the best at doing dishes right away, and sometimes just rinse and leave in the sink until the next night. Other flatware tends to rust a bit in this situation, but not these spoons.

I got my money's worth and then some with these. I will probably buy a second set, as both my boyfriend and I use these extra long spoons frequently. They're just fun.",

The handle is not too flat, but not too round. They are smooth and easily cleaned. The appearance is simple, but graceful and tapering. I wanted a spoon like this for eating ice cream slowly out of a deep glass, or for just eating yogurt in smaller spoonfuls instead of gulping it down. Although slightly more expensive than some others, I'm very pleased with these; they seem like a fun addition to our \"silverware\" drawer.",
