      "text": "the wireless on this is not like adding an apple product. it's convoluted, you will need a disk drive, and a network admin. we used this in our company and it basically took over our corp access point and shut everyone out of the network. we will take another pass at setting up. it's amazing to me that a company like Epson can ship a wireless product that was outdated in 2010. external usb thumb-drive, cd rom, and it still gets configured incorrectly. also - it has a weird metric thread (4mm?) instead of the standard 1/4x20 tripod mount. it's teeny but seems to hold the load. image seems good, i like the outside physical controls for keystone and focus.",

Somehow I was not enjoying it as a pure movie projector. Biggest flaw I felt about this unit is, no output for audio from the projector and I was not happy with outside projection area was bright and very big. But again, these are not major issue to complain about. Given the price, one of the best bright n clear projector. It can be used for conference and meeting without any issue. Epson are always great with this job",

I read some of the reviews and decided this would fill the bill for us. And fill the bill it did, as it was much brighter and clearer than our old one. The colors are bright and vivid, overall we probably do not even need to close the blinds anymore. Have not tried the wireless function as of yet as it is hard wired with HDMI and VGA as well. Works really well.",

I thought I'd be fine using the dongle in lieu of model up with built in wireless, and I am, but there's no secure place to store the dongle. Since this projector has to be portable I have to remove the dongle every time it's moved or stored. I worry I'm going to lose the dongle every time. This isn't the fault of the projector but I think if I had to do it again I'd pay the little extra and get a projector with the wireless built in.",
