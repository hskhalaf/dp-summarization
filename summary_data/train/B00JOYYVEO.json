      "title": "Amazing sound and quality!",
      "text": "I visited a local store to test out their selection of Meinl, Pearl and Schleigworks cajons. Bottom line, I only liked one and it was the $400 Meinl Artisan. After some online research I came across very positive reviews of Sol. It took blind faith for me to buy sight unseen and unheard but I jumped. The first time I played it I was in love. The sound is pure with resonate bass and crisp slaps. There is no bleed over of the snare in the bass, a problem many other models had. The craftsmanship is superb! It looks amazing and for the price with a gig bag is unbeatable. Very happy with this purchase!",

Sound is very good with nice booming bass. Slaps sound good with the high slap adjustable by loosening the corner screws. High slap has a nice 'snap' to it. Padded gig (carry) bag is good quality with an attractve logo. One backpack strap and two carry cloth handles. Overall very satisfied with this purchase.",

El Artesano Cajon features snare wires designed and placed to reduce their sound when playing the bass tone without sacrificing any snap on a slap tone. The result is a cajon that balances the best sonic characteristics of both a traditional cajon and a Flamenco cajon. Free gig bag included!",
