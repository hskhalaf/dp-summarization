It doesn't get too hot and the concentrator nozzle it comes with makes styling easy. It has a long lead, about 2.4m long. Although it is really light weight it is not a travel hair dryer, so it is not foldable. At the bottom of the handle there is loop for hanging. The controls are at the inside of the handle so it is easy to change temperature and speed while using it. All in all a really good hair dryer and great value for money.",

      "text": "While this definitely works (and for the price is a deal), I must say that it is not optimal. The hottest temperature is VERY HOT (arguably too hot), while the next level down barely blows any air at all. I often resort to just using the cool option, but I feel that it may not work as well for styling hair. I will definitely keep this for now, but if it breaks, I will probably explore another option.",

Also there is only 1 setting adjuster meaning if you want the top level of heat you need to have it on the top level of power or if you wanted it on the cooler heat setting you need to have it on the lowest power setting. I dose have some positive, it is very light and I was cheap",
