By the time I saw the stain, I had already run it through the dryer. I added this to the stain ( didn't follow the directions to were it first and add a thin layer). I added a decent amount and scrubbed with the brush. I let the dress sit for about 30+ minutes, then I washed the dress again. THE STAIN WAS OUT! I suggest this product all the time. It has been safe on colours and whites. I haven't tried it on all materials, just cotton and poly-blend. Good stuff!",
