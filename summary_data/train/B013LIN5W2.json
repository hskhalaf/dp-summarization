Great bass response, clear mids and highs. I think these are great for movies/TV (probably because I don't care about surround sound) and they are perfect for music. The room I'm in is 13x19 with hard wood floors and tall ceilings, and these fill it up with sound. Using them with an Onkyo A-9050 stereo receiver. Definitely glad I took a chance on these.",

At low volumes you don't get much out of the speakers which isn't a bad thing, they can really handle power. Being a two-way speaker you get flat spots in the high range but all speakers have faults.

Used these to replace larger (20\" high) bookshelf speakers that lost their mojo (whatever that is). Have a pretty decent receiver (Denon AVR-S900W) and center channel speaker. Tempted by the simplicity of a sound bar but could never pull the trigger on such a purchase. Placed these on 30\" stands flanking a 50\" Samsung TV. Very pleased with the balanced sound. Hard to beat at this price point.",

I see where you might be able to obtain a speaker like i mentioned that sounds like the old cabinet ones but whos got $1500+ or more for each speaker?",

The Polk T-15's seemed right and when installed they are perfect. Well made, complement my furniture, and easily connected.",

I purchased these in conjunction with the Onkyo TX-8260. I thought the speakers might be overwhelmed by the amp; they aren't. Although I don't crank up the volume too much, I really like their transparency and accuracy. It's a good combination.",
