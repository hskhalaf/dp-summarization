The only negative is that they will NOT fit inside each other unless two of the wheels are sticking out. We did not want to force them so ended up storing the smallest in the largest one and will store the medium one separately.",

A couple of things that makes me give only 3 stars is that the large bag doesn't have a handle on the bottom to make lifting easier and the supposed carry on is definitely too big for carry on. The wheels make the bag stand too tall although the bag itself is proper sized. Airlines are requiring smaller bags these days for under seat placement. I will have to purchase a smaller carry on now.",

They are not really easy to maneuver, and they do get dirty quickly, but for the amazing price that they cost they absolutely get the job done. I did have a problem with them at first, and the company contacted me immediately with strong intentions to fix the problem and make me happy. Their efforts do not go unnoticed and I commend them on their great customer service. They stand behind their products 100%.",
