Zinus should have made the headboard more customizable if you had thinner than 10-inch mattress. You'll also want to use the bolts in the Zinus brackets because the ones that come with headboard are very long. One of threads on the headboard where you screw in the legs also has a thread misalignment. Overall I like the look and am keeping the headboard. Just very disappointed.",

Parts are numbered and the instructions walk you through the snap together and tighten fasteners steps. The resulting structure is reasonable sturdy given the price point. There are a couple of notable negatives though. First, there's really not an easy way of determining which of their many bedframes is compatible. The install kit has nice fasteners for their mainstream units, but literally includes a long bolt and wingnut combination for their popular studio platform frame. Fortunately, it works, but it's a bit cheesy. Second, the gray fabric much darker than shown in the photo - closer to charcoal.",

      "text": "First off this is a great headboard. Solid construction and nice aesthetic. SUPER easy to assemble. I'm docking one star because it doesn't fit the Elite Smartbase frame as expected. While I did order the universal headboard brackets, this headboard's slots don't line up with the expected slots on the brackets. It took me a while to figure out that the long screws need to go through the CORNER holes on the brackets. This setup seems less secure than the slots that are shown in the bracket instructions and a bit more difficult in slotting the screw in. However, I managed to get everything tightened down and it seems secure for now.",

The included screws for attaching the headboard to the frame are very long, but since our bed doesn't have a box spring, that wasn't a problem. I added a few felt pads to the corner so somebody can lean back and the metal won't scratch the wall. Looks great. Almost no gap between mattress and bottom of headboard--again, platform bed with regular mattress. It's day 2 and still giving off a chemical odor, but hoping that dissipates in the coming weeks.",

      "text": "I purchased this headboard to put on my Zinus bed frame. You do need to purchase the bracket set, but it is so worth it. The company just gives you good feelings. My shipment came with greeting cards that I could send to other people and an extra tool! It makes you feel cared about. But the real awesome thing about the products from this company is how easy they are to put together. The instructions are simple and super easy to follow. I could easily put together the bedframe, put the brackets on, assemble the headboard, and attach it to the bed in 45 minutes. By myself!! I am super impressed!!",
