This stuff is perfect for a guy who is in continuous contact with boxes and other dry/absorbing stuff. This cream lasts a long time and doesn't produce too strong of a fruity smell. My hands look much better and I take pride in being hygienic. A little goes a long way. I still have about half a tube left after 2 months of daily use. Will be buying again.

Yet, the one i purchased on amazon seemed to have something mixed in it. It was as if someone put soap in the lotion and mixed it. Or conditioner, the texture of the cream wasn\u2019t the usual texture. I usually buy this cream in the market. Therefore, returned. So if you notice the texture is a bit slimy. You\u2019re not getting the real thing. Just a heads up!!",

That's what this smells like with a tiny bit of lavender. So even though I ordered it straight from Amazon I suspect it's either fake or very, very old.",

I've gone through 4 tubes. It's long-lasting. A pea-sized dab will due, especially if your hands are slightly damp. For my recent order, I decided to try lavender. It smells exactly like the lavender in my garden. I'm looking forward to trying other scents.",

We have so many different lavender products in our house (essential oils, actual lavender in the garden, dish soap, bar soap, other lotions) and I've never smelled a lavender like this one. I'm finishing the bottle, and will probably try the Pomegranate Acai or Grape Seed & Blackberry next.",
