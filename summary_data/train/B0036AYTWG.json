If I have one quibble, it's with the monopod/tripod clip attachment. The pods will slip out of the small 'bag', but that can be solved by using an alternative setup.

My preference these days is to travel lighter with 1 or 2 lenses. If you intend on using this bag for everything, then this would be a great purchase. However, if you prefer light travel, stick with the smaller sizes.",
