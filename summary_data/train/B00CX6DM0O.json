As far as the complaints about them not being good, just remember that there are people who eat only a few varieties of food and are just picky in general. As for the price, you get what you pay for. For me junk food and pop are way too expensive Quality items like this, you will pay for if you value quality.",

These are not the most expensive vitamins I've bought and definitely not the cheapest. I do like that amazon (or the company?) will offer clip and save coupons periodically on this product. Great vitamin, my kids will eat them. Thank you!",
