      "text": "This looks like an inflatable pool raft with handles. It went down the hill fast, though a bit more prone to tipping over. I'ts a big sled, but because it's inflatable, it's compact when deflated to be stored. Because I have a small car, I appreciated being able to have the space to pack this, then inflate at the sledding location. (I keep a tire inflator in my car, just in case.) We had a lot of fun on this.",

      "text": "My husband has a sledding club here in Minnesota so he knows a thing or two about sledding. He says this sled slid nicely and smoothly, was pretty fast, and was easy to inflate and seems durable. He says it is too small for a bigger adult and the handles are too small for adult hands. He thinks an appropriate age range for this sled would be 8-12 but a smaller adult can fit on it. The price is great for the quality and this sled is sure to offer hours of winter fun for kids. He recommends it.",

Definitely not a good option for a stick and rock laden slope, but anything with deep snow or a bit of grooming it is perfect for.",
