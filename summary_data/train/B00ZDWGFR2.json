So after lots of research, i bought this and A6000. After playing around with both for over a month, I decided to return A6000. This A7rii produces great quality when paired with Sony FE 28mm lens. I have taken picture in low light with ISO 3200 and the noise is reasonable to edit in LR/PS. I also have minolta BeerCan lens that is 70-210 f4, which also produces great images. I have yet to fully utilize this camera. Thus far, I am very happy after transitioning from Canon world.",

Eye tracking really helps increase the number of usable shots. Highly recommended",
