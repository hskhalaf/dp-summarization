Only things I'd like to see improved are that the configuration data is oftentimes lost after a firmware upgrade, and also if you attempt to restore from backup configuration data and you've changed the administrator username (default is 'cisco'), the process is broken (there's a workaround, but it's not simple). The 14-port switch is solid, and it's backed by a 3-year replacement warranty. Great buy for the price, but, again, a little clunky on the back end.",

But I will say that the web interface with this is easier to use than some of their other Small Business switches, I have 3 different Cisco Small Business switch models that all use only web interfaces, and the one with this router/vpn/switch is much better.

Good luck getting the VPN client to work if you cannot use OpenVPN, you can get it to work but you will spend hours if not days. Better off spending the extra $100 bucks and going with an ASA 5506. I will never use one of theses for a client again. ASAs documentation is superior to this product. If the ASA is too much money for you then go with IPcop, PFsense, or some other opensource firewall.
