They changed the smooth leather to a grained leather which is really no big deal because the shoe still looks great. My issue is with the soles. I have only worn them for about a month and already the heels are showing signs of a slant. I know it is because of the way I walk but usually takes much longer to wear.

Is there something that can be done to reduce the squeak or make it go away? Can the shoes be replaced. They should not be doing this after only 2 months of wear. Any help is appreciated. Otherwise, they are very comfortable for me with a 4-5E wide foot. Tough to find wide comfortable shoes. The comfort is still there but the squeak is really bad. I have tried to remove the liner, dry them on a heater and let them sit for a few days with no change. Thanks.",

He is a carpenter with pain from a recent ankle injury and needs comfortable shoes, as well. He loves these shoes and I hope they last a while. Maybe we have finally found him a good pair of work shoes!",
