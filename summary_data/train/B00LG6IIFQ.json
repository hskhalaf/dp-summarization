After the second time, he complained again and cannot wear them, even though he loves the color/design. Because he's worn them twice, I don't think I can get my money back. I didn't ask to send them back so that's not a shot against the vendor. The shoes are simply too narrow for my son's foot and he's never complained about shoes before.",

They are lightweight, have good long laces (not too long), and flexible. Highly recommended.",
