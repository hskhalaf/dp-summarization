I've sent it back and awaiting the refund. The process of sending it back is truly a pain in the neck. I want to give the UviCube another chance but I just don't know if that would be a good idea. The other thing to consider is the size. I didn't mind the size but I can see that it may be a little large for some kitchen counters.",

It is pretty big so it can do a lot at once. Before we had this we used to steam sterilize everything but drying was always an issue. The bottles would still be wet by the time we went to use them next. This solved that problem.",

My wife especially loves it for things like her purse and certain waxed cotton (Barbour) jackets, which can't go in the wash, but still get germy from everyday use. It's the middle of flu season and I already find our family of 3 (including a very active and curious-fingered 2-year old) getting sick less often and for shorter durations than last winter.

It was only from South Korea and the plug would not work in the US so when I saw this come out I was so excited. About to be a second time mom and with my first I used the microwave steam thing but you had to put water in the bottom and they always come out with condensation on them and would never dry quick enough to put formula in them. This will dry and sanitize. It takes 45 minutes for perfect bottles to pour formula right into when it comes out. Absolutely love this product!",

So the outside gets sterilized but the parts that must be sterilized don't get cleaned. So basically it is a pretty box that is very expensive and won't work for the intended purpose. Along with the whole Mercury bulb as mentioned by the previous reviewer this thing got packed up faster than it was unwrapped. Sent back the next day. Not feeling confident to use this for our new preemie.",

I've tried sterilizing other things besides bottles, including my iphone, water bottles. It's super easy to use! I wish they had a smaller one so I could take it with me when I travelled! I also wish it is in orange because it's my favorite color. I would highly recommend this product to any new mom! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!",

    "description": "UviCube is the first baby-focused sanitizing device in the U.S. to utilize the germicidal properties of ultraviolet (UV) light on everything from baby bottles and pacifiers to mobile phones and electronics. Parents who wish to efficiently and conveniently sanitize items their babies use and touch everyday can use UviCube to eliminate 99.9% of harmful bacteria when exposed to UV light. UviCube was found to eliminate 99.9% of bacteria on surfaces exposed to UV light by a nationally recognized third party ISO 17025 accredited test facility in the United States, and in compliance with U.S. and international regulatory requirements for independence and impartiality of lab data. The study involved Salmonella Enterica, Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, Klebsiella Pneumoniae, Staphylococcus Aureus and Escherichia Coli. * Study results are available on the UviCube website. UviCube also dries and stores wet items such as baby bottles, pacifiers and cups without the risk burns, set-up or clean up. Items can be organized and stored until you need them. UviCube features a highly reflective inner chamber that maximizes the reach of UV light to kill bacteria on exposed surfaces of the contents inside, with the simple press of a button. Offering more versatility than just a simple baby bottle sterilizer, UviCubes UV light can be safer than boiling water or using hot steam, protecting users from the risk of burns, and is able to sanitize the surfaces of moisture and heat-sensitive items such as electronics and other personal items.",
