It does these things during simple tasks like making calls and using the web browser. This phone also has a very short battery life. It is constantly telling me that my SD card is full and will not let me take photos although I have deleted all of the photos from my SD card. I put my SD card in a different phone. And it showed the actual space left on it. I reset the phone many times and nothing has changed.",

Your monthly payment date remains the same every month as long as you successfully make your monthly payment. However, if you make a late payment, your payment date will be reset to the day of the month before the date your service is restored (e.g., if your service is restored on February 15th, your monthly payment date will be reset to March 14th).\n\nMISSED PAYMENT\nWhile it's best to make regular on-time payments each month, payments do not have to be consecutive. If you miss a payment you don't have to start over. The on-time payments made to the account will still be available as well as any savings milestone achieved.",
