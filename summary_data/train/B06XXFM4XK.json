I went with pretty neutral colors in my living room so needed something with a little pop, and this chair fit the bill nicely. I added an ottoman and a little Hollywood glam table with a lamp to pull it all together. As others have said, the seam in the back isn't terribly attractive, but against a wall it looks gorgeous. Love it!",

The fine details of this chair give it an elegant look and classy feel to fit any de\u0301cor. Super easy to put together, LOVE LOVE LOVE these chairs.",
