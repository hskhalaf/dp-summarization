I placed the caps in corners under the stove, fridge hall closet and other areas of the house. Each morning for the first four days the bait was completely consumed. On the fifth day most of the bait trays had only been partially consumed and by the sixth there was no longer any signs of roach activity. It has now been three weeks and we haven't seen a single roach. I am now only putting out two caps and refreshing the bait once a week.",
