The listing doesnt say it does but I assumed it did and then had to buy one after we got it and realized if we didnt want it to run on batteries that we needed one! So do yourself a favor and buy a cord with this keyboard!!",

The keyboard delivers great sounds from the onboard voice bank and with the setup I am using, I am able to create unreal synthesizer effects.

I see, when I look back at the description, that I neglected to notice this NECESSARY piece of equipment is not included. Now, I can understand optional items not being included in the package. But to not include something that is essential to the basic operation of the instrument? That's cheap!!! It's an instance, I say, of nickeling and diming the customer. What's next? Pretty soon they'll be sending out pianos that only have white keys. There will be spaces and mechanisms for the black keys, but you'll have to pay extra for the plastic tops, then snap them into place yourself.",

My children and I love it and we're happy we bought it. It was an expensive compared to most Yamaha pianos I really do prefer Yamaha instruments or Casio.
