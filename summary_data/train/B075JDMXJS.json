Especially when they show up at unexpected places. It is another addictive Resident Evil game. Highly recommend for those who love games where you have to explore and search and evade characters. I dont like the war games so much. But this is in my wheelhouse.",

For the record, it was the first RE game I ever played, and this didn\u2019t detract in the slightest from the experience. Resident Evil 2 remastered is another must play, and judging by the demo, RE3 remastered is shaping up to be even better than its predecessor. Honestly one of the best video game series ever. There\u2019s deeply detailed artistry, an engaging story, and it\u2019s just...really fun. Must buy for any console owner.",

It proved to be a worthwhile experience although one would not have know that this was a Resident Evil game without looking at the title.",
