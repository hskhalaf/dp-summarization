The pong balls are held by a pool noodle and double sided tape and that was off when i opened it. Even amazon tried to cover up some box damage by outting the shipping sticker over the damaged part of the box! I would give this zero stars if i could. I ordered other brand before and they were amazing but this brand is garbage! Do not buy!",

It\u2019s relatively easy to fold once you get the hang of it and easy to carry. There\u2019s a bottle opener attached to the table, but it\u2019s not really sturdy enough to use. Overall, I would recommend this table only if you can be gentle and not too crazy with bumping into it and diving on it for roll backs. Otherwise, I would recommend trying to find a sturdier table.",

The decals were peeling away from the corners all over and the gaps were very noticeable. I would not recommend this table to anyone that is looking for good quality.",
