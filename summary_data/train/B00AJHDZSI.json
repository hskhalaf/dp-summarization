A lot of internet services and companies are no longer listing this modem version as compatible . The modem itself is several years old . In tech time , that's a lifetime. Many of the advancements from the software side (and a few from hardware) have blown past it and this model can no longer handle the speeds / advances. I recommend finding another one that specifically suits your current needs.",

      "text": "Most cable companies try to get you lease their modems for a few buck (or more) a month. If you get a modem on your own, you can avoid paying a monthly fee forever for a modem that after a year, it would have made more sense to just buy one. Just one problem with this is that if the modem you buy stops working at about the year mark. It's unfortunate, but this modem started dropping its connection to the internet. Perhaps it's over heating. It got to the point where we had to unplug the modem and reset 3 or four times a day. They've got a two year warranty, so we'll have to check that out.",

The unit appears to dissipate about 4 watts in service, so it gets warm over time. The manual did not specify whether horizontal mounting was allowed, so I left it vertical as shown to ensure adequate cooling. The only gripe I have is the intensity of the blue LED status indicators. They are so bright as to illuminate a room at night, and the constant flickering would be distracting for anyone attempting to sleep, as in a studio apartment. I fixed this by covering the face and part of the sides of the unit with cardboard, leaving openings for cooling.",

There were some serious one-off technical problems but at least some of the confusion was due to my unit having *white* power & internet LEDs. All official documentation say those two LEDs will be *green* to indicate 'on', but for the SB6141 I received this was not the case. Those two LEDs are unambiguously white. So unambiguously dim-white that in all the types of lighting I've tried there is not a single hint of green. I'm not colorblind. This is really silly. Arris should update their documentation.",

      "text": "Super easy to install although the self-install didn't work with Comcast (go figure, something not working with Comcast!). Once they provisioned it online, everything went well. BTW, this is being used on a Comcast BUSINESS class service using a dynamic IP addressing versus the static IP's of their business modem. Stop paying Comcast $12.95 a month if you don't need five static IP addresses. It has been up since day one, not one dropout,no resets and it must do firmware updates in the dead of night because it never loses the connection.",

      "text": "Swapped out an X1 Xfinity cable modem by Motorola. Depending on your location, you may have to work with Xfinity tech to register your ARRIS cable modem MAC address. I had to. Took 5 minutes. Everything is working fine. No issues like the other folks. I have this connected to a Gigibit Asus router and gettting 160-170 Mbps with Xfinity Blast. Save $ 120 a month and get this modem. I purchased the 2Yr warranty just for piece of mind. I was able to return the Xfinity cable modem via the UPS Store and they returned the Xfinity cable modem for free.",
