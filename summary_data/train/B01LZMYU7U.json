The screen only works when it wants to (I have never dropped it), the phone is slow, the charging port is almost broke and it never does what you want or need it to do. It is a cheap phone and great for maybe a young kid or and older person who will not need to yes it all the time. I had to get a phone pretty quick being that My old LG stylo 2 had died on me. It's a great price but not a long term phone.",

So I sent the phone back and bought from Walmart.com, and I could not be happier with the phone, it was a great purchase.",

I don't see there's a battery save like the Galaxy has which is a small bummer. Over all its a nice phone for a good price",
