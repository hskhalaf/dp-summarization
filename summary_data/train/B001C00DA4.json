It's doing the job well. The price has gone up by almost $2 since I bought it, though. But if it truly lasts for 2000 flushes it may be worth it, although the cheaper 8 tablets are also working well. The tablet gives the toilet bowl a chlorine/bleach odor which is noticeable but not objectionable. Would I buy it again? The jury is still out, I have to see how it lasts compared to the other product. But so far it's doing the job!",
