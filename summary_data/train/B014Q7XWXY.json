    "title": "Water Balloon Launcher 400 Yards by Captain Splash, 3 Person Slingshot Cannon Catapult, 150 FREE Water Balloons & Carry Case Included. (Black, Extra Strong Latex Sling) 2019 Edition. Outdoor Games",
    "description": "Details \n\n \u2714 Captain Splash 400 Yard Water Balloon Launcher is made from extremely durable latex, real surgical tubing and rip-proof nylon and foam comfort grip handles. \n\n \u2714 The carry case is made of quality nylon and double stitched. \n\n \u2714 150 multicolored water balloons included. \n\n \u2714 Can launch water balloons, snowballs and other soft and light promotional items up to 400 yards. \n\n \u2714 Hassle free Money-Back Guarantee. Recommended for children 16 years or older. \n\n If using around small children, keep safety in mind. The instructions to use the launcher may seem easy, but there is a small learning curve. It will take some practice before being able to launch incredible distances. \n\n How to Use \n\n At least 3 people are needed to be able to use the launcher. Fill up water balloons to about the size of a tennis ball. This will insure that the balloon does not burst when letting go of the pouch during launch. \n\n Two players stand three feet apart facing their target, each grasping one of the vinyl grips with their inside hand. A third player (launcher) will then load the water balloon into the pouch with one hand holding the nylon handle and the other hand cupping the balloon into the pouch. The launcher will then pull back (no further than eight feet), aim at the target and let go. Never aim at eye level. \n\n Tip: Once you fill your water balloons, leave them in a bucket of water, since Water Balloon Launcher Balloons are constructed to break easier to avoid injuries. \n\n Captain Splash Water Balloon Launchers will have you winning every water balloon fight, or snowball fight. Amaze with accuracy and monster distances.",
