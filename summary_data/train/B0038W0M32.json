      "text": "I am actually going to buy this chair a second time. After 7 years there was only minimal wear until someone MUCH too large for it sat in it for a few weeks (about 400lbs). I recommend adhering to the weight limit, otherwise the fake leather starts to peel off under the weight. But the chair itself did hold up. I'm giving it to someone who needs a chair. I really like the tilt feature and the padded arm rests (for me) are in the perfect place and are soft enough - my husbands padded arms start to hurt my elbows after a while.",

Yes, if you are not very handy and this is your first assembly ever then you might struggle. This is a one man job, takes 20-30 mins. The arm rests are the tricky part but after that, its pretty basic. I strongly recommend this chair because even for me (an individual exceeding the weight limit by 70 pounds) it is comfortable.",

However, only after 2 weeks of use, it has developed extremely loud snapping/popping creaks! Especially when leaning upright/forward in the chair. I use this chair daily for computer use, and I find it rather annoying while using my microphone. Also, if the company changed it's seat cushion mounting bracket to a wider quality, lesser wobbly, and quiet one, I would've paid ten more dollars for this chair. ($160.00) To get rid of the creaking noise, you have to apply some oil to each of the main mounting screws that attach to the bottom of the seat cushion",

The problems arose in joining the arms to the back part of the chair and took me over an hour to actually finish assembling it. For anyone who is not used to DIY, I think they would struggle putting the chair together. Other than that though, once the chair was assembled, it looks great. Just be prepared to spend quite a long time getting to this point first.",

My advice is to tighten all screws with a screwdriver, then take a seat in it and lean back to let it 'stretch' out a bit, then use a ratcheting chuck drill to get the screws in fully. not worth the price.",

It gives the visual impression that it is just going to sink in and hug your body, but it is actually fairly supportive. Don't get me wrong, it's soft but not like a pillow. Arm rests are nicely padded. I'm very happy with the overall feel. I spend many hours a day in this chair.",
