It is such an improvement over my previous backpack that was a big bag with a small pouch on top; its mesh side pockets could not secure water bottles. The 5.11 side pockets can each hold a insulated bottle in zippered security plus it does have a pouch for a water bladder.",

When fully loaded the main compartment I\u2019d about 21 inches tall. It is a large pack, with many large auxiliary pockets, but it not as large as advertised. The second problem is that the shoulder straps dig into my neck somewhat. More annoying than uncomfortable, perhaps. Otherwise, a very good pack.",

Us the molle makes it very modular. I stuff everything I can into mine before adding any molle attachments. Anyway, great backpack. I recommend it",

It was extremely comfortable to carry as designed, held up well, no issues with the zippers or any other moving part.

This pack, with the addendums, delivers! The pack has quite a bit of room. I like the middle fold out bag as well for dirty clothes after I'm done at the gym. Lots of interior zippered pockets which make organization a breeze. Highly Recommended!",

This bag will hold a small body in it if needed.. its that big! It almost feels more like 2 bags attached to eachother as the outter bag holds as much or more than most kids backpacks! The main compartment routes the hydration without any issue and the comfort once I have the bag on is amazing. I forget the bags size. Im fairly happy with this bag and am looking forward to seeing how it holds up!",

Not sure how I feel yet about the split type with space in between. It was ok, but not quite useful all the time. Sides were great for water bottles and shoes. Sunglasses compartment rocks. VERY comfortable to wear. Gets pretty thick though when packed. However, the straps allow for a lot of tightening. black color nice for deployment and back home in/out of uniform. Black color collects dust though in the AOR. Held all my gear needed for over a week of travel into and around the AOR.",

Nylon straping connecting with buckles to shoulder straps seems very poorly made and unlikely to last long. (That comment honestly applies to all of the nylon straping on the entire pack). The bag material (assuming it's the 1050 nylon/cordura as advertised) seems thin,cheap and also unlikely to last. I'm kinda disappointed about this backpack because it seems like the 5.11 is regarded for such high quality and honestly a lot of companies try to be and want to make similar products. Man, things are not made like they once where.",
