      "verdict": "Folks liking the Pathfinder Mid CSWP simply for its glove-like fit are vastly missing out on its other great things. The gear also has exceptional lightness, huge amounts of comfort, and an almost non-existent softening period. However, they might get disappointed because of its unruly laces. To sum up, the Salomon Pathfinder Mid CSWP is more than capable of emboldening hikers on the trail. People who are still quite concerned about its slick laces can either lace up with double knots or replace them with considerably effective ones.",

They were too small so I exchanged them for a size 9.5 and again, they are too small to wear. The problem is now a size 10 will put the toe box so far out in front of my normal feet that they won't be wearable, except like clown shoes. If you wear wool boot socks I suggest highly ordering a full size large and expecting the fit to be odd. I really wanted to like these boots but I just can't order another size up. Time to head to the local store and try on what actually fits.",
