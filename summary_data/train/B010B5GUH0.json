The materials look much better, and they don't feel like cheap plastic. The lenses are far darker than the Gunnars, and they affect color integrity to a much greater extent. So much so that I DO NOT recommend these for gaming or graphic design. For programming or general office desk work, these are fantastic. But they affect the color far too much for other uses. Gunnars will remain at home for gaming use, these are going to work with me.",

They have made a noticeable difference in how fast I can fall asleep by blocking the blue light that disrupts melatonin. I still try and turn off the tv an hour before bed but wear the glasses 1-2 hours before that. They are made out of very sturdy and good quality materials (frame, lens, and hinge spring) the only fault I have with it is - for me being a male with a larger face- the regular size frame is a bit on the small side. I would like to see a larger frame made.",

The Swannies felt more uncomfortable around the bridge of my nose. And the lenses are identical. THL Sleep actually seems to block more blue light. Swannies do seem to have less glare though. But they are also a lot more expensive. They do block blue light, but so do cheaper options. You don't need verified tests to know when they're blocking blue light.",

Florescent office lights and lighting in stores, etc. bother me tremendously. I also have a hard time with transitioning from light to dark (driving at dusk, etc.). So I bought these hoping they would give me a little relief. They are fabulous! I am actually enjoying going shopping again. I know my purpose differs somewhat from the advertised use but these really cut down the glare and keep my diseased eyes from getting fatigued by the afternoon. They are also well-made and look decent on.",

My only complaints are that the arms are a bit long for my head so they tend to get pushed forward if I try to lay down, but they have to be one size fits all so I understand. Also, I can't use them to watch tv at night because I wear prescription glasses to see far away. Great for nighttime electronic trading though!",
