I watched a review by CNET rating the top 2019 wireless over the ear headphones. Of course all of them were the high end headphones $200+. The reviewer did a special mention of the Tribit Xfree and praised it for its quality of sound and stated it could compete with high end models. Needless to say they do perform as well as the high end models for a fraction of the cost. The sound really is amazing. I highly recommend these.",

Ear cups are soft and large, but the lack of articulation is a big issue. This means you cannot get the ear cups exactly fit to your head/ears, so it may cause stress or pain after using for a while. This is exacerbated for those with larger heads where the headband must be extended more, creating even more of an angled fit. It's too bad these have this design flaw, because other than that they are very solid earphones. The EarFun Wave appear to be nearly the exact same headphones if you look those up.",

I only complain about the bulk and they do look a little goofy on my average sized head. I wish the design was sleeker with slimmer pads. However they are extremely comfortable. Ultimately, you won't find better sound at this price. They sound comparable to my studio quality Sony headphones ($80 wired headphones). Sound quality is king, and these rock. Fantastic.",

Lastly, they are way too loud. Even on the lowest setting, they are above what I would like. So if you like to listen to things at a moderate volume, these are not for you.",

Very good quality, very comfortable, & True To Life Audio w/genuine Deep Base. 35 yrs of Audio, Vid, & Broadcasting, & I've prob worn over 20 diff headsets & the Tribit XFree is definitely the most comfortable w/high quality, while rivaling $300 sets w/its sound. So I implore you, if you desire Quality, Comfort, & True To Life Audio, buy these now! OK, you've been fed. I'm going for 2nd's before the price goes up. Happy listening :^)",

The bass however lacks seriously It's not active noise cancelling but does a good job isolating outside noise. In conclusion this is an excellent headphone for who listen to music with soft sound. Hip hop listeners might want to try something else because of the low bass.",

For some songs the treatment of the treble was rather poor and instruments sounded like static as opposed to.......well..... instruments. But for the price.... It's okay... Perhaps good.

I taped it, but it just seems to me this shouldn't happen. Also, I have had some charging issues--I leave it plugged for a day, and it doesn't charge. I think there may be a problem with the connection. I left them charging all day--didn't work, and now it doesn't even fit on my ear because it broke. Bummed, I use them a lot.",
