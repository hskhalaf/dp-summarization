The tote straps are too short to put on your shoulder, and a fully loaded bag is quite heavy on one shoulder like a crossover messenger. I'll probably convert mine to utilize the backpack straps off of my BFF to get more functionality.",

Makes everything organized and easy to access. There is even a changing pad included! Size - big enough to carry everything and even some Material - strong and durable, can take a beating Fabric design - nice and colorful, very vibrant and cheerful What I don't like - full price is steep",

Neutral and probably useful after the baby stage is over, but it's definitely not the most stylish diaper bag. For my purposes, function won over form, so this bag is great.",
