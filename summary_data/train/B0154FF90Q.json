She swallowed it, and passed it thankfully. This is a design flaw, you should not have a piece of plastic hitting a piece of metal. The company was very nice/concerned and did issue us a refund, and is passing the broken gate over to their quality control team, but a gate designed to keep babies away from choking hazards should not be so easily broken.",

I got fed up with trying to figure out how to flip things around, so I just zip tied together what didn't connect properly. However, for the price, I shouldn't have to use zip ties to make things work. Connecting the pieces should be more flexible, so that we can buy more sets down the road.

It has to be very deliberately closed to insure that the lock is all the way secure. It\u2019s easy to open one handily but closing it isn\u2019t as easy. It can half way lock and if it\u2019s pushed on it\u2019ll open. I would still recommend this gate but you just have to make sure it\u2019s actually locked.",

Also it's pretty flimsy and has a lot of \"wiggle room\" no matter how tight we get it (though we have it installed over tile, and the feet would probably hold it steadier on carpet), and the door is a bit of a pain to close. Overall feeling, it gets the job done but I'll be happy when we don't need it anymore.",
