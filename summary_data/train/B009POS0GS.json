The second monitor had the exact same problems. I spent hours on the phone with customer support and they could do nothing. They said it may be my motherboard. So I took the monitor to my job and it was terrible there too. Overall it is the worst monitor I have ever seen. I have a free throwaway from my friend which is much better and that monitor is 8 years old. Go with a different brand or at least a different model.",

It's not the worst thing in the world to have happen but it is disappointing especially because I bought these monitors specifically to run 144 FPS.",

Through the hdmi port you can only get up to 60hz... so DO NOT buy this if you have a newer graphics card.",

The quality is much above my previous \"traditional\" monitors in both picture quality and buttery smoothness. There's a great little trick you can apply to the monitor that utilizes the light boost tech for a smoothness that's similar to a CRT monitor which is REALLY cool. All you need to do is lookup the model number and lightboost on YouTube. I haven't tried the 3D itself yet, still need to get those $100 nvidia glasses... I'm very tempted though. Otherwise I'm extremely happy with the purchase.",
