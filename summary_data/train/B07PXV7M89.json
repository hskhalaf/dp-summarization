The lack of a disk drive puts me at bay since I know the feeling of a single scratch putting my favorite game out of service. Now I just share my game library and Gold subscription with his Xbox and my own. P.S. It was not cheaper than buying a console with a disk drive, I just wanted my brother to have something new.
