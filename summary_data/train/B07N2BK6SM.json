      "text": "I\u2019ve had my pc for 2 months now. I bought a new mouse and keyboard to use, but sadly when I plug any usb device into my pc, it says drivers can\u2019t be found. I also can\u2019t download updates for windows for some reason. Contacted support and was told to download the chipset driver from their website. So I did, and as soon as it downloaded I\u2019ve been stuck at a black screen. That\u2019s been 3 days now. Their support has been very reluctant to do anything for me. Save urself time and hassle, don\u2019t buy a PC with AMD graphics cards. I believe this is the problem.",

Very happy with my purchase. It is a little noisy, but much of that can't be helped. Wish they would have put in 16Gb of RAM instead of just 8Gb, considering the cost to them would be very small, but I can do that so I can't complain too much. Have not yet needed Tech Support, so I can't comment on the quality of that. Also wish the keyboard had backlights, but the mouse is pretty nice looking. Would buy again.",

Even the cable management inside looks great. Came in fast and without a doubt I rate this PC 10/10.",

Very rarely does the system get hot and fans are quiet. I do recommend getting a CPU fan, but the stock CPU fan does its job fairly well.",
