Have never had a complaint-until now. These were stale. They did not melt in my mouth as it always had. The picture shows the truffle after being bit into. My past experience has been biting into a Godiva chocolate is NOT a breaking up bite, but a soft, smooth melting bite with both the outer chocolate and the soft insides coming together. These broke the outer chocolate and, believe, me it tasted like they had been sitting in a store window for six months--Godiva would be appalled. Will not purchase from any where but Godiva.",
