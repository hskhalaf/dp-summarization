Searching for a quick, effortless, cordless vacuum, we were reluctant to spend a bunch of $...maybe just haul out the electric model instead. We took a chance on the Fluffy and it turned out great. Works so well on bare floors and also works very good on area carpets. The price is good...the product quality is there...buy it.",
