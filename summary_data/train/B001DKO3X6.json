In the past I have even used a ice scrapper with a brass blade called the Fantastic Ice Scaper with brass blade and it too left scratches but that was a different car. So I guess the lesson is to expect fine scratches from ice scrappers and to rarely use them unless you don't care about the scratches. Hence my okay three star rating.",

(This handle is quite robust and may be somewhat awkward in a smaller hand). Recently multiple layers of sleet, snow and freezing rain where dumped on us.

I ended up ordering 2 of these, one for my truck and one for my wife's car.",

It does a superior job of getting close to the car surface without scratching. We have serious frost/snow in the Tennessee mountains and this did a great job on my car. I got caught in snow while out shopping. I simply pulled out this scraper and cleaned my windows back/front and drove home. Fast, easy and it gets super close for a clean finish. I highly recommend this.",
