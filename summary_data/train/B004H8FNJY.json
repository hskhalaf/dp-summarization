      "text": "I purchased this camera three years ago and i surpasses most cameras today (2017). The video is fantastic and the photos are equally amazing. The camera is simple to use. The onnly thing I would change is the location of the movie button. This is a minor point and newer Sony cameras have the movie button on top for easy use. The Zeiss lense is without equal and a 5 powerr true optical zoom is adequate for most situations. The digital zoom is okay, but pixelation can become a factor. I rarely use the 16 megapixel setting except for very unique photos. 5 megapixels is fine for almost everything I shoot. Would definitely buy again and recommend to my friends.",

      "text": "I purchased this camera because of it's good reviews for use in low light situations, and it did not disappoint. I used my previous camera at one of my children's graduation in a large auditorium, and the majority of the pictures came out very dark, even with the flash on. I used this camera at the next graduation, and the difference was noticeable. No more dark pictures. It is also small and lightweight. I bought a soft shell zipper case for it and normally carry it in my purse. It's light and takes up very little room. Great camera, great picture quality, and great price.",

The videos are excellent and the audio too. The camera offers settings for different shots in different scenarios. The photographs in dark places do very well. Cons: The digital zoom is good but must improve to take pictures over long distances. The battery lasts a very short but this is solved by buying another battery. Conclusion: Excellent camera, very fast and very good for taking photographs is a pocket camera. Excellent seller, the purchase was made \u200b\u200bwithout any problem.",

      "text": "I bought this and the Sony dsc-hx7v at the same time. Other reviewers have already covered pros and cons so i'll just mention why I returned the wx9. I decided to keep the hx7v and was convinced the $70 difference over the dsc-wx9 was well worth it. I took pictures of the same scenes with both cameras and the hx7v just seemed to take sharper pictures overall. I also noticed the hx7v had a much better flash (brighter and farther range than the wx9) and the 10x zoom came in handy many times. These are the main factors that made me return the wx9.",

The picture quality is incredible and there are a lot of features, that even after owning this for a year, I have yet to really utilize. One really cool setting is the panoramic setting - the outcome is incredible! Another one is the available scene selections - there are 14 to choose from and they really do aid in taking fantastic pictures. The menu is easy to navigate through and the screen is large and bright. Definitely worth the money!",

This camera takes great pictures and is very simple to use. I purchased an underwater enclosure for it and used it for SCUBA diving the Caribbean. It works very well in low light settings and the flash is powerful enough for underwater shots (within 3' of subject). It takes very good video 1080i, but this does tend to drain the battery quicker (no surprise there). All in all a very good little camera.",

I own a Mac and the videos cannot download on my iPhoto as the other cameras could. Instead, I have to download them on iMovie for some reason and I have to download all or none of the videos.

Aside from that, it was the best $150 i spent :)!!!",

    "title": "Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-WX9 16.2 MP Exmor R CMOS Digital Still Camera with Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar 5x Wide-Angle Optical Zoom Lens and Full HD 1080/60i Video (Black)",
    "description": "Color:BlackFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\nSony DSC-WX9 \u2013 unrestricted power in a compact package. With powerful features like Full HD movie for high quality movies, low light performance for improved image clarity, 10 fps to capture the precise moment, and 3D still image capture for a new way to experience your pictures, you wouldn\u2019t believe something so compact could be this powerful. Sony DSC-WX9 Feature Highlights\n\n16.1 Megapixel Back-illuminated \u201cExmor R\u201d CMOS Image Sensor\nThe DSC-WX9 features a 16.1 megapixel \u201cExmor R\u201d CMOS image sensor that brings out the full resolving power of the camera\u2019s Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar lens to deliver extremely fast speed, high resolution, and stunning low-light sensitivity with improved image clarity and drastically reduced grain. In addition, the combined \u201cExmor R\u201d CMOS sensor and BIONZ image processor delivers extremely fast 10fps, Anti Motion Blur, Hand-held Twilight and 1080i movie modes3.\n3.0-inch XtraFine \n3.0-inch XtraFine technology gives you deeper blacks and more color in your display, all while being thinner than most LCDs.\n\nFull HD 1080@60i\nRecord crystal clear movies at the highest resolution available with capabilities for 60i in 1080 AVCHD3. This provides stunning, fast motion video with less distortion for playback on your HD TV.\n3D still image and panorama \nProduce awe-inspiring images with 3D still image and 3D Sweep Panorama capabilities4. Photos will take on a new dimension of creative capabilities for viewing the world in a whole new way.\niSweep Panorama \nWith iSweep Panorama just press the shutter, pan the landscape and let the camera do the rest. It automatically links together each frame to produce a panoramic image. This model even detects faces and moving subjects to stitch intelligently different widths to help avoid subject distortion.\nBackground Defocus \nDSLR photographs are often beautiful because they blur the background, putting the emphasis on the subject. Now our point-and-shoot cameras can deliver this signature DSLR benefit. The system takes two shots, identifies the background and applies a defocused background keeping the subject crisp and clear.\nBacklight Correction HDR \nDon\u2019t miss a single detail in high contrast shots. The built in backlight correction analyzes the image and automatically adjusts accordingly to give you a perfectly lit shot. Backlight Correction HDR helps correct for this by taking three pictures at different exposure settings and processing the best elements of each into a single image for more natural looking shots.\n\nSuperior Auto Mode \nGet cleaner, more dynamic pictures and fewer missed shots. The camera automatically recognizes the correct scene mode, then quickly shoots and combines up to six shots to produce images with greater clarity, optimum dynamic range using backlight correction HDR technology and lower image noise using 6 shots layering technology. Superior Auto intelligently detects 36 scenes for still images and 44 scenes for movies, making it easy to get the best shot.\nDigital Zoom \nCapturing the right shot at the right moment has never been so easy. Digital zoom brings the action up close to get that perfect shot, every time. \nOptical SteadyShot image stabilization \nOptical SteadyShot image stabilization uses a built-in gyro sensor to detect camera shake and automatically shifts the lens to help prevent blur without sacrificing image quality.\nSoft Skin Mode \nPortrait subjects will love the results. Soft Skin mode recognizes skin tones and reduces the appearance of blemishes and wrinkles without affecting the rest of the shot.\nNatural Flash \nConventional point-and-shoot camera flash shots just don't capture colors the way the eye sees them. Natural Flash mode takes a reference shot without flash and then uses that reference to correct the color, for far more lifelike images.\nCarl Zeiss Vario-Tessar Lens with 25mm equivalent wide 5x Optical Zoom\nThe high-performance Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar 5x optical zoom lens brings distant subjects closer for video recording as well as for outdoor, sports, and travel photos, and Close Focus shoots close-ups up to just under \u00bd-inch from the subject. A wide angle of 25mm equivalent wide-angle lens allows you to take wider shots of the scene or group in crowded spaces.\n\nHDMI output \nThe High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) is a compact audio/video connector interface for transmitting uncompressed digital streams. HDMI connects digital audio/video sources such as a compatible camcorder, Blu-ray Disc player, a personal computer, a video game console, or an AV receiver to a compatible digital audio device and/or video monitor such as a digital television (DTV). Easily connect your Cyber-shot camera via HDMI cable to any compatible HDMI compatible device to easily enjoy and upload content6.\nSmile Shutter technology\nSmile Shutter technology captures a smile the moment it happens. Simply press the Smile Shutter button and the camera does the rest. You can also select adult and child priority and indicate the degree of Smile Detection Sensitivity. Intelligent Scene Recognition can be used together with Smile Shutter mode. This means that beautiful smiles can be captured with settings optimized for the particular scene, even in difficult conditions such as twilight and backlighting.\nFace Detection technology\nSony\u2019s Face Detection technology can automatically distinguish between children and adults. Face Detection technology detects up to eight individual faces and adjusts flash, focus, exposure, and white balance to help deliver crisp, properly lit images of family and friends.\nMotion Detection\nMotion Detection, along with Face Motion Detection adjusts ISO sensitivity and increases the shutter speed when movement is detected, reducing blur in moving subjects and faces.\nAnti-blink Function\nIt\u2019s frustrating to capture the perfect shot, only to review it later and discover subjects blinked during the photo. When the camera is set to Soft Snap, the Anti-blink function captures two images, recording only the photo with less squinting or blinking. If a blink is detected in other shooting modes, a warning will be displayed after you take the shot.\nSweep Multi Angle Mode \nIn Sweep Multi Angle mode, the camera takes 15 images at different angles as it sweeps across the scene. By tilting the camera during playback, the camera\u2019s Gyro Sensor detects motion and displays the image in a 3D-like view on the camera\u2019s LCD.\nAnti-Motion Blur Mode\nCapture cleaner and sharper images in low light for non landscape shots. When set in Anti-motion Blur Mode, the DSC-WX9 captures six images in a fraction of a second with higher shutter speed and combines the data from all six to create a single image of extraordinary detail and dramatically reduce subject blur, beyond the capability of traditional cameras.\n\nTransferJet technology \nTransferJet technology, developed by Sony and advanced and promoted by consortium of 18 other companies, allows you to transfer up to ten files between two TransferJet enabled devices just by touching their TransferJet logos together, without the hassle of hunting for cables or the complication of pairing5.\n\nCompatible with PC and MAC Systems \nThe high definition, AVCHD, video captured with the DSC-WX9 can be used with the provided Picture Motion Browser software1 for PC and iMovie (sold separately) for Mac systems\u00b2.\nIncludes Sony PMB (Picture Motion Browser) Software ver. 5.51\nSony Picture Motion Browser software offers a simple, intuitive way to transfer, sort, and view your video and still images on your compatible PC. In addition, multiple output options let you burn your memories to DVD using an external DVD burning device (sold separately), as well as take advantage of one click upload to a number of popular video and photo sharing sites (such as Facebook and Sony\u2019s Personal Space). Using the new 5.5 version also enables playback of 3D images taken on the Cyber-shot camera.\nIncludes Sony PMB Portable software2 \nWith the pre-installed Picture Motion Browser (PMB) Portable software2 the DSC-WX9 makes it easy to pre-select videos and images in the camera and conveniently upload them from the camera to a compatible PC and popular Internet sharing sites7 without the need for any additional software or install. \n 1. PMB requires Microsoft Windows XP SP3/ Windows Vista SP2/Windows 7 environments not supported. Not supported by Mac OS. \n 2. Uploading directly to the web requires PMB Portable (ver 5.5) for Windows; (ver 1.3) for Mac software and USB cable (included), and PC with internet connectivity. Windows XP SP3 64-bit and Starter Edition and Windows Vista Starter Edition environments not supported. \n 3. Movie recording is limited to 29 minute segments.\n 4. 3D viewing requires 3D HDTV, a high speed HDMI cable (supporting at least 10.2 Gbps) connection and 3D glasses (all sold separately).\n 5. TransferJet enabled media (sold separately) and TransferJet technology required in both devices. Interoperability and compatibility among TransferJet enabled devices may vary.\n 6. HD Viewing requires an HD output adapter cable (VMC-MD3) and compatible HDTV, both sold separately.\n 7. Requires compatible wireless access point(s). Some features may rely on Internet services.",
