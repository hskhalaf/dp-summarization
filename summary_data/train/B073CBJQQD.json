They were really stiff at first, and it took a few times out to get them worn in, but that was to be expected with a more platform sole. Now that they\u2019re broken in, they\u2019re very comfy.

Not something I didn\u2019t expect, but it is wearing out faster than I thought it would with wearing 1-2 days a week (I have the sole around the heel coming apart).
