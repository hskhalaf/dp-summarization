And it eliminates a lot of extra math trying to figure out what the clocks should be changed to when the visible clock is counting down and the backup clock is counting up.",

We've used these in rain and snow with no problems. One complaint is that the battery lasted less than a year, much less than some other more expensive stop watches we've had. However, considering the batteries are extremely cheap to replace, it's still much less expensive than other options even if I have to replace a battery every year, so I'm not removing a star.",
