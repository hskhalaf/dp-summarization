I ended up returning it and replaced it with a Denon receiver for $150 less with many more capabilities. The Soundblaster control panel software never installed properly on my Windows 7 64 bit Professional system. Creative tech support was unable to diagnose my issue which was another reason I returned the amplifier.",

However after a day of use, I have given up. The software is very difficult to configure and use, and the hardware did not seem to be an improvement over my 2 year old Sound Blaster X-Fi Surround 5.1 Pro. I even applied the firmware upgrade and it did not help. I think the X7 is really trying to be the answer to everything, but winds up being not good at anything.",
