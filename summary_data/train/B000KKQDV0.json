I have grit in my eyes and hair! I'm past the return date, so I'm just tossing it. The \"gear\" on the stand sounds damaged. Totally unhappy with this company. Buyer beware!",

We removed the tree and emptied the stand to find a large crack in the bottom plastic. I have no idea how that base would crack, it was stored safely and never dropped. I've attempted to contact Krinner but I expect I'll get the same response many in here have gotten, nothing helpful.",

      "text": "I have had this thing since 2012. It's great. Everyone I know who buys a tree balks that I paid $100 for a tree stand. I always ask them how long they have had their tree stand and they always say about 10+ years. So if you could pay $10 a year for a tree stand that saves time, is easy to use and setup and probably get more than 10 years out of it... would you? They always say \"That's true.\" and never buy it. Don't be like my friends.... do yourself a favor buy a xmas tree stand that will save you time and frustration.",

Just put it in the stand, step on the foot lever until the bell rings (three steps in my case) and voila--it's done. Stand is nice and heavy, and seems very sturdy. I particularly like that it has a low profile, so I didn't need to cut off a lot of the branches on the bottom of the tree like I did with my last stand. The only complaint I have is that I didn't buy one of these years ago! Highly recommended!",

This even has a gauge to let you know how much water is in it, but it does get a little clogged with tree degree, giving a false reading. Like other and possibly all tree stands, it's a little difficult to fill with water. I recommend making something to fill it with.",

      "text": "My family loves real Christmas trees but we\u2019ve endured decades of frustration and teetering firs because of balky tree stands. The Krinner stand is a beautifully engineered godsend that works. Its sturdy cable-based grasping system holds the tree firmly and works with just a few pumps on the lever- instead of endlessly turning 4 or 5 bolts that may or may not support the tree. The handy float eliminates guesswork about water level. This device is a wonderful product that is long overdue. If you enjoy real Christmas trees, you\u2019ll love this product!",

Ever since we got this tree stand we've had several family and friends buy one as well. Everyone loves it. The design is genius and always make us think why this wasn't around back in the day. I can't recommend this tree stand enough. Buy it!",

My wife wanted me to slide the whole thing over to the side of our living room, and it slid very easy on our carpet. I filled the reservoir up with water until the water gauge popped up. I have never put up a tree so fast. If you use a tree stand, this is the one to get. It is sturdy, and should last a lifetime",
