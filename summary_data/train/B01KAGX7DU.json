But the 170 (the backlit model) is twice the money. I think I'm happy with what I got. Thank God I was able to turn off that annoying beep. I think the bike looks very clean too.",

On the first use, it started making this \"clunk\" noise when you pedaled (what other reviewers have alluded to) at random times. It's annoying even when you have headphones on, as you can feel it through your body. Don't buy it. Pay a bit more and buy something else, or buy from a shop with good service.",

The repair tech found the right pedal set of crank ball bearing were installed backwards! After installing the new ones correctly, the sound was gone! So, it was a manufacturer's assembly issue. Perhaps this may be the reason others have heard the same sound. I called within a week of assembling the bike. Glad I did as Nautilus was very efficient.",

Every 30-40 miles it seems, I have to tighten the bolts that hold the pedals, or they will make a sound while I am pedaling. That is how quiet this bike is when all screws and bolts are tight. Schwinn says you have to tighten everything periodically anyway. This is a great bike if you eant the basics, and I fully recommend it.",

      "text": "This bike, for the price, is great! The only complaint I have is that my heels want to hit the pedal shaft. I have size 13 feet, perhaps the problem. My wife and teenage children do not have this problem. We really like the input for devices, such as cell phones and MP3 players. Speakers and fan work well. The operation of the unit is very quiet. Nice! The bike arrived in great shape and was pretty east to install, with the help of my son. So far... so good.",

Giving 4 stars only because the holes on the control pad did not line up to the bike so we could only put three screws in rather than four. But it is still very stable. Also the control pad is very dim. But other than that I love it. Easy assembly but two people are needed for one step to connect the main frame to the front pole. It looks great in my office and takes up very little room.",
