      "verdict": "Still relevant even after its release decades ago, the Adidas Samba Classic lives up to its name. The durability of this soccer cleat has been highly regarded. As far as comfort is concerned, the purchasers were satisfied with how soft the soccer cleats are after breaking them in. However, there were some who were less than happy with the arch support feature found on the insole. The traction gets all praises from reviewers. Overall, this soccer cleat is indeed a good pair given its durability, traction, and comfort.",
      "pros": [
        "An overwhelming amount of reviewers lauded the comfort provided by the Adidas Samba Classic soccer cleat",

        "This soccer cleat has been praised for its durability with many users disclosing that their pair lasted them several years",
        "A few reviewers noted that the design of the soccer cleat is casual enough to serve as everyday wear",

      "cons": [
        "A number of reviewers shared that because of the gum rubber outsole, the Adidas Samba Classic is on the heavier side of the spectrum",

        "It is a common complaint among users that the arch support feature in the insole is too high",
        "One reviewer mentioned that it takes a while to break in the soccer cleat"

And 2. these shoes don't offer a huge amount of grip when walking outside which is fine most of the time, but I've definitely slipped a couple times when it's wet or on certain surfaces.",
