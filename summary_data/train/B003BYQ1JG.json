Reached out to the company and they suggested i buy another scratching post to replace the ripped up one. Except i paid $40 for this tree, and dont think i can convince myself to pay around $20 just to replace one part of the tree. That just shows how money hungry they are.

They both use it differently. Right now the little guy is sleeping on the top perch upstairs, after climbing and scratching on it. It is certainly a better value and seems more sturdy than cat trees we previewed at the big box pet stores. Assembly was quick (maybe 20 minutes because the cats kept investigating).

      "text": "I bought this cat tree in 2014 and my cats have loved it to death. It's completely shredded and destroyed so time for a replacement. I'm so happy that this particular tree is still being sold because I'm going to just buy a replacement. This tree has been very sturdy and was a great purchase. My cats love how tall it it, but it has a pretty small footprint, and still remains stable. Despite a very active Siamese, who leaps before she looks, they've never managed to knock it over. The only thing that has broken on this cat tree - the little toys. Those lasted about a day! But I didn't buy this cat tree for the toys.",

We used to have the kind that use a spring rod to cling to the ceiling but after a year of them jumping on the tree that eventually broke down and we had to keep replacing them. This one has a wide enough base so it doesn't really move when they jump on it.",

Against sand colored carpet and light yellow walls, it sort of fades into the background and doesn't take over a room despite the large size. It's quite sturdy when placed against a wall. The only thing I don't like is the back of the stairs is uncovered particle board, so if you want to place it sideways against a wall (which works better in my space), you end up looking at a pretty ugly unfinished surface. My cat isn't into the stairs anyway, so I may just take them off--doesn't seem like they're structural.",

One of our kitties turned into a 10 lb monster (who we affectionately call \"the dumpling\") and even when she throws herself at it full force, I'm not worried about it tipping over. Overall a great, sturdy product that I hope our cats will enjoy for many years to come!",
