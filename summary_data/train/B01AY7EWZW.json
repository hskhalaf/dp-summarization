I would highly recommend it as the sound is awesome for an 8-inch cube speaker and it has great features such as Internet radio which you can set to your favorite station and it'll come on automatically every time you turn it on. Also it works very well with Tidal and Spotify streaming services. I use it as a TV speaker for my LG short throw projector as well, and it's a real space saving combination. If it were possible I would deduct half a star for not including the remote control which you can buy separately. Sure, you can use the app instead but the remote should be included at this price point.",

Wait, this is just one BOX with built in speakers. No way to compare with home theater with multi speaker system. Once I realized this key point, I start enjoying it.",

The music keeps cutting out and it seems to be on a time rhythm that is consistent. About 25 sec on and then it cuts out for about the same. For this price, I'm very disappointed, not sure if its a design flaw or a cheap bluetooth receiver but I'm sorry I bought this product. When its functioning, the sound quality is good for a single source audio speaker, but not impressive. I have an old Bose Sound that would kill this thing in audio quality. A waste of money.......",

Plus my modem is just in the next room about 10feet away and when I play music it cuts in and out. My Boise was way cheaper than this and no problem at all getting connected and staying connect where ever I was in the house or even the yard. Yes it sounds wonderful but not if you can't get it to connect. I wouldn't buy this again or recommend it to my friends.",
