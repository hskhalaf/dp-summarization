My big complaint, however, is that the brackets that hold the watch band to the watch case break easily. Research it and see for yourself (as I did after the fact.) SUUNTO replaced the watch case without any hassles. They said the watches made in 2018 have a defect. Then why not pull them from retail stocks!!?? Supposedly , you can tell by the serial number, the first two digits being 18.",

My only beef with the watch is the actual color of the watch. I was disappointed when I opened the box. The photos on the Suunto website are misleading. They use more saturated photos of the watch leading one to think the color is darker than what you get. The photos on the Amazon page are slightly more accurate. However, the actual watch color is more of a washed-out off-white green. If you want a bold color, choose something other than Ocean.",
