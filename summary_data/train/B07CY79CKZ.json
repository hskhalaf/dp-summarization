      "text": "UPDATE: Installed a 500GB SSD and now this computer is very fast. Too bad Acer went with a cheap, slow HD as stock for this. If you plan on having a descent anti-virus or do much beyond basic computing, highly recommend upgrading to SSD hard drive. ORIGINAL: Had high hopes but the hard drive on this is really disappointing. Basic antivirus slows it way down and makes it act like a 5 year old computer. I had to order an ssd hard drive to make this act like it should brand new. I have built PCs for years and owned several brand name PCs too. This has been pretty disappointing after one week",

It is very fast and has seriously cleaned up my desktop-no more cables and stuff above and under desk. It runs very quiet despite the fact that it doesn't have an SSD, and is an excellent option for word processing, spread sheets, email, web browsing, etc...obv if you're a serious gamer or video editor look elsewhere, but all in all a great machine! Would Recommend! Pros -Fast performance -Quiet -Visually appealing -Good Value Cons -built in speakers aren't great (were you expecting them to be?) -Included Wireless keyboard and mouse aren't great -not terrible though",

Has more than enough RAM, so it's likely a processor issue, combined with a platter hard drive and not a SSD. Also, if you want to use a different keyboard than the one supplied (and who wouldn't) , the mouse has to be replaced ALSO, because otherwise the USB receiver seems to pick up random signals or noise, and this leads to unpredictable behavior on the part of the OS. On the plus side, the display is gorgeous. Wait until this Acer goes on sale, or find a comparable All-In-One with a bit better performance, my advice.",

      "text": "Bought this desktop in 2019. Within months it made a grinding noise. It was within warranty, so Amazon refunded my money and I purchased another identical one in May 2019. This one presented another problem - the screen would go black for several seconds, sometimes minutes, then retur to normal. I sent it to Acer for repair. They found no issues with it and returned it to me. It does the same thing. It is out of warranty, so I am stuck with a one year old $599 desktop that is unreliable. Amazon offered no options. I do not recommend this product at all.",
