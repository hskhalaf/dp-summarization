The mirror stays perfectly in place, and adjusts 360 degrees. Its stainless steel mirror reflects whatever's behind you perfectly. I feel 100% safer with this.",

Overall, however, I prefer the Mirrycle. You might have a different opinion on your bike. The Mirrycle is more adjustable in positioning so that your hand/arm aren't in the way. Also, on a tadpole trike you need to rest the trike on its side to work on the front wheels. The Hafny doesn't easily swing out of the way like the Mirrycle.",

      "text": "I'd been putting off finding a rearview mirror, especially after checking local bike shops for something I might like. After much research, I believe this is it. Really saves on wrenching your neck looking back if you're an older guy like me. After 3 rides with it, I've really gotten used to glancing down and spotting cars coming up behind me, which makes me feel much safer and helps adjusting to traffic. I had a moment of confusion when first trying to install in my 16.7mm inside diameter bars, but there is a removable expansion sleeve for larger diameter bars that is not mentioned in the minimal instructions. Excellent product!",

No matter how much you tighten it, though, the adjustment screw still comes loose after a while since it's impossible not to bang the mirror with your knee sometimes, which then requires that you move it back. Other than that, it's perfectly effective and I would recommend it to anyone who needs to see behind them without craning their neck. The view is tiny, and hard to see if the road is uneven, but it's enough to see what you really need to see, and it night it's even more obvious when cars or other bikes get close.",

You have to scan this device more for motion than a 'target' but used correctly it is a good accessory to have.

Not using anymore and trying to return (only mirrors that has ever worked for me is the blackburn bar end which is for mtn bikes) Will try helmet mounted mirror and see how that works.

The attached pictures so the mirror on my bike with the bike unfolded and folded. The mirror extends out far enough that I can clearly see cars or cyclists coming up behind me.

If your handlebar grips can come off easily, its best to cut out the hole prior to installing them on the bar. Otherwise, happy slicing with scissors or an exacto knife. No need to lop off the entire end of the bar grip (that will look ugly). I simply cut out a hole big enough for these to slid in securely. It will look cleaner on your handlebar to have some of the rubber ends still intact. Just my opinion of course....",

The road vibrations means you have to adjust the angle of the mirror periodically on a ride (easy to do). And road vibrations means the image isn\u2019t as clear as on a car side view mirror but it is certainly good enough to discern oncoming cars. Position is perfect on my old school flat mountain bike handlebars.",

Forget the fact that the mirror is a wide view (re: \"Objects Appear In Mirror Further Away Than They Actually Are\"). The image just isn't particularly sharp, and it's harder to pick up cars way down the road than other mirrors I've purchased. That being said, I'm still keeping it on the bike. Overall, it's a good design. I'm just not sure bright stainless steel works as well as other reflective materials.",
