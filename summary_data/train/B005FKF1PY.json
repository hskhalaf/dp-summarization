This is the second garbage item I've bought from D'Addario, and will never purchase anything from them again. The planet waves cable I bought from them was broken right out of the box. They used to be a good company, not sure what happen, probably moved all their manufacturing to China and now this it the low quality garbage they'll be remembered for. good job.",

The only location to mount the tuners is on the headstock near the neck. However, when I placed my guitars in the stands I use, the tuners slid upward on the headstock and it ruined the decal on one of my Teles. Really pissed me off. Did the jackasses at D'Addario actually try these tuners on a variety of guitars? I'm probably going to take the batteries out of these tuners to salvage some value. The units will then be tossed in the trash where they belong.",

The new Clip-On tuner has the same round mount as the existing Clip-Free tuner, so you can easily remove the Clip-On bracket from the new tuner, and mount it to the Clip-Free tuner bracket as shown on my acoustic guitar. A great discreet tuner, made better! Update: I tested the new tuner outdoors and it's brighter and has better contrast than the old model making it much easier to read in direct daylight!

I tested it on my piano and it is good for two octaves higher and lower from middle C. (I have been using Snark tuners until now and very frustrated that they break so easily.

I'll have to pluck the string a couple times and sometimes resort to using harmonics to get it to pick up the vibration.

I purchased the universal tuner, so it clips on my acoustic and electric guitars with ease. LED light is brightly displayed, and the tuner rotated 360 degrees so very flexible for whatever position and direction you like. It\u2019s worth the price and twice as accurate as my previous clip on from a different company. I like it a lot!",

I must have received the older version because there was no metronome as the video states there would be. 2. It sometimes does not recognize when a string is plucked. The response time is often slow. 3. I thought I had ordered a package of 2 tuners, but they sent 2 packages of 2 and now I have paid double what I anticipated (I should have checked closer). Careless me! 4. The clamps are not spring loaded, therefore they are likely to be knocked off. 5. The display is relatively small and hard to see. I don't recommend this item.",

My brother builds guitars and recommended this tuner to me, and it works pretty well.

The features are nice, with the ability to reverse the image to allow for different location placements on the guitar. It's a bit pricy compared to other products on the market, but only slightly so. It's my go-to tuner now.",

They're fine if you play through headphones, or play loud enough that you won't notice it... but at bedroom/apartment levels it's a noticeable and annoying buzz that ruins what would be an otherwise great tuner for the super affordable price.",

It's discreet enough that it can be left on your guitar's headstock without anyone ever noticing it was there. It's accurate as well. My only real problem is with the mechanism to lock it to the headstock. As you can see, it's plastic with ridges to lock into. But, headstocks aren't necessarily within the same increments as such ridges, and so it doesn't always fit snugly on the headstock.",

    "description": "Enjoy effortless and inconspicuous tuning in the studio or on stage with the D\u2019Addario Accessories (formerly Planet Waves) NS Micro Clip-On Tuner for acoustic and electric guitars, basses, mandolins, banjos and other stringed instruments. The lightweight, discrete, highly compact tuner hides behind the headstock practically blending into the instrument and is small enough to be kept on your instrument while stored in its case. At 1.25\u201d, your audience will never know it\u2019s there and you will want one for every instrument you own. The NS Micro features an extremely accurate piezo transducer that picks up an instrument\u2019s vibration rather than sound. A wide calibration range (410-480Hz) guarantees precise performance adds an additional practice tool.\n\nThe easy-to-read, tri-color backlit screen displays the note in red when out of tune, yellow when close, and green when in tune. This allows you to accurately tune with a quick glance at the display - even on dark stages or in direct sunlight. Powered by a readily available (and included) CR2032 battery, you will enjoy maximum battery life thanks to its auto-off function that shuts the tuner off after several minutes of no signal. Featuring a 360-degree swivel mechanism and adjustable padded clamp, the NS Mini offers optimal viewing angles and maximum positioning flexibility. Equally effective on left and right-handed instruments as well as on small and large headstocks, it is the ideal choice for the widest variety of players and string instruments\n\nFor over 20 years, D\u2019Addario has been leading the industry in innovative and problem-solving products that serve musicians worldwide.

      "THE STEALTH TUNER \u2013 Your audience will never know there is a tuner on your instrument with the highly precise Micro Clip-On Tuner. The lightweight, discrete, compact tuner hides behind the headstock practically blending into the instrument and is small enough to be kept on your instrument while stored in its case. At 1.25\u201d, you will want one for each stringed instrument you own.",
      "EXTREME ACCURACY \u2013 The NS Micro features an extremely accurate piezo transducer that picks up an instrument\u2019s vibration rather than sound. A wide calibration range (410-480Hz) guarantees precise performance.",
      "EASY TO READ - The easy-to-read, tri-color backlit screen displays the note in red when out of tune, yellow when close, and green when in tune. Powered by a readily available (and included) CR2032 battery, you will enjoy maximum battery life thanks to the tuner\u2019s auto-off function.",
      "VERSATILE - Featuring a 360-degree swivel mechanism and adjustable padded clamp, the NS Mini offers optimal viewing angles and maximum positioning flexibility. For left or right-handed instruments with small or large headstocks, it is the ideal choice for acoustic and electric guitars, basses, mandolins, banjos and ukuleles.",
