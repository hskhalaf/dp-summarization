But after spending 4 hours with AT&T technician, we eventually gave up on it. It only works on 3G data. No 4G data service from AT&T at all. The production description is misleading. Return on second day and totally waste of my time.",

This one can have some app slowdowns and I had facebook and facebook messenger crashing and locking up time to time. The battery life is surprisingly good, the pictures are very very good. It beats - hands down- my iphone X' shots, yes, believe it! On the other hand, there are some issues regarding the software. It will not take just any other launcher if you happened to not like EMUI interface, Id's say stay away from Huawei if you prefer Google stock-like launchers. Overall, it's a solid mid-range phone, but after trying out the 20Pro, this phone feels slow and subpar.",

A letter from fsg trading stating that it won't working with sprint and verizon providers in USA. This is confusing because the product description in amazon doesnt mentions. The super charger is not for USA plug. These things must be mentioned in product description. It does comes with transparent phone cover. Overall its a good purchase with some surprises but I like it so far.",

My main issue is that the headphone is connected through micro usb instead of a headphone jack like a normal phone. I didn't think too much about it at first, until I'm actually using the phone and realize I can't charge the phone and listen to music at the same time. Again, great phone overall, but this is a stupid design.",
