      "verdict": "To give the ladies a stylish alternative to the bulky, typical rain cleats, Keds unveiled the Scout Cleat Splash Twill. This sleek kick showcases wet weather-ready features without sacrificing the fashionable flair. This new-level cleat is also reliable when it comes to comfort and lightness which were pointed out several times in the reviews. Despite the merits, several critics opposed owning this for its poor arch support making it not suitable for day-long use.",

        "This model has an affordable price range",
        "Some buyers liked the overall look of their Keds Scout Cleat Splash Twill that will make them look stylish even during the wet season",

        "Several reviewers noted that this model is more comfortable than the ordinary rain cleats",
        "A handful of respondents mentioned that this sneaker is easy to maintain as the dirt can be easily wiped off",
        "This model fits right to size",

      "cons": [
        "A couple of critics disclosed that the traction of the Keds Scout Cleat Splash Twill is insufficient especially on wet surfaces",

        "Not many disappointed buyers cited that this pair has lacking arch support"

      "text": "The shoes are not the best quality, but look cute on. However. The hooks on the boots are bad news. I was walking down the street and the lace from one shoe got caught on the hook of the other shoe and i fell really hard and almost hit my face on the concrete. Hilarious, I know. Even funnier is that I was telling my friend the story and she said the same thing happened to her and I showed her the shoe and it was THE SAME ONE!! These shoes have made two different people trip! In addition, the hook of one shoe ripped off from my fall! So they're trash now and I only wore them twice.",

The only downside is that they don\u2019t have good traction for being an \u201call-weather\u201d shoe and they\u2019re pretty thin so I wouldn\u2019t wear them in snow or ice, but like I said, perfect for me!",

I chose them mainly for their appearance, which was interesting because I typically only wear men's shoes but loved them. They are not 100 percent waterproof, so you shouldn't submerge them in an ankle deep puddle and expect dry feet, but that's what galoshes are for. The traction on the bottom is great for ice and I appreciate that the sole is thin enough that I can feel the contours of the ground, which is useful when hiking.",

They didn\u2019t need to be \u201cbroken in\u201d and they were light for luggage reasons. I would suggest wearing high socks with them because toward the end of the day, on the one day I didn\u2019t wear high socks, it started getting uncomfortable on my calf where the top of the shoe is!
