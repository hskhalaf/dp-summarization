Firtly the actual card slots are so small that they barely fit an actual card. I have five bills, five cards and one ID in there and it literally sticks up about 5 inches. My trifold wallet that I had previously I had 10 cards, four ids, a law enforcement badge and several business cards and it only stuck up three inches. Very disappointed in this product. I'd highly recommend looking elsewhere and to take this review to heart.",

Like real leather it takes some wear to \"break it in\" and give it flexibility. Because the shape of the wallet seems to be almost a perfect square and the credit card slots are stacked offset, even with this wallet filled with 20 individual bills and every credit card slot full , also with the pass case still in; This wallet is still comfortable to sit on without you hurting your butt cheek.",

      "text": "After my search for a new wallet, and finding some I really likes, but hated the $150+ price tag, I decided to buy another Tommy Hilfiger. The first one lasted almost 20 years. It was still in really good condition, but the ID card holder was starting tear at the corner, so I figured I\u2019d buy new one. The new one seems to be made just as well in regard to stitching and material; it has an all leather outer shell, and is exactly as described. I really like it. If you looking for a decent men\u2019s wallet, but do not want to spend a lot of money, give this one a try.",

I removed the ID holder separately, so I can use just one ID and a cc with me when I go for a jog, or short errands. I keep very minimal items inside wallet so it won't be bulky but this is capable of holding many items. At very beginning we will feel it's bit thick and bulky but once we start using it, it comes to normal size which is good else You can keep it under a big book for a night to shrink it. :p Hopefully this also stands for three years at least.",

First, space for your dollar bills is pinched tightly on the right and left sides where the stitching a are. This makes it a little difficult to slide paper money into. Lastly, the wallet may not close fully when the card slots are filled. This is mainly knit picking and not a deal breaker at all.

I had bought a Nautica tri-fold wallet from this site about two months ago and already like this one better. I guess a flip passcase billfold wallet is the way to go for me.

It's OK but not quality is not up to par, The leather is pretty thin and the slots to put your money in is horrible. I have to pry the slots apart to either take money out or put in. Overall it's cheaply made and I would look elsewhere for a better wallet.",

(Remains to be seen how the wallet holds up after a year of normal use but based on the overall quality it seems like the wallet will last at least as well as my previous dockers wallet). Can remove the id card insert if you want an even slimmer billfold.",

Unfortunately he didn't bit was too big for his liking. Once he started switching his cards over he just stopped and said \"it's not going to work out\". Just because he's used to small wallets and this one became too bulky and it didn't close properly. I gave it to my father and he absolutely loved it.",

But what can I say, I'm just frugal/ really cheap :) I was deciding between this and a 10 dollar wallet at zara. Glad I bought this, got it in the mail today and absolutely love the quality. Hands down my favorite wallet I have purchased. I feel like a baller.",

Just don't buy it.",

Its well constructed and fits everything you would need in a wallet, will say the cards fit a little snug but should loosen up over time. It came with a nice box with a price tag marked $44 nice to know I could purchase on Amazon for $18 vs the high department store price. I hope to enjoy years of use and I don't see any other better value for your money.",
