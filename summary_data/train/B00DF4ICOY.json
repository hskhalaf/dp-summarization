They are quiet, and installation only took about 1.5 hours to do both of them. The low profile is great when you need the clearance and don't require lighting. The finish and appearance is great, and they move a good amount of air without being overwhelming or blowing papers all over the room. If you are just looking to circulate air and you don't need a fan to cool off an entire room, then this fan is for you.",

When I finished installing this fan there was a periodic noise when the fan blades were turning. Someone, while manufacturing the fan, secured two wires together using a small white Ty Wrap. It was 2 inches too long, and rather than clipping off the excess, they left it and it dropped down into the rotating part of the fan, making the unwanted noise. This required almost complete disassembly to remedy. This was very frustrating and unnecessary. Assemblers, pay attention!!!",
