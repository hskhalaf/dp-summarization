Oh I could but I'd just start thinking about all the things that money could have been used for. These are the only bluetooth wireless headsets that he will alllow to adorn his big noggin with when he's away from the high end toys that of course use oxygen free cables ..I think that's what he called them..anyway this is a great headset...",

I really got zero knowledge of AKG before that. - Another AKG is on the way: \"AKG K240 STUDIO\". - I am going to be a diehard for AKG from now on and I just cannot stop myself ... ...",

I was able to makeshift a repair peace and some screws to make it work but not sure for how long. I have yet to contact the company about it.

The quality of the of the headphones sound is awesome! The frequency range is amazing. Unlike many other headphone, where the low frequencies are artificially amplified, so the \"bass\" sounds strong, here with the AKG Y45BT, the low frequencies are NOT too loud but CRISP. Other famous brand name sells a similar headphones for a price twice higher. The extra charge in this case is for its name only, not for the compared quality of sound and specifications. So buy smart.",

Not to be obvious, but suggest listening to a CD or vinyl rather than streaming music source if you want to get a real read on their sound. Or try Tidal. The build quality seems good, but that's a question that can only be answered by time and use....... AND they're less than $100.00. I can't imagine better sound is available anywhere at this price point. Very, very happy with this purchase.",

The only bad thing is that when you close them up, the headphones can turn on because the button is bad placed. Overall, great headphones.",
