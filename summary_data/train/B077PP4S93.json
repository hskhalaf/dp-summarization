Tested Netflix 4k, YouTube 4k (from the Nvidia Shield) and movies from the Samsung UHD player and all were spectacular. Only downside is there is a small light border that extrudes a bit (depending on size of image), and a tiny bit of light that comes from the fan vent, but that is it. I'm loving the RGBRGB color wheel too! Get this thing, you won't be disappointed.",

My 2050 was a great projector but I am so glad I took the leap to the 4k model. Have it hooked up to my xbox one x and can completely tell the difference between my old projector and this one. Handles games and movies just fine. there is border light shadow hanging over the side of my edgeless projector screen but doesnt seem to bother me like some others. set-up was simple, I actually tried a reviewers set points and was happy enough to just leave it with those.",

I upgraded to the BenQ from an Optoma HD142x and was surprised on how much bigger the BenQ unit is. Install/Configuration went smoothly and was pretty straight forward. The only hurdles i have run into so far is getting the projector to recognize 3d content via my xb1x/plex setup that was working flawlessly on the Optoma. There doesn't seem to be a way to force it to run either sbs/tab modes like i was able to do on the Optoma. Overall i am very pleased with this purchase.",

It took me a while to get the colors looking good but after I did it looked very good. I was planning on getting the UHD60 but I'm glad I went with this one instead. My only complaint would be the border light which is a dim black light that extends about 6 inches around each edge of my 120 inch screen. After a while I got used to it and didn't even realize it was there anymore. It would be nice if there was some way to get rid of it.",

I though the light border would be annoying, but I made sure to adjust the screen size so that the picture fills the screen. Don't notice the border while watching content. Downside is buzzing sound, but not a deal breaker as usually my surround sound overtakes it and I don't usually sit right underneath it. Would like lens shift option though to make installation a bit easier. Overall very happy with the purchase.",

There is also a large grey light area around the projected frame so the glow around the image was wider than the felt frame on my screen (very distracting).

      "text": "Contrary to what is mentioned in the product description: \"All units purchased after 3/16/2018 include Firmware Update 1.0.3\", I bought one on 3/30/18 and it just arrived with the 1.0.0 firmware. According to the label, this was shipped out on 3/23 from BenQ, so they're still shipping out broken units from the factory. Was upset enough that nobody even tested the 3D, the first time I had to return this. This is just insult to injury. It's a shame, I really wanted this projector. Probably best to wait until the summer for them to get their act together. Or pay a little extra for one of the alternatives.",

      "text": "I had to return this product because of the unusual lag that occurs when changes sources. I contacted BenQ and they said it was normal to have a 20 second delay when changing from PS4 to kodi or when adjusting HDR settings. I went with the ViewSonic PX727 and the source lag is only 5-10 seconds. I'm not sure if my unit was defective but source change lag was a deal breaker for me. The picture is decent but I think the PX727 has better contrast and better color",

Not only does the projector black extend much further than expected, the projector makes a horrific buzzing sound. It didn\u2019t last 15 minutes on my ceiling. The only reason it got 2 stars is that the image quality was superb, if you can get over the other issues. As for me, back to my trusty 1080p projector I go for now.",

When power button is pressed, power light flashes green twice, then goes to steady red for about 15 seconds, then back to orange. Will not turn on. Manual says this is a scaler reset failure.

Nothing. The green led light flashed, went out and the red off light came on, then all the lights went off. There ya go. Nothing. A flop. I haven\u2019t called Benq support yet, actually I did but they closed 4 minutes before I called, but I will contact them in the morning. Hopefully it\u2019s just a bad lamp, which is still pretty crappy, but that\u2019s an easy fix. If that\u2019s the problem. I was really excited. Was.",
