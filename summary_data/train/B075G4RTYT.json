My knife now has 3 deep scratches in it that catch food when i cut. Huge disappointment. I contacted the company, which claimed their sheath couldn't do this, however i watched it happen to my blade twice. I wanted to like this sheath, but i can't believe the damage it's done and the lack of caring by the corporate staff.",
