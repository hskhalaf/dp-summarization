I even woke up one morning in a hotel (it didn't seem as if the room was overly humid) with my hair completely matted all over my head. Apparently the room had more humidity than I realized! If I try to comb through it, my hair will absolutely break off unless I wash it out first. All that being said, I can't find another product (spray or otherwise) that holds my hair in place as well as this one.",
