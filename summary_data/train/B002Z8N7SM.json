This rake is well made and looks like it will last a long time. As compared to my \"big box\" rake: the Bully rake weighs about the same and the handle is about 4\" shorter. At 4'11\", that is not a bad thing for me. Spent the morning yesterday spreading mulch and doing some garden clean up. The rake did what it was supposed to without coming apart every third pull.",

Rather than contact Amazon and send the large bulky item back for a replacement, I contacted Bully Tools directly to see if I could get a replacement part. The company contacted me within 10 minutes and let me know they would be sending out a replacement part the next day. That is what I call great service and I couldn't be happier.",

      "text": "Made in USA. What does that mean other than overpriced and poor product? Well, in this case, it's good old fashioned 'Murica! Over engineered and well made. I've looked at a lot of garden rakes at big-box stores and was underwhelmed with the Chinese representations. Crap! I wasn't expecting what I recieved. So far this has been a \"Tool Man\" style tool. Over engineered and well made to pass down to your kids. Why not a 5-star rating? Because it's not an entirely forged rake end. Nobody makes that, but that's the ultimate 5-star product.",
