The carbon fiber cones were disapointing. I never installed the Monoprice in the wall due to the poor build quality. The Micca and Silver Ticket were comparable in sound quality after installing in the wall. I decided to keep the Silver Ticket pair and returned the other two pairs. To me, even if all 3 costed the same, I would still keep the Silver Ticket. Their build quality and part selection were noticeably better than Monoprice and a little better than the Micca.

Apart from running more speaker wire through the ceiling, they were easy to install, and their sound blends right in with the rest of the system. I'm using a combination of B&H and Mirrage speakers, and these hold up along side them well. They are featured less frequently, as they are my height speakers, but when the soundtrack makes use of them, they sound convincing and definitely add to the immersion of the sound system. They arrived on time and packaged well, too!",

I doubt these sound as good as a more expensive version; however, it was the only in ceiling angled center speaker I could find that wasn't as much as I paid for my first car. So far they sound good. I really like the build quality and how flush it is with the ceiling; I truly do not notice it is there. Movie dialogue is very pronounced and easily understandable. I actually feel once I perform an automated setup of the speakers that the receiver will pull back on the center channel a little as the dialogue is on the loud side.",

The verification was to make sure the issue wasn't with the wires. Once verifying the wires worked, Silver Ticket quickly responded and said they would ship out a replacement speaker. The Customer Service was very nice and quick to respond. Great company and product!",

The regular downward firing center speaker (with aimed tweeter) produced very low/muddled movie dialogue even after using my receivers equalizer to lift the voices. I was constantly increasing/decreasing the volume to hear the actors but not be blown out by explosions etc. the ability to angle them has really lifted the voices while keeping the other sounds in check. Additionally I like the extra boost of having two speakers in this unit. Easy to use template, simple since I was replacing a previously installed speaker.",

I have 6 of these speakers (2 front, 2 side, 2 rear) plus their center channel speaker running through a 7.1 Onkyo receiver with Onkyo subwoofer. Just amazing. I probably wouldn't have tried these speakers if I hadn't bought their fixed movie screen. I was so impressed with the construction and price I decided to give the speakers a try. Very glad I did.",

      "text": "I did a lot of research while preparing to update our home theater. The reviews on these sold me and I am so glad I chose them. Our old speakers pointed straight down. The angled speakers project the sound so much better that we have the volume significantly lower than before. They were easy to install, I only had to make the opening bigger to accomodate them.",
