My previous mouse, a Logitech G5, lasted over a decade and I was assuming that this one would make it at least that long. I suppose it is my fault for making an assumption. I do not recommend this item.",

I love its Dual Mode wheel, which allows toggling the wheel between a smooth scroll, and a clicky scroll; while it also has the Tilt Wheel feature, which allows you to tilt the wheel to the left or right to act as extra mouse buttons.The DPI is very fast and very responsive.",

I saw a couple of solutions online to fix this, but given that I am not a mechanical guy, I do not know how to work with tiny stuffs. With such price, the mouse should last longer and die from more catastrophic damages. I will not spend money on this mouse again. I have totally given up on this product.",

It's very responsive, and I like that you can change the weight of it to fit your preference. Personally, I loaded it up with the heaviest weights it came with. The sensitivity buttons are nice but I honestly don't use them very much. All the buttons are in good spots ergonomically. One of the best mice for this price.",

The mouse offers different weights, but I think that is more of a gimmick, I just use the mouse without any weight and never had a problem. The scroll wheel can be toggled between smooth scrolling or fine finer scrolling, which is a awesome feature. The mouse also looks cool, with a painted \"splash\" kind of look.

Uncertain how much use I'm going to get out of the ability to change DPI on the fly, but we'll see-- at the very least, it's nice to be able to adjust the default setting ticks for DPI.

I like the mouse heavier, nice to have extra weights. Very precise. Loads of buttons to do what you need to. Scrolwheel is very well made, nice scroll (odd thing to say, but it's a thing that sits in your hand 8+ hours a day, every little bit helps). It's very comfortable for office use as well. Recommended if price isn't steep for you. (otherwise consider G400, similar performance but no customizable weight).",

If it moves too fast, click a button on the mouse and it slows down, same for the opposite indeed. It's precision never let me down and I like the number of buttons (6) that can be used during games. Those are easily parametrable and recognized by most recent games. I did not use the weights because I could not really see the use for it but the idea is not bad. More specifically, it does not remove anything positive from the experience.",

After a bit of using it, I truly like the design. I upgraded from my G500 which lasted me something like 7 years before the right mouse button stopped working, and this new mouse has Macro features to boot. Logitech's G series of mice have impressed me with their durability and I like the G500 so I would definitely recommend it.",

I didn't need to use the extra weights that came with the mouse - it worked fine right out of the box and still works as well as the day I got it. The adjustable sensitivity was not something I expected to use, but it definitely helps with first-person shooter gaming. Definitely recommend this!",

A really nice addition is the small button under the wheel is a lock for the wheel. If it is pressed in, it is like a normal wheel where you can feel the bump as it toggles. If you let it free though, you can spin it very rapidly. This option is great for scanning through large PDF files.",

      "text": "Great mouse with great customization options. It allows you to do a lot but not so much that it's overwhelming, is comfortable to use for long periods of time, and has just enough buttons that I'm not overwhelmed but enough that my husband loves it, too. We both have one--he bought one that he ended up letting me use (he's so nice!) and when his mouse was on its last legs I bought him one for Christmas. We both still love ours and I would buy it again if I needed a new gaming mouse in the future.",

I decided to go back to wired, because I was tired of changing out the batteries every month or two(I use my computer a lot) and am glad that I did. I like extra weights that they give you. Gives the mouse a more solid feel. Great response and although it is meant for gaming, I bought it for Photoshop use and love the ability to change mouse sensitivity on the fly.",

Logitech also has the G800 MMO mouse which is just as good.",
