That being said, it looks really awesome and the build is great fun and the minifigure selection is fantastic if you're a Ninjago Movie fan not looking to buy every set.

Also there is a wizard in the collection... which even confuses me more. Its almost lego mashed together two lores with no respect to either of them.
