Also ordered the \"Naturous PLW01 Waterproof Cylinder Porch Light\". This light is a single light to illuminate my house number and matches my porch lights.",

      "text": "Really like the appearance and light glow. The top and bottom of the light has a silicone gasket sealed glass cover, which protects from water intrusion. The problem lies in the sides of the light\u2019s tube body, where the light allows water intrusion via the designed knockouts. The plastic diffusers aren\u2019t sealed properly. That results in water entering the side of the light and pooling in the base of the light (see video). Definitely a flaw in that it occurs in all four lights I purchased.",
