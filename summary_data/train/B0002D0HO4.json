      "text": "Bought these for my husband and he says: Haven't had these long, but from the moment I unboxed them I was sold. I've only used low-end cymbals in the past. These are monsters, heavy and beautiful. The hats have a nice stick sizzle, but less definition than I'd like with the pedal alone. It may be technique; I'm no master. The crash isn't painful, just loud and a tiny bit splashy. I like it. The ride is gong-y. I may damp it a little. Big sound, lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-ong sustain, with little or no wah in the decay. I still dream of Zildjian K Constantinoples, but for this price, I never imagined I'd own cymbals this good.",

Bronze with tin has a much more musical ring tone to it. Do yourself a favor, skip the brass cymbals and buy bronze cymbals. These Wuhans are GREAT sounding 80/20 bronze cymbals AND a good price. You will love their sounds.",

Doesn't crash well but very good for cutting through a mix. Overall, for the money you can't beat this. I bought these as a practice set and they're perfect for that but the hats could easily be used for recordings and certain live settings. Would suggest listening to some sound demos on youtube, but even then no cymbal sounds the same. If you're a beginner, these are such a steal. even if you're advanced, they are a good set to have in your arsenal.",

These cymbals are so much better than the lower end offerings of any of the big brands. If you're mainly playing at home, just get these.",

The ride has good response and the bell sounds great. Not overly washy depending on how you play it. The 16\" Crash is dead is and sounds a little thick, even though it says thin. A little gongy to me. I may expirement with it a little! Although I haven't played out with them yet, I'll give them a 4 out of 5. The ride and hi hats sound as good as I've had. Good luck",

I'm a 66 year old drummer wannabe and was looking for some good, but reasonably priced cymbals to augment a rock kit. I have Zildjian K Constantinople cymbals on my jazz kit, but was blown away by how nice sounding and well suited the Wuhans were for my rock setup.
