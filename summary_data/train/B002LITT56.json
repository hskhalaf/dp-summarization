I would like a longer lens, but this makes you move to the shot. I wish the peep hole were worth a crap for more than guesstimating- still not a big deal. I'm really loving HDR with the RAW images. I've had and enjoyed DSLR's from Canon and Pentax and the samsung mirrorless, but I really love nearly everything about this camera. Even the shortcomings are more like quirks.",

This seller, a certified Cannon dealer, had a reconditioned G!! at a good price, with a good warranty. The feature I love about this camera is the flip screen, which makes it possible to take photos at odd angles. It is also great at microscopic close-ups. Nothing in the under $1K range does this as well. Hope this one lasts almost as long as my first one!",

In some difficult situtions such as extreme backlighting I have yet to figure out how to easily give priority to the lighting and subjet I want, but I am certain this camera can easily accomplish that. Quite often this camera easily handled indoor lighting without flash. Focusing is usally accurate and very easy to compse shots. Had many who have various other Digital cameras that were very impresed after using this in place of their camera.",

I am very please with this camera and recommend it",

The only better compact cameras are the micro 4/3 series cameras, but they are 2-3 times the cost. The built-in editing software is good, but better is to take .raw images and use photoshop or photoshop elements for vastly expanded image editing capabilities. The only drawback is that you can only shoot .raw images in certain modes.",

The second is there is no attachment for a wide angle lens, and if it did, I would sell my Nikon. Yes it does everything and in the year since I've had it, I have yet to learn all its features.",

Perhaps a notch down even, I noticed in a lot of \"other than bright light\" conditions, skin tones are almost pastel. As the flagship of the PowerShot cameras, just \"ok\" is rather disappointing. The swivel, raw, hotshoe, manual controls, high ISO are all pluses, but at the end it comes down to picture quality.",

    "description": "The G Series comes full circle. You asked, and Canon not only listened, but delivered big time. Advanced amateurs who have overwhelmingly embraced the G Series will be delighted with PowerShot G11, which features RAW mode for unlimited editing options, a 28mm wide angle lens, and a 2.8 inch Vari Angle PureColor System LCD. Add to that Canon\u2019s new High Sensitivity System and high speed ISO for incredible image quality, and Canon\u2019s top range compact digital camera is a truly groundbreaking successor.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nThe G Series comes full circle. You asked, and Canon not only listened, but delivered big-time. Advanced amateurs who have overwhelmingly embraced the G Series will be delighted with PowerShot G11, which features RAW mode for unlimited editing options, a 28mm wide-angle lens, and a 2.8-inch Vari-Angle PureColor System LCD. Add to that Canon\u2019s new High Sensitivity System and high-speed ISO for incredible image quality, and Canon\u2019s top-range compact digital camera is a truly groundbreaking successor. \n\nPowerShot G11 Highlights \n\n\n\nNew 10-megapixel sensor coupled with Canon\u2019s DIGIC 4 Image Processor\nThe PowerShot G11 employs a newly developed, 10-megapixel High Sensitivity System by combining a powerful CCD sensor and Canon\u2019s DIGIC 4 Image Processor. Thanks to this technological advancement, the G11 is dramatically more sensitive than cameras with identical megapixel counts, and delivers spectacular images with minimal noise. Increased sensitivity demands a higher ISO speed, and the PowerShot G11 delivers with a new maximum setting of ISO 3200. Blur and camera shake are notably reduced for the ultimate in sharpness and clarity. \n\nIn addition, a new Low Light mode lets you capture images in an astonishing range of conditions. The camera automatically adjusts the ISO speed from ISO 320 to ISO 12800 in relation to ambient brightness, subject movement and camera shake. \n\nFull range of shooting and recording modes including RAW + JPEG\nThe PowerShot G11\u2019s RAW mode lets you shoot images without JPEG compression. It gives you clearer images and complete creative control in editing. RAW images are transferred directly to the computer where they can then be edited using image adjustment software or a processing application to adjust your images as you please. The camera can also be set to allow the simultaneous recording of both RAW and JPEG images while shooting. \n\nAlso, with 26 Shooting Modes, you're ready for whatever shot comes your way. \n\nLarge, bright 2.8-inch Vari-Angle LCD\nThe PowerShot G11 gives you a large 2.8-inch PureColor System LCD screen for excellent control when framing your shots. But size is only part of the story. Canon\u2019s PureColor System LCD offers spectacular color, resolution and contrast even at an angle. The screen is durable and easy to see. It is a perfect feature for gathering friends and family around to see your images. \n\nOptional accessories including Speedlite flashes, underwater housing and Tele-Converter Lens\nThe PowerShot G11 is compatible with the Speedlite flash series intended for all EOS series SLR cameras. Attach a Speedlite flash to the hot shoe, then you can set and control the flash on the \"Flash Control\" menu in the camera. With a Speedlight, the G11 is given extra functions such as autoflash metering, FE lock and Flash exposure compensation; continuous shooting with external flash. Also Canon\u2019s Speedlite Transmitter ST-E2 enables you to have multiple slave flashes and wireless control. A Tele-Converter lens designed for the G11 and WP-DC34 Waterproof Case are also available. \n\nWide-angle 5x optical zoom (equivalent to 28-140mm) with Canon\u2019s Optical Image Stabilizer\n5x optical zoom in action The camera is equipped with a long, 5x Optical Zoom, and Canon\u2019s own Optical Image Stabilizer Technology keeps images steady and blur-free all through the zoom range--even in low light--by detecting motion and generating a corrective signal. Because it is an optical system, more corrective movement is allowed and there is no degradation of image quality. \n\nThe G11 is a highly versatile camera with a wide-angle zoom lens that reaches all the way from 28mm at the wide end to 140mm at the telephoto end (35mm format equivalent). You\u2019ll capture more image in every shot, and add greater depth to your overall photography. \n\nDIGIC 4 Image Processor \nCanon\u2019s proprietary DIGIC Image Processors have long set its cameras apart from the competition, and the new DIGIC 4 sets the bar even higher. Faster, more accurate noise reduction delivers better image quality, even at high ISO speeds. \n\niSAPS Technology is an entirely original scene-recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos, iSAPS works with the advanced DIGIC 4 Image Processor to improve focus speed and accuracy, as well as exposure and white balance. \n\nA new Face Self-Timer automatically detects an increase in the number of faces and makes the appropriate adjustments. For instance, to include a photographer\u2019s face in a group shot, there\u2019s no need to rush in. Just put the camera on a stand or tripod, select the Face Self-Timer, and the camera will wait for the photographer\u2019s face to get on-camera before it takes the shot. Motion Detection now tracks moving subjects in a much larger range, and the new Servo AF retains focus on a moving subject after the shutter button is pressed halfway \u2013 allowing you to wait for the perfect shot without refocusing. Also, Face Detection and Motion Detection are markedly improved. \n\ni-Contrast in action Intelligent Contrast Correction\nDIGIC 4 also makes possible the new i-Contrast (Intelligent Contrast Correction) system, which controls the compensation level in pixel units to brighten dark areas while leaving bright areas unchanged for better images where the main subject is dark, and more natural transition. The PowerShot G11 can even use i-Contrast in playback mode to adjust images that were shot without the setting activated. \n\nRed-eye Correction provides options for removing red-eye from subjects in flash pictures. \n1) The Red-eye Correction during shooting actually identifies and corrects red-eye in human subjects as pictures are taken. \n2) The G11 can be set to automatically detect and correct red-eye during image playback. \n\nLife doesn\u2019t give you second chances to capture special times. That\u2019s why the G11 features ISO 3200 to reduce the effects of camera shake and sharpen subjects in low-light situations, giving you greater shooting flexibility. \n\nHDMI output for viewing still images on an HDTV\nWith the advanced PowerShot G11, you can capture breathtaking, high-resolution still images and impressive standard definition movies with ease. The camera also makes it simple to enjoy and share your stills and SD movies with a mini-HDMI connector for direct connection to a high-definition monitor or HDTV, so every color and nuance can be appreciated like you intended them to be. \n\nImproved Smart AUTO intelligently selects the proper setting\nJust set the Canon PowerShot G11 to Smart AUTO and you're ready for maximum enjoyment from your picture taking every time. It's a relaxing and satisfying way to shoot because you can completely concentrate on your subject knowing that the camera has the technical details covered. Advanced Canon technology intelligently analyzes your situation and shooting conditions. Then it automatically selects an appropriate setting from specially defined settings. So whether you're photographing flowers, a captivating sunset, or your friends at the park, you can be confident that you're getting dramatic, memorable images. \n\nWhat's in the Box\n\n * PowerShot G11 \n * Lithium Battery Pack NB-7L \n * Battery Charger CB-2LZ \n * Neck Strap NS-DC9 \n * Digital Camera Solution CD-ROM \n * USB Interface Cable IFC-400PCU \n * AV Cable AVC-DC400",
