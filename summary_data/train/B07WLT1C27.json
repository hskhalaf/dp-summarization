Granted, I'm not out here paying extra for it (it was actually cheaper than the standard edition), but the \"GOTY Edition\" moniker makes owner transfer basically impossible.",

The scientific puzzles/missions are fun and add value to the game as opposed to existing as solely filler tasks. Great story with some interesting twists on old relationships and new enemies. Suits, skills, gadgets, and suit powers are easy to use and can be upgraded with points earned through normal game play - no hidden 'pay to play' features. Web swinging is pure joy.

It is more mission focused but he was free to do side missions or explore the city when he wanted to. Highly recommend for some fun and great storytelling!",
