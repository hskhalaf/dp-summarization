      "text": "I bought this to play with my sugar gliders in and I absolutely love it. Its very easy to store away and when you take it out, it pops open immediately, and you can pull out the sides to make it stand up. I've had it for about a month now and I haven't noticed any rips or tears in the material, which is surprising because my glider's nails are fairly sharp and they occasionally bite on it too. I would definitely recommend this to anybody with sugar gliders or anybody who is looking for a reliable mosquito net tent.",

We kept one side \u201copen\u201d, though, so we could still watch her from the other room via our portable baby monitor. Great value!",

Our gliders love to run around it, and I love that the bottom is entirely netted in so they can't escape. Easy to pop up, easy to fold away, and even has a little carrying bag to put it in.

This has worked well to solve a pest problem that I had otherwise been unable to solve organically. The only downside is that the net tears easily. I have literally torn it with just the sole of my sneaker. I don't think I will likely get more than one season's use. I wish the netting were a but sturdier but all in all I have been pretty pleased with the purchase for this purpose.",
