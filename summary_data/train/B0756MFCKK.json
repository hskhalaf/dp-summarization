It constantly pauses or stops working with the error of \u201cconnection problems- make sure the device is connected to the internet and that your Wifi is working properly. \u201c The length of unusable time ranges from seconds to minutes. Precious seconds for monitoring to make sure your baby is still breathing. It\u2019s not my WiFi connection since the other arlos setup around my house are still monitoring and live.",

As I live across the country I needed tools to watch over her and even though I had installed Arlo Pro cameras in her room for video and audio surveillance, I still needed to keep an eye on the temperature,humidity and air quality. Se will often adjust the thermostat because she is \u201ccold\u201d and the next thing you know she\u2019s sitting in a 90 degrees environment wondering why she\u2019s uncomfortable. Now I can assess the environment and then call the facility staff to make any necessary adjustments! Thanks Arlo!",

They are also extremely helpful to be able to LISTEN TO MULTIPLE arlo baby cameras AT THE SAME TIME through the app. This is a huge selling point. It's unfortunate that they won't work with the echo Show, but hopefully this flaw will be fixed in the near future - kinda doubt it, since it has not been working for the 3 years since they first came out though (read online forums).",

Arlo does a pretty bad job of differentiating between a baby's cry and a normal sound. Now I get notifications on my phone when by dog barks bear her room. I did turn down the sensitivity but it's still not perfect. On the plus side Arlo has a ton of features like different colored lights, music and a long list of other features. It was easy to install and the night vision is excellent.",

And still is while being changed, but I do not need Arlo to keep informing me with notifications every 20 seconds.",
