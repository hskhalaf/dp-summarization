They even threw in a few shoe bags as an apology for my troubles. They showed exemplary customer service and I would most definitely shop with them again.",

With two ties the case bulges slightly. Disappointing as the build quality was actually adequate. Makes you wonder if the manufacturer even tested the product...",
