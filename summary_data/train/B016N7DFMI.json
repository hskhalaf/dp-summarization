Biggest gripe and why I took off a star: WHEN DESIGNER\u2019S DECIDE HOW BIG A STORAGE BAG NEEDS TO BE, THEY NEED TO ADD 20% MORE SPACE TO THE BAG. I spent about 20 minutes in freezing rain, cursing Core 9 while trying to get the tent back in the the tiny storage bag. Bag could stand to be much bigger. Especially if you want to throw in some decent tent spikes (i.e. not what ships with the tent) and a mallet. But now that I have that off my chest, this tent really is fantastic.",

You need to stake out all the rainfly lines to keep the rainfly off the tent fabric and maximize ventilation. The top is mostly mesh so you don't have much privacy with the rainfly off but you do get a great view of the night sky. Great value for the money (bought at 102$).

      "text": "We broke a pole setting up our previous tent right before a camping trip. Needed something fast, yet affordable. After researching we settled on this one and couldn't be happier. We have used it twice and have been rained on multiple times, with no leaks. Love the small area at the top for storage. Only complaint would be that the rain fly steaks are numerous and tend to stick out farther than our previous tent... need to get something to mark them to remind us they are there. On one of our smaller sites, we tripped over them numerous times.",

Unfortunately when i pulled out the tent poles, i found that the elastic on one of the bigger tent poles was torn. Bummer. So I gave up and decided to return it. Im gonna get the smaller one cuz this one was too big for us.",

Super easy to put together (you do need two sets of hands to do it with more ease, but could be done alone). Our camping trip was three nights long, and it rained every.single.day. Not one drop of water made it to the inside!! Very pleasantly pleased. I love the window on the back side! The only reason I gave it a 4 is because the zipper does get caught once in a while, which can be annoying when trying to go in/out quickly with the rain!!",

In other reviews people complain about the cover not cover the mesh all the way.. I didn't have this problem. There is velcro on each of the poles and the cover. If you use the steaks to tie down the cover it covers it completely. It also allows a little more air to come in. I think my biggest complaint would be lack of air flow because there are only windows on front and back.",

I would like a replacement for that pole if possible. If not then where would I purchase such an item?? Anyway, when I get the pole issue straightened out, the tent will be fine.",

We joked that it was a little apartment. The extra space was great for keeping our bags and my 6\u20193\u201d fiance\u0301 was able to stand up inside to comfortably change. We also didn\u2019t have any issues with water getting in, and the air vent and zippered windows helped with ventilation. Easy-ish installation for a first time tent-setter-upper, as well as take down. Overall highly recommend!",
