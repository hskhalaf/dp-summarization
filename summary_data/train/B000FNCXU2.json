Unfortunately I am told I\u2019ve missed my return window by 3 days. Would avoid this product based on major design flaw.",

The latter is true - mostly because we love being outdoors and it doesn't take much to entertain us; the former statement is is based on the bean bags having a tag that reads: \"Made in China\". The board is USA made, but the accessories to use with the board are from China. They don't tell you that on the website because they want you to think that you are buying a 100% manufactured in USA item. The game is fine - the bags slide a bit too much off the plastic, but not 100% a USA product.",

Opening the box one of the corners was dented (kind of a bummer, as it was brand new!) but it didn't effect the play. Bags seem pretty rugged and the door on the back was a nice idea to store them. The material plastic is like the same as those toddler play yard pieces Play School, to give you an idea of how they are made. I think that is the name of them, pic-nick bench, slides, ovens, play houses and so forth. Shipping was FAST!",
