What fits good in the story often doesn't quite make the grade once you take them home and have worn them long enough to know \"Oops,\" but too long to return them. These Asic's were first bought in the sporting goods store. After a couple of weeks of wearing them, I decided to be smart this time. I went on Amazon looking for exactly the same brand, size, model, etc. and bought two more pair. Now I'm good to go for a couple of years! Because these really work well for me.",
