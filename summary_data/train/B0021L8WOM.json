We tried to give him some of this to help introduce him to our new cat and it did not help with this. He was still very on edge.

But he still has bad days where he rips the hair & skin off his tail. This product really helps on those days. I rub about 1/2 tsp. on his front feet, which he immediately licks off(he seems to like the taste) He relaxes about 5 minutes later. Sometimes he needs another dose in an hour or so... But this usually calms him for the rest of the evening. Easy to use, and much better price than bought locally(& it's not always available locally). Good product.",

      "text": "The first time I purchased this product it came in great condition and worked well for my cat. The second time I ordered it, it came to me smelling AWFUL and sour, so I could tell it was spoiled. It also looked like the bottle had been puffed full of air. I figured it could just be a one time thing and had them send me a replacement bottle. Unfortunately, the \"replacement\" bottle was also the same way - spoiled/sour, smelled horrible, and the bottle was full of air. Very unsatisfied with this product, which is so sad because it was working great.",

I have given it to him during the day a few times but it does make him sleepy so I try to only use it at night or only use a small amount during the day. He eats it right out of my hand.",

Note that after it's been open for a few weeks, the potency seems to wear off (based on my cat deciding it's less interesting), so make sure you push the cap closed tightly. Both Pet-Ease and Hairball gels seem to work equally well, but I prefer the Pet-Ease as my cat's a little high-strung so every bit of calm helps.",
