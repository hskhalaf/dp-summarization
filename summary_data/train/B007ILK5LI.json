      "text": "I bought this to replace my broken A300 and it was definitely an upgrade. Of course, the fact that I already had Sony (and old Minolta) lenses is a plus. However, even for someone just starting out in the DSLR market; the Sony lenses are generally less expensive for the same basic capability as other brands because image stabilization is in the body. I can't imagine ever doing without an articulating screen again and I can't imagine ever needing another upgrade.",

It is a fantastic camera.I was torn between this and the Nikon d5100, but I'm so glad I went with the Sony. I agree with everything that has been said about the camera and only want to add what I find the most amazing for myself. My favorite thing about the camera is that when you change shutter speed or f-stop or iso etc, it shows you a live preview on the screen! The other most important thing is the built in vibration reduction and focus control, making the lenses for the camera a lot more affordable.",

It has an easy to understand menu as well. Performance in low light is amazing as long as you have a wonderful lens mounted on it. If you're thinking about it then I'd say go for it.

The included lens was dusty and had some kind of material on the front glass. Printed instructions and other materials were outside of plastic bag and appeared to have been damp. The description of this item did not state that it was used so I immediately initiated a return request.",

Not too happy with the jpeg quality, but it comes with a good raw converter if you are not lazy.

As the successor to the SLT-A55, the new SLT-A57 includes advanced features such as translucent mirror technology, a 16.1 MP resolution and BIONZ processor, 12 fps continuous shooting1, Full HD movie at 60p (50p)2, and the world's first3 Auto Portrait Framing. Standard zoom lenses become like telephoto zoom lenses thanks to Clear Image Zoom, which realizes a high-resolution look even when shooting with digital zoom making it dramatically easier to get the best shot.\n\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n12 FPS TELE-ZOOM HIGH-SPEED SHOOTING\n\nEvery second, you can capture up to 12 dynamic close-ups of subjects in motion. Tele-zoom Continuous Advance Priority AE magnifies the center of the action 1.4x to bring subjects closer at a clear 8-megapixel resolution. You can also team Smart Zoom with 2x magnification for super zoomed shots (4MP, S size). The a57 also supports 10 fps continuous shooting at the camera\u2019s highest resolution (16.1 megapixels)4.\n\n\n\n15-POINT AF SYSTEM WITH 3 CROSS SENSOR\n\nThe renowned precision of Sony\u2019s 15-point AF system, previously reserved for higher grade models, ensures fast and accurate TTL phasedetection autofocusing wherever and whenever you shoot. Even when capturing moving subjects in dim lighting, the three vertically aligned cross sensors deliver accurate and reliable tracking. You can choose any of four AF area modes (Wide, Zone, Spot or Local) depending on your needs.\n\nHIGH SENSITIVITY (ISO 100-16000)\n\nThe large Exmor APS HD CMOS sensor provides an extremely wide sensitivity range of 7 1/3 steps. You can use AUTO ISO (100-3200) for outstanding results in most lighting conditions or manually raise sensitivity up to ISO 16000 when lighting is low. Even at high sensitivity settings, the a57 captures every detail with natural tonal gradations and extremely low noise. This makes the a57 perfect for shooting indoor athletes at high shutter speeds without a tripod or reproducing the mood of candlelit rooms without supplemental lighting.\n\nFULL-TIME CONTINUOUS AF\n\nEven at maximum continuous shooting speed and during live-view movie shooting, accelerated full-time continuous phase-detection autofocusing keeps your subject in sharp focus without the slightest delay. This remarkable AF performance, made possible by Translucent Mirror Technology, lets you effortlessly capture dramatic moments and expressions in all types of situations with professional-looking results. \nQUICK AF FULL HD MOVIE\n\n\n\nEven when shooting movies at Full HD resolution5, the a57 employs speedy full-time continuous phase-detection autofocusing. Most interchangeable lens cameras revert to contrast-detection AF that slowly hunts for the correct Full manual movie shooting focus when shooting movies. But the a57 delivers the same swift, accurate focusing as during still photography to capture even fast-moving subjects with clarity. You can even lock exposure, switch the focus point, enjoy digital zooming and more while shooting movies for expanded creative control.\n\n\n16.1 MP RESOLUTION WITH EXMOR APS HD CMOS SENSOR AND BIONZ IMAGE PROCESSOR\n\nEvery detail of your scene is beautifully captured by Sony\u2019s proprietary Exmor APS HD CMOS sensor. In addition to offering impressive 16.1-effective-megapixel resolution, the a57's extra-large dimensions deliver supreme sensitivity in low-light conditions and gorgeous background defocusing effects beyond the capabilities of conventional camcorders. Moreover, dual noise reduction and enhanced BIONZ image processing ensure smooth gradations with minimal noise in low-light conditions. This means you can add a cinematic sense of drama to virtually any scene.\n\nRELEASE TIME LAG\n\nWhen you press the shutter button, the a57 responds in 0.05 second \u2014 a blazing speed that rivals professional cameras. Made possible by an innovative electronic front curtain shutter, this accelerated response lets you capture decisive moments with utmost confidence. The electronic front curtain shutter also produces less shutter noise and vibration than a mechanical front curtain shutter (which can be activated if desired through the MENU). \nENHANCED OBJECT TRACKING\n\nNewly improved Object Tracking utilizes powerful predictive focusing algorithms, 15 AF points in a wide focus area, blazing-fast BIONZ image processing and Sony\u2019s original subject recognition technologies to track subjects with speed and precision. When your subject is a person, it automatically switches between face detection tracking and object tracking, depending on whether your subject is facing the camera. \n\nAVCHD VER. 2.0 (PROGRESSIVE) FULL HD 60P (50P)2 MOVIES\n\nCreate movies of amazing clarity that play extra smoothly by recording them at Full HD resolution (1920 x 1080 pixels) in the AVCHD Ver. 2.0 (Progressive) format \u2014 at the extremely high frame rate of 60 (50)2 fps. You can easily download the movies to your computer for editing and recording to Blu-ray media, which is highly compatible with the AVCHD Ver. 2.0 (Progressive) codec. Sony\u2019s lightning fast Exmor APS HD CMOS sensor and Full-time Continuous AF ensure flawless capture even at accelerated 60 (50)2 fp.\n\nFULL MANUAL MOVIE SHOOTING\nThe a57 frees you to realize your creative moviemaking vision. P/A/S/M modes (Program, Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority and Manual) let you flexibly adjust aperture and shutter speed to modify the depth of field and achieve effects like defocused backgrounds when shooting movies in the manual focusing mode. On-screen prompts provide assistance to make full manual operation quick, easy and comfortable. \nAUDIO NOISE REDUCTION\n\nSound is captured clearly with minimal noise thanks to a high-performance stereo microphone on the mirror housing and advanced noise reduction that effectively suppresses AF lens drive noise via innovative NR algorithm.\n\n24P (25P)2 CINEMA-LIKE EXPRESSION \n\nMovies played at theaters are traditionally captured at 24 (25)2 fps, creating a subtle but unmistakable look that film lovers everywhere associate with the cinema. Simply by capturing your movies at the same frame rate, in the progressive format at 24p (25p)2, you can recreate this look and endow your movies with an added sense of quality and drama. This feature, together with interchangeable-lens flexibility, exceptional image quality and advanced a57 capabilities, makes it easy to achieve your moviemaking aspirations. \n\nINTERCHANGEABLE-LENS FREEDOM\nLike a movie director, you can use whatever lens most effectively brings out the moment. Whether fisheye, telephoto, macro, fixed focal length or zoom lens, the a57 lets you take advantage of almost any system A-mount lens. Moreover, all of these lenses are compatible with the highspeed phase-detection AF system in the a57, enabling clear results in the most challenging conditions. \nONE-TOUCH MOVIE ACCESS\n\nWith one press of the Movie button, the a57 is ready to roll. The camera immediately enters movie recording mode even if you were shooting photographs continuously or in single-frame mode. It\u2019s the quick and easy way to capture every moviemaking opportunity. \n\n\nAUTO PORTRAIT FRAMING \n\nSimply photograph a person and new Auto Portrait Framing \u2014 the world\u2019s first feature of its kind3 \u2014 will save an additional, optimally framed image in the vertical or horizontal orientation. The feature even recognizes the direction your subject is facing and captures more of the scene in that direction to create a more appealing balance. Auto Portrait Framing employs face detection technology and the \u201crule of thirds\u201d principle to achieve this amazing feat. It also applies Sony\u2019s proprietary By Pixel Super Resolution Technology to Clear Image Zoom to ensure trimmed images feature the same number of pixels as the original. Even close-ups provide great results thanks to highly dramatic trimming.\n\nCLEAR IMAGE ZOOM\n\n\nDramatically enhanced Clear Image Zoom utilizes proprietary By Pixel Super Resolution Technology to zoom the center of your image up to 2x with nearly imperceptible degradation. It virtually doubles your zooming range to that of zoom lenses when using a standard lens or to that of super telephoto lenses when using a telephoto lens. So you can create dramatic \u201cclose-ups\u201d, enjoy greater shooting flexibility and take more advantage of the brightness of compact single focus lenses. \n\n\n\nFACE DETECTION, SMILE SHUTTER AND FACE REGISTRATION\n\nYou can always capture faces at their best with the a57. Face Detection technology ensures that facial features are clearly focused and skin tones are accurately reproduced by fine-tuning parameters such as exposure, white balance, flash and D-Range Optimizer. Smile Shutter captures smiles at just the right moment by automatically releasing the shutter when smiles reach the desired level, while Face Registration lets you register up to eight people for the camera to prioritize when detecting faces in groups. \nCREATIVE STYLE \n\nGive your photos and movies a creative look with Creative Style settings. Depending on the scene and your creative intentions, simply select any of 6 customizable settings (Standard, Vivid, Portrait, Landscape, Sunset, or Black & White) and the camera will adjust color and other image parameters accordingly. You can also fine-tune contrast, saturation6 and sharpness to suit your personal preference and achieve just the right finishing touch.\n\nPICTURE EFFECT\n\nOrdinary scenes become extraordinary photos and movies with Picture Effect. Choose from 11 customizable modes and 15 effects that significantly increase visual impact by adjusting camera parameters and applying advanced processing techniques. Settings include HDR Painting, Richtone Monochrome, Soft Focus and a Miniature mode that makes subjects look like miniature models. You can even monitor most effects in real time while shooting.\n\nENHANCED NEW TRU-FINDER\n\nThe Tru-finder electronic viewfinder delivers class-leading viewing ease thanks to sharp 1440k-dot (SVGA) resolution, a 23.1mm eye-point, and a notably wide 31.9-degree viewing angle that leaves competing optical viewfinders behind. A 100% field of view combines with faithful effects previews to ensure that what you see in the viewfinder is exactly what you see in your photos and movies. So you can fine-tune every aspect of your image with confidence and achieve desired results. On-screen displays keep you informed of current camera settings.\n\nSWEEP PANORAMA / 3D SWEEP\nPANORAMA\n\n\n\nSimply sweep the camera to capture breathtaking vistas. The 57 automatically records and seamlessly stitches a sequence of photos to create a spectacular image. 3D Sweep Panorama records separate right- and left-eye images to bring scenes alive when viewed on an HDMI-compliant 3D television8.\n\nAUTO HDR\n\nCapture more details in the shadows and highlights by activating Auto HDR. With one press, this instant High Dynamic Range mode takes three exposures at different settings and composites the best details from each \u2014 in the highlights, mid-tones and shadows \u2014 to create a single image with wider dynamic range than any single exposure could possibly capture. You can even shoot without using a tripod. The resulting HDR image is simply breathtaking in its detail, rich color and impact.\n\nDYNAMIC RANGE OPTIMIZER (DRO)\nDRO uses proprietary Sony technology to bring out details in the highlights and shadows and deliver naturally bright images. It can be used during continuous shooting and provides five userselectable levels of compensation. \nSUPERIOR AUTO MODE\n\nRelax and enjoy the convenience of point-and-shoot operation. Superior Auto mode automatically detects and analyzes shooting conditions and adjusts camera settings accordingly to achieve optimal results. It also activates advanced functions like continuous shooting if subjects are moving fast and Auto HDR if details are getting lost in the shadows and highlights. Active settings and functions are displayed on screen for easy confirmation at a glance.\n\nSOFTWARE AND CLOUD SERVICE\nPowerful, intuitive bundled software and a cloud service help you make the most of your photos and movies. Enjoy editing, file management and more. \n * \n * \n\n1. In Tele-zoom Continuous Advance Priority AE mode\n2. NTSC (PAL)\n3. As of Decemeber 2011. Among inter-changeable-lens digital cameras.\n4.
