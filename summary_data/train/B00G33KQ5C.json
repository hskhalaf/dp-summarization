He defied all logic by surviving all these years, so I wanted to do something special for him..RIP Gilbert..<><",

It also came with a nice card that I used as a grave marker until the flower seeds (that also came with the pod) start to bloom. I love that the pod is biodegradable and comes with flower seeds to grow so I can always remember my pet <3",

We then gave him a proper burial in a pretty pot where we planted the included perennial flower seedling leaf. We look forward to seeing Rainbow's flowers bloom as beautiful as he was.
