Since I don't use the monitor speakers, no big deal for me, but I tried them once and they suck. But the monitor being a monitor is great and the DVI, HDMI, and VGA options make these easy to set up whatever cords you have to setup. They also have the 4 hole mounting back so I switched from the stands to mounting all 3.",

To the novice user this means shutting everything off, unplugging everything and powering everything back on. With that said, I love the color on this monitor, and the resolution nice and crisp. If I nitpick, the stand leave a lot to be desired as I found the installation to be unnecessarily hard. Other manufacturers have this line up and click pedestal installation, which I prefer.",

Tried tons of different software to fix the issue, and none have corrected it. Also tried \"massaging\" the screen in the area that had the issue to no avail either. Overall the monitor is great, just unfortunate that they couldn't fix the pixel issue.",

Making adjustments via the tiny buttons on the front of most monitors is difficult and not intuitive.",

There are other 27\" monitors out there that offer 2560x1440, which gives you more 'real estate' on the same size screen. But for the $267 I paid for this in 2012, an excellent purchase.",

The only con is the speakers are not of great sound quality but they will work in a pinch if you have no other options. The software that comes with the monitor is better downloaded from AOCs website and the drivers are better updated with windows as Microsoft seems to have the most updated version of the driver. The Screen+ feature is great but does not work with all applications, however it is not a necessary feature. Awesome product for a great price.",

      "text": "I thought I was getting a heck of a buy for a 27\" monitor @ $200, but the screen has a dark pixel area on it. You don't notice it until you have a white screen like the one I am on now. Or while photo editing I keep trying to edit the bad pixel away. It has become quite irritating over the weeks. In hind site, I should have returned this monitor to Amazon for an exchange or refund.",
