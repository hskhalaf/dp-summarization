I recommend 100%, I will buy again definitely! The care you get is amazing! Buy this instead of store candle. I was excited that I could put the saying me and him say to eachother on the candle!",

I even paid extra for the expedited shipping. When it arrived, it was a mess. The candles oil seeped through somehow ruining the label and gotten all over the inside the box and the outside of the candle. The scent wasn\u2019t my favorite either, but that\u2019s just personal preference. It smelled more like Dial soap than fresh linens. I should\u2019ve just made my own.",
