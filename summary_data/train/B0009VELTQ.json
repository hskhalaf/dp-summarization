Both did the same thing, burned the bottom and left the inside not completely cooked. The recipe book is one of the best I have ever seen with with an ABM and the listing of times and bells for adding is very helpful but otherwise I would totally not recommend this product. I wish I had my old Westbend two paddle ABM, it was a wonderful machine that finally wore out. Don't spend your hard earned money on this product.",

Obviously it didn't mix well, so next time I tried to mix all the dry ingredients first, then stop it in mid-mixing to pull the flour away from the corners. This time I got bread with the right shape, with a wide dry vein of flour meandering through the middle. The only thing I could think of that would make a reasonable bread with this would be to make the bread before hand and put it in the machine to bake it! Seems like a lot of money for a timer.",

The bread machine is quite big to start and the loaves started coming out with think crust even in the light setting and ended up covering the pan with Aluminium foil as mentioned in one of the reviews. This helped with that but the paddle was always a problem. One would have to wait for the remove paddle beep to remove and if not the loaf was invariably come out torn. After couple of weeks, the paddle became loose and would come off part way during the cycle! I had to keep checking the machine to fix the paddle back in the pan!",

Once I made sure everything was mixed, I started the cycle from the beginning. It seems that I can't enter the correct code for the recipe I was making either. So far, I'm thinking that I should have just stuck to baking bread in the oven. This machine is not saving me time if I'm hand mixing anyway. I'll try again though.",

The convection took a bit of getting used to (everything browned more than I expected), but other than that everything's fine. I use the machine at least once a week for breadmaking plus mixing dough for pizzas. I especially like the ability to turn off the mixing alarms. (Small thing, I know, but what'll you do.)",

I highly recommend this product; it's exactly what we were looking for.",

If you are watching your carb intake, get ready to have your willpower tested, lol. If you keep the necessary basic ingredients on hand, you'll end up making more bread than you know what to do with. It's fun to use, super easy cleanup and of course makes great loaves! It does take a little practice to get the recipes just right sometimes due to humidity (living in Alabama doesn't help!), but once you find what works best you will not be dissatisfied with this product!",

I have found the only ones that are not are the ones that contain milk and egg. I like that you have three choices of bread sizes. I also like the seperate yeast dispenser.

I figured I got about $15 of use out of the old machine, so I returned it - I also felt it was the honest thing to do. My new machine is working so far.

Entertaining is easy with 3 crust colors, 3 loaf size options, and over 100 bread, dough, cake, and jam combinations with minimum fuss.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nTroubleshooting Tips:\n\nWhen using the bread maker, please make sure that you first set the removable bread pan in the basin of the bread maker *BEFORE* inserting the kneading paddle into the bottom of the bread pan. Failure to do so can cause the kneading paddle to unseat itself when the bread pan is inserted and locked in to the unit. To insert the bread pan, follow the instructions in the use and care guide. Please pay specific attention to the snaps on the left and the right side of the bread pan. Both snaps need to engage to secure the bread pan into place. Failure to do so will result in an improper fit between the unit and the bread pan, causing noise and failing to knead the ingredients properly.",
