The second part that annoyed me a bit was you cant really use an equalizer to put a bit more bass it will just lower the volume on the voice or the other instruments other than everything else was fine and the 3.5mm cable is really short and thin",

      "text": "This is one of the best electronic devices I have purchased for years. Of course everyone buy it for its pixel display, but I never imagine this can be so addictive to play with. The app allows you to create your own pixel arts and project it on the small screen, or share with users around the world. A very great idea to allow people not only interact with their own devices but the real user community. And it has been in the market for almost two years (how could I miss it?)! Good sound quality (from a layman's perspective).",
