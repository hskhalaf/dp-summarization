The replacement was rock hard and not at all like the first. The company kept insisting it was the same mattress. My guess is that most of the good reviews are from 2016 and older, and that they changed the mattress to correct the continuous \"dipping\" problem I've seen others have. The problem is that the newer model is way too hard and not at all what we were initially happy with.",

      "text": "It's OK? I use it on my hospital bed. As for that, it keeps sliding off the side which I'm certain it wouldn't do if on a regular box spring or solid surface. It's not as cool as I expected, but not hot either! It's way easier to pick up and move because of the edging, piping. You can grab hold of that and it's way lighter than a solid foam floppy mattress. It has a bit of structure. I would definitely buy this for a replacement mattress in a heart beat for bunk beds etc. As a main everyday or night mattress, no. Good deal though.",
