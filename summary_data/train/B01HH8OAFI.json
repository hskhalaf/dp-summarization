Very comfortable shoe. Great traction. Again, the comfort is amazing. My biggest complaint, and this is a knit pick, is that the shoelaces are 'stretchy' and can be difficult to get the undone without taking your shoes off like an 8 year old. ;) I'll manage.",

Got the usual comfort I expect from them except for one thing: my left foot doesn't seem to fit squarely in the shoe. There's a tendon or nerve that constantly rolls off the side of the insert and it is pretty aggravating. I'm not sure if the insert is too small or what. I've never had this issue before with any shoe ever. Maybe I got a dud of a left shoe.",

After breaking them in, they feel fine, but I've got to be careful not to tighten them too tight. I don't know if it's the laces or the lace system, but when tied tight, it really squeezes my foot.

    "description": "Merrell Agility Peak Flex Trail Running Shoes Get ready to tear up the trails in the Merrell Agility Peak Flex Trail Running Shoes. Featuring a hefty grip, Hyperlock Technology and reflective details, these shoes provide everything you need and more to excel on long runs and rugged terrain. Mesh and TPU Upper A combination of fabric, mesh and TPU make up the materials for the upper, making it durable and breathable even in warm weather. The mesh allows air to circulate through the shoe to the foot, creating excellent ventilation in the process. Meanwhile, the TPU detailing protects the shoes from any wear and tear you'll undoubtedly encounter out on the trails, such as sharp rocks or branches. The lace-up front complete with Merrell Omni-fit Lacing System allows a snug, glove like fit to minimise your foot moving within the shoe during long runs. M-select Fresh antimicrobial agents also feature throughout the shoe to minimise odour and prevents moisture or sweat affecting the freshness of your shoes. EVA Midsole The midsole, consisting of a comfortable EVA cushioning offers extra protection against uneven ground and minimises your discomfort at all times. FLEXconnect EVA dual-directional flex-groove Technology increases your stability, letting you remain agile even on rough, rocky and uneven ground. A Hyperlock moulded TPU heel counter features provides extra security during quick decents and sharp turns, making these shoes perfect for mountain-side or hilly trails. For extra comfort a EVA foot bed is located in the shoe, which can be removed or changed according to your preference. Grip+ Outsole Featuring an M-select Grip+ Outsole, these shoes offer incredible grip and unbelievable traction. Skeleton-style lugs allows the outsole to stick to any ground, either wet or dry, making these shoes ideal for any kind of weather. The outsole is also highly durable, and releases dirt and debris as you run with its specialised lugs.",
