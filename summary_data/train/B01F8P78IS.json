Reading reviews on various items, this one had the best reviews. And, indeed, those reviews were correct! I make a full pot in the kitchen, pour it in the carafe, and it stays hot. Love it!",

I drink tea all day and I was tired of making tea forgetting about it nuking it. This way I have hot tea on demand all day. I clean it before bed fill it with hot water and it's warm and ready to be filled in the morning. I'd recommend this product. I'm very happy with my purchase \ud83d\ude0a",

I can't say how it will hold up over time but for now I am very pleased and recommend this product to anyone looking for a way to keep your beverage of choice hot. Not sure how it does for cold but I'm guessing just as well",

      "text": "This carafe keeps the coffee hot better than most of the other metal options I have ever used. However, the caveat is that the mouth is so narrow that I cannot fit the scrub-brush inside to wash this. The opening is also so narrow that I cannot fit my strainer into the opening - but have tweaked it with the use of a funnel. It also has a tendency to drip all over the place when one pours out the very last bit of any liquid inside (lid open, but attached). The trigger-spout option is much nicer than the twist-top types that don't drip though, so I am willing to overlook that issue.",

The reason I ordered it was because we lost power during a storm recently. When the generator was running we had hot coffee, but we'd shut it off while were out cutting up tress that had fallen. I wanted to be able to have hot coffee (or water for hot chocolate, tea, etc) even when the generator was off. I think this will meet our needs.",

I did ask if they retained the heat as that was the problem with the old ones....someone said \"there was still steam coming out\". SO, let's hope they fulfill our mission. We liked the discount with multiples as well. Thank you!",

Over all I like this carafe: it holds a full pot of brewed coffee from a Cuisinart with plenty of room for cream and sugar, it keeps the coffee hot/warm/drinkable for the better part of a day, easy to keep clean. The one major flaw? After pouring a cup of coffee, the pour spout dribbles. Every. Time. What a pain. Not sure if this is an isolated issue with just my carafe or a major design flaw, but it's a deal breaker for me. I'm giving this one away and buying a different model.",
