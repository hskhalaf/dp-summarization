      "text": "This lovely orange fragrance freshens the air when cleaning.. The spray bottle is made well unlike so many spray bottles that only seem to last a month. Remember to shake well after it is diluted and before each use.I did dilute the mix recommendation further. I tried on both my laminate floors and tile floors and it leaves a somewhat sticky surface. It definitely needs a fresh microfiber mop head to rinse the floors so they are not sticky and show the footprints. It works great keeping the inside of car fresh, but remember to rinse well.",

Hopefully it stopes raining to see the full potential of this item.",

I didn't buy it as a cleaner, but I love the smell and now use it for the kitchen counters!",

We grabbed our bottle of Green Gobbler because we didn't have anything else and it not only took care of cleaning up both messes quickly, but it also made the room smell so good! Nothing amazes my husband but when he saw how fast the mess cleaned up out of the carpet he was sold on this product. I use this product to clean with everywhere and I am also excited by the fact that it cleans my stainless steel with a perfect shine. I highly recommend this product to anyone!",
