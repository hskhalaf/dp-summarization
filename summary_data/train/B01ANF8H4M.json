This might be good for small design applications but it isn't good for large designs on shirts for 2 reasons: 1. As shown in photos, the heat isn't consistent throughout the heat plate. 2. The temperature indicator is always 25-100 degrees higher than the actual temperature on the plate depending on where you measure the heat. In the photos I set the heat press to 400F and got heat measurements from 275-380F.",

That can and has ruined multiple projects: t-shirts, at least a hundred dollars in vinyl, etc. I planned on earning my money back from this purchase, but instead I haven\u2019t been able to even start a business selling any products because they would never adhere correctly.

      "text": "Works just fine for my needs. Sticking heat transfer vinyl to various materials and doing dye-sublimation prints on fabric or Corian plastic. Heats up quickly to about 400 deg F if needed. I set it at 320 deg for HTV prints. Simple timer/temp control. Only negative I have, is that the platen \"shelf\" does not allow for putting the side opposite the print side of a t-shirt underneath. Lack of swing away feature is not a problem.",
