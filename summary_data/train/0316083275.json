      "text": "This book has great information on raising a puppy. I have used the \"bed tethering\" method for containing the puppy at night and it worked from day one. She was happy to be near us and did not soil the area. Very interesting book - both training and explaining the birth and first 12 weeks of puppyhood. It is the book to read before you get the pup! Just great insight on what kind of dog may suit you and your family.",

I recommend you read it before you even get a puppy! The first few nights of having the pup are so important how you introduce him to the house and everything. Buy the book, read it and apply it to the pup. You owe it to him!!",

Your dog just wants to be with you and please you, and this book helps you learn how to understand your new puppy. I first read this in the 1990's, and think this is still the best puppy book overall. The authors are not fans of \"Crating\", i.e., caging your dog up for long periods. Dogs need to be with you - sleep in your room, smell your breath, be part of your pack. A dog that has proper excercise, feeding, healthcare, and love will become part of your family. So please don't cage your new \"baby\"!",
