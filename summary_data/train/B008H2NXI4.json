It's just me and 1 small dog in my house so it hasn't been roughed up, it only goes on one bed. I first noticed the unravelling of the stitching after the second wash, about 2 months after purchase. Loved it to start out with but sad about the quality.",

For some reason, I thought that it said regular pillows. So, had to buy a pair of cheapie pillows to fill them. Not a big deal. The quilt hangs below our tall, pillow-top mattress by about 4 inches or so. It might show a box spring on some beds, but we don't have a box spring, so it looks great on our platform bed. Didn't come wrinkled, so I didn't even have to iron. Love that!",

We like to sleep a little cooler at night and this quilt is perfect. It's cotton so it's let's us breathe instead of holding all the body heat in, yet it provides weight an snuggly-ness (yes that's a word I just made it up).",
