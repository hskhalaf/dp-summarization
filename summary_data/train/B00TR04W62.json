I've only had the bottle for two days, and I don't think I've used much at all; I'll see how far it takes me.",

While I thought this product worked to help hide it a little, it did not completely eliminate the noticeable scalp line like shown in some of the pictures, at least not for me. This product would would probably be better for people with small balding spots versus large areas to cover; I think that with overall thin hair too much of the product makes it look like you have dirt on your head. That being said, it is better than nothing but you can also use eyeshadow close to your hair color for the same effect at a fraction of the cost.",

It lasted me 3 months and I would use it about 3 times a week for second day hair, or any time I had noticeable thin spots with my style for the day. It's easy to apply, and yes it can get messy (on the counter) but it's easy to clean up with a wet towel. So glad I found this stuff. *I'll update with pictures*",
