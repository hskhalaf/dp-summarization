A lot of the infant towels that we registered for and purchased for our baby are really thin and, honestly, pretty useless when wrapped around a screaming and writhing wet infant. This towel gets used a lot because its thicker and more comfortable for the baby once he's wrapped in it. He doesn't cry at all when wrapped in this towel. It keeps its shape well when washed and dried as well.",
