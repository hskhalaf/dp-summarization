ISmartAlarm is convenient, functional, and super easy to use and set up. I have recommended the system to two people and both have purchased and are happy with the recommendation. I plan to get a system for my grandmother! I get alerts for new products because I keep upgrading and adding additional products when they are released. Also, customer service is phenomenal! They answer quickly and ensure the issue/comment/question is addressed and resolved. This system does not fail and I have never had a false alarm. Highly recommend!!!",

While you can adjust the siren volume to Low, Medium, or High, which is what I have mine set for; it is extremely loud and would scare any would be burglar away. Setting up and connecting the iPhone app was a breeze. Triggering the alarm sends text, email and most importantly a phone call, a few seconds after the alarm triggers. If you have a small condo or apartment and looking for a reliable wireless security system without the monthly monitoring fees, this is it. I highly recommend the iSmart Security System.",
