Actually it's a little triangular and fits better between fingers than even traditional pens... I only wish the iOS App was updated more frequently than couple times a year. Also automated iCloud syncing feature is missing, so after using iPhone for a few days, I can't seamlessly open the same app on iPad and continue writing. I'd absolutely recommend this pen to everyone and hope the company in South Korea grows bigger and continues innovation.",

I love that the notes I jot down are with me on my phone at all times, so even if I don't have my notebook, my notes are still available. I have used the notebooks and printed out the paper for use as well. I was concerned about the size of the pen, I do not like \"fat\" pens, but due to the rounded triangular shape it feels like a regular sized pen when writing. I did quite a bit of research before purchasing and am more than pleased with the product.",

However, I have had others try it and found a few people that write at an angle ( pen to notebook rotation in the up axis ) that causes the smartpen not to track. The issue was resolved by rotating the notebook so that it was oriented to their hand/arm and not their body.",
