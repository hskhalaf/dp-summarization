I don't do VR chat, I'm into the adventure games, none of which support the tracker. Still disappointed, I am thinking that this just isn't catching fire with the developers.",

I mean, they are just gizmos that allow for extra tracked body parts. what else are ya gonna need? other than 3 of these and the belt straps?",

As for how to put these on: - For two of the trackers, put each on the top of your foot while wearing socks. - For the waist tracker, put it at either the left side or the right side of your waist, so you can lay down without losing tracking.",
