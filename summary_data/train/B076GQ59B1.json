The cape is soft, but durable, just like at a high end barbershop, and it came with a wood comb and a nice bag to keep it all in. When he used it there was no mess and the cape was super easy to clean. Just a little shake outside and that was that! Overall I\u2019m very happy with it. It did exactly what I wanted it to and it\u2019s quality exceeded my expectations.",

One thing he mentioned about the shapers comb and I agree is the comb should have been the whole bottom part, making the forks go across the whole bottom. The bib itself barely fit his neck, he is stocky. Should have more room in the neck hole. It is more expensive than others. All in all though decent product.",
