The user interface is about as easy to use as I've seen in a point and shoot. a 16-GB card holds 5K pictures or about 1 hour of video.",

      "text": "I love these little cameras, and have bought three of them over the last 7 years. They take great video, great pictures, and the zoom lens is fairly quiet and quick even in video mode. My only real gripe with them is a relatively short battery life, but I have four of the batteries used with them so I never worry about that. Newer cameras in my opinion haven't really changed for the better in certain aspects where this one excels, so I'm sticking with this one as long as it's still available!",

The zoom is pretty good for a little camera. Also, I just find it to be the perfect size for a travel camera...very easy for my spouse & I to take selfies with. I also love pink. :)",

Personally, I think it is better than some of Canon's higher end non-SLR cameras like SX50 HS (which I own as well). Only thing with Canon point and shoot cameras is that the lens front metal plate is too flimsy. It easily gets bent and hampers the lens cover movement. I have seen that with many people's cameras. Even mine arrived with the lens front already bent. I exchanged it for another one but, had to take the horrible blue one. Alas, now my wife has misplaced the camera :(",

So far, I'm very satisfied with this camera. The images and exposures are outstanding. Its basic operation (zoom, changing modes, focusing and shooting) are fast and smooth. It has very good color saturation and seems to handle low-light situations (a primary weakness of many point-and-shoots) well. It's \"only\" 12 MP, on the low side for current-generation cameras, but it has an outstanding 14X optical zoom. I'm finding the menus a little confusing but overall I think this is a really good point-and-shoot.",

But after getting used to it ... so many situations are such that i DO NOT WANT flash such as performances that say \"No flash photography\" so I would have been constantly checking the settings to confirm that flash is off. With this, you just hold your left finger over the pop-up when you turn it on and Presto, no flash. And you KNOW the flash is off. (And by the way, it takes very good pictures in low light!) It's actually very simple. If you want flash again before you turn it off/on, just manually flip it up.",

This SX230 disappointed me with the blur of the pictures at the higher zooms. Backing off the zoom did result in better picture quality, but why have all the zoom if you can't use it? The low light capabilities were disappointing. And the final straw was the GPS not reading my location. I felt this camera did not deliver the Canon quality I was expecting, and flat out did not have a functional GPS for the camera. Canon, you can do better than this.",

Highly recommended. It is small in size, and when turned on the lens ins't as big as others, but it still gives you exceptional performance for a point-and-shoot camera. [UPDATE] I still recommend this camera. I have been using it for family events and some casual photos and it delivers as much as expected. Great photos. It is the best point-and-shoot camera on the market. Even that is not as new nowadays, it will beat a whole lot of cameras out there in the market.",

That's about the only annoyance, but a big one for us since we like to take videos often.",

    "description": "Color:BlueCanon PowerShot SX230HS 12 MP Digital Camera with HS SYSTEM and DIGIC 4 Image Processor (Blue)\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nExperience the Power.\n\nCanon's HS SYSTEM with a 12.1 Megapixel CMOS and DIGIC 4 Image Processor improves shooting in low-light situations without the need for a flash and lowers noise levels at higher ISO settings.\nThe Canon HS SYSTEM takes the frustration out of low light shooting. The system delivers clear, blur-free shots with all the ambiance intact, and frees you from the sometimes unwanted effects of using the flash. Beautiful low light shots are possible at both low and high ISO speeds, and the dynamic range is expanded to retain maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas.\n\nThe system is the result of two technologies brought together in a compact PowerShot. The first is the 12.1 Megapixel CMOS Sensor, which positions the light-receiving surface for optimal light reception. More light means clearer, blur-free images with plenty of detail and nuance, even in dark areas. Working together with the CMOS sensor to deliver the HS SYSTEM is Canon's advanced DIGIC 4 Image Processor, which actively reduces noise and delivers high speed image processing.\n\n\n\nMemorable Moments in Spectacular Full HD.\n\nFull 1080p HD Video for exceptional quality with stereo sound, plus a dedicated movie button for easy access. Zoom optically while shooting video and keep footage stabilized with Dynamic IS.\nExperiencing the brilliance of Full 1080p HD video in a Canon PowerShot ELPH digital camera has never been easier. With the convenient dedicated movie button, you'll be able to instantly record everyday moments in amazing life-like realism at a push of a button. You can also operate the optical zoom while shooting video so you can get in close\u2013but don't worry about shaky footage because Dynamic IS will help keep your videos steady! \n\n\n\nThe Ideal Travel Companion.\nRemember where you were and when your pictures were taken with a GPS tracker that records your location, and a logger lets you view the locations on a map via Canon's software. \nThe new PowerShot SX230 HS digital camera is the first PowerShot digital camera to come equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS)* technology. Now you can travel the world and let the camera automatically record the locations and local times of your stills and videos for you to vividly remember time and time again! You can also maximize the usefulness of this GPS technology by using the special bundled Map Utility software that makes sharing the memories of your worldly adventures very fun. Besides displaying all your photos' locations on a world map, the SX230 HS digital camera's GPS system can also track your route from photo to photo\u2013a great way to visualize how much you've traveled during a particular trip! You can also create and share custom maps\u2013like a personal mini-travel guide!\u2013with friends and family members to give them ideas on what to see and do when they visit a particular destination.\n\n\n\n\n\n* In certain countries and regions, the use of GPS may be restricted. Therefore, be sure to use GPS in accordance with the laws and regulations of your country or region. Be particularly careful when traveling outside your home country. \n\n\nAs a signal is received from GPS satellites, take sufficient measures when using in locations where the use of electronics is regulated.\n\n\nThis software uses Google Map for displaying maps.\n\nIncredible Zooming Power.\nPowerful 14x Optical Zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer and a 28mm Wide-Angle lens. Great overall zoom for a family vacation to your favorite tourist destination. \nA powerful 14x Optical Zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer and a 28mm Wide-Angle lens provides a wide range of shooting possibilities that are great for traveling and everyday photography. The versatile 14x Optical Zoom will let you get the shot you want, whether it's a close-up or a subject that's far away. An ultra wide lens will let you photograph large groups, beautiful landscape and tall buildings, while the Optical Image Stabilizer will help keep images steady and clear. \n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Smart AUTO for Stills and Videos that Shine.\nSmart AUTO intelligently selects the proper settings for the camera based on 32 predefined shooting situations.\nThe PowerShot SX230 HS digital camera takes the quality of your still images and videos to a whole new level - automatically. The camera's advanced Smart AUTO system detects a wealth of information about the scene you're shooting, then automatically selects the optimal settings for you. Now with an expanded range of 32 shooting scenarios, the camera handles a wide variety of situations, freeing you up to concentrate on composing your shot and capturing the moment you're looking for. From portraits to landscapes to action scenes, the PowerShot SX230 HS digital camera has you covered whether you're shooting stills or videos. \n\n * Smart AUTO\n   The camera automatically selects the best shooting settings for optimal quality based on subjects and environmental factors to provide point-and-shoot simplicity.\n * P Program\n   Access advanced exposure compensation features while shooting mostly automatically.\n * Av Aperture-priority\n   You define the aperture to either isolate your subject or have clarity throughout the entire picture, and the camera will choose the corresponding shutter speed.\n * Tv Shutter-priority\n   You select the shutter speed to stop or blur action, and the camera finds the appropriate aperture. With slow exposure times, Canon's noise reduction system activates to ensure low image noise.\n * Movie Digest Mode\n   Records a video clip before capturing a still image and then combines one day's worth of clips into a video.\n * Portrait\n   The camera sets a large aperture, focusing the subject and artistically blurring the background to make your subject pop.\n * Kids & Pets\n   Reduced focusing time freezes fast-moving subjects, so you won't miss those special shots.\n * Smart Shutter\n   The camera automatically takes the photo when people smile, wink, or get into frame.\n * High-speed Burst\n   The camera shoots continuously at a high speed of approx. 8.2fps while you hold down the shutter.\n * Best Image Selection\n   The camera takes five photos in succession, and then chooses the best one out of the bunch.\n * Handheld Night Scene\n   Suppresses image blur even without the help of a tripod.\n * Low Light\n   For high quality image capture in an amazing range of dimly-lit situations.\n * Fisheye Effect\n   Add a classic photo distortion without a fisheye lens.\n * Miniature Effect for Movies & Stills\n   Emphasizes perspective for a miniature effect by blurring upper and bottom portions of videos and stills.\n * Toy Camera Effect\n   Simulates photos taken with \"toy\" or pinhole cameras, darkening the image at the edges to create a vignette effect.\n * Creative Light Effect\n   Transform background bright spots to stars, hearts, music motes and more.\n * Monochrome\n   Choose from three single-tone effects: Black-and-White, Sepia, or Blue.\n * Super Vivid\n   Super Vivid intensifies existing hues, saturating the scene with bright colors.\n * Poster Effect\n   Poster Effect combines several similar shades into one color, turning subtle gradations into eye-catching, scene-popping contrasts.\n * Color Accent\n   Choose to retain a single color in your image while other colors turn monochrome.\n * Color Swap\n   Select a color and replace it with a color you specify for special effects.\n * Beach\n   Get clear shots of people at a sunny beach without darkened faces.\n * Foliage\n   Capture brilliant shots of autumn foliage, greenery and blossoms.\n * Snow\n   Shoot clear snow scenes without darkened subjects or an unnatural bluish tint.\n * Fireworks\n   Grab brilliant images of skyrocketing fireworks.\n * Stitch Assist\n   Build awe-inspiring panoramas by neatly aligning sequential images.\n\nMovie\nShoot in Full HD (1920 x 1080) at 24 fps for up to 14 min. and 34 sec. or 4GB per clip. Shoot in HD (1280 x 720) at 30 fps for up to 20 min and 43 sec. or 4GB per clip. Shoot in VGA (640 x 480) at 30 fps for up to 43 min. and 43 sec. or 4GB per clip and QVGA (320 x 240 at 30 fps) for up to 1 hour 58 min. and 19 sec. or 4GB per clip. Also shoot in iFrame Movie format (1280 x 720) at 30 fps for up to 13 min. and 35 sec. or 4GB per clip.\n\n\nSuper Slow Motion Movie\nRecord your clips in high speed (approx. 240fps), and then watch your videos in slow motion.\n\n\nActual results may vary from examples shown above.\nFinal image may vary depending on picture composition. Easily Turn Your Memories into Videos.\nMovie Digest Mode records a short video clip right before shooting a still image and then combines one day's worth of clips into one video.\nPutting together a video containing highlights from family vacations, important occasions and other special events is now easier than you might imagine. Using the Movie Digest Mode, you can have the camera automatically record a short video clip (up to approximately 4 seconds) every time you shoot a still image. The camera will then combine an entire day's worth of clips into a single video. No editing required \u00d0 Movie Digest Mode does all the work, so you can sit back and enjoy your video!\n\nAdd some Fun to Your Photos!\nNew scene modes, Toy Camera Effect and Monochrome, add an artistic look to your photos.\nAdd some vintage nostalgia with Toy Camera Effect. Toy Camera Effect recreates this look by darkening the edges to make them appear as if they were photographed through a pinhole lens and adding contrast.\n\n\n\n\n\nMonochrome lets you sway away from the usual black & white combination. Now you can choose from three single-toned effects: Black & White, Sepia or Blue to really give your photos the effect you're looking for.\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the Image on a Big Screen.\nLarge, bright 3.0-inch wide PureColor System LCD with high resolution and wide viewing angle.\nThe PowerShot SX230 HS digital camera's high resolution (461,000 dots) 3.0-inch wide PureColor System LCD gives you the big picture, whether you're shooting, reviewing or showing off your images.
