I have read complaints on poor battery life. I have gotten 10 mins of battery life with the standard battery and a little over 11 mins with aftermarket batteries. One warning do not fly this past 60 meters other wise you may lose connection and if it is over water when this happens it will land in the water because the fail-safe feature when you lose connection is to auto-land. otherwise this is a great product.",

Oh, also the pre-expanded battery expansion will crack open the cheap case that's supposed to hold it, so the battery won't even fit into the thing, so I can't fly it.

Batteries last longest when in plane mode with little wind. I bought 3 more batteries so my kids and I can all I have a turn. Phone hookup allows you to see how much battery is left and allows you to do some one button tricks. Camera is basically useless, but I don't mind- don't have any need for it. Tough construction- it can withstand drops and running into stuff. Would definitely buy again!",

      "text": "I have a lot of RC airplanes and Quadcopters, but this is by far the coolest little quad that I have ever tried. It is very easy to control. Very stable. In Quad mode flies very steady and in airplane mode is steady and can fly slow or fast. I even was able to hover it around my living room in quad mode with no problem. Outside it can even stand a little bit of wind. This is a very excellent addition to my RC fleet! I have ordered additional batteries so I can fly longer without having to wait for recharge. Nice job! I highly recommend.",

      "text": "Easy to fly but not recommended for flying when more than 5mph of wind. Instructions to connect phone via bluetooth to the flypad were difficult to understand. Parrot's technical service dept. was very helpful and easy to understand to complete the connection. The phone connection doesn't offer much to the flying experience over just using the flypad. A good product and vertical takeoff and landing making the flying experience hard to mess up.",
