      "text": "I purchased this smart sprinkler device with some doubts since I asked for a RACHIO Smart sprinkler controller for Christmas last year, and that cost over $200! As I researched I found that this device can do everything the RACHIO can do for half the price. I needed some way to control the sprinklers at my rental property and so I thought I would risk spending the $95 for this device. I'm glad I did. I was totally \"Blown-Away\" at how easy the installation was and the WiFi set-up was easy as well. In my opinion, you can't go wrong with this purchase. WATCH MY VIDEO - For more DETAILS.

The support representative told me to contact Amazon and that they could not help me. There is a slip of paper included with the unit that states, \"Do not return the unit to the place of purchase and to contact customer support first.\" You have all seen those messages before so I was a bit surprised by them telling me to contact Amazon and offered no assistance. I give Orbit Zero Stars for such poor customer service so I cannot recommend anyone buy their products again. Horrible customer service! Do not buy!",

I printed them out, and now all is fine. It accesses the forecast via Wi-Fi, and sets an automatic rain delay when necessary Love being able to set a \"rain delay\" for X amount of days if I don't want the yard watered for a while. You can set it for odd/even date watering for communities with rationing conditions, or set it for specific days of the week. Programming is easy using the phone app. One of my favorite purchases of the year.",

Installation time included removing the old manual control rainbird (relic from the Arc), relocating the mounting screws to align with my wiring harness. Down loaded the app, load the MAC address into router, connect, set station, test and set program. It started as programmed and worked perfect. I looked at more expensive units that had more features that I determined I really didn't need. This unit the Orbit 57950 B-hyve Smart Indoor/Outdoor 12-Station WiFi Sprinkler System Controller is the best bang for the buck in my view.",

      "text": "I love this sprinkler controller! So easy to set up and work from the phone. My husband did the install and he thought that was straightforward even with outr 9 station system. He plans to add one more so we can add water to the pool by remote also. We haven't connected it to our google home yet but I love just seeing it on the phone- I have a picture for each zone and have been showing it to my neighbors. The sale price of $90 was outstanding- I would have paid full price for this one.",

      "text": "Nice for the price. Installation was easy. Had to cut the transformer cord to hard wire. Set up is super easy. The only thing I don't like and why it is 4 stars is the app. Requires log on each time, even if the phone screen times out. Pain in the ***. Otherwise, I love it. *****UPDATE***** So after I write this review the app keeps me logged in so changing to 5 stars. I guess the squeaky wheel does get the grease!",
