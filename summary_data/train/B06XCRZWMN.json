      "text": "I like the product. Easy to install and easy to work off the app. However I bought this because it was tied into the local weather and local rain restrictions based off of my address. Needless to say the restrictions dont seem to be taking effect as the sprinklers are going off in the rain and snow. It also disconnects from the internet a lot on it's own. I have to constantly recycle the power to get it to connect. If they can fix those two issues with a firmware update it will be prime product. Lots of zones, you can monitor your water usage and customize areas. There is a really good support community forum as well.",

I\u2019m hoping they improve some of these issues. If they do it will be 5 stars",
