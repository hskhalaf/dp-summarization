I work security and I've worn these every shift for a year now and I couldn't be happier. The shock support and slip resistance is amazing and they are really easy to clean and shine. I can't speak for if they are waterproof or water resistant but they definitely keep my feet dry. I am 21 have really bad knees and I don't feel nearly as much soreness at the end of the day when I wear these.",
