This scale is a little more expensive but it is more full featured and considerably more durable. Purchased it in March 2010 and gave it pretty hard use for the first year and a half and normal use since. It still retains its accuracy and no electrical problems like the previous ones. UPDATE 09/18/2017: Scale is still working great and is still very accurate after much use. UPDATE 06/30/2019: Scale is still working great and is still very accurate after much use.",

I initially tested it with my wife's work-out 1-2-3-5 lb barbells and they were all over the stated weight by a few ounces. Then weighed packages to be sent by USPO and Fed-X. The one at the post office weighed exactly the same to the .1 oz and the Fed-x differed by 1 oz (the clerk may have rounded). So far it seems that it will be accurate enough for my purposes but time will tell. I'll try to update this review after more useage.",

The ability to measure in various units as well as the hold function that allows you to weigh items that would normally block the screen have proved invaluable time and time again.

We also discovered (by accident) that our kitty will tolerate being weighed on the scale...especially if we leave it out and allow her to make the decision when to get on the scale. This helped us accurately weigh her to purchase the correct dose of flea medicine.",

The 'hold' feature that allows me to see the weight after I remove items from the scale is also helpful when dealing with bulky items that may obstruct viewing the display.

I'm the testing coordinator for a high school and we're handling over 8000 test books and 2,200 answer documents. Weighing the materials rather than counting has greatly improved our efficiency and sped the check out/check in time for teachers. I like that it operates by plug or batteries. It also has a myriad of different weight measurement options. Great value!",
