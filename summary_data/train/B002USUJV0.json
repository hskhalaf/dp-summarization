I purchased this as a breakfast table to put in my kitchen. It was easy to assemble my friend and I put it together in a little over an hour from opening the box to having it all in place. A drill was the only tool needed that it did no come with and that was to secure the cushions to the stool which you don't really need to do because it fits securely without the screws.",

I'm somewhat of a skeptic when it comes to buying furniture off Amazon, but I bought this set (bought the chairs off Amazon as well since I wanted a bar stool with a back to it) and I couldn't be any happier with it. The faux marble and cherry wood match the rest of my furniture in my house and it is very sturdy. Being a woman, this was super easy to out together as well being it has all the holes and posts put in for you and all you need to so is simply screw on the legs to the top.",

If it gets any moisture or humidity sitting on it for any amount of time, the paper swells up and the layers separate. There is no way to get the swollen bubbles out and if it happens on the edge it expands like a sponge. It\u2019s a pity, because the rest of the table (and pub stools) wore so well. I just wish the top were wood as too or at least laminated well. The virtue of the top ruins what could be a lasting piece of furniture.",

Be careful not to over tighten because it seems to strip the wood pretty easy. Other than that this was a excellent deal and I'm glad I found it. My wife and I needed a bench and chairs for date night we were going to have outside and I couldn't believe I found this for that price.",

Anybody looking to buy this table, take your money elsewhere. I won't be buying anything from this company again.",

The 4-seat table I have (gifting soon) is taking up space I could use to expand my living room. So this table is great if you need a small table for company or to eat on occasionally. Assembly took about an hour. The toughest was the chairs. Table is a bit wobbly and chairs are decent enough for the price. Would not use the chairs every day so it's nice they fit under the table. FYI, The little brown \"nail coverings\" pop out very easily so I don't use them. All in all it's a great buy",

The stools are small and comfortable but I opted to get two bar stools with backs. For those of you who like to cook or bake, this table is PERFECT for that. You could easily flour the surface and roll out dough, and the height means your back won't ache. Of course, I'm 6'5\" so maybe you won't have that issue. A great purchase all around, and a great value.",

It wasn't too difficult to assemble, although I needed to use an extra small screwdriver not included. Every single little decorative knob you put in the chairs last fell out. I'd have to glue them in to stay but I don't care that much.

The table and stools seem sturdy but the table gives a bit of a wobble. Be careful not to overtighten screws on the table and stools! They all go in easy and I don't even think the screws for the stool seats are needed, as mentioned in another review. Overall we got more than what I expected for a good price. Nice solid set.

I used every single piece ut came w/ so the only thing that this doesn't provide is a mallet to hammer those little wooden pieces into the stools so u dont see the screws.

The legs of the table and chairs bend rather easily, and the overall design makes it easy for the legs to not be perpendicular to the ground. The table is very light \u2014 this makes it convenient for moving, but also makes it very easy to accidentally move when using. Decent product, but wouldn\u2019t pay more than the $100 we paid for it.",
