I bought it as used - like new - in original box but obviously it was a return because of the legs error. Needed to use it immediately so didn't return it.",

Back has three settings of incline which is nice, great for my small for appartment. Update. 3months after purchase and use. So there definitely is a loss of firmness which seems due to lack of spring supporting the cushion. Opend the bottom and the support are very minimal. There is also a wood beam running the the middle of the seat. That can be felt while sitting. Definitely better deal when the chair was cheaper. Needs some tweaks.",

Quite light I guess, makes it easy to move when moving to new house or apt time to time. I had a very heavy couch/bed which was heavy to move compared to this. And if you buy another, you can stick together. I was thinking these are not much different from walmart, they are cheaper if they have them in stock and style, while amazon can be pricey lately sometimes, even if straight from amazon.",

I don't mind because that just means it will last longer. * The fabric used will show dirt and grease stains plainly. You will need to keep it clean w. moist towl & a little soap to avoid looking grungy.",
