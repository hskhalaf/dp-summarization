I\u2019m an IT guy by trade so I like to think I can tell if something works well and this does so far. Time will tell on the longevity of it though. I definitely recommend anyone who doesn\u2019t want to spend $10 a month renting to fork over the $40 and just get it. You\u2019re saving money in four months. It\u2019s a win win!",

Lucky for me, the techs solution as it was late was to just not use the trap (free tv!). Guess if I got a jerk installer, he would say there was something wrong with the modem and I would've been out of luck. (Signals seem strong, and it's been working fine though)",

Good performance ( I have Xfinity 150 Mbps and always gives this speed). Cons Very slow customer service if need them. It will take them at least more than a week to replace the defective unit and you have to pay for shipping. Broke or stopped working suddenly. Maybe, it was worth it to get a protection plan",
