It was my fault, should have known better but I wanted to get a shot and in the process got splashed pretty good and the camera got pretty wet. Initially it stopped working at all but then came back to life, but the zoom doesn't work properly. It feels like it's got corrosion in it, obviously from getting wet. Keep it dry and you'll like this camera.",

      "text": "I got this camera for my horseback riding vacation to Scotland. It did not disappoint. I used the 'intelligent auto' mode and can't say enough good about it. The zoom and quality of photos was incredible! The image stabilization worked like a charm. The wide angle was fantastic for the vistas of the Highlands. The motion picture mode and continuous shooting features are also excellent. The software is very user friendly and the directions on how to use the features is excellent. I took one extra battery and a 16 GB card (didn't want to run out of room). Originally I only wanted to spend $150 or so. But am sooo happy I went the extra and purchased this camera!",

I'm not going in-depth for this review but I hounded the web prior to purchasing and still am a happy camper! Expecting many years of point and shoot use and easy traveling. Dial down most of the shots to 5 or 8 MP to conserve space; 12MP if I really want to edit the work later. Basically, if you want some nice features, don't crave GPS, need a flexible camera for all the occasions to easily slip into a bag or even a pocket... I doubt you'll find a better option for the money!",

Much improvement over Canon cameras I used in the past. Long battery life for rechargeable battery. Prior cameras ate up AA batteries quickly. Caveat: a little tricky to order a backup battery on the Internet. Need to be careful to buy the EXACT battery made by Panasonic for this exact model only, and definitely not one of the less expensive ones, none of which are exactly the same as the Panasonic.",

It works well in low light, easy to disable/enable flash, change settings, move into different modes, etc. Given the camera's size, the picture quality is also far better than I expected. Easy to download files from the card or the usb cable. The movie mode creates very high quality files. I will no longer be lugging around large cameras and lenses!",

I hear a hood for viewing is available for the back which allows holding up to your eye. The only thing I can recommend as a caution is if you think most of your use is outside, then consider a Camera with both options. john",

This seems to be a great combination of all those. The solid feel of the camera puts me in mind of some of the classic 35mm range finders I used decades ago.

Only thing I don't care for is Panasonic software - a lot more complicated/squirrely than the Canon software I was used to. So I am using Picasa 3 instead for taking pictures off camera and into my laptop and that works just fine.",

You more than likely will need read the manual, as i need to do, to fully understand how to use all the different settings and scene modes.",

    "description": "Color:BlackFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n The Lumix DMC-ZS5 features a 25mm ultra wide-angle* 12x optical zoom f/3.3-4.9 Leica DC Vario-Elmar lens (35mm camera equivalent: 25-300mm). Incorporating Panasonic's advanced optical technologies, this lens system is comprised of 10 elements in 8 groups, with 2 ED (Extra Low Dispersion) lenses and 2 aspherical lenses / 3 aspherical surfaces while preserving compactness. This lens system enables a remarkable 25 to 300mm range of focal length in this compact body. The powerful zoom of the DMC-ZS5can be freely controlled even when shooting motion images. Inheriting the fine rendering and outstanding quality of the Leica Elmar lens, this easy-to-carry camera delivers beautiful images any time, any place.\n* Converted to standard 35mm camera equivalent, at the maximum wide position. \n\nLumix DMC-ZS5 Highlights \n\n\n\nPowerful 12x Optical Zoom\nThe DMC-ZS5 features a powerful 12x optical zoom lens (35mm camera equivalent: 25-300mm). This gives you highly natural expressions from people and animals that you can't get close to. It is also available in movie recording with the mechanism designed to minimize the noise of auto focusing or zooming. And its slim, compact, pocket-sized body can easily go wherever you do for both everyday snapshots and traveling. \n\n25mm Ultra Wide-angle Lens\nThe 25mm ultra wide-angle lens has about twice the shooting area as a standard 35mm lens. This enhances all kinds of shooting situations, like when you're photographing a group of people at an indoor party or shooting a large structure or sweeping landscape while traveling. \n\n16x Intelligent Zoom / 23.4x Extra Optical Zoom\nThanks to the newly incorporated Intelligent Resolution technology, the Intelligent Zoom is available with the DMC-ZS5 which extends the zoom ratio by approx. 1.3x maintaining the picture quality even combining a digital zoom. This means the 12x optical can virtually extend to 16x equivalent. Furthermore, the Extra Optical Zoom function that extends zoom power to 23.4x* by using the center part of the large CCD to bring subjects even closer.\n*At 3-megapixel resolution or less. \n\n\nSonic Speed AF\nThe Sonic Speed AF system in the DMC-ZS5 has a maximum speed of approx. 0.35 second (wide-end) / 0.41 second (tele-end) for auto focusing. It includes numerous re-engineering enhancements, including a higher-speed actuator, optimized algorithms and parallel software processing. The result is fast and accurate AF performance. You can quickly get moving subjects in focus, such as when you're shooting sports scenes. \n\nPOWER O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer) Shake Detection\nJust about everyone has had the experience of taking a photo at night and hoping to capture all the memories and beauty, only to be disappointed at the poor result. The POWER O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer)* nearly doubles the hand-shake correction power of conventional MEGA O.I.S. You get bright photos without blurring even from handheld shooting at slow shutter speeds. Panasonic's accumulated optical technologies, the MEGA O.I.S. has been incorporated into Lumix from the early stage of digital camera development. This helped show all digital camera users the absolute need for hand-shake compensation, and led to its prevalence throughout the industry. And now, Panasonic has worked on the low-frequency vibration hand-shake component, which is physically generated when pressing the shutter button or when shooting at night with a slow shutter speed.\n\n\n*The POWER O.I.S. is automatically turned on in the iA Mode and can be turned on or off in the P/A/S/M Mode or some Scene Modes.",
