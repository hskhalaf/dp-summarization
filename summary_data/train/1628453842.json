Makes the process pointless. It almost feels as if the writers churned this out as quickly as possible.",

      "text": "I really enjoyed the study guide. I like that it includes practice questions and answers, and even as I read each section, I can't help but feel like I'm in a class room being taught from the book. I also appreciate the fact that there are various sections explaining each type of question in the LSAT. I will definitely recommend this study guide to anyone I know who plans on taking the LSAT.",
