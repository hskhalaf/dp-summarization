I don't know if the few boxes i got were from a bad batch, or they are all like that, but they were super hard and, and very difficult to chew. They only had a slight peanut taste, and overall the taste was not that good. They are really bland and tasteless. I am kinda disappointed, because I really like some of their other flavors, so I'll stick to them for now.",

I could taste the peanutbutter flavor. Good bars. I will be buying more. And the price is great!",
