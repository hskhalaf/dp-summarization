The low temp setting cannot cook beans in 7 hours time. Very slow customer service, it took me a month of emailing to get a plastic piece for the back that they had forgotten to put in the original purchase, and with this installed it still leaks. My husband has been begging me to throw this thing out before it ruins our house. Ver disappointed. I don't understand all the good reviews.",

The Unit kept giving me the BURN Message. This was very Frustrating and Disappointing in this Design Flaw using Stainless Steel vs Non-Stick. I cook the same meat in my Farberware with no Liquid and no problem. Adding water turn the \"gravy\" I want into soupy thin Liquid. So Please Design with Non-Stick Pot. I Decided to buy the Fabreware 8QT and Very Happy. N0 More \"Burn\" message.",
