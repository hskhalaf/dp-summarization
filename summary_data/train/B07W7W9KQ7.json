The layers of surprise and science are so cool and engaging. My son is engaged in the 'hunt' and discovery for about 10 minutes we use a craft tray for that part. Once he has discovered all the goodies I have him go wash his hands while I wash off the figures. Then it's time for imaginitive play that lasts hours and includes the whole family. Getting the gold really excited him and made me believe that these actually have gold treasure in some. This is a bargain ($8!) for something so cool!",
