      "text": "The bag is sturdily made for a smaller scope. It is slightly too small for the 127-130mm tube diameter (while it holds the whole scope and its accessories, I found it very hard to fully zip up the bag). Still it is a fraction of the cost of an Orion bag and it is still a great deal nevertheless. It comes with velcro straps to secure your tripod, as well as an accessory bag that can hold the eyepieces etc. I would not recommend putting the counterweight in this bag together with the other compoennts for the fear it might move around and damage the other parts.",
