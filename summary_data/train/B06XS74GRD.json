      "text": "Like many who are now working from home, I needed an ergonomic, adjustable height desk. Saw this one on Amazon and the price and style met my needs. I have been very pleased with it. Packaging was great. Not overdone, but certainly kept the desk protected. Assembly was very straightforward and easy. It adjusts to the height settings that I need. It is made of very sturdy materials. It looks nice too! I also had to contact customer service via email to ask about how to display in English vs metric and I got a reply with a solution in less than 15 minutes! That's impressive customer service!! Highly recommend this desk!",

      "text": "facing extended work from home time under covid, I needed a desk that wasn't too large to fit the space in the spare room and loving my stand up desk at the office, figured this was the desk for the at-home job. It is big enough to be functional but not so large that it overtakes what little space I have. (with a laptop and desk lamp on it, I still have space for two cat beds for my coworkers.) The surface is sturdy and I love the preset options for desk height. Big win for the value and the functionality (assuming you do not mind not having desk drawers -- i do not mind)",

I wouldn't say the desk is really loud when moving up or down--but then again, we work in a factory warehouse so sound doesn't matter to us. I think if you used this at home and had to raise/lower during a nice quiet night, it would probably be a lot louder than expected. I also like how light weight this desk is in comparison to the bulky wooden desks that we've been using. It feels much more natural and I love being able to decide if I want to sit or stand without breaking my back.",

Easily lifts a heavy table top, full tower, 2 monitors, and bookshelf speakers. - Not super loud - Memory setting is nice (display turns off when not being used) - Easy to assemble (took me about 30 minutes) Cons: - Price - Wobbles a lot a full height - Controls and display are cheap",
