The ability to use these Mighty Paw leads as tethers is another advantage. I can clip this around a porch ballister, table leg, etc. The 15' and 30' leads might not be strong or long enough for large dogs but work well for my small breed dog. I think the price is fair.",

After using for a couple of weeks the longer leash works well for walks at the beach. If I let my lab puppy have all the leash he wants, he doesn't pull at all. He's satisfied with his range. It makes our walks much more fun for both of us. Definitely recommended.",
