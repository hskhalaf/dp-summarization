One year later and the most used pan have lost much of the finish or are stained badly. The skillets with the teflon have deteriorated to the point that I have to use oil to keep food from sticking. My ten year old Faberware skillets looked better when I replaced them. I had one pan that I dropped when taking it out of the cabinet. It fell about a foot to the floor. That pan is now dented and the lid wont fit. Big waste of money.",
