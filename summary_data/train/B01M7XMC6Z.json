They are vibrant and have many twinkling options to choose from. I got mine in a warm white and they are illuminating at night, my balcony really stands out. Even during the day they were bright. Would 100% suggest using a staple gun (T25 staples) to hang them up- it made it much easier and felt very secure. I used the twist ties that come with it to help tie together the long pieces of lights and it really worked out well. So elegant and fun!",

      "text": "I read so many reviews about people not being able to untangle them or it took an insane amount of time to do it, which terrified me, so this is how I did it! We used command strips specifically for hanging lights and we first hung up the main line that has the lights hanging down from it! From there, we unzip-tied each strand after they were hung, and it was a pretty simple process! We tried to untangle them without doing that at first and then the idea popped in my head and it was a LIFE SAVER! They're beautiful and I can't wait to put up a sheer curtain in front of them!",

It is long so be sure to put it high up close to the ceiling or you'll be rolling the lights up. It has a remote on the plug in that gives you different light settings from blinking, to slowly changing to regular \"on\".",

The lights light up the sheer fabric and it keeps people from seeing through them and into my home. They are very beautiful and give my living room a nice dim glow. I also like that the plug is low and can be plugged into a low wall outlet. The only downside is that the controller box doesn't have an option to turn the lights off. They have to be unplugged. Overall I love them and will be buying more for my bedroom!",

Need to individually wrap back together, if not you will have a tangled mess. They do not link together (like Christmas lights), so you have to plug each one into a separate socket. I also found the plug to be too short. I bought two packs, so I needed two extension cords to plug them in. If you buy multiple packs you will need an extension cord for each. (If you want to buy I would suggest buying an extension strip with multiple outlets)",
