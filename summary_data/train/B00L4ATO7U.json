      "text": "I have bought several brands of this style of hand-made card over the years. (These are Paper Magic Group.) I have never seen one so cheaply made. The embellishments were few and far between and look cheap. The paper is super cheap. The envelopes are thin. And lastly the cards are sealed in plastic sleeves that give no indication on what type of card is enclosed or what the card says on the inside. In order to use the box they come in and sort the cards by occasion as intended, you have to remove them from their protective sleeves. I won't buy again.",

Those cards have the inside verse or \"blank inside\" printed on the outer wrapper. This bunch does not, so you have to unwrap the card to see if there is a verse and if it's appropriate for the recipient. Naturally, some cards are nicer than others, but I think I will use most of them. The boxes are great for storage.",

The cards are well made (no faded off handmade stamps here) and fun. I love the variety and the embellishments. I have dipped into other card lines and continuously end up disappointed because they are not nearly as lively or just look half-hazzardly made. I will keep a mix of these offerings to have the perfect card for the occasion.",

Some do, but there are a number of square-shaped cards in the box and the envelopes are too big and rectangle in shape. See picture. The second thing is that the glue from the envelope bled through and glued the front of the envelope to the back. I have used one care (or wanted to) and found the envelope tore when I tried to insert the card then pulled another envelope and the same thing happened. So disappointed. because I did not open the box until now and my window of returns is expired.",

And, if I have extras of certain types (like new baby), they sell really well at yard sales!",

Couple reasons for 4 star rather than 5 star - some of the envelopes are much to big for the smaller cards. Makes the cards look kinda cheap imho. There is only one wedding card, one congrats card and one new baby card. Overall though I will use all of them and save money! Very pleased, would purchase again.",
