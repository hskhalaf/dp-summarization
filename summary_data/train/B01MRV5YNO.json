It could easily pop off when a cat is standing on the lid, then fall into the litterbox. Traumatic for the cat that falls in, and extra work for me. Plus, it renders the box non-functional!

My cats took to it immediately and the lid really reduced the amount of litter they spread around. I just placed a litter mat under it and cleaned it out regularly. The best part is they can urinate right against the side and it won't drip out (an issue we had with the litter boxes that came with lids). I also appreciate that they can dig in it and litter doesn't end up everywhere. In the end, we bought two!",

I'm pretty sure she didn't put the lid back on properly. I have a 18lb cat. Just make sure the lid is back in all 3 spots all the way and you won't have any problems. :)",

I bought the arm and hammer scooping litter box as a sifter and it makes cleanup easier. The included scooper is too small to be useful.

      "text": "Thoughts after owning this box for a month: So we had a top entry litter box from the time our six-year-old cat was a kitten, and I knew we were never using the traditional side-entry boxes we'd had with our previous cat. I LOVE this box. Our cat uses it with no issues and it's stylish. I like that the lid traps the litter better than our previous top-entry box, the Cl*ver C*t. The color scheme (white box + beige top) and the nicer, glossier plastic are more aesthetically appealing, and besides looking nice, it's easy to keep clean by just scooping out every 3rd day. Highly recommend.",

      "text": "I have tried many litter boxes (and brands) for my three cats. I have one cat that likes to pee at the back of litter boxes, often causing spills if the lid-bottom divide is too low. The next best option until this was Nature\u2019s Miracle. This box takes up less space and has no such divide so the marking problem is solved. All three of my cats tend to kick litter out of the litter box, but I\u2019ve found the top entry minimizes the issue; litter is still spilled out of the box, but this style, top entry, has resulted in the least litter spill of the different brands that I\u2019ve tried.",
