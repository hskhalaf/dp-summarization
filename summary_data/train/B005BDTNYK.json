While this lacks the best technologies from Saucony, it does offer a no-nonsense approach to those who require a moderately cushioned neutral shoe that does exactly and a bit more than expected. This lightweight running shoe is also perfect for those who are recreational runners, middle of the pack participants, entry-level runners and those who are budget conscious.",

You won't realize that they're even on your feet from being so light, yet the support is there. I've also had zero problems with the laces. 4.5/5 and two thumbs up.",

Happily the return policy is very good and I am returning them to exchange for a size 11.5. Hopefully I won't need a 12!! TBD. Edit to Add: The 11.5 fit great and I really like the shoes. I suggest checking to see if the European size is correct for you. IN these shoes the size US11 were a EUR45. Most size US11 shoes are a EUR46. I think Saucony's conversion is the root of the sizing problem.",

They are no frills but feel more comfortable and cushioned than any other brand. They are not too heavy. They are \"neutral\" meaning not for pronators or supinators. We have had no injuries from these and the various family members run between 20 and 85 MPW. The price cannot be beat and adjusted for inflation they seem to get cheaper every year. I will take these 35 dollar pair over any 150 dollar bells and whistle model any day of the week.",

The wear is minimum. The shoe is light and well constructed. The fit is perfect for me. Style and color is great. I\u2019ve had compliments on them. Best of all the fit, comfort and support is great making for some happy feet. Will definitely be ordering a couple more pairs for this summer.very satisfied",

Normally I purchase shoes in their Guide line of products, but last week I decided to the try this one. Sadly, it was nothing close to the quality, fit, and comfort of the Guide line. The shoe feels almost a full size smaller than my Guide shoes despite being listed as the same size, and they are outstandingly uncomfortable. These are being returned, and I will go back to the Guide with great pleasure. I still love Saucony, I just won't ever be trying a Cohesion shoe from them again.",

I would not run on anything but smooth pavement in these because of stability concerns. This is my least favorite Saucony to date. will go back to running shoe in the future. This is my 2nd trail runner from Saucony and I will go back to a training shoe or something.",

I keep a pair at the gym, but plan to buy another for races and will update this after running outdoors on different surfaces. I'm a huge fan of the color; it was one of the reasons I bought these.",

The main reason I gave a 4 instead of a 5 is that there is a hollow part under the heel that while it gives more flex, it gets a bit uncomfortable around the edge of my heel since the inner part of my heel sinks while the outer edge is held up. So that difference in support becomes a bit uncomfortable. But I'll keep these until they wear out and would consider the same brand again.",
