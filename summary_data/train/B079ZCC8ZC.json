Its lightweight nature and durability were also appreciated. However, the construction of the collar was greatly criticized along with the loose fit. But in the end, it came highly recommended for those looking for a stylish and comfortable walking shoe.",

        "A majority of the reviewers found the Ryka Nell to be very comfortable for long periods of use",
        "Many buyers raved about the doll-shoe style and subdued colorways because they went well with various clothing ensembles",
        "The size and width of this model were considered true to the brand\u2019s measurement scheme by multiple users",
        "More than a few testers were pleased that this product was very lightweight",
        "Despite the lack of a closure system, the upper was deemed supportive by several people",
        "Some individuals lauded the upper material because it was perceived to be durable though it was soft"

      "cons": [
        "A significant number of critics ranted about the stretchy collar because it tended to become too restrictive and the back portion and rubbed the Achilles raw",
        "The fit of the footgear was deemed too wide that a minority of shoppers had to return their pair because it kept falling off their feet",
        "The upper material irked a few folks because it was too stiff and caused discomfort"

Here are the 2 issues: 1) the back starts rubbing almost immediately and 2) the elastic at the top pushes down too much and start feeling uncomfortable after just a few minutes. I wore these for about 30 minutes at home sitting down and these shoes had to come off because of the elastic. Too bad I have to return them because the style is nice. I think these would look good with lots of outfits. Gray color is nice as well. Which is why I gave these 3 stars instead of just 1.",
