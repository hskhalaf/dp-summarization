I like that it comes with a carrying case (people have mistaken it for a fold up chair) but it is very heavy. We live on the second floor and it is heavy to take down or bring up the steps. It does have a shoulder trap but I can't carry it on my shoulder most of the time my husband has to carry it. Setting it up is extremely and my 11 year old can put it together all by himself.",

It's very sturdy and the fabric seems well made. We will be spraying it with 303 Fabric Guard to protect it. His brother has the Innovo portable basket, and the DGA Mach Lite is superior.",

We've also taken it camping with us and set it up at our campsite. It's super easy to assemble and pack away, and comes in a nice carrying case. The chains on it are a bit loud, especially for an apartment or campground setting, but we've found that if you lay a towel around the bottom of the chains, it quiets them down to a softer level. 10/10 would recommend for anyone who wants to practice on the go!",

I agree with some other reviews I've read, in that the flag is flimsy and I'm sure that once it's hit, it will die. Also, the strap on the carrying bag could have a pad for the shoulder. Even so, it suits my purposes to a tee. I take it somewhere, set it up, and use it as a practice basket or play games with it, with the kids. I love it!",
