A plumber gave it to him and was told that it was best to mix it with tepid water before you put it down the drain and not to do it every day for five days as the instructions say. Doing it once every other day to begin with and then monthly. I used it on a rental house with older plumbing and everything just started flowing better just after one treatment. Even the toilet seemed to flush better! I'd recommend it to everyone, it's just too bad that it's so expensive, but much less than calling a plumber.",

Yes, as others have mentioned, it is quite expensive.

I used Drain Care in the past and that worked okay. I was trying to go the 'natural' route, but wne my drain slowed considerably with this stuff I went out and bought liquid plumber - which opened it wide up.",

Had to call plumber to unclog. The product did not even help to increase the flow of waste water and this was the most disappointing aspect of this product.",
