In other words it is very flimsy. I regret I spent money on these sheet set. I don't think I will ever buy beddings/sheets online ever again. Sheets are best shopped around buying at stores.

These sheets, for me, stay put and don't slip when I toss or turn. Color fast. Cons: Expect a lot of dryer lint until they have been laundered several times.

I haven\u2019t noticed any particularly special \u201cstain-resistance\u201d or \u201cwrinkle-free\u201d qualities, but that wasn\u2019t why I chose them. They\u2019re very soft, and surprisingly good quality for the price. I haven\u2019t had any problems with rips or tears and I\u2019ve been using them for about 4 months. The colours are true to the stock photos too. I am very pleased with this product.",

They came through the laundry just fine, very easy to take out of the dryer and shake wrinkle-free, almost like permanent-press, and were every bit as soft as before they were washed. They fit a full size bed and pillows perfectly. They aren't thick but aren't like the paper-thin plain cotton ones sold at the big discount stores either. Very soft and comfortable and they don't stick to you, but not slippery like satin sheets. Great color assortment. Great sheets for the money. Going to buy some more for sure.",

Product arrived in good condition, true to color, no fading, no snags, no weird packaging smells. I highly recommend!

That's where the elastic on all 4 corners of this fitted sheet came in handy! Instead of having to use those complicated sheet clips (that never seem to stay on anyway) this fitted sheet stayed put (along with all the extras), due to the corner elastic holding everything in place.

      "text": "I really like these sheets! Oddly, I didn't think I would. I thought they would end up being too warm and I'd wake up sweating. Not the case! They are very soft like a very thin flannel feel almost and they stay cool. The fitted sheet has an extra elastic corner to keep them put, and they stay. My only issue is the huge tag on the flat sheet is at the top corner. Ive had it happen woth other sheets and i cant stand it. Definitely not a deal breaker though. Overall the sheets are great.",
