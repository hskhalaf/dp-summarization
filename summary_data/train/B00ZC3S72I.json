Sound quality is good, could be better. I use them for cs go, they suffice. The side bits may rattle sometimes, which is a bit annoying. Good mic and a nice feature is that you can hear yourself. It can be unplugged. Since I\u2019m a right handed I would\u2019ve liked the controls to be on the left side. You can use them with a regular jack, you can play while charging. The charge holds enough. 10 hours I think. Another nice feature is that they power off themselves if not used. Save draining battery.",

I've now bought two headsets and both of them broke in exactly the same place. Before you tell me it might be the way I use them, I've never had this problem with other headsets or headphones I've had. I'm going to look for another headset now, and it won't be these.",

Unfortunately these seem to be modelled on a child's head. I had to expand them to near max to put them on & then they are digging into the side of my head! Very uncomfortable. Unfortunately the ear cups also seem quite small and actually curl the edges of my ear to fit them in. If you have a small head - go for it, if you are a normal sized adult male, I'd look elsewhere",

Some slight cons i found. The creaking of the plastic if your eating while wearing them or moving to much does get a little tiresome. Also the horrendous voice they chose to tell you when the battery is getting low. it will grind on your nerves after a while.. All in all though im very happy with these headphones and i still use them after 2 years of constant use.",

I've also done some recordings to see whether or not they're producing a decent mic quality, and it's superb. When I have played online, I've never had any issues, people can hear me loud and (most importantly) clear :)",

      "title": "Cheap Plastic",
      "text": "I've bought a TB headset in the past and its headband broke. I waited a decade to get these because of that horrible experience and guess what... they still use cheap plastic. The best possible way I can describe this kind of plastic is comparing it to a plastic cup that's been left outside for a few years. It's like dry rotted plastic and it snaps so easily. The sound is good, the earphones do not cut out, I'm told that I'm heard loud and clear on the other end, but what the headband is made of is absolute crap. What's really sad is that these were pricey while the cheap bluetooth headsets, like MPow are not, but last FOREVER.",

      "title": "Great Sound, nice compfort, poor durability",
      "text": "I really liked Turtle Beach headsets. Their sound quality and confort is excellent. However I'm finding that the durability of pretty much all gaming headsets is severly lacking. I owned at least 2-3 pairs of this model, each time (lasts about a year) the plastic would breack at the ear cup / headband hinge point. Over time it develops stress fractures in the plastic, just from normal use and eventually will crack and break off. Unfortunately I'm seeing this across most manufacturers. Seems the only way to get long lasting durable headsets is to purchase very expensive studio headphones and get a USB adaptor for the PC.",

      "text": "Great quality device for the price. The sound quality is good (not spectacular, but great given that its wireless and digital) and the various equalizer options are nice, though I don't tend to change between them. The mic has a dial for letting it pass through to the headphones to give an open-back effect where you can hear your own voice, and thats a nice feature. Also holds a charge for quite a long time. Only negative I have to say is that it grips pretty tightly, and the cups aren't big enough to fit all the way around my ears, so wearing them for a while can cause some discomfort. YMMV on that.",

I love the built in audio queues when you power the unit off or on or when you mute the microphone. They are light and comfortable and the range on the wireless adapter is great. Having these makes a world of difference in gaming immersion and allows me to get the full sound experience for my games at night without waking up my neighbors. Best gaming headphones in this price range by a mile.",

      "text": "I've loved these headphones, and would have given a 5 star review, however after a strange crack formed (I did not drop or damage it) in the headband, I contacted Turtle Beach Support to see if I could get a replacement piece of plastic. There are screws and it looks like it could be swapped. However, they were anything but helpful, saying that I would just need to buy a new headset and throw the old one out. Toss it in the landfill because one small piece of plastic, an easily replaceable part breaks?!?! Umm, no thanks. I won't continue to support a company who's attitude is such a disposable one.",

      "text": "I purchased this in April 2016 and have been largely satisfied with it, but would not buy it again. Pros: The quality, comfort, range, and battery life of this headset are all above-average. Nothing was amazing, but overall it was a good headset. The buttons are reasonably well-placed and it functions well overall. Cons: Auto-shutdown was very aggressive and annoying. The signal was easily disrupted by appliances and walls, incapable of functioning in my kitchen only 20 feet away from the receiver. After just under three years of use, the headphones will no longer charge unless the cable (any cable) is held at a particularly sharp angle.",

And the $7 for a 3 year warranty was a nice touch. 9 month Update: The band broke on the headset. I contacted the Warranty I bought first for replacement options, they told me to contact Turtle Beach. Which I did, I sent photos and everything went fine. When I received the replacement, it was a refurbished product in a white box. I kind of feel duped since I had the manufacturers warranty and the warranty I bought. And they sent me a refurbished product instead of a proper replacement. I probably won't be buying from Turtle Beach again.",

      "text": "This headset really delivers on sound quality, features, and mic quality. Yet all these great points are overshadowed by the fact that just a year in and it had already snapped along the headband, leaving only half of the adjustable length on that side usable. Now, a year and a half in the other side have also snapped, leaving the headset all but unusable. It's unfortunate that this headset delivered on everything except build quality. I have also experienced the battery life dwindling. I am lucky to get just a few hours of playtime without charging. Overall, if you are looking for a short-term product this headset will deliver, but don't expect it to last long.",

      "text": "At first I thought these headphones would be compressing my head a bit since they were stiff and I needed to expand them to max size, but they adjusted relatively fast and fit over my whole ear rather than resting on top like others might. Sound is top notch for the price, great lows and clear highs, mic works wonderfully, I usually have to use push to talk because mics have difficulty picking my voice up, but not with this headset! Also, the range is insane. I walked across my house (from corner of second floor to opposite room on the first) and still had perfect connection. Will update if I have any issues soon.",

Well, its kind of a hybrid for me cuz after an hour or two I can tell that my ear is just barely cramming into the headphones. All other functions are great. Battery life is phenomenal. I go on 12+ hour gaming binges occasionally and have not had it die on me one time. If you go longer than that I think you need be less concerned about battery life and more concerned about your own lol",
