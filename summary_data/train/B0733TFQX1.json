      "text": "I really love the idea of these for my face wipes that I DIY. They would be a perfect solution as I was on vacation last week. When my bag went through TSA, the pouches were actually leaking. I can\u2019t tell if it came from the construction of the pouch or how the lid attaches, but I was pretty bummed. The whole idea was that they would stay moist but not leak. (Keeping in mind these wipes weren\u2019t soping.) I suppose it could\u2019ve been that they were in the bag sideways.",

I used to just use the wipe case it comes in but the sticker will get caught to the material and my wipes dry out. The bundle wet wipes pouch is perfect cause of the hard cover cap that keeps my wipes fresh and wet no matter how long I had my wipes sitting inside. Overall great item and great item!!",
