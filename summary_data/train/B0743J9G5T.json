The exterior plastic itself may seem tough but was cracked upon arrival. I'm a US Marine living overseas and I am frankly too busy to deal with the headache of returning this very underwhelming product. This case, which probably cost the manufacturer under $5 to produce, is clearly not worth the $100. I would strongly urge anyone considering this guitar case to go to another manufacturer.",

Great upgrade from a gig bag and for taking from studio to apartment. I absolutely love this case, its like the neck cutout was made for my Ibanez RG Wizard III neck! Latches are somewhat cheap, but if you are careful with them they will be just fine. I got a used one from Amazon Warehouse and its in mint condition. I highly recommend this case over the $55 Chromacast one from what ive seen and read.",

      "text": "I purchased this to house a Partscaster style guitar that deserved a proper case. This is a bit thicker than your standard Strat rectangular case by an 1-1.5 inches and probably a bit better built. It fits the standard Stratocaster body well, but does not allow the vibrato arm to remain on the guitar. There is quite a bit of storage space on either side of the neck compartment, but I generally don't trust case compartments to carry anything but a cloth (nothing worse than something hard, heavy, pointy banging around in the case next to your guitar.) The case compartments are open. All in all a very worthy generic case.",

I probably wouldn't have any reservations checking this in as luggage when flying for fear that the guitar would be damaged, because I don't think it would. However I probably wouldn't check it as baggage because though the guitar wouldn't get harmed, the case would take a beating.",
