Scrub it clean wipe it up by hand. 2. Get on your hands an knees and apply this with cotton rags. It just creates a better result to do it by hand.",

Allow each \"layer\" to dry thoroughly, which may mean two or more hours wait time. I actually allowed an overnight between two of the applications. Terrific results but a helluva lot of work.",

Super, gorgeous flooring returned. Finish is unreal; honestly looks like new flooring. Nice, hard finish - you can see that it's stronger than most \"wax flooring\" products out there on the market. Extremely thrilled with purchase. Already have my friends and family purchasing this product to do over their dull laminate flooring. Thank you so very much for making such a remarkable product!",

It WORKS beautifully! Super-easy to apply, dries very quickly, doesn't leave greasy/sticky/slippery finish, NO chemical smell, safe for children & pets. What more could you ask? Applied either 2 or 3 coats on high-traffic areas (cleaned & scrubbed as much as I could beforehand) and they ended up with a lovely soft shine...wood is very grateful when you give it some TLC. Got a kick out of the comment from one reviewer who \"wanted to MARRY Weiman...\". Absolutely right!",
