Now, you are talking to someone who, for years, never used a real trash can and only relied on loose grocery shopping bags for their trash. I didn't know what I was missing! I got it in stainless and I know they make the copper/rose color too. But sure would love to see it offered in a VERY SUBTLE Brushed-Gold color to match my kitchen hardware.",

I was willing to pay for the convenience, but it's junk. If you open the entire lid and just think you'll use it that way, the trash bag has nothing to hold it at the top.

The battery life is reasonable (have yet to change in the 4 months since purchased). We also use the recommended trash can liners and they fit well and are sturdy. I would buy again. Update. Changed my rating given the motion sensor/motor died after 2 years of use. Could not repair.",

So far, I love the look of this new can over the itouchless. It has the same delay to open as the itouchless, but most important advantage: It STAYS OPEN for you to use the can as long as you need, and closes when you move away, unlike the itouchless, which closes after a few seconds very annoyingly. Hope this new can lasts.",

      "text": "This trash can is so beautiful. Fits trash compactly and comes with complimentary package of sturdy custom fit simplehuman trash bags. With a simple wave of the hand in front of the sensor, the lid will open. My only issue is that the can will open when I'm simply walking by it. This is likely due to my placement of the trash can as I have to walk within 1-2ft of it in my small apartment kitchen. Otherwise, I have no complaints and have had a great experience with it so far!",
