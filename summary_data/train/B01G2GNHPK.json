The second time we used the other one, both plastic pieces broke off the straps making it unusable AND the sprayer stopped working. The dollar store wouldn\u2019t even sell something of such low quality. It looks cute and my sons love firefighter things but if you buy this, the only thing you\u2019ll get are tears from your kids as it breaks right after taking it out of the box.",

This week he took it outside finally and we discovered the bottom nipple where the hose connects is not straight, allowing a fairly substantial leak. This won't be a huge deal during hot summer as a full water toy but unfortunately he cannot use the toy without getting wet. The return period has already closed on the purchase before we discovered the leak. Otherwise, he loves this toy and I would give 5 stars.",

Personally I feel that because it's a water gun, expect some things to get wet and don't sweat over a tiny leak. This backpack is really a cute and fun toy. If you have a kid who loves firefighters like mine, he will love this toy too.",

Then u add a backpack holder to it and u know every 5 min your going to get asked to do something to it. This is so easy they dont need you...yes u might get shot a few times but that's it! The biggest seller for me was they are a fireman come on what kid doesnt want to be a fireman!!! The gun part even looks like how they put out fires...which makes it even cooler for kids",
