I did a lot of research on different ones and I am glad I got this one. It does not come apart while using it and if it did you for, then you didn't clip them in correctly. They are hard to take apart but I don't need to do that often. I think its the perfect weight too!",

Because I didnt realize how much of the fun was sucked out of hula hooping when its 3+ pounds around your waist, just so you'll get toned \"quicker\". Just get a jumprope, regulate healthy eating, and safely waist train if you're so hell bent on having a smaller waist. Or just love yoself for what you are! Life is short, damnit!",
