My only negative is the directions to put this tent together are pretty sad and trying to squeeze it back into the bag is very tight , But it was very simple to figure it out . The tent set up quickly and I was amazed on how roomy it was . We had high winds 30 mph gust and rain, the tent held up great and we stayed dry. The tent is high quality and I hope I can get many years out of it. I highly recommend it.",

The cross beam pole on the roof are thick and can handle wind and snow. The upright poles are metal and even thicker. This tent is worth the money",

Not just came untied, but actually frayed and broken. The tent was unusable for us. We ended up going to a local Walmart and buying a smaller tent to get us through the week. I wouldn't buy again and instead will be looking for a more reputable brand of product.",

My Coleman EZup shade structure came home in pieces but the Browning / Alps tent was flawless. Most tents at camp had inches of water. I did have some very small puddles until I realized I needed to stake out the rain fly. After that it was bone dry. I had a tarp underneath which captured tons of water between the tarp and the tent bottom, but amazingly no water leaked thru the bottom of the tent. I will continue to buy Alps / Browning products.",

Tip, if you're driving 9 hours to complete at Custer state park, just pay an extra $25 and rent a rustic cabin in the campgrounds...

Big enough to put three twin beds and then some! It's folded up nicely and even fit back in the carry bag. The poles seem sturdy. So far, we love it. I will update after we have used it outdoors. So far, so good!",

All my other tents have had from 4\" to 6\" inches from the bottom a different material that would be a bit thicker and more like a tarp. So make sure you bring a tarp big enough and also dig your trench around your tent if your expecting rain!!!",

Light to moderate winds with rain constantly pounded the tent and the poles snapped. So much for our family reunion camping. Never slept in the tent yet.
