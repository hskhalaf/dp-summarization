I've been wanting to learn to play the accordion for years but The entry level price was way to high for something I didn't know I would be able to play. This little machine was perfect for finding out if I would like it. I play piano so it was an easy transition to simple songs...within 24 hours I was playing a reasonable version of \"Roll Out The Barrel.\" Try this before you invest $500 in a full scale model.",
