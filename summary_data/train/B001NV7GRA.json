I don\u2019t think the smell is harmful but I am using it inside a living space and it gives me a headache even in fairly small exposures.

I can't speak for its ability to take stain as the several projects I have used it on have all been painted but it sands very smooth and is even easy to use to smooth the edges of plywood grain if you thin it slightly. I especially like the idea that if it starts to dry out I can recover it by simply adding a little water. I have thrown out a lot of other wood filler through the years.",

    "description": "Color:Original versionA totally unique, quick drying, water based grain filler and wood putty accepts stain beautifully or can be tinted. Never goes bad Easy to apply and clean up No shrinking, cracking or falling out. Does not become permanent until you apply a finish. If youre ever unhappy with the way it looks, the color, etc. \u2013 just water it down and remove it. If it freezes, simply put it in the microwave to warm it up or if it dries out, just stir in water. This allows for zero waste! This might just be the perfect wood filler. Manufacturer recommends using only stainless steel or plastic tools to apply because Timbermate may react with low grade steels and turn black. If this happens, simply add water and remove it, or wait for it to dry and sand it off.",
