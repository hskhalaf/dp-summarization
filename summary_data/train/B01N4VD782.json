This has a nice \"citrus\" smell to it, it comes with a slotted-scoop to make application very easy. I used our car wash brush to move it into the carpet fibers. Also, I have a Rainbow vacuum cleaner, which has the water basin, which I believe helped in the cleaning process. I read a review that said it will ruin your vacuum cleaner? I think the key to using \"Capture\" is to let it dry completely. Vacuum a room, empty the canister, repeat. I will be purchasing more of this product! I highly recommend it. Linda W.",

When I moved to a new community, I couldn't find it anywhere locally and was very happy to be able to order this online. Just finished spot cleaning all the heavy traffic areas in my house. Completely finished and ready to walk on carpet in less than an hour. I will buy this product again.........and again.",

For best value, buy the 8 lb tub for the powder. You can buy the pre-treat spray separately as well. The kit comes with the pre-reat spray and a scrub brush to which you can attach a broom handle and a good stiff broom works just fine. I have a Shark vacuum and need to clean receptacle and sponge filters after after each floor. Way easier than the Bissell, no dry time required and the longer you leave it set on the carpets after brooming in the better it looks after vacuuming.",
