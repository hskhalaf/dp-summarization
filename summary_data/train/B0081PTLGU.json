I don't use frozen fruit (fresh fruit only-cut up into pieces) and I use small ice cubes, not the big blocks you usually get from ice trays. So far, I've had NO issues with this blender. Blends everything, no chunks and the pouring spout is great. I've also used it few times, and haven't experienced any issues. For the price, it's a good blender.",

There are two different pulse settings, making chopping more evenly a breeze. The milkshake button makes a smooth shake! Ice crushing is no challenge. No burning motor smells. Super easy clean-up with a self-cleaning button! For the price, this blender really has it all! I love it!",

I just need it to make smoothies from both frozen ingredients & fresh. I always add plenty of liquid, so that's not an issue. The issue is this just can't handle blending ingredients in a non-chunky way. Will be returning.",

      "text": "I purchased this blender July of 2015. It lasted until December 2018. I bought it mainly to crush ice for smoothies. I looked into several blenders before I purchased this one because I wanted to make sure it would crush ice easily. About a month ago it started smoking and smelling of burnt motor, when i used it and today it died. It was hard to take apart the base when it was time to clean and hard to remove the lid after using. While it lasted it worked well, but personally I felt it should have lasted several more years.",

I looked at other brands while looking for a replacement, but I had such faith in Hamilton Beach since the last one survived almost daily use for such a long time. So far, I've been very happy with my replacement. I like the new thick glass container. It's powerful enough to blend my smoothie (I sometime throw in celery and ginger) to smooth enough consistency. I'm curious to see how long the plastic parts of the container will withstand the daily use. It just feels slightly less durable than the last model I had.",
