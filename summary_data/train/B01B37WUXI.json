Then we bought the large one a month later after our kitten had a case of diarrhea for a week. We ended up putting them together and using the small one for her litter box. They are pretty sturdy and our cat loves them. Although the top must be on or she can easily jump out. I would definitely recommend this enclosure.",

I love how the top and door unzips so there is a lot of versatility to this carrier/bed. You can unzip the top so you can put them in and pet them from above. And I love that the little 'door' can be rolled up and velcro held so they can freely walk in and out. It's extremely light and portable so you can take it with you and your little ones will feel right at home. Just add their favorite blankets and they will happily stay in it. I'm extremely happy with my purchase.",

This playpen is perfect for just that! We put a blanket in it and she's perfectly content to curl up and wait until we let her out. I was skeptical that it would ever fold back up the way it unfolds - but every time it's super easy to fold in just seconds. Really cool product - great seller with prompt shipping and good communications. Full 5 stars all the way",

      "text": "Bought this for a friend, who is a small dog owner. His dog just had 3 puppies, and he needed somewhere to keep the mom and puppies contained at night. This was the perfect option! It's small enough to fit in the corner of a room, but big enough to where puppies and mom have room to walk around. Part of the playpen is used for a \"bed\" area, one part for potty pads, and one part for food and water. The best part is that it folds down flat, for quick storage during the day. The sides are tall, so it's not easy for a small dog to escape, and the bottom wipes clean easily.",

I would recommend it...just be very cautious with enclosing your pet inside while away from home.",

I didn't want to invest in an expensive or giant brooder for chickens that would grow out of them within a few weeks.

The zip top cover was perfect for keeping the chicks from jumping out, but was also super easy to open to feed and water them. I scrubbed and hosed them down a couple times each week and they held up fairly well. Definitely got some wear and tear, but worth the money for sure compared to other brooder set ups.",

There's a tag in there that your dog can bite on and pull, and it will pull in one of the sides. So I suggest you cut it off. So far we've had this for 2 days and he loves it.

If you have an active animal in there they definitely will test the integrity of it. I can see this being useful for extremely young animals, but not active kittens or puppies. The price isn't too bad, but that's because you're not really paying for much. I returned it to Amazon via Kohl's drop-off without issue.",

My puppy is small and can tip this over and use it like a gerbil on a wheel while still confined until potty trained. That may not work for everyone. They do eventually split at the seams where the side and bottom meet but that would also depend on the dog and how much you use it. It's great as long as you know what to expect.",

We only got one use out of it as a crate alternative, but it works really well as bed for her to hide in at night in our room.",
