Yes, the frosted glass is touchy, but I knew that ahead of time & was careful. Yes, the stickers were a pain to remove, but I managed it. At first I thought it was going to be quite rickety, with the feet seeming uneven, but I finally realized I hadn\u2019t screwed the legs all the was in, lol. After that, I had no trouble putting it together & while it probably won\u2019t last 50 years like my last coffee table, it is just fine for camp.",

I decided it would wasn\u2019t worth the hassle to exchange and it\u2019s still a very nice table, I didn\u2019t notice any damage to the glass in the shipping process.

I live on the ocean but my doors and windows were closed and the ac was on., so strong winds were not an issue.certainly never had any issues with it before. this could have been very dangerous to anyone at home. it may be idiotic of me to buy the table again but I will. caveat emptor.",

I put this table together by myself (I'm a petite-but-strong female) using the super-easy instructions. The only con (and this is likely just me), is that there's a gap between the middle and bottom shelves which I would've preferred not to see for mostly aesthetic reasons. Still, the price makes this coffee table a steal and no shipping charge! So glad I didn't buy an almost $500 round table, since I'm just as happy with this below $100 purchase.",

Just remember to assemble it tightly. Once done, It is very sturdy. The only reason I have given 4 stars is coz it is more tapering at ends than I expected. A must buy for small living room.",

      "text": "This table is ssoooooo cute ! When arriving the box makes it seem bigger than it really is so be aware of the dimensions of the table . It\u2019s small ! But for an apartment or small living space (like office or so) it works great . Once my apartment was filled up with other furniture , the table brought the room together and made my living room look so chic. With the right accents and decorations it\u2019s really an eye catching piece :) !",
