One, for some reason no one (including tech support)can figure out why the remote that came with it will not open Media Center, but will do fine once I open MC normally. I was able to use their win2000 software from their website but the second issue is: There is no video editing capability for that software. Even a small application would have been appreciated. I will have to get Adobe.",
