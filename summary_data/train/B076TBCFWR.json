I bought this because the other Simple moisturizer I use does not contain it, but this one does. Sadly, silicone makes your skin soft but does not actually allow your pores to breathe or to absorb the benefical properties of most moisturizers.",

I have tried many, many other moisturizers, only to have them leave me more oily or cause break outs or make my rosasea more red. This moisturizer is absolutely perfect! It makes my skin soft and supple. Absorbs well, helps my bb cream go on more evenly and smoothly and has actually helped to lessen the amount of oil my skin produces. I can't find one negative thing about this. It's just perfect!!!!",
