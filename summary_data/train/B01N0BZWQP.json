In the past, it would take forever to charge, but would maintain the charge for a couple of hours- perfect for what I needed it to do. Now (5 months later), it doesn\u2019t work at all because it cannot hold a charge whatsoever! My window of return as expired. I will be more than happy to change this review if someone from customer service department reaches out to me for either a refund or a replacement.* update* amazon has great customer service and was refunded for this.

It feels like very cheap plastic. Very lightweight. Will not stay in one place it's so lightweight. The way it turns to flat is neat for storage but that's about it. I have a hard time using it. It does not fit with your hand very well. Feels awkward. Will be getting rid of this and going to a normal regular mouse. Don't let the looks fool you. It looks weird and feels weird and is not worth it.",

For starters it doesn't always detect scrolling, and the middle mouse button is very flimsy compared to the rest of the mouse.
