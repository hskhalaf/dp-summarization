      "text": "When I purchased this laptop a year ago it was great as far as its capabilities were concerned, among everything else. It has thankfully not degraded over the last year but at this point in time I would suggest buying a newer laptop as this will soon be extremely outdated as most companies' PC ports will require a lot more powerful hardware due to the capabilities of current consoles and the lack of interest that most developers have in good PC optimization.",

But wow! this laptop is so in budget and can run very well and the first laptop ive seen that doesnt over heat on me from continous moving.. only problem i would say in my opinion is the keys wear away.

Delivery was excellent and the product was undamaged. This laptop can run most of my games on ultra settings and is super fast when i need to use it for anything else, especially uni work. Would definitely recommend. Only one minor problem is that the touch pad can drift slightly when clicking, however it is easy enough to just buy a mouse so this does not devalue the product in any way. Excellent purchase :)",

I don't use a mouse and I really wanted a good touchpad. You can set it up very easy and it has very nice functions, but still is a bit hard to use.

Don't be fooled by the false advertising. One of the main features about this laptop that caught my attention, was the ultrabay removable GPU. I wanted to buy the ultrabay GPU add-on and run it on SLI settings. But after some research, Lenovo confirmed that they have no intentions of bringing any ultrabay add-ons (GPU , HDD or fan) to the UK, even though it is clearly advertised. But to be honest, after all that, it's still amazingly good value for money.",
