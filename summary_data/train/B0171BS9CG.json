Everything feels much smoother w/ the updated processor and more ram. Note this does not come w/ a charger. Not a big deal as i have plenty of micro usb chargers. Only thing i wish was that the tablets had Quick Charge built in them. When my kids use up all the battery, it can seem like a lifetime for them to charge mainly because theyll come up to me every 15 mins asking if its done.",

The product has served me well for about a year now and continues to satisfy my needs. The only complaint is that I've noticed that the price has jumped from 200 to 275 in the past year, with no apparent improvement in hardware (maybe there was but it's not listed in the Amazon specs). IF the price were still at 200, I would have bought a second one by now.",

I only have one minor complaint, the power button is relatively hard to press (perhaps this is just an issue with my unit?) But I solved that by buying the flip cover.",

Very sturdy construction, much better than average sound for a tablet,(the speakers are in the FRONT inside a small chamber, GREAT idea!). More screen real estate due to the \"8 form-factor, IMHO you simply CAN'T do better for this price!.",

Haven't really tried out streaming a game to my tablet yet though. Screen is bright and I don't see any washed out colors to my knowledge. Mine did not come with any backlight bleed. The front facing speaking sound great. A little distortion can be heard at high volume though My only minor complaint is that the tablet's back cover is kinda slippery and I'm worried I might drop it while I wait for the case to come inn the mail.",

As far as software is concerned hardly know it's not a Nexus no bloatware. I've had Nexus devices for the last 3 years and have no patience for anything other than pure Android and I am right at home with this tab feels just like a Nexus with a few extra features. Currently running Android 6.0.1, this gets updated a few weeks after my Nexus 5X. Love it.",

The front speakers are well placed and it supports an SD card and mini hdmi connection which are features unavailable on the majority of tablets. The only negatives I would say to stop me giving it a 5 star is that the screen resolution and ppi is not as high as some other tablets and the wireless is only n when it should be ac which has a maximum through put of 450mps instead of 150.",

To play well you'll need a keyboard and mouse to really stream and play on tablet games that are similar in nature. Defeats the mobile streaming IMHO.

It could have a bit more RAM and a bit faster CPU, but that would quickly ramp the price up. I love this little thing and take it with me everywhere. I haven't tried out the controller that's made for it, but I do recommend the NVIDIA cover, even though it's a bit more. Keeps the tablet sleek while giving a stand and protecting the screen.",

No tablet can play the games that this tablet can unless you consider a windows tablet and although you can play great games there you loose out on the functionality of Android or ios.",
