I've only worn it in the damp and chilly Pacific NW environment so far and will be interested to see how it does in a less humid climate. The texture of the material is a bit stiff and plastic-like, but the blue grey color I find a nice contrast to the competition. A couple of negatives: the sleeves are way longer than needed and needed some extra length to the hook-and-loop fasteners on the cuffs to adequately close them; and the hood is absurdly too large. All in all, however, I think this a good jacket at its price point.",

      "text": "Bought this rain jacket a few months ago but was only recently able to use it. The waterproofing is not at all consistent. The hood, shoulders, and part of one arm were letting water through within 30min, in a light drizzle. Very disappointed and would return it if I could, but I'm now outside the 30 day return policy limit.",
