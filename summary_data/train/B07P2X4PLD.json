The fact that the water puddled was encouraging, however when I removed the tarp, a significant amount of water had soaked through. Still a really nice, heavy duty tarp but I feel it's false advertising saying it's waterproof when it is only water resistant.",

If the waterproofing ever does come off you can just melt beeswax and put on there and it will be waterproof forever. I bought this for underneath my tent when camping because the water does come up and penetrate from The Damp ground but now I think I may hang it above the tent for when we get the heavy rains because it appears to be able to handle the heavy winds that we get in our rain storms in southeast Oklahoma. I am really pleased with the quality of this tarp.",
