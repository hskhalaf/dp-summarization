      "text": "I have received mine in an open package, meaning the transparent plastic around the item was already cut. This tool also presented signs of wear. To me it indicates that it had been returned at some point, and then shipped again. With that being said, I am not going to return the item because the item seems to be fully functional, and for such a small item, a little cosmetic imperfection doesn't bother me. I can polish the brass and make it look new again.",

Anything the best blacksmiths could make out of brass a hundred years ago, a sloppy machinist in Taiwan could probably do better today... The angles are correct, and the finish is bright and smooth. What else do you want at this price point?",
