When the water starts to evaporate eventually it turns foggy and \u201cdewy\u201d. I did not try it return them (they were bought as a gift and my family threw one away after constant frustration with foggy water sloshing inbetween cup and insulation) but if i had all the cups I would have tried. Do not buy these cups no matter how cute they look. Very disappointed.",

But that doesn't mean they are flimsy, they're just delicate. I've owned many brands of double wall glasses and have broken many of them. These do feel a bit more solid than other's I've owned though.",
