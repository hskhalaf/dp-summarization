It doesn't fog or leak at all. I feel comfortable wearing it. The complimentary hat, earplugs and nose clip are really helpful. The quality of this product is totally worth 10 dollar. I would rate it five star and would recommend to anyone who needs it.",

I ended up purchasing a lycra swim cap that's a lot more comfortable than this rubber one. No complaints with the goggles after 1 swim lesson though!",
