I have used Saucony shoes for many years and this has never happened before. A few more miles and I am sure they will completely fall apart. I am very disappointed in these shoes. I expected much better quality from Saucony. As a follow up to my initial post, I had two horrible wipe outs with these shoes. I have hiked hundreds of miles without an accident before I started wearing these shoes. I think the sole is too rigid and becomes very slick when wet. I have since thrown these shoes away.",

I stepped on a small fallen branch and felt it on my foot as if I had no shoe on. There seemed to be no cushioning, and my knees were hurting at the end of my run, which never happens and which I don't ever want to happen. I won't use these again. I hope I can return them.",

Frayed on the side (as in about an inch of fray, completely obvious) and the glue on the front failed, leaving the lip of the shoe loose. Never in my life have I experienced such poor construction of a shoe. Really regret this purchase. We had photos but amazon would not let them post them.",

They are Goretex, and perfect in the rain and sloppy conditions, plus they are completely breathable. They are sturdy enough for trails but light enough to feel like a sneaker rather than a heavy hiking boot. They are very well constructed, but I can see myself going through the them pretty quickly just because I wear them all the time. I am seriously considering buying a few more pairs so I will keep having them for many years to come.",

    "description": "Saucony Excursion TR10 GTX Trail Running Shoe Enjoy the trails or any challenging terrain that you will encounter Take your run to the trails in any weather condition with the all new Excursion TR10 GTX. The outsole provides excellent protection and the traction on rough terrain while the waterproof and breathable GORE-TEX upper hugs the foot to provide support throughout your run. Upper - Lightweight Knit Mesh/Gore-Tex The GORE-TEX membrane is an extremely thin layer of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) placed on the interior lining. It has over 9 billion pores per square inch. It's these pores that give the GORE-TEX fabric its Waterproof yet breathable characteristics. A breathable mesh makes up the majority of the upper unit. It has an open construction, therefore allowing air to enter the shoe to make a well-ventilated environment for the foot. This durable material doesn't tear apart easily, so it has a long-lasting effect. Supporting this material composition, durable synthetic overlays are placed on top of the mesh and stitched onto the material, then connected directly to the lacing system. When the shoelaces are adjusted, they cause the upper unit to follow suit, giving the runner a customizable fit. On the interior a soft fabric lining gives the runner a comfortable and non-irritating in-shoe feel. It doesn't cause any pressure points or warm parts, so it prevents welts and blisters. Working alongside this feature, the plush tongue and collar help in securing the foot and keeping it in place. It also adds a bit of cushioning to keep the foot comfortable and supported whilst reducing chances of chafing and discomfort. Midsole - Heel Grid System/IMEVA The IMEVA or Injection Molded Ethylene vinyl acetate is a full-length midsole foam that delivers responsible cushioning to the runner at all times. It doesn't have a substantial weight, so the runner won't feel that the platform is dragging them down. It's responsive and durable, and it even offers shock",
