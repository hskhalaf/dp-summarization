It is a simple little table that has provided hours of entertainment in our house.",

The square Lilly pad base that goes in the center has grooves that are not aligned so it won\u2019t click into place. I can see based on other reviews I\u2019m not the only one with this issue. The Little tykes emblem is also upside down on the piece we got. It\u2019s also really difficult to get the drain plug into place correctly.I don\u2019t have time to package everything up and return it or set another new one up so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it to return. Not sure if I will buy this brand again.",

If the window for return hadn\u2019t expired, I\u2019d return it. I\u2019m not sure if I just have a defective plug or all the tables were made this way. Unfortunately I have to put duck tape over it. It\u2019s sad because my 15 month old loves splashing the water and playing with the toys. Table looks tacky with tape over it. If it weren\u2019t for the plug issue, I\u2019d give the table five stars!",

A little challenging for a younger child that may not have the patience to hook a fish but fun nonetheless there are plenty of activities on this to keep them occupied. The drain hole that people mentioned was there just not in the place it shows on the picture but I\u2019ll say it\u2019s pretty obvious to figure that out. Anyway the legs aren\u2019t the sturdiest so be mindful with how much water you add and having bigger kids lean on it. But I\u2019m happy with it. Would recommend!",

I foresee her continuing to play with this over time. Great price too\u2014 especially with these being price gauged and mostly sold out due to high demand!",

He loves splashing in the water, sending the little critter down the slide, and trying to catch the fish. I even have a lot of fun playing with him which is great because so many toddler toys are kind of boring.",
