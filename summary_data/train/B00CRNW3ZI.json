This blows away the iPhone by miles, which my wife and son both had until recently. They were so glad to move over to Android and Samsung phones! You will be too. There are endless apps for about anything you can think of, the phone is easy to navigate, the screen is gorgeous and a nice size, the feel of it in your had is perfect, it's fast and has great speaker! This one will make anyone happy! Get it.",

Apps are lightning fast, integration with Google features is perfect. Camera is the BEST, challenges my array of Nikon and Canon pocket cameras for quality. The phone is very light weight and a bit delicate--I damaged it a bit the first time I dropped it, but was able to repair it myself. I added a $20 Body Glove case, which makes the phone at least as rugged as my Droid X, but also as heavy or heavier than the Droid X.",

I don't know if Amazon is sending out faulty products or what, but this is unbelievable. Again, the outside screen is perfectly fine no cracks or scratches but the inside LCD randomly cracked. I'm going to contact amazon about this, but so far it looks like i was sold a faulty device that may not be under warranty because they will claim physical damage.",

The Air Gestures thing is kinda wonky though, gimmicky actually. Not deducting points because everything else is spot on.",

I don't have a problem with getting updates, but I do have a problem getting OTA updates that cost me data. HTC at least gave me the option to only download updates over wifi similar to when there's an update for an app in the Play Store. The rest of the phone's features are outstanding. The screen quality is unmatched, the call quality is terrific, and the phone's size is super slim.",

For those of you who do not know what that means, the phone has been listed as lost or stolen or the previous owner didn't pay their bill therefore the IMEI is pretty much locked up & can no longer be activated through Verizon. Luckily, that is a cheap fix & moderately easy process, but I would much rather have been able to pop in my sim & go about my day. 2 star rating from me!",
