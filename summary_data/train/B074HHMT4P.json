This little thing can definitely output some serious volume with little effort. It's got great range and can definitely accommodate any type of music you throw at it. Straight out of the box, i was up and running within 10 minutes. the set up would have been quicker but i got distracted playing around with some advanced settings. And with the portable battery pack, it's nice to have the option of taking the speaker outdoors. Great sounds, great price, easy to use. What else could you ask for?",

In addition to sound quality, very well thought out and comprehensive in terms of connectivity (although i just use it with my Echo Dot - and of course vs. an Echo Dot's own speakers, there is literally no comparison in terms of sound quality). I have not tried the Riva Festival yet but am now tempted to try it given my experience with the Arena - although I should probably get a bigger condo first.",

It can take from 20 minutes to over four hours to power up and connect. This happens everyday now. I tried to contact Riva direct, they will not respond to either voice mail or e-mail, only Amazon was able to help on the warranty/return claim.
