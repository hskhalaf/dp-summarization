I think the problem is that higher humidity affects US currency is that it becomes a slightly more dump and this machine just can't count once the currency is slightly dump and by slightly I mean probably even by 15%. Also, it is possible that this machine is just no longer functioning because it wasn't build to last. I have it for over a year. It used to work fine, but it doesn't work well anymore even though I don't use it often.",

The biggest complaint I have about this counter is its limit for counting. If you put too many bills in at once, you're going to run into issues. I would recommend it.
