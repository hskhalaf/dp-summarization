My only complaint so far is the battery barely makes it a day(granted with heavy initial use). With more normal use and using it more as a phone it should be able to make it a couple days before a couple hour recharge. Extras purchased: Spare battery  Snap on cover  LCD screen protector  HDMI micro adapter  32GB class 4 SD micro card  Will post more as things come up.",

Every app I've tried works great.\" However, over time, and probably because I installed quite a few apps, it got painfully slow and clumsy. Because you can't \"root\" the phone, you can't run any utilities to keep it clean and speedy. Your only option to get it fast again is to reset it (just like a computer with Windows on it :-) Once you do that, it's fast again :-) If you plan to reset it, make sure anything you want to keep is on the SD card.",

There are some quirks, most of which are relatively easily fixed with a search of one of the Android enthusiast forums (google Motorola Triumph forums). For example, this phone doesn't have a spelling dictionary which virtually every other Android phone does. I was able to fix that by copying a file into a folder as instructed on one of the forums. Another way to fix it is to download a free alternative keyboard app from the app market. The phone is not perfect, but it is VERY good for a cheap prepaid plan phone.",

      "text": "Motorola Triumph with Virgin prepaid is a useless phone with serious issues. Battery is very poor and requires twice daily charging with any amount of use. In fact it would die unused by the end of working day. Camera quality is good but the hardware is often unresponsive and needs frequent shutdowns. The calendar app keeps crashing and its unique to Motorola alone. I was grandfathered to older $25 a month plan, so for me Virgin with unlimited data plan is best bargain I can ever get. GPS in this phone with GoogleMap makes my Garmin obsolete. I would NOT recommend this phone to anyone.",

I like the Triumph because its only $35/month an extra $5 with insurance and its fast. It has a lot of free apps/free music downloads. I had an iPhone before and it took a long time for me to get used to the Triumph keyboard, but I have it down now (after a month or two). I would encourage others to do as I do, because you're saving buckets of cash in the long run. And who on earth is going to have a mobile for a short period of time? lol",

The stock battery will only work 1/2 a day. If you Wifi or play games it won't last very long. The 1600mAh will last all day. Just search Amazon for \"Motorola Triumph 1600mAh battery\" or click on the link for the one I bought below. I paid $6.00 for it. You will have a lot of fun with this phone. I also ordered a 5 pack of cases, the fit really nice. The link is below for them as well. ]",

The cameras quality is no where near my expectations and it's rather slow. It isn't bulky, fits right in my pocket, and gets great service.

The battery plate barely stays on, even in my pocket. The battery life is a bad joke. If you forget to plug it in one night, expect it to be dead by the next morning. It consistently freezes on me and I've recently had to delete all pictures and all but a few apps due to insufficient phone storage, and that's with a bigger memory card. It has convinced me to never buy another Android based phone again.",
