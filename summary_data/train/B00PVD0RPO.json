Watch a video on how long it takes to set up & it never works with the app till you reset it. Then expect it to stop working sometimes 3 times a month & then it needs to be programmed again & again. I have a top of the line router so I know it's not that. If you buy this after what I've told you, you will be doomed to be retarded without a WiFi signal the end.",

The issues with connecting with my Altop Camera is NOT with the Extender or Router. The problem is with the Altop camera and their tech support has given up. So the extender doesn't connect the camera to my desktop software provided by the camera manufacturer. D-Link on the other hand has the best - most patient tech support staff I've ever had the privilege to communicate with ever! They are more than AWESOME! Altop Cameras on the other hand ... consider other manufactures.",

Signal strength has been great, and I love that I can plug in another device via the gigabit port such as a NAS or desktop. Would recommend.",

It is just a wifi range extender that can either take a wifi signal aand essentially rebroadcast it, or it can take a wired (incoming) connection and rebroadcast that, like a normal basic access point would. It does not act as a wireless bridge, which should connect to an aaccesspoint and retransmit that signal over its wired connection (incoming and outgoing), allowing remote wired computers to leverage the wireless connection from the router.",
