I am using it for an old Martin tenor, and it holds it without issue. I also tried it with my Yamaha alto, works fine as well. I couldn't be happier with this stand. I would recommend this item to anyone. To those leery of paying a higher price than others that look similar, I urge you to delve into those reviews and note a common theme - inferior product, unsteady, cheap materials, etc. This product is none of those, and worth every penny.",

Luckily I have another sax stand which does not get stuck at all and quite stable. This stand also has a Hollywood Curved Soprano bracket.

My only complaints- the tenor sticks to the cradle some, so it's a good idea to step on a foot when picking up the horn, to avoid pulling the stand off the floor- especially if you have a flute or clarinet on the peg. On the other hand, it holds a tenor or alto sax securely. I feel that the lower rest should be wider. It's too easy to miss it and have your horn put in danger.",

The bell brace at the bottom always has me wondering if I've set it in the right place but it is very adjustable to fit any tenor or alto horn. Good for keeping your sax out and available to practice more. It's utilitarian, not decorative, tho... if you want something that compliments your living room, I saw a wooden one on Amazon, somewhere but, for the studio or the stage, this one is hard to beat.",

It's so well-made, I may not have to buy one again for a LONG time. Highly recommend. If you need a doubler's stand, I believe they make other versions that include pegs/accessories, too.",
