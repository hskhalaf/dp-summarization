Granted, I'm a little addicted to the touchpad on mynow, but I still use this at work because I hate my mouse cord getting caught up with my phone cord and just generally being in the way. It's a great addition to a desktop set-up to simplify your wires. It's comfortable to use, though I've used the multi-function buttons less lately (haven't taken the time to set them up with a new computer). They're nice, but the mouse also works fine without those features if you don't want to use them.",

The transmitter for this mouse was mounted in the USB port in the back of the computer. The cursor was reacting slowly and wasn't very smooth. I finally used a USB extension cord to move the transmitter up to the table next to the monitor and everything works fine now. The mouse and all the special features work flawlessly. I like being able to custom program the buttons for different applications. Excellent product, but be aware that if the distance between the transmitter and the mouse is not optimal, there could be some problems.",

I'm not a \"power user\" of mouse buttons and have no interest in the email button and other custom buttons and disabled them. But for me, this mouse performs the key functions of a mouse very very well on all fronts without the cord and without constant battery changes -- which is just what I wanted.",

Once I moved the signal closer, I had no more problems. That being said, if you can't get the mouse within about two feet of the USB connection, you may find the mouse action unreliable.",

The mouse works better than any mouse that I have owned, and with all the features that it has I would definitely give it 5 stars",

Nope, you probably won't find it at your local Staples, Office Depot and the like. But, it's excellent. It's feel and function are very good and it doesn't really eat batteries, though no wireless mouse is kind to a battery. The wireless receiver is a little plug in for a USB port and it even works through a wood desk without a hitch. Way to go Logitech for a really really good mouse for a reasonable price (roughly $50).",

However, unless you're a gamer or a power user, this is probably overkill for you. I've seen others complain about the email and IM buttons not working with certain mail clients, but I should point out that the mouse configuration utility can easily fix this if you are willing to dig into it.
