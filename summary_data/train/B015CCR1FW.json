      "text": "Watch This Video [...] This is a great product that lights up when you push the necklace and when it gets wet. The batteries are also safely secured with a screw and waterproof for young children. My 1 year old is not into Barbies yet, but she loves this Barbie because it lights up. Also for parents concerned about choking hazards the only part that needs to be removed for safety is the tiara, which is easy to take off. Nothing else besides the removable tiara on this Barbie is a choke hazard. Highly suggested for toddlers that are new to playing with Barbies because its both safe and stimulating.",

It has a button on the chest area so the flashing lights in the tail can be turned on at any time, and when the mermaid is in the tub, her tail lights up automatically. The mermaids hair stays very soft and smooth after using it in the tub, which many dolls hair does not. This is a very nice toy.",
