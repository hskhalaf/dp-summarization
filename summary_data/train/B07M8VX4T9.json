An update, I found a smart device to stick to this that will automatically push the button the way I program, (it\u2019s a smart button pusher device). It worked well until my boyfriend misplaced the cord, now i guess I need a replacement. My second recommendation is they could make a universal power cord.",

It did catch a very small gnat. In the end we got rid of the invasion through apply cider vinegar traps and patiently splattering them with a magazine. Was really hopeful for Katchy, but can't recommend it on any level if your intention is to catch fruit flies.",

This Catchy definitely helps reduce the problem, but I want to add that if your problem is gnats due to houseplants, these kinds of devices will only get rid of the adult/mature bugs. To fully solve the problem, you have to stop them from continually breeding in the soil of your plants. The biggest thing is to stop overwatering. You can also try bottom watering, you can treat your soil with diluted hydrogen peroxide, add mosquito bits to the soil, etc. BUT, this Catchy definitely catches a ton of them, and I'd definitely recommend!!",

If I'm using my Kindle I have to put the Katchy on the high setting. The light is brighter so it helps to draw them away from the Kindle. This works perfectly for what I needed.

My poor little girl is scratching all night and wakes up with little bumps all over her, as do I . It did take me at least two nights to find the right position in the house for the Katchy. Once I discovered the best position, which was at the entryway to the room in which we sleep, we have been seven days mosquito free through the night. Thank You",

Once I got this device, the bites were nearly eliminated. It caught the little gnats I didn't even know were there in addition to the mosquitoes. The fan isn't at all bothersome but the light can be - put it behind a lamp or on the lower setting if you dont want it right in your eyes...or place it on the other side of the room. It does have to be placed in a dark room or it isn't effective. I would recommend this highly.",

But, placed it in my attached bathroom with door open just a few inches and sleep fine. Will be buying 2 more for other parts of the house.",
