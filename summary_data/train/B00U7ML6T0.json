They look super cheap!!! I would be embarrassed to give them as a gift and I would have to spend in individual bags and ribbons if I were to gift them... I don't have the option to send them back because they aren't eligible for return. What a waste of money.",

The oils in the bath bombs feel nice while you are in the bath and as other reviewers mentioned the scent stays on your skin long after the bath. Downside so far after trying one has been the rose petal pieces. They left quite a mess in the tub and looked more like vomit chunks than rose petals. :(",

The color, while not a requirement, is part of the fun. Two of them, that again smell fab, turn the water a sickly green color which reminded me of lake water. All that being said, I will definitely purchase these again. The pluses far outweigh the minuses!",

They make my skin feel amazingly soft, leave no mess in the bathtub, and have just the right amount of smell. Only critique is that I wish there was a greater variety of scents to choose from (maybe some basic ones like honey, lemon, peppermint, etc) and I could do without the rose petals.",
