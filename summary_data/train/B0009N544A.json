I'm no expert, but this did exactly what it it was supposed to do. I have a Netgear antenna, so my only recommendation is to get a USB adapter from the same company that makes your wifi router. That was recommended to me by my IT guy at work and it worked flawlessly with this equipment.",

The only negative is that they're becoming addicted to the internet! I could have lucked out with this product, but it worked great for me.",
