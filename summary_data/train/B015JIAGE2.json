No, the pictures are not super-sharp, high-definition prints, but that's not what this camera is trying to be. Under the \"standard\" color setting, the photos come out looking like a film camera from the late 80s, where the \"sepia\" photos look like they were taken from my grandpa's camera from the 60s. The focus has been sharp and impressive at all distances I've shot. I'm very pleased with this camera",

Also be sure you are considering your lighting and angles in the view finder as it definitely effects the photos.

No information on the calibration process, no website for manual download on the package. We spend over half an hour of frustrating attempts to get it working with no success. This was an expensive gift to have this unacceptable customer experience. I do not recommend giving this product consideration.",

Now it is in her room laying with many other toys that were so great in the beginning but now has fallen by the wayside. I would recommend buying a good $40 digital camera and developing any quality pictures that you want to keep at Walmart.",

I had a bad feeling having to buy through a third party, but I went ahead and did it anyways. Polaroid does not sell this camera from their website; they just direct you to buy through third party sellers on Amazon... hmmm. I should have gone with my gut feeling.",

It will be awesome for my son to get to experience polaroid like I did!",
