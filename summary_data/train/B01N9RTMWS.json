If you plan to use your Switch on an airplane (the absolute best place to play a Switch, by the way), I think a stand like this is basically a requirement. It's ten times better than playing in handheld mode, using the flimsy integrated kickstand, or trying to get the screen to the right viewing angle some other way. My only complaint is that I wish it would lock in position, since it can be easy to nudge it with your hand.",

It works great with the Mumba case, which means it'll probably fit most any case, and it's thin enough to fit in bigger carrying cases. It's nice for playing desktop while charging.",

If you're on a limited budget this accessory belongs no where near the top of your \"must have\" accessories list.

      "text": "I got that so that I could play games like VOEZ and Piczle Lines DX (games that are easier to play touchscreen) in handheld mode. It works exactly as intended, and I am very happy with it. The only downside is that there is nothing that grips the switch in place, you just set it down. It's not flimsy at all, and I'm not afraid of it falling over or something, but it would be nice to have that extra security. WAY better than the switch's kickstand. Recommended!",
