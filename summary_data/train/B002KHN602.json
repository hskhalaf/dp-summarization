      "text": "Canning is a relatively new hobbie for me and my 14-year-old daughter. In the past, we\u2019ve fumbledwith DIY racks, kitchen tongs and all the wrong tools. This year, as we prepared for our county youth fair and preparing her award winning salsa, we opted to purchase canning equipment to cutdown on frustration and guesswork. This was the perfect solution! Not only is this kit a low-price solution, it also contains all the tools needed to canning. It was easy and safe enough for my daughter to work with independently. I\u2019m very pleased and look forward to using this kit frequently.",

The spatula has a wooden measuring stick handle so you can be sure your water is at least one inch above your cans, the funnel is the best, the little gizmo with the magnet is for getting tops out of the sterilization pot with ease....everything else is pretty self explanatory. This is not only my first canning set up, my guess is it will be the only one I ever need. One caveat--the magnet came out of its holder but it was easily put back in and has stayed there.",

It was just as described & I was impressed by the quality & price. I did a lot of research on canning. I needed just a few more items to get started. I needed jars, scooped spoon and candy thermometer. It was really fun & easier than expected. Thank you",

The handles do not hook to the sides very well, one time while I had it raised removing jars one handle came loose dropping the whole basket back into the pot of boiling water. I was very lucky to not get burned during either of these accidents. Don't buy this garbage. Take a stand for quality.",

My only complaint is that it's huge, much larger than it has to be to get the job done on smaller jars. When it's full of water I can't lift it out of the sink, so I have to bail it by hand. I would imagine that if you had a smaller sink you would have to fill it by hand as well.",

I got it as a gift to my husband who loves to makes Jam and he loves it so much and actually went crazy making way too much jam, so we sold a lot of it at my Xmas Bazaar, and it was a hit. I would comment this item to anyone who loves to make jelly or jam but doesn't have the time the old-fashion way. It really is a life saver. VERY GOOD PRODUCT AMAZON!!",
