The small size and pour spout make it so much easier to make the meringues (pour with precision, and get all the syrup out of the pot and into the bowl without hitting the whisk). It\u2019s super easy cleanup as well. I expect I\u2019ll use it for more things because I like it so much, but I\u2019m delighted that it\u2019s so perfect for what I wanted it for!",
