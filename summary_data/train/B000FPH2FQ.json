If using in combination with another drug for giardia, used for 10 consecutive days. Mix with something very yummy as these are bitter and picky dogs may not be willing to consume it no matter what you put it in. For these dogs you may have to request the liquid formulation but this is not ideal for medium to large dogs based on volume required.",

It's easy to administer, comes in a individual packet of a granulated powder that can easily be mixed into wet dog food and they all scarf it down, even my pickiest of eaters eats it with out hesitation. Tip: I purchased a large box even for my small dogs and used the weight chart in the back to dose my smaller dogs two dogs with one box saves money!!!! Yes I would recomend this product to friends and family",

I only didn't give one star because I can't be certain now that the type of worm she has is the one type this medication doesn't treat. I now have to take her to the vet and spend a heap of money that I'd hoped this would help me prevent form spending. smh..win some lose some. If this post is still listed throughout 2018 that means that she didn't have that type of worm and that this medicine should have prevented the infestation of parasites she's fighting.",

Based on what I have read, I believe this product eliminates a wider range of parasites than any other single product on the market; is virtually non-toxic; and is flavorless, so there is no problem in getting your pet to ingest it. It mixes easily with food. Although not \"approved\" in the U.S. for cats, I have read that it is used for cats as well as dogs across Europe, and is administered with the same dosage per unit weight as with dogs. However, I am not a vet, so discuss its use with your vet before giving to your cat or other animals.",
