Everything crashes constantly because the apps are outdated but there are no updates.

The only reason I am not giving it five stars, there are not many free channels available, yet. Technology exists but content providers still fear providing the content online fearing the content distributors like Comcast, Time Warner, etc who would obviously would cut them out. Buy this and cut the cord, it is only a matter of years when all the channels would be available live. But until then, there are pre-recorded videos, and ofcourse, youtube, netflix and amazon. There are also couple of new comers of unknown reliability.",

      "text": "I would give this device a 5 stars if it would support DLNA and mainly DTS audio for movies. The device comes with Plex client installed which could take care of streaming content but it does require a server program to run on your computer. The media player needs to support DLNA. There is no DTS , DTS-MA support for videos so any movie with a mix of DTS and AC3 tracks will only allow you to have AC3 audio and nothing if the movie is DTS only... The DTS thing is probably a licensing issue but if sony can include it in their bluray player they should be able to do the same in this device.",
