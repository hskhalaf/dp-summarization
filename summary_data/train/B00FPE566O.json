This alkaline water has helped turn my stomach woes around. I suffer from IBS and have for 10+ years. I previously drank Essensia but Qure is 10x better. Not only is it more alkaline than Essensia is, but it had a better effect on my body and my stomach. I know the price of this water may seem high, but it is 100% worth the cost.",
