My primary gripe is the construction.....it is particle board with a fake (vinyl) veneer. No solid wood whatsoever. It is a Wal-mart grade piece of furniture. Had I known this, I would have spent another $100 and locally purchased an assembled piece that at least had a real wood veneer. It looks ok at a distance, but up close it does appear cheap. Would not do this again given the facts.",
