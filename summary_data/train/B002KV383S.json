Well, he was right, he didn't use it, but I use it all the time. I don't know why anyone would want one of those expensive bikes when this one has everything you need--tracks time, distance, speed, etc. and has a resistance knob. It's also a nice compact size for our small home. I've used it almost everyday since we bought it and have had no problems with it.",

The bike is not quiet because it makes a thump every time the pedal goes around. I can't see any cause for this. The bike is level and on a mat.

Tension levels are acceptable for my level of biking interest. Only two complaints: First, the seat can be a little uncomfortable. Second, while I assembled the machine, the left peddle did not screw in completely due to some manufacturers defect (yes, I followed instructions very carefully). This wasn't a big problem, as I was able to tighten the peddle enough that it felt secure (for now).",

      "text": "Pros: 1) Excellent price and well-built. 2) Compact: the upright is easy to stow even is a fairly busy room between uses. 3) Quiet operation. Cons: 1) Not very strong resistance even at max setting. This does have some adjustment in the handle neck. The assembly procedure might leave the resistance at lowest range and can be adjusted internally with some disassembly required. 2) Another Marcy tradition: The seat is very uncomfortable. 3) Can be unstable as the support base is narrow gauge. This is a \"meat and potatoes\" upright bike, carrying on the Marcy tradition of sturdy and cost-effective equipment. The handles are stationary.",

Only thing I would change is the seat levels. I have long legs and on the tallest setting my legs are still pretty bent, more than I'd like for this type of equipment. Other than that its pretty easy to move and seems pretty sturdy.",

The only downfalls are that the seat is very firm and uncomfortable, and the handle bars force me to ride the bike hunched over, which hurts my back after a while. Would be nice if there was a cup holder on the bike.",

Well, believe me, unless you have her \"young\" butt, you need a cover. Mine was killing me. I bought the simulated sheepskin cover and it helps alot. I'm still having a lot of muscle and joint pain after but wait to recover then try again. I don't see how it cannot improve anyones health.",

The computer crapped out last year and honestly I don\u2019t really rely on it to track my workouts anyways, so I never bothered to fix it. It can be a little unstable on rugs, I find it works best on my hardwood floor. Overall, it\u2019s a great investment for a small home gym or someone looking to fill the void on days they can\u2019t make it to the gym. I am currently looking into another Marcy machine.",
