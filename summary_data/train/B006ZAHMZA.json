Being able to plug the camera in to the TV is a great option for sharing the fun with a group. bought the protection plan with the camera but haven't had any issues yet, despite watching the poor thing crash to the floor from the hands of my beloved little one. The only issue we experienced up til now was temporary, and occurred because my son breathed into the lenses and fogged them up internally. Surprisingly, they didn't clear up very quickly, but after sitting overnight the picture quality was restored and no more blurry lens.",

Changing settings and lighting did nothing to improve photos. This camera also made subjects look really weird. Super fat faces on anyone in the right or left edges of the picture (on all settings). The distortion reaches almost a quarter of the way in so only the central half of the frame is correct. The really disappointing thing about it is that the reviews were positive and so completely incorrect. I bought it on Amazon new. Complete garbage.",

I'm not a photography enthusiast so I have mine set to automatically select the best \"scene\" setting for each shot, and that seems to work just fine. With 16 megapixel pictures and 10x optical zoom (31x digital zoom), you can't beat the price. My previous camera was also an Olympus and that one only lasted 3 years and then it died on me. I've only had this one for a few months so I can't give it 5 stars because I don't know whether or not I will have a similar longevity problem. For this price I felt it was worth giving Olympus another shot.",

Another neat feature -- thanks to Olympus' thinking is the camera battery is used in other Olympus cameras, including the vr-360, vr-470, sz-12 and sp720-uz.

I have repeatedly charged the battery to \"full\" and the same thing happens each time. I will be able to take one picture and the red Olympus will go dead. Therefore the battery will not hold a charge, or other issue. I wonder if any other folks have had this problem? Returning it immediately.",

This is a simple model, but the features are what sold me at the end. The beauty feature is my favorite - my girlfriends and I use the heck out of that feature! It takes great video too. I plan on taking this to Europe in a few months (part of the reason I sought out a new camera) and I trust that it won't let me down.",
