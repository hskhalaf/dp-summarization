I tried different temperatures (up to 240c) but still not good. I had better success with other non black filaments from Hatchbox and IC3D. I recently gravitate more and more to Hatchbox ABS filaments, better price and so far they all gave me very good printing results. Edit: added a picture with sample prints with Hatchbox yellow, IC3D red, IC3D blue and IC3D black (the subject of my review). The IC3D black I got underperforms consistently, except for very simple models.",

This filament does have a shrinkage effect (as does all ABS filament) of roughly 5%, so that is something to keep in mind while printing. Overall, this filament met project requirements and expectations. I would purchase again when in need of filament.",

Similarly, the hotend needed to be 245C to get good printing.
