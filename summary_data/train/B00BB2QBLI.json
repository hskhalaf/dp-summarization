Today's technology with ProTools, LOGIC, Digital Performer, Reasons, etc having the Apogee Duet as a companion is well worth it. It will make your music 'radio ready'. I've done many duets in the course of my career, and I'm happy to now have this 'duet' interface as one of my studio companions. :-)",

      "text": "This small little box sounds better than my old ProTools Rig ! As a songwriter/ producer I only record single instruments or vocals at a time so no need for a huge interface with tons of inputs and outputs. The sound is spectacular even if you just listen to iTunes through it, you miss it when you are not listening through it. I also have done several remote sessions at a singers house and used my iPhone 5S and Garageband, works perfectly !",

Mine did come with the Lightning cable inside the box! I tried plugging my iPhone in just to test it and it connected right away, charges the iPhone, and starts playing audio from the phone. Very cool, love the look and the sound, and that it\u2019s Made in the USA!",

It's ridiculous \u2013 my synths. drum machines, effects processors all user 1/4\" balanced outputs. Now I'll have to buy a whole new stock of cables. The 1/4\" input is only for instruments, and microphones. The device has a breakout box, which I dislike \u2013 but it sounds good. The software and ergonomics are good, but that missing 1/4\" balanced input makes no sense.",

It randomly makes loud popping noises and changes the volume after updating to Yosemite, but because of the above bug won't let me update the firmware at all without buying an extra cable and installing an ios app (I use it on mac). Might be worth $20 as a paperweight, definitely not $600.",
