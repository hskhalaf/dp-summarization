My planned use is design software (Autodesk Revit & Formit) plus maybe SketchUp. Plus weekend viewing outside - I will let you know if the screen NITS is high enough for sunny days.",

The spec's on this machine are very good for the price. The battery lasts me about a day and a half without extreme use. There was a few minor scratches on the side of the laptop but aren't noticeable. Overall very worth the price and I'm satisfied with it! I recommend purchasing this!",

Im sure that that is the tradeoff for having a strong hinge but I can only sometimes open it with one hand and usually have to hold the bottom down while opening the top. Windows Hello is amazing. Windows Ink is good but I just don't really need it.",

It came looking and feeling just like new--except for one thing: my caps key was reluctant and only worked intermittently. Fortunately, I have learned to have some patience and, after a couple of days, it got \"broken in\" and, now, all is well. This seems to be a fairly solid machine (for a non-business model). I like the key action (I'm a serious typist), and the unit is quick (the SSD!) and powerful.",
