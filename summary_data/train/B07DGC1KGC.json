It\u2019s smaller, easier to move around and comes with a number of tools. The most useful tool is a mirror. Unfortunately the mirror is round and when angled only reflects a narrow image. Making an oblong replacement with hard stainless wire and an acrylic 1st surface mirror was an easy task but 1 star deducted for design flaw. FYI Lesson: When looking for TDC use a clip to prevent the camera snake from sliding into the cylinder chamber when you let go to turn the engine over.",
