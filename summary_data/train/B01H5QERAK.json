      "text": "I get migraines quite often so I always used the Ace cold packs with a wrap-around sleeve, however, they are no longer available. I bought this product to test it out and see if it could compete with Ace, and it didn't compete, it's significantly better than those. The sleeve is very soft and the gel pack is more pliable and lays flatter that the Ace ones do. I will definitely be buying more. Great product!",

It had a small tear at the end and brown gel like substance started oozing out! I emailed their customer support and have not heard back. Quite unsatisfied.",
