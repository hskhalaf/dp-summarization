The head swivels from left to right easily and the hose pulls out to deliver water a good way beyond the kitchen-sink; as well as to deliver a spray and or full spouting water pressure. The single 'water-lever' accesses hot, cold and tepid water to our/your desired temperature. The finish is classic \"SH\" - high buffed, stainless steel finish.",

This is my first faucet with the pull out spray head and my only regret is that I didn't get one like this sooner. This particular one appears to be made for a fairly large sink, front to back. For my sink, I would prefer the neck have more of a bend so the water came out directly over the drain. But this has not been an issue- you get used to it quickly. The handle can be aimed in any direction when installing, and mine is forward instead of to the side as shown in the ad - seems more convenient to me.",

I then had to uninstall the entire faucet in order to fish out the coupling which had become stuck in the base of the casing. A real pain, but I did it. So, I recommend the faucet but hope the company improves this design flaw so that users do not need to rig it with homemade solutions.",

Either Ensure that water/damp air never gets to those parts or get a grinder ready if you want to change it out after some years.",
