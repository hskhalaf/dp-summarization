      "text": "I am not sure how these can be called puppets - the hand opening is tiny and very shallow, especially since none of the heads are hollow. You essentially have to awkwardly get two fingers into the 'arms' while your other fingers are bunched up and in the way - all while the material doesn't come even come down low enough to reach your wrist. The is true with small hands. It would be impossible to even fit a larger hand at all. This is really unfortunate because the animals are cute and I was hoping they would be fun for telling stories with our child.",

I think what you get for the money is worth it, but the animals have stumpy legs, and their heads are controlled by one\u2019s middle finger which is a very unnatural position and feels awkward and uncomfortable. They are also pretty small, so seem better for a child\u2019s hand than an adults.",
