      "text": "In my previous home, the home theater guy sold me some ARIA IC614 in-ceiling speakers and told me they were fantastic. They were OK but I always felt something was lacking. I paid around $160 per speaker back then. In my new home, I resolved to not cheap out. I decided to get the NSIC800WH 6 speaker set. Could not believe they ended up around only $100 a speaker and I would have a spare to boot. I played some music and I was absolutely shocked that these speakers could actually pump out some bass. There was some thump! Coupled with my Polk subwoofer the sound fills the room very well and is extremely cohesive. Extremely satisfied.",

They are clearer, more crisp sounds. Both are the same installation, but the yamaha have a magnetic grill front while the Monoprice are pushed into the right spot. The NSIC800WH is about $20/speaker more then the monoprice. I think the quality of product and sound quality is about right for the difference in cost.",

With a weak amp they will sound like through a hole in the wall; pretty much the same as a toy bluetooth speaker you can get for 20 bucks. Changed the amp to 2x100W from Yamaha and wholey woley what a world of difference! These can pump some serious music. Do they match the RTI-A9 from Polk in my TV room, heck no....BUT in the kitchen (recent remodel) they are waaaaaay more than needed. Sonos has nothing on my setup which costs probably less than half and the Yamaha amp has build in Bluetooth for little over a hundred bucks, WIN-WIN!. Would certainly buy again/more.",

No need to paint the grill but I see that could be a problem if you wanted to paint it. As with other reviewers, this was installed in a bathroom and works OK. It is about 12 inches (30.48 cm) from a single compact fluorescent light with no obvious interference. One suggestion: Since this was installed in an attic ceiling, I gently taped the cardboard template to the back of speaker to protect it from insulation. Recommended.",

    "description": "An easy-to-install in-ceiling speaker system that has magnetic grilles and high sound quality designed to meet various custom installation requirements.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n\nYAMAHA NS-IC800 IN-CEILING SPEAKERS: RICH STEREO SOUND ANYWHERE IN YOUR HOME\nThe NS-IC800 8-inch in-ceiling speaker is good for 2-channel sound reproduction or home theater use in a living room, dining room, family room or bedroom. The NS-IC800 uses a blue polypropylene mica cone woofer and fluid-cooled soft- dome swivel tweeter in a coaxial design. The tweeter swivels so it can be aimed for most effective high frequency output. The paintable grille with magnets makes it easy to attach or remove for quick installation. The large mounting clamp with non-slip tread grips ceilings or walls firmly for sure installation.\n\n\n\nThe Yamaha NS-IC800 blends seamlessly into your decor\n\nHIGH SOUND QUALITY WITH A UNIQUE DESIGN\nYamaha's policy of always putting sound quality first, combined with decades of experience in producing fine speakers, ensures that the sound of these speakers is superior to that of many other in-ceiling speakers. The NS-IC800 uses a blue PP (polypropylene) mica cone woofer and fluid-cooled soft-dome swivel tweeter in a coaxial design. The tweeter swivels so it can be aimed for most effective high frequency output.\n\n\n\nMagnets make it easy to attach or remove the grille\n\nA unique ridge-shape aluminum center cap with a stepped speaker surround eliminates mid-high frequency peaks, so the sound is delivered smoothly and musically.\n\nThe NS-IC800 8-inch speaker is good for 2-channel sound reproduction or home theater use in a living room, dining room, family room or bedroom. The design of these speakers is very practical. They have a noticeable grain-finished acoustic baffle with a spiral pattern which makes the sound disperse naturally. The slim fringe grille becomes almost invisible after installation, so it won't conflict with your interior decor. A sealed back cover protects both speaker unit and crossover from dust and moisture.\n\nQUICK AND EASY INSTALLATION\nThe paintable grille with magnets makes it easy to attach or remove for quick installation. The large mounting clamp with non-slip tread grips ceilings or walls firmly for sure installation. No need for expensive professional installation--the NS-IC800 is an easy upgrade to bring better stereo sound into your existing home theater setup.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\n * Speaker Type: 2-way coaxial\n * Woofer: 8\" polypropylene mica cone\n * Tweeter: 1\" fluid-cooled soft dome, swivel\n * Voice Coil: Single\n * Frequency Response: 50 Hz - 28 kHz\n * Impedance: 8 ohms\n * Sensitivity: 90 dB\n * Maximum Input Power: 140 watts\n * Network (Crossover Frequency): 12 dB/oct.
