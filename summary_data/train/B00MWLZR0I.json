Replaced it with a $26 Mediasonic Homeworx HW180STB and it works flawlessly. Using the same USB HD. No wireless for the Homeworx however it does have a HDMI port which provides much better quality (1080P) than the Tablo. I had to turn the Tablo to its lowest (frame rate/video quality) setting to get it to work at all. I suspect the Tablo had an intermittent defect as it would disappear from my home network randomly. Great concept poorly executed.",

This product might have a future depending on the Tablo company and its willingness to serve all its customers. For now, the display design is awkward without a subscription.

Gave it another try early this year since I was tired of paying 120+ for Sat TV. All the issues I mentioned above have been fixed. Buffering is pretty much gone. I think several things had help 1. probably better firmware. 2. I upgraded my home router so internal speed is north of 30 Mbps 3. Added an external Antennae in my attic. Overall, I'm happy with the unit. Cancelled my SatTV.",

This has to do with 'opening ports' which some folks feel can be a security risk. There is a 3rd party outfit that can help you for $40 (Port Forwarding.com) As far as I can tell Tablo does not support these configuration changes. At least in my case, Tablo is not Plug and Play.

Going to be great with football and fall season of new shows coming up. The device works well and I stream via Wi-Fi to three different televisions (TCL televisions since you can use the TV App) and also to my computer with no issues thus far. Glad to not be paying a monthly rental for a cable or satellite DVR box. I did sign up for the extended guide data - 2 weeks of data.",

The interface and features were wonderful and did everything that I wanted. But there were issues with disconnecting from the network, unit detection, lost sound, failed recordings, and playback errors. The 4-tuner DVR also got extremely hot by design. I placed it on blocks and a cooling fan base to dissipate the heat.",
