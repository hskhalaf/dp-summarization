Someone had mentioned this spot remover, so I decided to try it. The first time I used it, it worked wonders! The set in, dried in, stains came right out the first time. I put some solution on the stain and rubbed it in. I let it sit on the stain overnight and washed as normal. When I pulled the clothes out of the dryer, the stains were gone! Definitely love this spot remover!!",

The 3 bottles come sealed in a shipping pouch, and upon opening it, the pouch was full of liquid and the 3 bottles were soaked in the soapy solution. Had to rinse all three bottles off, and one was half full. Ineligible for return or claim, so I guess I\u2019m out a half a bottle. Love the product, but less than impressed with shipping. Simply checking the lids before bundling into 3-packs would have saved this issue.",

The first bottles of this stain remover I purchased from Amazon clearly labeled the product as NON-TOXIC and BIODEGRADABLE (picture attached). That formula was the best stain remover EVER, got rid of grease, ink, mustard, etc. However, the newer (3) bottles of this stain remover have a Prop 65 warning on the label, and indicate that the product is a skin and eye irritant. Had I noticed this I would not have bought the product, no matter how well it works. I will not purchase again.",

I love it because it can even get out a stain even after an item has been washed and dried. Perfect for getting out greasy spots and food stains. Doesn't need any setting time either, just put a bit on and then throw it in the wash. A little bit goes a long way!",
