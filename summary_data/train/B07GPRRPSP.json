Now the real data, I ranged a Prong Horn Antelope at 632 yards and many other at all distance below that. I ranged a beef cow at 847 yards. This range finder is the real deal and the price is awesome, I've bought other way more expensive range finder's and they DID NOT perform even close to this Kilo1200. Totally happy with this range finder right now and I strongly recommend it. I will test it hard on Bears in August this year, 2019.",
