The power of the spin mechanism, both in the water and in the colander basket, is very effective so the mop cleans itself. You can easily adjust the amount of water you want to leave on the mop.",

When you rinse it, you have to manuly pop the wet/dirty base angle back to 90 degr. to put it in bucket to spin it. . Other than that it does the job in fastest time than any other mop.",

I am pretty disappointed. I bought this because my old one, different model, broke after 2 years of using it. This one was taller and I really did like it until this little plastic piece broke.

Simply plunge the handle into the water bucket to spin and clean the mop by getting rid of loose debris. Then transfer to the stainless steel wringer basket and plunge to spin dry. Control the dampness you want by the amount you spin. Ready to go again in no time! Two built-in handles and large wheels make transporting the bucket easy, even filled with water. The pivoting mop head, made of 100% replaceable microfiber, allows for cleaning under furniture, in corners and around stationary objects. The water bucket easily drains with a drain plug built right in, and if more cleaning solution is needed, a perfectly positioned soap dispenser is ready to go. A convenient storage compartment is also built in, ready to store cleaning accessories like sponges, gloves or brushes so you won\u2019t have to go searching for them.",
