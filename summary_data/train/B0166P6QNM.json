The new one is well executed, one indication being the shot-welding that joins the base to the basket. Stainless is burn-prone, but the welds showed no hint of burns, so both production and pre-shipping inspection are solid on this matter. Why not a fifth star? The edges of the handles were a bit sharp, not cut-hazard sharp, but less than ideally comfortable. I'll acclimate, and they'll smooth over time, but attention to that detail in speccing, production, and/or inspection would have gotten a fifth star. Yes, I would buy this again.",

In addition to the small holes all over the place and the comfortable handles, this LiveFresh one has holes in the base to help with the initial runoff. A nice touch. It's well finished with no rough spots or sharp edges, and feels like it'll last a lifetime. I have run some Ditalini and some Angel Hair pastas though this one and they both drained great!

It is well made with strong handles, a smooth interior, and holes small enough for food to stay in. Even my husband noticed how the spaghetti didn't get caught, so that tells you something. Bye-bye to my old plastic colander and metal one that sat right on the sink (I never liked that).",

      "text": "This colander is great. It is very well made and sits level on the base. The holes in the base are an absolutely great feature that allows the water to drain from all sides and not build up in the sink, so you can sit it wherever in the sink and it will drain without the water level raising and touching the contained items. The handles are very securely fastened to the bowel. The product has all smooth edges with no sharp items that would catch cheese cloth or other bits of cloth that sit in it. This is a great product at a great price.",
