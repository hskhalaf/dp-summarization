The fact that something seemingly so decadent and rich is actually very good for you is a plus. I put it in my coffee for an extra energy boost. This is the first time I tried the Zen Spirit brand, but it won\u2019t be the last. I had small amount left of my previous brand so compared the flavor. Zen Spirit is noticeably more flavorful and rich. It dissolves well. Everything I\u2019ve read and researched about this company indicates that this pure, well-sourced and carefully processed.",

Cacao seems to have a more \"real\" chocolate flavor which I preferred. The rest of the family's opinion was split. This is a good product that I will buy again.

I was expecting it to be more bitter than it was but I could tolerate it by itself or adding to warm milk and drinking. Overall, put less cacao in the bag so it opens easier and fix the resealable issue and it will be a 5 star product.",

Taste more like an culinary quality blend matcha tea. The best thing is that you aren\u2019t getting any dirt like in other brands. Spend more on ceremonial quality ones and you will be proud of yourself after that kind investment.",

It was also easy to add to my yogurt by sprinkling a teaspoon over top of a vanilla-strawberry blend. Also ideal for baking, I added some to a batch of oatmeal cookie dough for some added health benefits that raw products produce, and some additional taste/sweetness.",

I was very happy to replace my crappy store bought cocoa powder with this and will definitely purchase this brand from now on.",

If I boil it with the milk, it'll taste a little burned, but this is a given with most matcha powders--this one is much less grassy than many others I've tried. The best way I've found to make the lattes is to mix the matcha with a shot of water using a frother first, then add the matcha \"shot\" to very warm (not hot) milk and it's perfect! This matcha powder is the closest I've gotten to replicating Starbucks' Green Tea Lattes and isn't as exorbitantly expensive as some of the ceremonial grade stuff out there so I'm a fan!",

Taste is not great at all; in fact there is no matcha taste. The smell is not very fragrant either. When I mix this, it is very thick for some reason. I boil my water in a kettle, so I don't see the temperature of the water being the problem. I also have cheaper matcha from before, and it's much more frothy. I bought Matcha Wellness' 1.5 oz matcha before I bought this product, and it's way better, but obviously more expensive. TDLR: this matcha is not worth your money.",

The amount of product is sufficient for me for approx 3 weeks. I personally use a little more than the recommended teaspoon per serving, though, so it could last longer for another person depending on their use.
