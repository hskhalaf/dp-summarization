I had my husband tried who weight like 190 and still work just not as fast when my kid play with it. Hope it can set a speed limit but over all it feel very durable and battery least a good amount of time for my kid play in the park, and he is able to carry it himself when he is done as well. It is very small but wider than normal board in case people is interested to know.",

I think this is a good option for kids or women, since the maximum weight is 150 lbs and I am definitely going to trust that number.",

I recommend riding it on flat surfaces because if u go down hill it holds it at that speed and is hard to stop. Also the faster it goes the harder it is to control cause the trucks r loose meanings it's easy to turn so the faster u go the harder it is to keep it straight and in control",

The rainbow back light is really cool, and the beep lets us pedestrians know that there is something about to happen that we should be aware of. As a first dip of the toe into electric skateboards, this was a total win. It was definitely worth the money to extend her range (board can get her to more bus routes, increasing her level of mobility & freedom to explore without begin dependent on others for transportation). It shortened her college commute to about 10 minutes (from 30 min walk).",
