It should stop crevice corrosion if it can penetrate into gaps like that. the cans have no straw type nozzle so I removed one from another product and that worked well to get inside panels and drilled holes.",

If you knock off the old rust with a wire wheel or brush, you only need to spray on this CRC Inhibitor to end up with a professional quality protective coating. My boat trailer looks like it had a makeover. I also used it on my hitch receiver, and it too, looks almost new again. So, if it's rustable or corrodible, covert it with CRC 06026 and stop worrying about the problem. Fare price for what it does, and it's less costly than the other brand.",

Then once a year a light coat and I have exposed metal that has not corroded in the 6 years of use. Do not try a think coat as it puddles and runs. Two light coats and a year maintenance coat is all that is needed.",
