The only place the wire is visible is about 8 or so inches from the steering column to the LCD display. The only improvement I would suggest would be for the wiring diagrams to be printed a little larger, but then I am 84 years old. I did test the unit for operation before attempting to install. It is working as advertised.",

Because installation is A PAIN!!!!!wires are not long enough, wires from the camera to your back up bulb are super bulkyy due to the resistor connections, does not fit to any lights openings/Prius 2010/ you need to drill holes if you have a newer car! I almost returned due to the extremely difficult and time consuming installation good picture Very clear images but I\u2019m very cautious about long term reliability. I do not recommend this camera due to hard installation! Next time I will spent more money but will avoid painful installation!",

Dash mount isn't quite as stout as I would prefer but seems to be holding up well so far. Instructions are easy to follow, and there's plenty of cable for a typical pickup installation. The one thing I would change is mounting the camera on the license plate bracket. I would rather have it higher on the vehicle so it's at a better angle to view the trailer hitch...the only reason I wanted a camera.",

It upgrades our truck to the new ones on the market and I recommend this to anyone without this feature and makes life much safer when backing up with the blind spot covered.",

Tried to stall it dying by adding some silicone at the seams but it\u2019s too damaged. My best advice, take a small amount of flowable silicone to the camera lens/led lights (just around the edges and a SMALL amount) not to cover the camera. Throw some regular silicone where the camera pivots once you know where you want it angled and the seams.",

My advice is that whichever you chose, make sure to tighten the knob that connects to the camera. Otherwise the camera will keep falling off.",

Also the easiest place to mount it would have been on the left of the dash but easy is no fun so I had to drill and cut quite a bit of the webbing behind the dash, but I think the location is more in my line of sight than off to the left.
