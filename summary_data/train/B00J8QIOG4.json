Her daycare only allows closed toed shoes for the summer and these are perfect for that! She says they are comfy and they match most of her outfits. They seem lighter than the newports and dry fast! My only concern upon initial inspection is that Velcro is thinner so I hope it will hold up over the summer like the Newports did. I also feel like the smaller narrow straps allow less rocks and Mulch to get in which we had a problem with in the past. Fingers crossed but we love the design",

Since I wear a kid size 5, I was able to pay half price, and got a pair for my older my daughters too. I actually prefer the Keen kid shoe vs the adult one. My 12 year old daughter who wears the same size as me, also thinks they are the best walking shoe ever. So, thanks!",

My daughter really loves the color of the shoes and can wear them with just about anything. I can't say enough good things about Keen shoes!",
