We have given this to him regularly now for the past two years. To date, he has not had one more UTI. The ingredients are natural, there is no need for constant harsh chemicals to be given, and our dog thrives. This is easy to dose, even for a cat, although we hate to give our cats any medicine, because it is kind of like wrangling slippery alligators. When they are having urinary tract issues, we dissolve the powder in water, put it in a syringe and squirt it in the cat's mouth. Well worth the money.",
