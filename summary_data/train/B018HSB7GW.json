But even the ones that didn't, took almost four days to dry out - and that was laying them out in a single layer in the sun. Anything we had touching other beads - even in a colander - never dried out. We ended up pitching a bunch of them because we weren't sure they'd ever shrink back down, and just having a bunch of buckets of water beads everywhere was getting strange.",

The dried colors are not a good reflection of what the finished product looks like. The beads I thought would be black were actually a pale blue once hydrated, and the deep red became a pale pink.",
