The 4mm thick yoga mat cushions hips, knees, spine, and elbows! \n\nAmazing Grip \nOur cork & rubber mat offers amazing grip during hot yoga. Instead of sliding or slipping, the more you sweat, the better your grip becomes! This is NOT possible with plastic yoga mats, which would need a towel to continue practicing! \n\nBuilt With Eco-Friendly Materials \nWe used responsibly sourced cork and 100% natural rubber, which is sustainable. Since no trees are cut down in this process, buying the premium Repose yoga mat is choosing to be environmentally responsible. \n\nHygienic \nOur naturally antimicrobial cork mat inhibits the growth of germs, mildew, mold, and bacteria which thrive on other cheap foam yoga mats. It also adds an earthly cork scent to your yoga practice. \n\nNon-Toxic \nEvery day we learn about toxic chemicals found in our food, water, personal care, and homes. At Repose, we know that most conventional yoga mats are toxic so we created the perfect yoga mat without glues, PVC's, TPE's or other harmful chemicals. Be inspired to practice regularly knowing that your health is our highest priority! \n\nEasy To Clean \nWe recommend cleaning your mat once a week with light use and after each practice with heavy use, especially after hot yoga.",
