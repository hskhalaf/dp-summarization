I would not recommend to anyone. Initial report: Functions fairly well. It doesn\u2019t seem to get as hot as a normal grill. The brand label on the side was curling up when it arrived. I pushed it back down but stayed only for a day. With the grill set in the highest level, it still takes a lot of time to even cook pancakes. It\u2019s best feature is that it folds up, so it takes less room to store than a regular griddle. Okay for occasional use.",

Sometimes for breakfast I scramble eggs til they are almost done, but still slightly wet. Then put a flour tortilla on the grill, put the scrambled eggs on top with some grated cheese and cooked bacon and then another flour tortilla and then grill for a minute or two. Wonderful!",

      "text": "Simple and terrific. Plates are removable and have gone through the dishwasher without damage, yet. The unit is somewhat flimsy being made of molded sheet metal but should last a few years as long as it's not abused. The grill I received had a misaligned top and bottom so I just \"tweaked\" it to make the two sides fit. Seems to have worked fine. For the price, the removable plates are what makes this a good buy in my book and if it lasts a few years I'll be happy.",

The top plate is heavy, so if you don't want something squished, you have to fashion some sort of shim under the outer handle---so that the upper plate merely touches the top of the bread, rather than presses it. (and yes, I know this is a sandwich press---but some other models have a hinge). Despite the nitpick, I'm still giving this 5 stars. It makes my life so much easier when the family asks, \"what's for dinner?\".",
