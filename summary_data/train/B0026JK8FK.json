After that, it darkens,looses it's viscosity (watery), and magical abilities to fix notchy grindy shifts. But man, with a fresh change, I can practically shift with one finger. For $30 every 15k miles it's easily worth it. Before I was using honda mtf (old formula) and it was pratically useless. Then I started using this and noticed a huge improvement. Haven't tried the new honda mtf formula but highly doubt it works as well. It's a very thin fluid.",

I used it in one Honda for 180k miles without any issues. The gearbox was still shifting smoothly when the car finally died with 235k miles. Unfortunately this fluid was not as smooth in my BMW gearbox. Redline turned out to be better. It just depends on your car. I would still recommend that anyone with a notchy or stiff gearbox start off with Synchromesh as their starting point.",

So i decided to order myself a couple quartz and give it a shot. BOY did this stuff make a diffrence.

My truck calls for this fluid and despite being more expensive than most manual transmission fluids it improves shifting and reduces noise. Instead of pumping this fluid through the small holes in the transmission, I took the shifter off and poured it directly into the top of the transmission until it began flowing out of the upper fill hole. Proved much easier than pumping it out of the bottle.",
