      "title": "Good welding jacket",
      "text": "I needed a jacket to protect me during my welding sessions. I wanted a jacket because it provides more coverage (arms, torso, waist, etc) than just sleeves or a bib. The jacket is well made, heavy duty and seems to be made of high quality materials. The only down side is it is a little on the heavy side when you first put it on but after a while I didn't notice the weight. And it can be warm if used in warm climates (but this can be a good thing in colder climates). Overall I am very satisfied with the jacket.",

It is on the warm side so I don't use it much in the summer but during the winter I keep my shop at about 60deg and it is perfect for that kind of temperature.",

I mig weld and these work good untill they fall apart from washing just like any other chinese garbage we buy. Leather is too hot in the shop I work at , mainly use it for the UV ray protection on my arms. sleeves are hot and fall down. this works good with a t-shirt underneath. keeps the aluminum weld smoke stink off your arms for the most part.",
