The other one started marking in the house once the old dog started goofing up. What a mess! I have ordered these types of diapers before, but I didn't like the strange colors. (Aqu-blue? Orange? Yellow?) I like that these Paw Legend diapers are black on both sides, so you don't have to see the \"yellow\" inside. I usually wash a batch of these twice, which removes the odor. I also use bleach, and they have stay color-fast after at least 50 washings.",

The absorbancy is sufficient for daytime when I can let my dog outside regularly, but I add extra pads for night time and the belly wrap and both extra pads that I insert are totally soaked.

The quality of the garment remains even after several washes, so far do good. I can recommend theses snd would buy them again.",

Update these are my favorite belly bands I at first didn't care for it having two strips on the one side but that makes them even more adjustable, just ordered my second set because I don't care for the others an wanted to have extra so I dont have to wash everyday, I have started washing with dawn in the sink to get the pee smell out before I wash them in the washing machine, if I don't sometimes it still has a pee smell.

We have tried everything over the years and at times just gave up and decided to continuously clean the messes. Until I found these wraps!! Unlike conventional dog diapers, these stay in place and our dog tolerates them. They are very absorbent, strong velcro and cover all the right places. Our pup is 7lbs and 11.5 inches around his waist. We ordered the xs and they fit perfectly! Seriously beyond grateful for these little things!",
