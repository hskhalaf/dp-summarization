I always hear people complaining of their gun not shooting straight but yet they buy the cheapest paint possible and wonder why. Graffiti for me has always beeen my go to paint. It is decently round and sized very consistently. Give it a try and you will see. Just pay a little more for paint and you will have a lot more fun and accuracy. They paint came to me with no broken paintballs(some dimples)",

I did a drop test took and it took about 15-20 drops to break but I did not think much about it because this paint is expensive with good reviews. I went to the field played with it, then I shot my friend a lot, next he said he got about 5 bounces. I was bouncing shots on people all day. Other than that it flew straight, had no breaks in bag or barrel so that is good.",
