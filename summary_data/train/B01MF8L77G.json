I would have to shampoo 2 or 3 times to completely remove the hair product. Now this is where Layrite comes in. Layrite is water soluble so you only have to wash once. And the hold, while not being nearly as strong and Gatsby, suffices quite nicely. One bottle is lasting me the equivalent of two Gatsby containers. Well worth the price and highly recommend!",

It has a good smell (vanilla) but I don't like smelling my pomade all day. It doesn't seem to fade away as the day goes on. For water-based, I'd definitely recommend Layrite Super Hold or Uppercut Deluxe.",
