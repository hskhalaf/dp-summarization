I don't know how long my hair was, I was 4 days out from shaving last. I feel like longer leg hair would sting way more. My skin is pretty sensitive, and this definitely made it mad for a bit.

      "text": "For anyone who remembers the Epil-Lady with that horrible vibrating spring that ripped hair out of your body, don't be afraid of this. It's a whole new device, with a very comfortable way of getting rid of hair. I've used it on several sensitive areas of my body and while it's not unnoticeable, if you hate shaving or get a shaving rash, this might be a good solution for you. I absolutely love it! Because it takes the hair out from the root, you don't have to use it every day, and over time the hair grows back thinner and there is less hair. I'm so glad I found this!",

So I am really happy with my purchase and I recommend it to everybody who is lazy like me ;) Big plus: You can use it on the sofa!!",

I categorize it more as annoying than painful. If you've ever waxed, you won't have a problem. If you're worried or have a low pain tolerance, get some roll-on Aspercreme with 2% lidocaine (not benzocaine, it's not as strong).

I like the light it has but the actual times I tried to epilate, it would miss every single hair and break them off. People here seem to claim that it is much less painful than other epilators but I personally did not notice it. I've used cheaper epilators than this one who have given me much better results. Not my favorite product :l",

This kit comes with several extras - I have only used the epilator so far, and it works pretty great.",
