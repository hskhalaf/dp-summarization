I even washed my 2.5 year olds face with this in the shower and it didn't hurt at all! It's tough on from too. I took out to the beach today (at a lake) and it got her hair nice and clean all the sand off and no more lake water smell. So glad I purchased this!",

    "description": "Puracy Natural Children\u2019s Body Wash is balanced with the right amount of cleaning, moisturizing, and natural fragrance to make bathing a fun finish to the day. Your child will experience plenty of suds, softer skin, and a renewed love for their nighttime ritual. We designed it to be versatile enough to wash every body part. \n\n\n\nPacked in this world-class blend of ingredients is Pink Himalayan Sea Salt, which naturally balances your child\u2019s skin. This thick liquid formula also features Coco Glycinate, an exclusive coconut-based surfactant which produces lot of foam without disrupting the stratum corneum layer of your skin. When you disrupt this layer with a needlessly harsh cleanser, you create irritation, dryness, and redness. Our formula thoroughly cleans yet leaves this crucial layer unfazed. This allows your child\u2019s skin to feel soft, fresh, and moisturized. \n\nDesigned for children to be used as a daily body wash, shower gel, or bubble bath. This clinical-grade formula is safe for those with sensitive skin or skin conditions such as eczema and dermatitis. The sweet, youthful aromas will leave your child smiling throughout their bathing experience. It smells so good, you may even want to use it yourself. The food-grade, plant and mineral-based ingredients were carefully chosen and developed into a premium solution by Puracy, a trusted source for natural and organic, plant-based, child & pet safe, hypoallergenic, and effective household essentials. The proprietary blend of renewable ingredients is family friendly and free from harsh chemicals and fumes. This product is 99.95% Natural, per Puracy\u2019s \u2018What Natural Means to Us\u2019 definition available on our website.",
