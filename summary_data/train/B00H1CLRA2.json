All mine are on supplements but he needed something more and this came well recommended. I've added it to the regimen for two others, as well. I think it's been helping but the reason I only gave 4 stars is that, realistically, measuring out this liquid is haphazard, inefficient and imprecise. There has to be a better way of delivering this product with more accuracy. I think you should either add a marked syringe based on weight or a much smaller pour spout. So much gets wasted trying to get appropriate amounts into a teaspoon for giant dogs and small dogs.",

Prior to starting on TerraMax he was getting gimpy and was unable to jump up on people (which was a good thing but bad sign for his hips). Soon after we began him on TerraMax he was jumping up again and his hip mobility greatly improved. He\u2019s like a 12 year old puppy now! Thanks TerraMax!",

It had gotten to the point of her just not wanting to walk anywhere and her limping just broke my heart. I've had her on fish oil for a long time, but it just wasn't helping. After reading the reviews here I decided to give this product a try. At almost the 4 week mark I'm starting to see a bit of difference as her limp does look a little less severe. I look forward to the coming weeks as I watch her improve.",
