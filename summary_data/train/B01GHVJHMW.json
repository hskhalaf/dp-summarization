I was extremely skeptical at first but now I couldn't be happier! When trying to put 2 carseat in, it's a little tricky to figure out at first but the small cup holder for the second seat closest to who ever is pushing, comes apart to fit the carseat on and that's how it clicks in.

The other con is that it's really long...so, if you don't have a big trunk, the stroller probably won't fit. We have a Yukon, so it fits just right, but literally butts up to each end.

I wasn\u2019t able to find anything I like better cheaper. It will be great for my 2 year old and infant. The infant car seat fits nicely. My one complaint is the basket doesn\u2019t drop down like most strollers so you can\u2019t use the basket while using the bassinet or car seat in the back.",

A few minor complaints: the rear canopy isn't vented and becomes a sail in the wind, really increasing the force needed to push the stroller. I can't figure out how to get it to latch folded up. The seats do not have adjustable recline, so your infant needs good body control to be able to sit in it. I would definitely buy it again.",
