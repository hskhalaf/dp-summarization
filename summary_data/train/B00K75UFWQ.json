If you want to store a car I suppose it would be much more usable because the ties wouldn't be used a lot and it would just sit there.",

I recently removed the cover and noticed it seemed to crumble in my hand. After I laid it on the ground I noticed there were several spots that were now a see-through mesh offering no protection. Also, there was a gray film of dust left on the car and several spots were the paint as lightened like someone dribbled paint thinner on the paint. I am not happy and do not recommend this cover, especially not for a classic car.",

The fabric is nice, doesn't scratch, but it's not really waterproof. It will withstand water for awhile, but I guess it's no match for the rain of the Pacific Northwest. The water now wicks through the fabric, and it's been on my car for around 2 months. It rains a lot here, so I'm not that surprised. Would probably be OK in other areas with less rain. Guess I'm looking for a tarp now!",

I made the wrong choice and wasted $50 on my cover, Do your homework and pay a bit more for a real outdoor cover. You can see in my pics that there is no pull or strain on the material as I bought a longer length. I don't understand how this cover got so many decent reviews if it can't last over 3 weeks without falling apart!",
