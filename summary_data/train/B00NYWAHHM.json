App originally required you to register an account, but they backed off after a lot of complaints. At this point I thought I'd give them a try. The app then requested permissions it doesn't need, (most notably your location), but you could just deny the permission and the app would still run. Then they updated the app. Now it won't run unless you grant permission, and it automatically opts you into sharing all of your usage data. So they are basically holding your device hostage until you give them permission to track your location. This should be illegal.",

Don't be fooled. You are buying the cheapest thermal camera on the market and getting the cheapest thermal camera on the market. I wouldn't have rated it so low but the product description and the way someone got away with listing reviews for a different product is super shady. The camera is zoomed in more than the phone camera too. So you can't compare.",

Fortunately, the image is actually stored in Photos properly so it's a super annoying bug but not a killer one. The main reason I'm disappointed with this is that the imager doesn't read values below 20C. See the photo of the insides of my freezer attached. It should be reading -5C (23F) but it says instead, 20C (68F).",

      "text": "I would have used this for my HVAC business, but this is the worst thermal imager that I have ever had. It is 2018 and usb-c is not an option. I tried 5 different brands of adaptors and this picture of my dog 3 feet from me is the best that i have been able to take. Somewhere it should state that it does not work with usb-c adapters. My Flir 1 works well with the adapters and now they offer a usb-c option. DO NOT ORDER IF YOUR PHONE IS USB-C.",

It took an exchange and a month of searching to finally find out that the Seek could NEVER be used on my phone and I was wasting my time. I'm taking the stars because they wasted my time for nothing.",

It also works with both of my tablets, a Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5, and an older Walmart RCA Pro12 tablet. The RCA requires a reversing adapter for the USB port, the Samsung did not. I am very happy with the camera. The lower cost, and wider thermal range than the FLIR unit make it hard to beat.",

I was looking at the Cat S60, but I prefer modularity in all cases. If enough people show interest in this tech it will advance. As soon as one is 4x more resolution and 2x FPS for the same price, I will upgrade. That should be about a year or two.",
