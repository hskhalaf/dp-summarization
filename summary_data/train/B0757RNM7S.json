This might last my kids a couple of years max. I hope at least. And putting this son of a gun together, let me tell you the directions are nearly useless. The way the parts are packaged and labeled (or not in most cases) was maddening. It was a guess game at best. Took 3 sober, 2 buzzed and 1 intoxicated adults about 4 hours to assemble, another 2 hours to unassemble the parts put together wrong and another hour to get it together completely. Have fun!",
