Only downside is that it eats up battery charge fast. Canon batteries are very expensive. I tried using the generic ones but they do not last long except STK batteries. Those are awesome and lasts for a very long time. It probably lasts longer than the original Canon batteries. If you buy those batteries then you got the perfect compact point and shoot.",

      "text": "Several excellent comprehensive reviews have already been posted on the S100. I did want to point out one shortcoming: in video mode, the sound of the lens autofocusing is recorded. You will hear the rapid fire clicking noise of the auto focus motor several times per second upon playback during quiet scenes. The sound is subtle but noticeable during quiet scenes. The sound is not noticeable while people are talking, or music is playing, or there is background noise. Whether or not you can live with the autofocus motor noise is strictly a matter of personal preference. It is not a deal killer for what is otherwise a very nifty little camera.",

The noise from the zooming mechanism is not a problem in a concert setting. Even with Power IS turned off, the camera shake is acceptable and actually gives YouTube very good clues for its 3-D conversion. I am very happy with the results  I am particularly impressed by the reproduction of the subtle depth of the performer's facial features in the YouTube 3-D HD mode.

Picture quality is close to the Nikon 700, but it is portable enough to take everywhere. I would also recommend the 'Eynpire Camera Leather Case For Canon S100'.

The image quality is good, but not great. But my main gripe is the lack of Speed,in Auto focus and the shutter lag. I miss too many shots because of the shutter lag, especially if you use flash. The AF speed is also quite slow. In this aspect it can't even beat the cell phone cameras. I am disappointed with this camera.",

I will keep this short, since so many have posted better than I ever will, with specs, comparisons, etc. All I can say is this -- I have owed about eight Canon cameras, both digital Elphs and semi-pro S cameras. This is the best. Best digital I've owned. Fits in a pocket, great lenses, can go manual, takes great shots. That is all. I think I will buy one more.",

I had to get a 32GB SD card because the one I had (1GB) was getting filled up pretty fast with the HD video. The microphone for the video is very good. The picture view has on-screen histograms - RGB and luminosity! The battery lasts a long time and the wall-unit recharger is much more convenient than AA batteries all the time. The manual is very comprehensive. I haven't noticed the GPS working yet, but maybe that's because it doesn't locate inside buildings? I'm pleased with the purchase and would buy again and have recommended to friends already!",

Picture quality is far superior and achieves the low light quality that the gift receiver was looking for. Battery life is not terribly great but that is to be expected especially with the large display screen. A second battery is highly recommended. However, I noticed that Canon did change the battery on this camera, so using batteries from previous models might not be an option (i.e. I personally own the original S90 and the battery from that model is different).",

Having the photos geo-tagged is really convenient, and its fun making slow-motion videos. 1080p HD videos can be memory hungry (a 7min video used 900MB).

With this camera, it is best to stick with snap shots and landscapes, leaving the action shots for your SLR. I have not yet utilized its motion picture capabilites as I consider it primarily my pocket still camera. I have had lots of fun playing with my S100 now for almost two months and carry it everywhere.",

    "title": "Canon PowerShot S100 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Silver)",
    "description": "Color:Silver| Product Packaging:Standard PackagingPowerShot FS100 Digital Camera (Silver) What's in the Box: PowerShot S100 Body, Battery Pack NB-5L, Battery Charger CB-2LX, Wrist Strap WS-DC11, USB Interface Cable IFC-400PCU, Digital Camera Solution CD-ROM\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n ELPH S100 Sleek and Serious\n\nThe PowerShot S100 is a sophisticated pocket-friendly point-and-shoot digital camera that has the power advanced users and enthusiasts need to create standout images. As with other PowerShot cameras, the compact PowerShot S100 incorporates all of the advanced Canon technologies that make capturing superb photos and video as easy as pressing a button. As automatic or manual as you need it to be, the PowerShot S100 is a serious photographic tool, which incorporates the Canon HS SYSTEM, now featuring the new DIGIC 5 Image Processor. The fast f/2.0 lens helps you tackle unfavorable lighting and capture breathtaking portraits with beautiful, shallow depth-of-field. 12.1 Megapixels ensure crisp, richly detailed images, and a 5x Optical Zoom provides an excellent all-around range to shoot near or far. \n\n\nExperience the Power \n\nCanon DIGIC 5 Image Processor\n\n\n\nThe latest-generation Canon DIGIC 5 Image Processor brings phenomenal increases in processing speed and power. Improved chip architecture and algorithms deliver greatly expanded functionality with further refinement in image quality. \nImproved noise reduction produces clearer images when shooting in low light at high ISO speeds. Enhanced i-Contrast performance adjusts differences between light and dark areas to achieve even more natural-looking results. \nThe faster processing speed also results in faster continuous shooting capability while maintaining full image quality. The DIGIC 5 Image Processor also makes possible a new, highly advanced automatic white balance system. Whereas conventional white balance makes an overall adjustment based on a single type of light source, the new Canon Multi-Area White Balance analyzes several areas of the image to determine whether different adjustments are needed, for example, for the main subject and the background. \nNoise Reduction\nConventional Image Processor\nWhite Balance\nWith DIGIC 5 Image Processor\n\n\nCanon CMOS Sensor\n\nThe PowerShot S100 digital camera employs a new Canon 12.1 Megapixel CMOS sensor. Inheriting much of the advanced technology developed for Canon EOS DSLR cameras, this sensor delivers state-of-the-art imaging performance and is optimized for use in compact cameras, such as the PowerShot S100. Utilizing a sophisticated light-capturing design, it provides high sensitivity for improved high ISO capture without increased noise. It is also a high-speed design, capable of rapidly capturing and moving image data to the processor, enabling faster continuous shooting and faster autofocus.\n\n\nCanon HS SYSTEM\n\n The Canon HS SYSTEM lets you take bright, clear photos in an even wider range of shooting situations. Beautiful low-light shots are possible with minimal noise and maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas. The system is the result of two technologies brought together in PowerShot cameras: a high-sensitivity imaging sensor, which is able to capture more light; and the DIGIC Image Processor, which actively reduces noise with high-speed image processing. The 12.1 Megapixel Canon CMOS sensor in the PowerShot S100 incorporates advanced light reception technology that enhances sensitivity. The new DIGIC 5 Image Processor provides a major boost in noise reduction, expanding the usable ISO range to an amazing high of ISO 6400. The Canon HS SYSTEM thus lets you use higher shutter speeds to capture clearer images with reduced noise and blur.\n\n\n\nMemorable Moments in Spectacular FULL HD\n In addition to the Canon HS SYSTEM, the combination of the advanced CMOS sensor and DIGIC 5 Image Processor in the PowerShot S100 makes it possible to shoot crisp, clear high definition video. Imagine the fun and excitement of being able to shoot spectacular 1080p Full HD video with stereo sound that you can later watch on your HDTV or download to your computer to share with family and friends. In addition to being able to shoot Full HD 1080p video at 24* frames per second, the PowerShot S100 can also shoot 720p HD video at 30** frames per second.\n\n\n \n\nHDTV Playback via HDMI with CEC Support \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n It's easy to enjoy and share the videos you shoot with the PowerShot S100. Simply connect its HDMI terminal to your HDTV using an HDMI cable. And because the PowerShot S100 supports HDMI-CEC technology, you\u00edll be able to control the playback of your images and videos on any CEC-enabled HDTV using the TV\u00eds remote control. (CEC \u00f1 Consumer Electronic Control \u00f1 is part of the HDMI specification, enabling components in a system to communicate with one another.)\n\n\n\niFrame Movie Support \n\n\n \n\n \n\nIt\u2019s easy to enjoy and share the videos you shoot with the PowerShot S100. Simply connect its HDMI terminal to your HDTV using an HDMI cable (included). And because the PowerShot S100 supports HDMI-CEC technology, you\u2019ll be able to control the playback of your images and videos on any CEC-enabled HDTV using the TV\u2019s remote control. (CEC \u2013 Consumer Electronic Control \u2013 is part of the HDMI specification, enabling components in a system to communicate with one another.)\n\n\n\nExperience the Power\n\n\nFull range of Shooting and Recording Modes Including RAW + JPEG\n\n\nThe PowerShot S100 lets you shoot in RAW mode, which captures images that are uncompressed and essentially unprocessed by the camera. Often the choice of advanced photographers, RAW images can be processed in your computer using Canon DPP (Digital Photo Professional) or other compatible third-party software. Creative control is completely in your hands as you adjust a wide range of variables to produce exactly the final image you want. The camera can also be set to allow the simultaneous recording of both RAW and JPEG images while shooting.\n\n \n\nControl Ring \n\nFocus, Exposure, ISO, Step Zoom, or White Balance can now be adjusted more quickly and conveniently with the PowerShot S100\u2019s control ring. Located at the base of the lens barrel, the ring is more intuitive than other types of controls for many experienced photographers. The functions that can be assigned to the control ring vary with shooting mode, and you can set your preferences quickly using the dedicated ring function selector button.\n\nGPS Technology \n The PowerShot S100 digital camera is equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS)* technology. Now you can travel the world and let the camera automatically record the locations and local times of your stills and videos. The camera can also use the GPS unit to automatically set the exact time. You can maximize the usefulness of the GPS feature by using the special bundled Map Utility software that makes it fun to share the memories of your world adventures. In addition to displaying all your photos\u2019 locations on a world map, the camera\u2019s GPS system can also track your route from photo to photo \u2013 a great way to visualize each trip! You can also create and share custom maps and personal mini-travel guides with friends and family members.\n\n\n\nA Steady Image is a Beautiful Image\n\nIntelligent IS\n\nThe latest advance in Canon Optical Image Stabilization technology, Intelligent IS analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation. For stills, the system automatically selects among Normal, Panning, Macro (Hybrid) and Tripod IS modes. When shooting video, the system automatically selects among Dynamic, Powered, Macro and Tripod IS modes. With Intelligent IS, you can concentrate on image capture, letting the camera make the most effective IS settings to assure the steadiest possible image.\nNormal\nCorrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills. Panning\nPanning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement. Hybrid\nCorrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting. Dynamic\nEffective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking. Powered\nCompensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified. Tripod\nWhen tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed. \nShooting Modes/Special Scene Modes\nCustom Define and store your own settings to achieve the effects you prefer.\nManual\nYou have complete control of exposure, selecting both aperture and shutter speed manually.\nAperture-Priority\nYou set the aperture, controlling depth-of-field. The camera automatically selects the shutter speed. Shutter-Priority You select the shutter speed to stop or blur action, and the camera finds the appropriate aperture. With slow exposure times, Canon's noise reduction system activates to ensure low image noise.\nProgram Access advanced exposure compensation features while shooting mostly automatically.\nSmart AUTO\nThe camera automatically selects the best shooting settings for optimal quality based on subjects and environmental factors to provide point-and-shoot simplicity.\nMovie Digest Records a video clip before capturing a still image and then combines one day\u2019s worth of clips into a video. Portrait The camera sets a large aperture, focusing the subject and artistically blurring the background to make your subject \u201cpop.\u201d Kids & Pets Reduced focusing time freezes fast-moving subjects, so you won't miss those special shots. Landscape\nIncreases depth-of-field for sharp and sweeping landscape shots.\nSmart Shutter The camera automatically takes the photo when people smile, wink, or get into frame. High-Speed Burst HQ Capture fast-action shots at full sensor resolution, by shooting continuously when the shutter button is held down.\nHandheld Night Scene Take clear and steady pictures at night without the use of a tripod.\nBeach Beach Get clear shots of people at a sunny beach without darkened faces.
