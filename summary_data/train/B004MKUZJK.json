Sometimes the balls don\u2019t pop right but it adds to the batters skills to take one inside or reach over the plate.

      "text": "I've had it for about a month. It's already cracked in one spot, been using it with tennis balls. Hit it with a tennis ball and the slide where the balls fit in broke in about 3 pieces. It will not launch regular baseballs correctly. The maximum height baseballs will get is about 1.5 ft. Where as tennis balls will reach about 4.5 feet. I think the reason baseballs won't work is because when it launches it hits a plastic part.",
