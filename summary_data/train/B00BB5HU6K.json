      "text": "This projector is amazing. I also ordered a separate HDMI cable for $11 and was able to connect this projector to my iPad. I laid in bed, turned the lights off and projected Facebook on my white walls. The projector has a built in speaker but to enhance the sound I just turned on my Bose Bluetooth speaker and it felt like I was in a movie theater. I will be using this to teach my college course because the classroom they assigned me to does not have a projector. I am so excited. You must charge the projector first before turning it on. It runs for three hours once fully charged.",

The picture is fine. If you are using it for a presentation you might need to focus it a couple of times. I had three presentations with it. The audio quality is good and I was satisfied with the picture.",

      "text": "I bought this projector for my dorm mates in college. A few times a week we connect the included HDMI cable to my Macbook, bluetooth stream the sound to my Big Jambox, and project movies onto our wall for some of the best nights of the year. The projector is extremely small, quiet, and doesn't overheat. We usually project in a dark room, so the lighting has been perfect. I don't have anything negative to say, I just wonder how long the lightbulb will last us. I really recommend this projector!",

The room must also be dark the lumens are not quite poweful enough to project crisp and clear in a well lit room. The focus action is not that great either. I do a lot of traveling and present materials to potential customers. This enablesme to get the job done but I am not overly satisfied. I expected a lot more out of the product.",
