Polyester ties are fine if that's what you want but if you're looking for silk, I recommend you try another brand.",

It makes me wonder why they even have that in the title, when they are nice ties at a decent price, with some obvious effort to put together a good looking package. Why lie and say they are silk? I like the ties, but have to give one star for blatant unnecessary lies in their marketing.",
