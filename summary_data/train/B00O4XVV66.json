It is possible to pull off the whisk by just holding the shaft part though. Edit: as commented below by Jamesbo, you can eject the whisks by pushing down the speed control.

The mixer has been with me for three years and it is still working (even though I drop it). It's a nice product so don't miss it! The only downside is that it doesn't look very refined and there is no eject button. So every time you need to remove and clean the accessories, you will definitely get your hands dirty.",
