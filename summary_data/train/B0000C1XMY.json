I could\u2018ve just as easily gone to the Home Cheapo and bought a Chinese rake for less $. When I unpacked the rake, I found the rake end to be covered in oil and aluminum shavings from when it was stamped. Also, due to the sloppy stamp job, razor sharp jagged edges are on almost all of the teeth. I am disgusted with what I\u2019ve spent my money on. I will not be buying any more products from this manufacturer, nor will I recommend their products to anyone. I hope this review makes it to them. Utterly disappointed.",

I alternated between pulling and pushing, and after four hours of work, I'd leveled out the gravel and started receiving compliments from the neighbor!",
