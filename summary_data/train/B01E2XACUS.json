The parts hook in with a hook and eye type button, but it isn't very secure and the balls fall out from in between the sections. I think a zipper would be a better solution to keep it together. 2. You can't seal off the ball pit without unhooking it from the tube. Other than that, my daughter loves it and it's really great! The ball pit is big enough for an adult to play in it with their kids.

Another thing to keep in mind is that there are two straps to secure each part of the tunnel to the tent and ball pit but that is not enough to keep the balls inside. My main concern is that the straps will break eventually. There could be an option for more colors as well!",

It would be nice if there was a zipper or something for sturdy to connect the pieces together instead of just strings.",

The sections are held together with ties so I wish it was a little more secure, but it has not been a problem thus far.",
