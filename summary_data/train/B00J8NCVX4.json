Devices constantly drop and there is never any reliability as to what will be connected at any given time. We may be able to access our thermostat for example, but cameras are out. Or it may be ENTIRELY unable to connect to the TV while the computer has full signal. This results in nonstop resets, unplugging, reconnecting devices, etc. All wifi devices and our modem are entirely stable and tested, so its the router that is the broken link in the chain. Definitely wouldn't buy another D-Link after this experience.",

I only found 1 issue which I don't really consider and issue is the fact that bridge mode doesn't support both 2.4 ghz and 5. Or it may but it removes the option of creating an ssid/password for each. You can only have one ssid at that point. It didn't impact what I wanted to do with it so 5 stars it gets.",

      "text": "This router is absolutely amazing. after switching to it the Internet connection got more stable, faster and reliable. Seriously, before I got the router my Internet connection dropped at least once a day. since the upgrade I can't recall the Internet connection dropping. I have few problems with it though. Pros: - good range - wicked fast wifi - stable connection Cons: - last firmware update was almost 2 years ago - range isn't as good as people commented here(maybe it's the location, will update) - control panel isn't that good, I saw better ones",
