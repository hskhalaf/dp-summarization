Once the plumber diagnosed this problem I now put a small cut in the bag and let the product in the toilet bowl and I throw the plastic away.

I found best result is achieved by letting the product stay in the pipeline for a while (say, overnight) without flushing it out from the pipeline completely (for example, one flush for toilet and about 1 gallon of water in kitchen sink). Hardened grease is the main cause of plugged kitchen sink and this product works well with grease. Seems environmentally friendlier than chemical treatment (e.g., chlorine and other chemicals). A pack of 6 is enough for all toilets and sinks in a typical household. If there is plug caused by hair in the drain, strong chemicals still work better.",

Within a day and a half, the smell was virtually gone, and by the day after that, completely gone. Fantastic! It saved me calls to the septic company and potentially a couple hundred dollars for a visit.",
