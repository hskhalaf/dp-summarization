If you get this go straight to nvidias web site and manually download the gforce experience app and li t takes care of the rest. I have only had this card for 4 days but so far so good!

The only negative about this card is that there is minor coil whine when under heavy load. But, gaming with headphones makes this a non-issue for me. \u2022 The Division 2 - 80+ FPS (Custom) \u2022 Forza Horizon 4 - 90+ FPS (Ultra) \u2022 Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice - 70+ FPS (Ultra)",
