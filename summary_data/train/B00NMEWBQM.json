      "text": "I purchased these Duck Covers 'Ultimate' Covers to protect my new Better Homes and Garden Patio furniture (Hawthorne Park 4pc Sofa Conversation Set). The covers fit the furniture extremely well, and should protect the chairs and sofa from our strong Florida sun, rainy summers and the nasty pollen we get in the early spring. The covers are very easy to put on and remove. The sofa bench is perfect for storing the covers while we use the furniture. For reference, here are the dimensions for my furniture in the event you have similar sized furniture. 3-Person Sofa: 35.21in.D x 80in.W x 32in.H Chair: 5.21in.D x 32in.W x 32in.H I hope you found the review helpful in making your purchase decision.",

Quality of materials is excellent, as it tailoring and fit is spot on. I actually bought two of these for a sectional unit - my wife was impressed with them as well. You really cannot go wrong with the product just makes sure it works for the specs on the piece you want to cover.",

The material is heavy duty and the water just beads up and rolls off. The color is true to the picture and looks really good. I do think it will fade in time but I'm not terribly concerned with that......my primary concern was to keep the furniture dry. Everything will fade eventually from the sun. The size also was as indicated. I have a three cushion sofa which it covers properly and I also lay the chase lounge cushion on the sofa before covering it up at night so it does double duty......the sofa and the chase.",

First test of the quality was high winds. The cover was flapping around a bit, and when I checked on it, I noticed the straps were not secured. Put them in place and the cover stopped moving in the wind. 2nd test - moderate downpour. I did not get the air pillows, so was worried about sitting water soaking through. Went outside and shook the cover a little. The rain that had collected on it literally went flying! Very happy with this purchase.",

Not worth returning and reordering the proper size ...",

Fingers crossed it holds-up over a snowy, icy winter. Update: i have had this cover a little less than 2-years. I discovered an 18 inch strip that was starting to disintegrate, and realized I was still within the 2-year warranty. I emailed Duck Covers a photo, and within minutes they replied that they were sending me a replacement. I stand by the 5-stars knowing they stand behind their product.",

The covers stay on and keep our cushions dry in any weather up to and including a small hurricane (no kidding). The brown does fade a little in the hot South Carolina sun but no big deal. Straps with plastic clips at each corner do a good job holding the cover on but we usually don't use them. Once you figure it out, they fold easily for storage. I highly recommend these covers if you want to protect your outdoor furniture. Well worth the money.",
