Even after charging the unit for a few hours with a wall plug, nothing happens when I switch it on; no lights - nothing! it only works when connected to a power source via the USB cable. However, I couldn't even enjoy it wired (as awkward and uncomfortable as that might be) because the Micro USB jack plugs in the worst place possible - under the nose pad! Sadly, I didn't get a chance to try them out for the first time until I was quite past the return window, so now I'm stuck with a useless piece of plastic. Thanks a lot, Panasonic! Nice going!",

They work great and I like them a bit better than the ones that come with the TV, because they have an actual on/off switch on the bridge of the nose. The glasses that come with the TV just have a button that lights up when you turn them on, but then goes off so just looking at them you can't tell if they are on or off. I did buy the 3Active twin storage case and I recommend getting some sort of case for them. The 3Active case is hard cardboard so if you have children or other distructive force in the house I would recommend something sturdier.",

The battery cover on most of my original Samsung SSG-3100GB glasses broke a while back- forcing me to use scotch tape to hold the battery cover on while wearing them. These Panasonic glasses are rechargeable- so no more fussing with battery replacement at all. Best of all, they are now bargain priced comparably with the non-rechargeable Samsung glasses.

Also, the ear pieces on the Samsung do not fold as they do on the Panasonic, so they are harder to store. The Panasonic glasses are also rechargeable (as opposed to a replaceable coin battery in the Sammy's) which is nice, and the Panasonics also block more light coming in from the side which reduces glare and wash out when watching in a room that's not very dark.",

The only nice part is that they have slightly lighter tint glass in them, so the picture looks a little brighter. Unfortunetly another down side is that the rechargable batteries require charging maintenance while the orginals only require a DIY battery change every few years. Also their is no way to replace the rechargabe battery, the units are meant to be disposed of when the battery fails.",

They weren't as comfortable until I removed a small nose piece that comes pre-installed. It was easy to remove using a tiny screwdriver. I ordered two pairs and my wife uses a pair with the nose piece intact (she doesn't wear glasses) and also finds them quite comfortable. When I say they are comfortable, I wouldn't recommend wearing these out of the house for fun, but they certainly don't bother me while watching a movie. Recommended!",

Given what the 3D TV's cost I would have expected Panasonic to make a better quality set of glasses.

As with all 3D glasses, viewing 3D results in some loss of brightness, which you forget about after a few seconds of viewing. Fully charging the battery with the supplied USB cable, they last an incredibly long time before being run down. And if you do run the battery down fully, charging for only 1-2 minutes will get you through one or two movies! Impressive.",

However, there is so much space around the periphery of ones eye that it makes it difficult to focus on what is happening through the glasses. Making it nearly impossible to become immersed in the 3D experience, which is the point, is it not? Furthermore, the frames of the glasses are not exactly comfortable and need constant adjustment throughout the film. Overall, they are not worth buying unless you are fascinated or involved with 3D. The technology and its logistics still require greater development.",

The glasses are expensive, so we have only 2 pair--therefore could not show a 3D movie to family/friends.
