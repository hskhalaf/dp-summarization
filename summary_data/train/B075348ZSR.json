I've been impressed by the cases from Caseology. They're stylish and fun but also offer a higher level of safety while not being a huge, bulky waterproof box. Not surprisingly, I love this case. It's pretty. It's sleek and yet it offers some protections against life's bumps and bruises. It is textured but still slides easily into my pocket. I will probably always use Caseology cases for my phones.",

The pseudo-metal looking part is just beautiful. I would venture to say it's more beautiful in person than the pictures. The case does have a slight texture to it (the ripples in the picture) and that has not affected my pop socket from sticking at all. I was worried about that, and it turned out to be a non-issue.",

I really need a Pop Socket for my 8 Plus because my right hand isn't big enough to reach across the screen when holding it normally. I've only had this case for two days now, and I'm considering returning it to get a new case that is Pop Socket-compatible or engineering a solution to get it to stick (which may involve some duct tape).",

It fits the phone snuggly, and provides a smooth surface that gives a bit more holding friction that the polished metal of the phone, which always feels slick. I like that the case has small built in buttons that cover the iPhone's buttons and which function very well unlike some cases where the case just extends over the buttons with little bumpouts that make it harder to press the phone's buttons.",

Prior to this one, I had an aqua wavelength series one on my iPhone for 1.5 years - it was dropped quite a few times and still held up. I decided to try a different style and tried this parallax series, thinking maybe it would be easier to keep clean (that was the only downside to the wavelength series) I\u2019ve had this phone case on for just over a month and the gold finish is peeling off. It hasn\u2019t been dropped or anything, it literally just looks like it\u2019s bubbling up in spots and peeling off - I never had this issue with my other case. Highly disappointed!!",

The referred-to help shows a box-template which does not come with the case. That would've been much easier, I believe, than the tabs that did come with the case.
