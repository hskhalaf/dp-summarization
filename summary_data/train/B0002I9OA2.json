It even seemed to lighten up the stains. I was so relieved because I thought I was going to have to pull up those floors and have them replaced and I simply just did not have that in my budget. Thank you Simple Solution. :)",

They eat quality catfood and both have a separate diet so it was not the food. Sadly, one of the cat has developed cancerous tumors and will be put to sleep today. I am sure this spray contributed to this - they are entirely indoor cats and the other 2 cats that go outdoors/indoors are absolutely fine.",

They were in the care of someone who dropped in once a day to be sure they were fed and litter boxes cleaned. Apparently, they considered they had been abandoned. To convey her feelings on the matter, one of them decided the most efficient means was to pee on the carpet just outside the litter box. The odor was quite strong. A deep spray of this odor and stain remover really knocked out the odor. I did not try to remove the stain, because the carpet is due for a regular deep cleaning, anyway, and will leave the stain removal for that deep cleaning.",

The directions are clear, the scent is pleasant, and more importantly -- it works. After letting it soak (per the directions) and running through our normal wash cycle, there were no stains and no scent on the bedding. I also appreciate that it can work with a carpet cleaner for larger areas -- which I'm sure we will do at some point as well.",

Those that haven't were because I didn't saturate the area enough. Get a towel, put it over the area and with the heel of your foot grind on it a bit moving the towel to use dry areas of the towel - it's that simple.",

I went ahead and bought the gallon anyways since it's much cheaper than buying the smaller spray bottles every time. I am quite pleased with the SS Extreme's scent which smells like baby powder.
