I'm impressed with the quality, it's an very sturdy product. I think a second one would look amazing paired on either side of the DJ booth. I may have to get another!",

The buttons felt very cheap and the whole number display area was all weird....at least on my light. The rotation is great on this light but the beam is very small and it projects a square with the four different colors. It was just not what I was looking for or expected.",

There's very limited usefulness with this because you cannot color-mix the RGB lights.... each component: RGBW is diffused into a different spot, so basically you have 4 colors you can project into a tiny pin spot area. It will work well for a mirrored ball but not much else.",

The light is basic - but basic is not bad. You do not have the ability to change the focus, however since this light would likely be used for ambiance instead of for spotlighting, I do not see that being an issue. I would recommend using this with an atmospheric solution to provide the best contrast. The colors do not mix to make a dmx mixture, yet give you RBGW. None of these things are bad, just make sure that you are ordering what you are looking for!",
