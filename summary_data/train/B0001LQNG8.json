You can fit one egg in each cup and they are the exact size of an English muffin. I sprayed the pan with a little canola cooking spray even though it's non stick. The eggs did not stick even a tiny little bit! You can see the picture I included to see how clean the pan came out! I absolutely love this pan!!!!",
