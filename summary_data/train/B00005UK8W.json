      "text": "The device does a great job of capturing the video. The key is to learn the different formats and understanding how best to work with the included software. The software is fairly easy to use, but if you don't pay attention you get lower quality output. The trick is to capture in DVD format ONLY; and adjust some of the quality settings to greater quality. It increases the size of the capture file, but the final product is great. If writing to Video CD, again, capture in DVD format. Since the software to write the CD is separate from the capture software, the write software converts it again on the fly; quality drops, but starting from DVD quality is key.",

If you don't have a DVD drive, then you can order the content on CDs. When the URL for ordering the CDs turned out to be dead, I tried to contact customer support. Alas, you can't email them and can't call them on the phone. If your question isn't in their Q&A list, then don't expect and answer. This product is going back to the store.",

The only drawback I have found it does not capture in anything larger than 350 by 288. So if you expect this product to render quality DVD's it does not. The software included has some drawbacks but I have used the text animator, capturing though, there are other products out there such as Virtual Dub or Unlead Movie Studio that are free or work better.",

Standard RCA cables do not fit into them, and only with force can you get them to rest delicately on the connectors, and they will function so long as you do not tug on or move them in any way. It was more than I could handle, and I decided to return it to get something a little less stylish and a little more functional, which is my suggestion to future buyers.",

The picture quality sucked (on the rare times it captured the full scene). I would highly recommend buying yourself firewire and using it to capture video from you DV camcorder, since they both cost about the same. Maybe if you were using this with an analog source, the capture would be smoother, but not for the digital stuff. This product seems too good to be true....because it is.",

I personally use a standard HI-FI VCR to capture the video, you can also capture video from camcorders, Laserdiscs and the TV. It's well worth its inexpensive cost.",
