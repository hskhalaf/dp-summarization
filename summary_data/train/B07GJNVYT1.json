Just add your own polish and creativity! Love it!! No instructions (some of the decals need water to pull them off the paper - watch the video on the site - easy to do!) but TONS of stuff for the price.",

The tools seem very high quality as do the decorations but the reason I didn't give full 5 stars, is that it didn't come with any guide to use or instructions. I have never used products like these before so I'm learning slowly via YouTube, which is fine, but I would rather read directions and get started right away. Besides that, great nail kit!",

The implements are very nice quality. The best part in my opinion are the boxes of jewels. They're fully packed and sparkle beautifully. Each container has an extensive assortment of caviar beads, metal bits and bright sparkling pointy back crystals with the right mix to be able to match your accent nails on each hand. Overall this set is an EXCELLENT value for the money.",

Brushes are good quality and love the tip guides. The only reason I give it 3 stars is because the stripping tape is hard to use without one of those handy dispensers thingys. And the biggest let down was most of the gems aren't flat back. Though pretty, trying to attach it to a nail with regular polish is impossible! (Unless you want to use half a tube of glue)",

The scissors are perfect for cutting the stickers for placement, but also the right size for trimming and applying wraps to correct a broken nail.

So just be aware that you might get random stencils not pictured here. I like the decals, but also note that they are often just one alone without a matching decal so your finger decals will not be perfectly symmetrical. The brushes have worked well so far and seem good quality (although I really am no expert on this matter). The scissors and the tweezers are both very nice.",
