Talkie has a sloth-like speed when it toggles through its functions through its voice. The send message button needs to be a lot faster in real-time instead of saying \u201cthis button is to send message\u201d; it also needs to stop repeating the user\u2019s message each time, which becomes too repetitive and drags the interaction experience. The buttons are not easy to press in the plush toy for my four year old he ends up not enjoying the experience as the actuation haptics is flawed.",

I love that I get a message every time he plays with it. This reminds me to send him a quick message and ensures he is always getting Toymail. I had no trouble setting it up and my son is able to send and receive massages independently.",
