      "text": "Cute for 1 month. We received them mid-October. It's end of November. My daughter's wore them probably 15-20 times and they're 100% BROKEN. I'm so mad and wish I could return them. They were adorable until the entire sole fell off. My daughter is 8 and plays pretty hard. The shoe fit perfectly and she loved the style and comfort of them, but they didn't hold up to a busy bee child. I think boots like these should be able to be worn more than a month without breaking. I don't normally provide bad reviews, but I'll be looking for another brand when I buy my daughters boots from now on. :(",
