He\u2019s not your every day drinker, when he does have a glass he doesn\u2019t want it watered down. Whiskey is hardly ever cold, ice takes away the flavor and waters it down. He uses 4-6 of them depending how quickly he wants it to get chilled, they work quite quickly that way. I would recommend this product, anyone that appreciates the full flavor of a nice glass or shot of whiskey, these are perfect. The glasses that come with the set are nicely made, the design on them makes it easier to hold since it isn\u2019t completely smooth.",
