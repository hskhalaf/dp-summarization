When it is not in use it is in the cradle hooked up to the usb charger and we use the regular charger for during play time. I think that is one thing that frayed the original plug in charger it came with, was all of the back and forth plugging it into base then unplugging it and plugging it into the pad.",

If you or your child play the WiiU while it is plugged in, consider reinforcing the cord.",
