But the product inside is delicious as expected. After reading several other reviews having problems with open packaging and unsanitary exposed or partial candy inside, I was sure to inspect the wrapping very carefully. All the kids were fully intact and all individual wrapping was secure. No problems at all with the product. But knowing that they are packaged individually and not in small packs means I won\u2019t be buying again.",

I've ordered three boxes so far, one was crushed during shipping but was quickly replaced by Amazon. We haven't experienced any issues with the actual candies themselves but the display box isn't terribly sturdy. The opening for dispensing the candy is flimsy (aka easy to tear) but if you're careful it should open without too much difficulty. As long as the price and quality remains reasonable I will continue to re-purchase these monthly for my office.",

At a cost of 5 cent each or less, it's easy to let each child choose two different items, and keep the cost under $50. I had a bin of your basic chocolates, too (Milky Way, Snickers, M&Ms, etc.), but the favorites among the kiddies were the Sour Patch Kids and Skittles.",
