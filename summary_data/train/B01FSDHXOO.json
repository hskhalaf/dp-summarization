I've been looking forward to trying these as an alternative to my Adidas Ultra Boost ST's which are very good but in my opinion could use a bit more cushion given my weight (230lbs). I've already run ten miles today and my feet were kind of sore...but once I put these on, I feel like I could go another 3 miles...the cushion is comparable to the boost but is more subtle when walking...so basically they feel great...and definitely worth the money...",

I've never had that happen with previous New Balance 2E width running shoes of the same size. Wearing a Band-Aid has stopped the rubbing from causing me pain, but they still aren't the most comfortable New Balance running shoes I've owned. I wish New Balance offered more wide-width options for underpronated / supinated road runners. The Fresh Foam is supposed to be the best option for underpronation / supination, but my 910 trail runners are actually more comfortable, even on the street.",

The Boracay's have surpisingly little cushion in the sole - I cannot imagine running five or six miles in them.
