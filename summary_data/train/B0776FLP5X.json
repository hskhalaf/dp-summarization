When I fold my nursing bras down it crumples up and then when I take it out it sticks to itself and then rips and it\u2019s just more trouble than it\u2019s worth. The individual plastic packaging is an ecological nightmare. No need for all that waste. I still prefer my Johnson & Johnson nursing pads. They are super hick and always show but they are still the most comfortable.",

      "text": "These pads are great, they are super thin, but don\u2019t let that make you think they won\u2019t perform. They hold in a lot and stays thin even though it has absorbed a lot of milk. They might not seem like they are absorbing anything because they stay pretty thin, but they are. I tried these because the Lansinoh brand gets moist on top of the pad that goes against your skin and that\u2019s not good, especially if you are trying to avoid mastitis, you don\u2019t want moisture to encourage yeast growth. These pads definitely stay dryer and thinner than Lansinoh while holding in plenty of milk. Great pads!",
