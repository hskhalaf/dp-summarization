      "text": "Update 8/13/17 - After a little over one year of use in the ER, cutting off patients' clothes and cutting orthoglass, these shears have significantly dulled. They were very good for a long time but now need to be replaced. I will probably look to purchase a more durable pair of shears in the future. Original review: Excellent trauma sheers. I work in an ER and these have never failed me. They cut through jeans, belts, et cetera, with ease. I also use them to cut fiberglass when making splints. I have noticed over time that they are starting to lose a little bit of their power, but they still get the job done well. Would recommend to others.",

Since he has to wear three-layer compression wraps on his legs, I feared cutting him when they needed to be taken off. Regular scissors were often awkward plus not very efficient, and I had to make certain to keep the point away from his leg. But with this wonderful product, I can cut away the wrap without worry. The Madison Supply scissors are sharp, yet the blunt tip keeps me from causing any additional harm. Wish I had purchased this very functional item much sooner.",

I've been using these regularly for over a month.

I was feeling very apprehensive about using scissors so close to Tucker's eyes, but I was able to trim the hair without any problems. And they arrived promptly via my Prime membership: in exactly 2 days. Love them! Thanks!",

I am not fond of the various utility belts people attach to their scrubs, since all I carry are my phone (in a case attached to the waist), a pen, and these scissors. It may depend on the version of the scrubs you wear, but in mine the length is just right, so that when the shorter handle and tips are aligned downward in the back of the pocket down, it fits perfectly.",

No they aren't the top of the line, but in a job where people will just walk off with your stuff if they like it, I don't want to spend $150 on something that I might lose. I buy them in doubles and use one on fabrics and the other on fiber glass and aluminium splints. When the one with the tough job gives out, I buy a new one for the fabrics and the other one gets bumped up for the tough work. I've only had one pair break on me (Dr. broke them), and had it replaced easily without breaking the bank. Great product!",
