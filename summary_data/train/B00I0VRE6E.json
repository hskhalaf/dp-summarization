We did an absolute max 1500 hours and it is dead. Let us see what Acer customer support can do... So I called Acer customer service. Totally useless. Basically if you are out of warranty, even by 3 weeks there is no support. The bulb lifetime is definitely not what they indicated, at least in my case.",

Honestly, you can't beat the picture for the price. The only downside I've found so far is that the internal speaker is not super loud and while you can hook up an external audio, it needs to be hard-wired. If I had the purchase to make over again, I'd probably pay a bit more to have something bluetooth capable.",

Pros: Gorgeous picture Good sound from built in speaker Has audio out if you want to hook up your own speaker Allows for HDMI or Chromecast Remote works from pretty far away Portable and comes with bag Cons: You can hear the fan kick on when you first power it up but it's not super loud and at least you know its not overheating!",

I owned an Epson for a couple years until buying an LG LED, which simply did not have enough lumens and screen size to make it bearable, so I sold it. This Acer is exactly what I want. I suppose what I needed was a home theater projector, not a business one, and the difference has worked wonders. Very little RBE and strobing effect here. I recommend this projector.",

But this projector, which cost me less than the old one, works better, is brighter, and doesn't have them (at least not to my eyes). With Amazon's lenient return policy, I pulled the trigger and tried this out. So if you're on the fence between this and a more expensive projector, just because of them rainbows, I'd recommend trying this one out first.",

I haven't been able to open it up to have a look if it's just the bulb or something more, though there's a rattling sound that seems to be coming from the left side (not where the bulb is). I'm really hoping warranty covers this and will add a note later if all goes well. We used it less than 150 hours, easily which is way too short a life for a bulb.",

I am not a a/v snob who inspects every pixel, but the picture is great, sharp, bright etc and for the price and my use, it works great!

You can buy a cheap Hdmi switch if you have more than one device. The only cons are the dark scenes the blacks are a little too black but it still looks better than my 1080p TV especially in well lit scenes.",

That being said, the image quality isn't that good. Most of the time the projection being large makes up for the below average image quality. I say 'most of the time' because sometimes when there is a large area in which the color changes slowly (like fog or a smooth lake) I see an extremely noticeable transition. Instead of seeing a smooth gradient I see 4-5 areas of different colors.",

While you won't get colors to match an LCD screen you really don't have to tweak anything, I found the settings I liked in the modes provided.

It is not 1080p. There is no lens shift. However all these things are to be expected in the sub-1000 dollar category. The pros of this projector are so many. It is super bright, has great contrast. Very light and thus easy to pick up. it came with a carrying case too. It is 3d capable and has low latency which is important for gaming. I brought it to my friends place and they loved it.
