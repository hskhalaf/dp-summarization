Last week (12/15/15), the plastic latch broke off when the dogs knocked the can over. Amazon wouldn't accept return since it was >30 days. No problem, since Simplehuman advertises 10 YEAR WARRANTY. Emailed Simplehuman who responded, after many days, \"your product is out of warranty\" The cust svc rep offered 20% off a new product if we provided a picture of what broke. However, we will not be so stupid as to purchase any product from Simplehuman ever again.",

Kind of defeats the purpose, since I got this to protect our hardwood floor from scratches. When I spend $100+ on a kibble container, I expect it to work well.",

A lot of people saying the large can handle even over 30lbs, not in my case. Either Royal canin sent me far more than 30lbs or simple human or Amazon sent me the wrong product.

The size was perfect for the space. The 18lb bag of dog food fit perfectly. And it matches the rest of my kitchen appliances and trash can. Very stylish.",
