The carbon fiber case itself just adds an extra sleek look to my iPhone X. The only downfall to this case is I feel the bottom lip of the case is slightly too loose and I imagaine it will only get looser as time passes.",

You could easily push the rubber strip below the top of the phone with your finger, leaving the bottom of the phone exposed. This could easily lead to fall damage.
