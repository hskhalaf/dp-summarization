Only had it a few hours, so not a lot of detail to add except that it seems to perform really, really well. take the time to run through its various features and options and you'll be glad you did. By the way, I've seen some comments on Q&A sites wondering about how to find a replacement for the micro USB cable that comes with the camera. Its not a \"normal\" size, but I just found that it seems to be the same size as the micro USB cable for the Kindle! No problem finding those around. Problem solved! :-)",

      "text": "I love my camera. It works perfectly well. the images are 10 times better quality than my other cameras. It has many features that are useful. sometimes using this camera, i feel like i have a DSLR already. Love the way it has the blur out function and many more. The only downside is that I lost my cable that connects the camera to the Comp or the charger. So My camera has been dead for months. I cannot charge my battery whatsoever. For this type of camera, you cannot find another USB cord that fits if you loose it. So i'm stuck having to buy another whole battery kit that's going to cost over $50. boooo",

I am not very camera savvy so that could greatly be my problem, but I find my pictures are always blurry. The 18.2 megapixels doesn't seem to be any significant improvement on my 12 and 14 megapixel cameras from before, so don't be drawn in to this camera just for that aspect. I've only had it a year but I am trying to get rid of it for something much more user friendly.",

I am so happy I purchased this Sony cyber-shot camera instead!! It exceeded all my expectations and then some. The picture quality is exceptional, it shoots great videos, and has an easy mode to make usage a breeze. There are so many functions. Overall this is an exceptional point and shoot. My only pet peve is th battery life is really short. Even with that defect I still give it a 5/5.",
