      "title": "Great affordable choice for my students",
      "text": "I ordered these for my classroom the past two years. I love that I found an inexpensive water bottle that is BPA free, large enough to prevent multiple trips to the drinking fountain, and a fairly good quality. Best of all, they do not leak! When looking at water bottles cheap enough for a class of 30, most brands did leak. These ones have held up great. The only downfall is that this year, three students have dropped their water bottles and broken the lids. Last year they survived many falls. Perhaps over a year in a hot classroom has worn out some of the water bottles.",

The plastic is BPA free so I don't worry about what my kids may be ingesting. The tops screw on tightly and we haven't had any issues with leaking. The squirt top is firm enough when pushed down that the seal keeps water from leaking out of the squirt top also. This is a great water bottle for a great price!",

      "text": "Great price. Good seal on bottle - I can carry it in my computer bag. Mouth is big enough to add ice cubes. Plastic doesn't seem to stain with juice or flavor additives. Plastic is somewhat brittle, so you can only squeeze so hard. Plastic is also very thin, so contents warm up quickly. Popup nozzle works, but has a tendency to retract after every squirt. Works well for me. I use it as workout water bottle and take one when traveling to fill up after airport security. At $3/bottle, I don't have to worry about losing it or giving it up in the TSA line.",

I haven't heard if any of the other kids water bottles broke yet (we handed out 40 of them), and there's always a chance that it was a fluke.
