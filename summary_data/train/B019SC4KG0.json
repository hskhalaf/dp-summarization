It appears the manufacturer grinds down the plastic welds and they ground down way too much. Parts of the plastic slide are so thin that I could pierce with my finger nail. Arrrg.

I'm glad we got this one though: The up and down is what makes the ride such a thrill. All my kids (4, 5, and 7) love it and our neighbors' kids all gather around to join in when we pull it out. It is quite large so storage over the winter will be a thing... Have space in the garage, but we like to park both our cars in there. May have to disassemble for winter and put back together in the spring.",
