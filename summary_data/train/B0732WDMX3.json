Hopefully this will perform even better than my expectation and I will update my review after mounting it. The plastic has corrugation in the middle of it. Great customer service.",

You have to tape the sections together at first because every time you move it, a section falls apart. Also make sure you level it before hanging. We did not and the house siding was not level!! We had to adjust the screws but did not take it down. Being said, I LOVE it. It is great looking, sturdy, but light. Comes out far from the door with plenty of rain shielding. Glad we got the double sided one. It also blocks the HOT South Carolina sun. It was a good purchase and I recommend it highly.",

      "text": "Not an easy installation! Missing some screws and difficult to keep assembled. Used similar screwed we had on hand and kept a piece in with some packing tape until it was up. Need two or better yet three people to put it up. Luckily my husband is handy and was able to make it work. It looks great and seems to do the job keeping the rain away from the door. Let\u2019s see how it takes strong wind.",

Also nothing holds the rear of frame together until it\u2019s bolted to the wall. Corners of panel crushed in transit due to poor packaging. Very cheap construction will be surprised if they last the winter.",

      "text": "One of the two panels had some dents in it but you can't really see them now that it's installed. Assembly was quick and straight forward, but we used longer screws than the ones provided. We also added a few additional screws to the middle of the frame. This really increased the sturdiness of it overall. It has completely transformed the look and feel of the house! We love our house now :) The canopy is subtle and lets a lot of light in.",
