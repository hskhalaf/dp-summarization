When we got them in the mail, we immediately noticed that they were made with superior quality and looked way more expensive than how much they actually cost! They were perfect for wedding \"getting ready\" photos and video, and the guys seemed to really put them to use during our wedding day, and had way more fun than without them! If you need a super classy looking flask, or unsure of what to give someone as a gift who loves a little liquid courage on the go, this is definitely a great gift option, or for yourself! You won't be disappointed!",

I'd rather just take the cap completely off than have it in the way when I want to take a drink. I did worry that the leather would just be a loose sleeve but it's (I'm assuming glued) on very well secured. Going back to my headline, when I say there would bee too much if there was more, I just don't see the need to have a collapsible shot glass or other gimmick added to a flask.",
