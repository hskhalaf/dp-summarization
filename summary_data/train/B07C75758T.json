Can't afford it but ... am I glad I invested in this one even though dozens of people told me I would regret buying one n this price range - Absolutely !!! So - buy it - have fun - but if you can afford it go one step UP and get the larger hoop and throat area on the machine. You won't regret it.",

I ordered Brother thread in hopes that since several reviews indicated that the machine is very picky about the thread you use. Now it is too late I assume for a return because that option is not available on the Amazon site. It has been 35 days since I received the machine. Not able to use it at all. Very dissatisfied.",
