It put it at just the right height and made room for lots of presents underneath. It went together easily and was stable throughout the whole holiday season...even with two full-size curious cats climbing around. At the end of the season, it came apart and packed away neatly for next year, or if I need it for something between now and then.",

Probably some a-hole ordered it for his/her party and returned it afterwards and Amazon just sends these to the next customer. The tables themselves are soso. The feet can't be adjusted for uneven ground, which is VERY annoying, the table tops are laminated, so will probably hold up okay. The overall construction is sturdy, but since the feet can't be adjusted, you'll have to carefully place them. Okay product, but highly put off that I got used tables for price of new. Shame on Amazon which is handling shipping/returns for these.",
