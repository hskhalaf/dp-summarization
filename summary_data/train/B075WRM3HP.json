      "text": "With winter approching, this is definitely going to be in my bag 24/7. It feels great whenever you need that extra warmth outside at night. I\u2019ve used this the other evening during a baseball game and it was perfect as my phone was fully charged throughout the entire game and my hands were kept warm. The device is very easy to use, as after a couple of minutes the device is warm and toasty. It fits in the palm of your hand and your pockets. The temperature can be adjusted accordingly. The device was able to fully charge my phone from 1%, and even after that, there was still charge.",

There are three temperature settings which are very helpful - the highest setting is good for outdoors and the lower settings are good when I'm indoors. It can also be used as a power bank to charge my phone when needed. Overall I am very pleased.",
