      "text": "I bought this magnetic holder to get some of my smaller knives out of my knife drawer and off of my counter top and so far I have been pleasantly surprised. I didn't think it would hold my bigger and heavier knives but guess what? It seems to be working very well. My cleaver alone weighs 880 grams (1.936 lbs), and this magnet is not having any problems at this point. I don't think it will hold it on the very ends of the magnetic strip (without tilting) and of course I'm always careful taking my knives on and off (but I would be anyway), but I think this thing works as advertised and actually better than my expectations!",

Then use a screwdriver to insert the screws into the anchor. The directions don\u2019t give those details but it worked well for me to do that.",

The bag that the screws were supposed to be in was empty. This is the second repackaged item I have purchased with missing screws. I won\u2019t be purchasing any more. I have a 25 minute drive one way to return it. So I might as well just buy the screws while I am there. Don\u2019t buy repackaged items! It will cost you more, in gas, in your time and more cash to buy the screws that were supposed to be included!!!!",

My backup drawer has gotten a little nuts, and buying two of these magnetic holders and mounting them end-to-end was a perfect solution for me. There is plenty of depth to be able to get fingers behind handles, the magnets are more than strong enough to hold large chef's knives, and mounting was very easy with a torpedo level and cordless drill. It's attractive, stable, easy to mount, and easy to use. Not sure what else you would need.",
