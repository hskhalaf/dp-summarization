The reason I'm not giving it five stars is because the drawers are crooked. The two side doors fit perfectly but the four drawers in the middle don't sit straight. So, when you're looking right at the front of the sideboard, the drawers are obvious. It's annoying but I love the color and the style. It works exactly as I need it to work. I just wish I could figure out how to straighten the doors.",

The drawers and cabinets are quite functional for storage. It arrived in three days well-packaged with plenty of thick, messy styrofoam.

      "text": "This is a great piece and easy to put together. Giving two stars because it arrived with a gouge in the top and several scuffs/scratches in the finish. Easy enough to touch up the scuffs, but the gouge will require some work. Too much trouble to send back. Be sure you look this over BEFORE putting together. There was so much styrofoam stuck to it, didn't even see the gouge until it was fully assembled and cleaned.",

The piece came damaged in multiple places, a huge chunk out of the bottom that's not visible unless you are really looking, and the finish overall is inconsistent. Scratches and imperfections everywhere. Plus the two holes for screws on the legs were not drilled on the cabinet piece. It's too much of hassle to return so my only option is to distress the piece to cover the imperfections.",
