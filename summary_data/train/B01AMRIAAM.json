      "text": "I purchased this steamer and it arrived 2 days after placing the order. Which was impressive. However I just used it and it's leaking and making a gurgling noise from the hood. I'm not impressed. I watched the YouTube tutorial and followed the instructions to a tee and we assembled it exactly as illustrated from the operation manual. Why is it dripping from the under base all over my salon floor? Also what is the black knob for? The instructions is really not helpful. I will be returning this.",

The steam only comes out in the front, and my hair is extremely wet in the front and extremely dry in the back of my head. What a disappointment. I contacted the company immediately but have yet to get a call back. Don't bother to purchase this one, garbage. RPatrick-Ohio",

About 2 months later I went to fill the water in the bottle and place it in the machine and all the water came pouring out. Not sure why that happened so I reached out to customer service anout a week ago and still no response. Hoping that they reach back out to me that way they could help me either fix the problem or replace it.",
