When I think the floor is clean it proves me wrong which can also be a little terrifying & make me want to buy hardwood floors, but I'm happy that this Bissell cleans so well. My favorite feature has to be the no hair wrap floor bar. My hair always would wrap around any other vacuum I've owned causing it to clog up & not do it's job as well. This technology truly Keepes hair from wrapping around the bar. The best ever!! Thanks Bissell The pictures are after using it. It collected so much after I had already used my old vacuum.",

I've been taking good care of it, cleaning it regulary, replacing filters.. However I have recently realized that the main hose is broken and I wish I was able to replace this part considering how much I paid for it..",
