It seems to work as designed but it is a bare bones purchase....no card, instructions just the battery, camera, remote and strap. Which is how it was advertised. I downloaded the instructions from Sony and the cards I used in the H9 work in this one too. The shipping was weak....I would have protected the camera better.",

With the rapid continuous shooting mode we were able to get clear photos of player movement to improve strokes and dives for competition swimming. I have some trouble operating the jog control.

With this camera, I haven't had a problem, I even have one picture of him running flat out, both feet off the ground, and he's not blurry at all. I highly recommend this camera. I'm still playing with the manual settings, like aperature and shutter speed, but even those are fairly simple to learn since the readouts are right there on the screen. Highly, highly recommended.",

Having a remote is a real bonus for group shots that include me. I am used to having nightshot capability which I didn't have with the H5. This one has it and now I can take shots of our pond in the Spring with the frogs & toads serenading with their little throats throbbing. Taking video is great too. I would highly recommend this camera. It's small enough to carry with me most of the time and get those unexpected shots otherwise missed.",

Pics in low light are grainy and if you want a shot instantly to catch a particular moment you have to guess how far ahead to push the button.

You can freehand some really good shots at 15x zoom for an affordable point-N-shoot with factory settings, that's outstanding.",

After all it is a digital camera you can take as many pictures as you want without wasting film, and you can instantly see what you have. My one thought is to buy a extra battery, with all the bells and whistles your're going to need one.",
