      "text": "While it lasts, this is an absolutely phenomenal fry pan! The non-stick coating makes oil completely optional. The solid handle attachment feels sturdy. Cleanup is literally just a simple wipe. What's the catch? Well, the caveat is an easily melted red release slider which secures the handle. Once that's melted, the handle can't be removed intact. And you can't apparently purchase a replacement handle. Sadly, this crucial latch is in close proximity to high-heat. It lasted about 7-months for me. See photos attached, depicting the broken handle and latch deformation. It's a shame that the red latch plastic is not heat resistant as are all other parts of the removable handle. :'-(",

The non-stick works well and very easy to clean, since the entire pan is smooth on the inside without rivets. It conducted heat very evenly since it has a very thick bottom. This is our new favorite camp frying pan.",

There doesn\u2019t seem to be good heat transfer on induction. Also, the eggs seem to slide toward the outside of the pan a bit. I was going to invest in a much more expensive pan, but after reading good reviews, I bought this. I\u2019m thinking that any pan that\u2019s not solid heavy metal on the bottom is not going to work well on induction. This has a thin layer applied to get it to work but it doesn\u2019t work well, in my experience.",

The non-stick surface has performed well making stir-fry dinners and large lumberjack pancakes (the size a real man eats). It works fine with my induction cooktop and cleans easily after use.

      "\u2714 PROFESSIONAL DESIGN & QUALITY \u2013 Our 11 in. (28 cm) non-stick frying pan features a flared rim for drip-free pouring and a thick 4.5-mm. bottom that resists warping and distributes heat evenly. Compatible with various heat sources (induction, radiant, ceramic, halogen & gas).",
      "\u2714 REMOVABLE SECURESNAP HANDLE \u2013 Designed with a SecureSnap ergonomic handle that detaches easily and snaps on securely. Reduce the pan length quickly from 19.5\" to 13.4\" by pulling the release button and angling up the pan at 30 degrees. Place and store the pan in tight spaces effortlessly.

      "\u2714 LARGE UNIVERSAL LID \u2013 Includes a universal lid with silicone rim, which is highly heat-resistant and doesn't stick to the pot or pan; it does not melt or wear off when you use it while cooking. Steam Vent is just the right size and prevents suction or high pressure buildup, keeps soups, sauces, and stews from boiling over. It has an elevated, cool-touch knob that stays safe and cool to the touch, and will not get hot. No need for potholders or worry about getting burned.",
      "\u2714 PREMIUM & SAFE NON-STICK SURFACE \u2013 Heavy duty 2-layer reinforced non stick, PFOA-free surface resists scratches and allows free-oil cooking. Oven safe up to 480 degrees (handle off). For a more pleasant cooking experience this Cleverona nonstick fry pan is designed to resist the harsh scratches of your spatula, so you don't have to worry about the coating peeling off and leeching into your food. Your bacon and eggs do not stick to the pan too, or even your favorite french toast.",
      "\u2714 MULTI-PURPOSE PAN \u2013 This non-stick fry pan can also be used as a wok, sauce pan, casserole or even a baking pan. So you can stir-fry your favorite dishes, make dips and sauces and go directly from stove to oven to bake cakes, pastries or even bread!"
