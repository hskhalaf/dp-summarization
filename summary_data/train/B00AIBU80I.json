Anyway, I printed up some stickers on address adhesive label paper and will cut one Spiderman sticker out for each time he goes. Once all the stickers are gone he will receive the doll. Just hoping this will work and mom will no longer have the expense of pull-ups. The doll itself is large and makes a great gift. Sturdy enough for Spiderman pretend playing time adventures and doubles as a bedtime pillow.",

Now we are having to repair it less than 24 hours into receiving it. The company who sold it does allow a refund, or return at no cost, so this is not a reflection of the supplier, just surprised that it fell apart so quickly.",

The ONLY reason I gave 4 stars (or should be 4.9 stars) is when this arrived the feathers got bent in the packing/shipping. My daughter will need to try and steam them down. It\u2019s really a minor issue but I thought I would mention it so maybe when u ship it, maybe tie or bind the feathers to something so they stay down. I know, I\u2019m kind of OCD but just thought I would mention it for the sellers sake, like a FYI. Would buy from this seller again, for sure!",
