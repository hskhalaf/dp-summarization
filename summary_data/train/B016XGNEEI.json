Sadly I didn't expect my main problem would be sound. The speakers in this computer are horrendous. It's probably the worst sound quality I've heard to date. Everything sounds tinny and underwater. I must have been spoiled by my previous laptops. I'm also have issues switching out my old laptop's SSD with this laptop's HDD. This is more of an advanced thing that most won't find useful, but it also adds to my frustration with this computer.",

Rather than a simple clip-in battery, the engineers behind this genius design decided it'd be a funny prank to make consumers take the laptop completely apart to switch the computer battery (which on average fails between 1-2 years). Didn't order from Amazon but would hate for anyone else to have to waste half an hour disassembling a laptop just to switch out the battery, something Dell and other brands make possible with 1 step clip-in batteries. Will not be purchasing a Lenovo again.",
