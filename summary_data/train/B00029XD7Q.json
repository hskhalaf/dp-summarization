They like to hang out in the curtains so it was a little tricky to suck them up as other people mentioned it is not super powerful. However if they are on a flat surface it's perfect. One night during a blizzard my cat was hunting something in the living room. It was a wasp! During the dead of winter. \ud83d\ude2d Panicked, I remember I had the bug buster and ran to get it. Sucked it up super easy off of the coffee table leg. I left it die a slow painful death in the tube.",

This product is PERFECT FOR THEM. Others complain that it is not powerful enough, and for denser bugs this may be true; however, for daddy-long-legs, it is the ideal strength. It gently draws them in to the compartment--I keep the vacuum on until I put the cap back on--then I put the cap on, take them outside, take off the cap and they tumble right out of the compartment--COMPLETELY UNHARMED. It is effortless, gentle, and humane. A wonderful product. The ONLY product we know of that works for this specific need.",

It's nice for those ugly \"stink bugs\" that if you do squish them, they smell soo bad! You can suck them up and release them outdoors (or take them outside to squish). My friends saw it so I ended up buying a bunch and handing them out. They all love 'em! And Ladies- you don't have to call your guy to come get the spider! D",

I'd give it a one star but it does, technically, work. The concept of catching bugs without having to touch or kill them, is great.

I wait til there are a number of dead ones, then throw them outside. (I do not waste a flush on single invaders) You can also just let them starve to death, nyah-ah-ah!

Then take the insect outside and safely release at arm's length. This is a GENTLE insect vacuum designed not to harm the insect. Non-toxic, no harm insect control.
