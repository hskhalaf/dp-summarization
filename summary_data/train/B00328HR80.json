In addition to all the positives above, here are some things I liked the most: Pros: +Excellent low-light photos +Excellent video +Uses SD cards in addition to Sony's proprietary Memory Stick +Small size, form factor +3.5 inch touch screen is both high-resolution and beautiful +Good fit-and-finish Cons: -VERY HARD to open/close easily. The finish is quite slippery and the cover is hard to open -Hard to hold since the screen takes up the entire back face. There's a tiny grip on the back, but that's not enough - even for someone with small hands like me. Otherwise, it's an excellent camera! JT",

Fantastic pictures in my opinion, though over the years I have come to realize that picture quality is in the eye of the beholder. Your milage may very. To us, its fantastic. The only complaint she has with the camera is the lack of \"Picture Modes\" such as Sepia, Black & White, etc. Why Sony chose to leave those off one of their \"higher\" end cameras I have no idea. Other than that, I have no complaints with the camera. Easy to slip in and out of your jean's pocket. Would buy again",

The touch screen is difficult to keep clean and you must watch to keep your fingers out of the pictures due to the location of the lens. Small cameras are getting too small and hard to hold. Great for portability. It's much simpler to use than previous Sony portables. The touch screen menus are very easy to navigate. It's not perfect but is an excellent choice if you want portability, ease of use, and a camera that fits in a pocket. The panoramic shots are also very impressive.",

This cameara has lots of features and can do everything one should need to do with a slim point and shoot.

I bought another battery and an SD with higher capacity and it hasn't disappointed me in my travels (well, perhaps, sometimes I wished I had a third battery too...). All in all, I am very happy with this purchase and when I decide to replace it I will probably first look at what Sony has to offer.",
