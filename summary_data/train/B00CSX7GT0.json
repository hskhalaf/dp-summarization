I can jump and do turns all night long without ever second guessing my stilts. The only con that I can think of is that I wish they came with a smaller foot plate, I have a size 6 shoe and the straps hardly cover my toes.",

This pair, however, has worked out very well so far, and appear to be much sturdier than the cheaper brands you can find here on Amazon. I am new to using stilts, but the leg straps on these are much more comfortable than the others, and I feel more balanced on these. So far, I'd say they are worth the price.",

But I still use them so I obviously didn't need them. If I could go back I would have spent the extra 40 on dura stilts",
