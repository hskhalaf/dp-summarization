I will have to spray paint them before assembly or try to figure out how to pack the numerous pieces back into the box and haul the 60 pound box to the shipping store for a return. Very disappointed that I spent almost $200 for this kind of quality!",

And if you don\u2019t have a 10mm socket wrench just forget it because you\u2019ll never be able to put it together with just what\u2019s included. It looks used already but maybe with a better coat of paint. At day 1, it at least seems sturdy.",
