The arm brace moves stiff so it doesn't flop around, but the leather arm brace kinda small for a bigger guy, but once you squeeze it together to fit your arm its still not bad at all. I thought it would be heavier for some reason, but overall I am very impressed with this kit, which also came with ammo, so your ready to go. From my experience so far all I could Say is I would buy it again!",
