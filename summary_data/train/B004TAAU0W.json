I've been shooting blocks for several years now and I've never had any problems with them. This target is super durable when it comes to shooting field points. I've been shooting mechanical (Rage) and fixed (Muzzy) broadheads into this target for a few weeks now and it is holding up fine. There is some cosmetic damage from the mechanical and fixed broadhead practice, but that is to be expected. Don't sacrifice quality for price, you won't regret buying this target.",

I don\u2019t see this one lasting 12 years. I guess they needed to make it a little less durable to increase the frequency of purchases.

I added another foam target behind the target, and continued using it, and it was completely shot out in about a month. Probably only a couple hundred arrows, with a 50/50 mix of fixed blade broad heads and field points.

      "text": "This target works well - you just plop it down and shoot it. Arrows are slightly easier to remove than pulling them out of a solid foam block. I think it is holding up slightly better too, but it is still starting to soften in the center after about a month of daily practice. Minor point - couldn't they have put 5 targets on the face instead of slapping their logo in target area? Come on, put the advertising on the side and let up shoot. Sure I can sand and repaint, but why should I have too?",
