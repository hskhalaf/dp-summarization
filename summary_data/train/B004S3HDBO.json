      "text": "I\u2019ve used my CampChef Everest twice since ordering it a couple months ago. In 55 years of camping my Everest is, hands down, THE best camp stove I ever used. It\u2019s rigged. It\u2019s portable. It\u2019s large enough for two large pots or a full-sized griddle. The 20 btu burners at full power are like afterburners on an F-15! The heat is easily controlled from low-and-slow to getting a large pot boiling in five minutes. This stove is ridiculously easy to use! My wife and I are overjoyed to have this powerful, rugged workhorse for our camping adventures! Always been a Coleman fanatic. CampChef Everest has raised the bar higher than Coleman can see, let alone reach!",

When we tried cooking, it cooked too hot. - carrying handle/groove had sharp edges. - igniter only worked one time. Concerns - plastic lid clips and knobs seemed to be of low quality and I'm not sure how long they would last.",

I have left it out in the weather elements for a weekend at a time and no issues at all. The only thing about this stove is that even on the lowest heat setting, it still pumps out some serious btu's. I use mainly cast iron by lodge when cooking, so I just turn off stove for a few minutes and let the retained cast iron heat continue to cook it. Plus side to that-I can boil water in 45 seconds!",
