This was hard on the battery life. 100% down to 55% in 6.5 hours. 2nd - it started scrolling, on it's own, through the three items below the clock (BPM, steps, and calories) unfortunately, no video... 3rd - while on the phone with FitBit, the screen started flickering lines and pretty colors [pictures]. Now 4th - its D-E-A-D, dead.. Will update when replacement arrives.",
