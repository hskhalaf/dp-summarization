I compared it to the first Samsung wireless charging pad I have and they both charged about the same, and my Samsung wireless charger is before fast charging. But one day it just died I don't know why I keep it next to my desk and never move it. Update: I received a replacement from the support team appears that I had a defective one, this one is so far working great.",
