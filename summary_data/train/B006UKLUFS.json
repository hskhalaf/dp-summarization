The paddle stopped moving at around 45 minutes. The ice cream was frozen around the edges and in the middle it was like soup. I have grand kids coming from back east that are looming forward to making their own ice cream. Also the other reviews mention just putting the mix straight in to the container. The instructions s called for placing mixture in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. I\u2019m confused. I hope you can help me. I called a technician... no answer. Thanks!",

This Cuisinart ICE-100 is superior in every way, the processing container lifts out easily to remove the completed ice cream or gelato, and has different processing blades for both which means they process them quickly and efficiently. It is much quieter than my older model and it is easier to set up and clean. The first batch I made was Carrie Brown's low carb double chocolate hazelnut ice cream and it was so incredibly good I know we will be using this machine on a weekly basis and loving it!

No matter how much I clean, how dry it is, the bowl always freezes to the machine.

      "text": "Last year I bought a $60 Cuisinart ice cream maker and ended up returning it after one use because the bowl would not get cold enough to have the ice cream freeze. So this Christmas, I bought this much more expensive ice cream maker and it is well worth it! I have made over 15 batches of ice cream so far. All very easy, quick and delicious. This machine has a compressor, which eliminates the problem the other ice cream makers have since you do not need to freeze the bowl. Easy to clean and make and experiment with ice cream flavors. No complaints, it does what is says very well!",

      "text": "I do not write reviews much but had to here. After reviewing multiple ice cream makers I went with this one. This thing is amazing. So far I have made Butter Pecan, Banana Nut, Chocolate, and Pistachio almond ice cream. All organic with grass fed milks and butter, organic sweeter, Himalayan sea salt. No preservative ice cream that is out of this world. I still can not believe how good it is. Now all I have to do is watch the amount I eat and Ill be ok! My kids and wife love it. Win for quality, Win for price and Win for healthy ice cream.",

Giving my grandchildren fresh treats and knowing exactly whats in it, is awesome.",

    "title": "Cuisinart ICE-100 Compressor Ice Cream and Gelato Maker, Silver, 1-1/2-Quart",
    "description": "THE CUISINART COMPRESSOR ICE CREAM AND GELATO MAKER\nThe ICE-100 Ice Cream and Gelato Maker Make decadent ice cream, rich creamy gelato and light sorbet that your family will love, all in the comfort of your own home. The easy to use, fully automatic Cuisinart ICE-100 Ice Cream and Gelato Maker features a commercial-style compressor so you can make batch after batch without waiting. Two unique mixing paddles and a 60-minute countdown timer work to ensure your homemade gelato, ice cream or sorbet has the perfect consistency.\n\nThe included recipe book features a variety of flavors to create with the Cuisinart Ice Cream and Gelato Maker. You can also add in your favorite ingredients -- be it fresh fruits, chocolate chunks, even brownies -- during the mixing process through the see-through lid to make a fabulous frozen treat. Once the timer countdown is complete, the 10-minute Keep Cool cycle begins to keep your ice cream or gelato nice and cool. For optimum consistency, transfer the mixture to an airtight container and chill for a minimum of 2 hours.\n\nLid, mixing paddles, mixing bowl, and base FEATURES AND BENEFITS\nTransparent Lid\n\nAdd recipe ingredients to the mixing bowl with the easily removable see-through lid and then watch the mixing process in action. \n\nMix-in Opening\n\nUse to add your favorite toppings and mix-ins, like chocolate chips or nuts, without interrupting the freezing cycle. \n\nMixing Paddles\n\nTwo unique paddles mix and aerate the ingredients in the mixing bowl to create your frozen dessert. The gelato and sorbet paddle perfectly incorporates air in the ingredients and creates richly textured results with intense flavor. Use the ice cream paddle to perfectly churn for smooth, creamy results. \n\nMixing Bowl with Lift-Out Handle\n\nAnondized aluminum mixing bowl. No need to pre-chill or freeze the bowl prior to use. \n\nTouchpad Control Panel with LCD Readout\n\nWhen the unit is on, the power button is illuminated by a red LED light. The countdown timer can be set from 10 minutes to 60 minutes. The Start/Stop button can be pressed at any point in the Mixing/Cooling cycle to pause the timer and mixing. The same button can be pressed to continue mixing.\n\nMAKING FROZEN DESSERTS\n 1. Use Cuisinart recipes included in the Instruction Booklet or use your own recipe, making sure your base does not go over the top dasher on the mixing paddle. Gelato and sorbet bases should be no more than 1 quart and ice cream bases should be no more than 5 cups. The ingredients will increase in volume during the freezing process. For best results, prepare the ingredients in a container from which it is easy to pour.\n 2. Place the mixing bowl into the base.\n 3. Place the ice cream or gelato/sorbet paddle in the mixing bowl so it rests in the center of the bowl.\n 4. Pour ingredients into the mixing bowl.\n 5. Press the Power button to turn the unit on and then set the timer per the recipe. The timer will default to 60 minutes.\n 6. Press the Start/Stop button to begin the Mixing/Cooling cycle.\n 7. Add ingredients such as chips and nuts towards the end of the mixing time once the mixture has begun to thicken.\n 8. Once the set time concludes, the 10-minute Keep Cool cycle will keep your ice cream or gelato cool.\n 9. When the frozen dessert is ready, transfer to a freezer-safe, airtight container for longer storage in the freezer.\n\nADDING INGREDIENTS\nIngredients such as chips and nuts should be added about five minutes before the freezing process is complete in order to fully incorporate them into the frozen mixture. To add a chocolate swirl to the mix, slowly drizzle in hot fudge or melted chocolate.",
