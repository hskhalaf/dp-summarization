      "text": "Oh man, I am over the moon about this product. My bedroom is the basement of the house, so the wifi just barely reached, and has a very weak signal. This extender is a life saver. It took maybe 2 minutes to set up, the hardest part was getting it out of the box! It amplifies the signal perfectly, and I find that it actually makes my wifi faster, as less people are using it! HouseWifi is my normal wifi signal in my room and the HouseWifi_EXT is the extenders wifi signal in my room. Look at the difference! I will be convincing my family to buy these for the farther parts of the house. In love!!",

I recently purchased a TV for our room and realized that I did not have good internet in that room to use it. This solved the problem. We stuck it in the center of our house and my phone stays connected to it all over. Took about 30 minutes to get it running, but it was easy enough. It basically broadcasts a separate network, which was confusing because you have to have service in the app to run it, but also WiFi? My phone doesn\u2019t get great service but I managed to wiggle it. \u2764\ufe0f",

The Google Wifi doesn't give you the custom control to setup a dedicated 2.4 GHz channel and I found out the hard way that the Roomba vacuum will ONLY function with the setup process on 2.4. This router was a seriously cheap solution to supplement my wifi network, broadcasting solely on 2.4 GHz. The setup and app control is extremely user-friendly. If you are seeking a very basic, but customizable WiFi router that just does it's job without a lot of fluff...this is a good pick.",

But a speedtest.net check with the same laptop in the same spot and switching between the original and original_EXT SSID dropped the internet speed from 30Mbps/30Mpbs to about 4Mbps/6Mbps. IMO this is maybe good for extending the range to get some barebones reception but at severe cost of throughput degradation. I guess it makes sense since it has to receive and repeat i.e. rebroadcast and this constant switching introduces significant enough latency to drop the speeds to useless speeds for things like video streaming or any real work. It's workable for emails/light browsing but otherwise practically useless.",

      "text": "tldr: 1. If you want this thingy to work, then get ready to downgrade your security to WEP instead of WPA2 etc. 2. You won't be able to share the SSID of your main AP, default will rename the extender to EXT_NameOfYourAPHere which is basically ANOTHER network within your LAN, not an extension of your current AP. 3. Don't waste your time and buy a wired AP or a Unify :)",
