The only problem is that if you opt for the magnet \"upgrade\" it's more of an afterthought. The magnets are strong and work well, but will rip through the material because the material isn't reinforced. You either have to use pliers to lift the magnet off your hood, or slide the magnet off and damage your paint (it's a strong magnet). You can see in the picture how the magnet ripped right through the black material.",

Big enough to fit two grown adults with ease, it's also strong enough to hold up via wind bursts. Unlike other umbrellas, this doesn't cover half of a person while the other gets drips...nope, full coverage for two. Subtle styling goes anywhere. Very well made.

My boyfriend was afraid to use it in chicago though while visiting me because he didn\u2019t want it stolen, which would be easy considering it just slips over the side view mirrors. Overall a good product, its pretty thick (probably 1/4 in) of fabric and seems pretty sturdy.",

The only problem is the magnets are not strong enough to hold it down. With the winds they blow off. Otherwise easy to put on and take off.",

The shell covers the display and there is a cut out for the click wheel that is covered by the silicone skin. The system comes with three silicone skins (\"clear\", black, and glow in the dark)and one shell. there is the option of a belt clip (I don't use)that works well too. The bottom is open for both connections. The hold button on top is a little tough to get if your finger nails are very short however. There is an adapter as well for the iPod dock. For me this is the perfect case.",
