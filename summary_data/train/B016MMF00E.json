      "text": "An excellent, versatile and portable camera. Takes high quality stills and HD movies. Useful zoom range. The camera allows manual or automatic control of all settings. Good quality electronic view finder with electronic spirit level and indication of aperture, shutter speed and ISO (film speed). GPS functionality via GPS enabled smart phone and WiFi connection enables GPS info to be added to raw image files and JPGs. The camera acts as a WIFi hub to which the smart phone can be connected. Small and light, easy to carry anywhere. For this reason it does get taken to places and used a lot.",

However, my reason for buying it was to give me a more portable solution for social occasions, but I've found that it suffers the same limitations as most non-SLRs and mobile phone cameras....shutter lag, resulting in blurred images, particularly of children who never sit still! I miss the definitive \"clunk\" of the SLR and the images are never quite as sharp. Early days to condemn it totally, so I will persevere in the hope that I can eventually master it.",
