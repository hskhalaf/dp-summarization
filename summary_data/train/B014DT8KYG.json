I've used may types and brands of chisels over the years and these do just as well as the more expensive ones I've used. Pros: Honing guide is nice and helpful - use a better stone though Like the handles - comfortable and easy to keep a good grip Great value - think I paid around $40 for them Cons: Don't like the stone - kind of cheap The case isn't great - hard to get the chisels in and out quick and easy Overall, for the value, I really like this set.
