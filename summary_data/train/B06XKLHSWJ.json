It's lightweight, less noisy than previous vacuum cleaners we've owned, moves around easily, and actually picks up all the dog hair in legit one pass!

When set to bare floors the brush beats up your hardwood or linoleum floors! The video showed her moving from carpet to bare floor without adjusting! Very poor suction. I tried various levels to try to pickup lint on the carpet. None of them worked! To pickup anything I had to beat up my rugs with the brush. Too bad I tore up the box. I would return it.",

A pro is that it is lightweight but a con is that it tips over easily when using the wand which is short. Con is that it has a 20 foot cord so you have to move the plug several times to go from room to room. Pro is that the filter sponge is easy to rinse out and put back in. Pro The canister bin is easy to empty and take apart to wash.",

It doesn't have auto-rewind which I didn't think to check as I thought it was a standard feature on these types of vacuums. One annoyance is the hose where it connects to the chassis, if you're using the crevice tool and moving the hose around, it almost always unscrews itself from the main chassis.

      "text": "We have one of these vacuum cleaners on each level of our home. We have three dogs and one cat so we need to vacuum multiple times per week. I've found having a lightweight unit makes the task easier and therefore more enjoyable. Good value, no frills and bagless with enough suction to pull up dirt and animal hair from floors, carpets, rugs and stairs. Simple installation too. The cord length seems normal, but we always wish the cords were longer.",

The hose attachments sit pretty precariously on the backside of the vacuum and fall off continually. Super annoying when your infant is napping and you have exactly 30 minutes to vacuum.
