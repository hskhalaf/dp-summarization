I have found for me, the glaze works better if I apply it to dry hair, and leave it on 30-45 minutes or so, then rinse. If I used it in the shower as directed, I just didn't get the results I wanted, which is to cover the gray. I have dark brown hair, and the glaze will give the gray a beautiful auburn color, and leave my hair very shiny and healthy looking. Be sure to wear gloves when applying because it will stain your hands.",

And honestly it does look good on me so I usually always dye my hair a natural light brown or ash brown to help control the natural brassiness of my hair.

I was reading about this and decided to give it a go and OMG I love how it adds a nice dimension to my dyed brown hair and ALSO my roots are not red!!! Hallelujah!! Best product I love it so much, easy to use, great color, great price. Thank you John Freida!",

I let it sit for about 20-30 minutes and then wash my hair as normal. For me, this process is working great! I do this every few washes, but I\u2019m sure more often wouldn\u2019t hurt.",
