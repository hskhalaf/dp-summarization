      "verdict": "The Gel Quantum 360 Knit features a seamless knit upper that afforded runners a sock-like fit and exceptional breathability. It delivers responsive and exceptional cushioning upon impact while providing strong-push offs, thanks to its signature 360 Gel Technology. While many are impressed with the quality of this shoe, there were others who felt that it is a bit heavy and narrow. Overall, it\u2019s a good road shoe for neutral pronators who need a reliable ride for short to mid-distance runs.",
      "pros": [
        "A lot of runners have lauded the shoe on how comfortable it is",
        "Some testers have reported going sockless with the Quantum 360 Knit and not having any hot spots or blisters",
        "As noted by most testers, the stretchy knit upper molded well to the foot, giving a glove-like fit",
        "A lot of runners shared that the upper offered great ventilation",
        "The knitted upper fabric proved to be good at keeping the feet dry during runs, commented by a consumer",
        "Testers have stated that the cushioning material of Quantum 360 Knit delivered as promised",
        "it did great in terms of helping protect the feet and legs from the impact generated by footfalls",
        "Some were pleasantly surprised by the damping technology of the Gel Quantum 360 Knit, which gave them smoother strides & takeoffs",
        "The outsole tread has been observed to provide good grip even on wet surfaces",
        "Some claimed that the upper granted good structure on the midfoot and heel cup area, which prevented foot slippage"

      "cons": [
        "A handful of wearers has commented on how heavy the shoe was for them",
        "A runner had also noted that this shoe\u2019s midsole tended to be noisy or squeaky during runs",
        "Some testers observed that the midfoot area was a bit narrow",
        "The mid-sole tended to be stiff and needed a break-in period, a couple of runners claimed"

The all knit top is different & they fell lighter than the prior 360 version. Let's see how they wear after 350-500 miles.",

They are on the heavy side compare with the adidas ultraboost but they are so comfy that I wear them a lot more than the ultraboost. So I decided to buy another pair (blue in color). Mistake happened when I decided to buy from 6PM. The shoe have stain on them and the arch part of the shoe has a hollow surface as shown on the picture. These pair of shoes are probably rejected from quality control. I will return these shoes and buy another pair from a different seller. 6PM never again!",
