It has helped, apparently, because I've had no breakouts in areas where it is applied. SO, I ordered a case of it. In time, I'm sure the doctors will deduce the offending irritant, but in the meantime, I'm grateful for this product. Evidently, It doesn't just work on poison ivy. It protects the skin from other irritants, too.",
