The only thing is if your lazy like me and get your watch a little too close to the water when washing your hands some water gets stuck under the case, but it is super easy to take off the case to dry it off!",

It's also tricky to get on the watch and once I read that you should remove the cover when swimming, and I saw what a pain it was to get off, I decided to return this. Good idea in theory, but I'm not willing to have an ugly watch face to look at and need to remove it every time I swim--it's summer for goodness sake!",

I have already scratched my watch face twice since getting it 3 months ago, all in the same area - the upper left and right corners where I smack them into things. This bumper will definitely stop more scratches from accumulating. While the perfect scenario in my opinion is no bumper, this will do and I'm pleased with it.",

Washing hands shouldn\u2019t be an issue but if you really get it wet, water does get inside the case. I usually take a QTip and clean it with out removing it. The case also protects all corners of the watch. Another good factor is that It\u2019s clear so you can\u2019t really notice it\u2019s protected. Now.... let\u2019s see how long it last.",

      "text": "Great cables! I ordered 2 sets. I was pleasantly surprised when I received the cables, the packaging was great. They come inside a nice pouch, which comes in handy not only to carry an extra cable with me, but for my portable charger as well. I love the feel of the braided cable. They look and feel sturdy; definitely nicer than other cables on the market. I like that they come in black, I have seen other cables in other colors as well, but prefer the black. The micro to USB C adapter is an nice addition.",
