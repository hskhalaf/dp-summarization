I suffer the worst out of all of my coworkers and I work in parks with a lot of poison oak. I get it often. If you did not catch the oak in the initial scrub then use this to cut the healing time in half. This stuff wont make it erase off your skin but it will soothe and then dry it out so that you don't feel miserable and it heals fast. Great product.",

This time the itch went away a few minutes into the application and the swelling went away after a couple of days. Getting rid of the itch was well worth the cost. One thing puzzles me is that the directions required that each application requires a minimum quantity (1.5 inch) of the product; and stresses this is required for the product to work. I did ignore this direction and used a smaller amount as one area of infection was very small. The product still worked.",
