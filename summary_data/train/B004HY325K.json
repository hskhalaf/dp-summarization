I use a hand held blender which works great. But clean up is a bit messy, again because it clumps to everything. Final thoughts. Tastes better than any other chocolate protein powder I've ever had. Yes...it's a pain to mix, but the taste is worth it. I'd like to say I gained 10lbs of pure muscle from my first canister...but....not really. Can't really tell any gain difference at all from whey protein.",

      "text": "The taste is just awful. Worst beef protein powder I've ever tried. I'm going back to my previous brand which was more expensive but tasted SO much better than this. This is overwhelmingly sweet. I thought they couldn't go wrong with chocolate, but they did. No need to add so much sweetener! I'm not even halfway through the container and I will likely be throwing the rest of it away, I'm starting to get a gag reflex from it!",

A groundbreaking clinical study presented at the 2015 International Society of Sport Nutrition (ISSN) conference in Austin, Texas showed that hard training athletes supplementing with CARNIVOR Beef Protein Isolate (BPI) gained an average of 7.7 pounds of muscle mass, while also increasing strength.
