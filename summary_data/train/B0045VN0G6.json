      "text": "I love this straightner! After about two years it broke when I was traveling and I turned it in with the warranty and received a brand new one instead. The company is super quick and helpful if you have problems. The straightner is super amazing it stays at a certain heat and even without heat protectant (with use of low heat around 290F) I have no split ends from daily use. I have used Chi's before and they ruined my hair they were just too hot. I am glad I settled on this one, ive had my new one for 2 years with no problems at all.",

However after 9 months it suddenly stopped working! bought a second one recently and took extra care of it once again in case it was my fault but nothing! no matter what I did after a month it didn't want to heat up! This is last infrared flat iron that I will ever purchase! It was a good flat iron! but I don't think it worth ANY money to keep repurchasing for malfunctioning.. Hope this review can help to save your money!",
