      "text": "Run, do not walk, away from Vinotemp. We purchased this product from Amazon ~ 4 years ago for our outdoor BBQ area, and didn't even get that much time out of it. The control board and sensor are already shot, and between parts and labor, we're looking at $748 to fix it. And of course, it's out of warranty. Outrageous! The telling indictment? The technician, listed by Vinotemp on their website as an approved service provider, shared that Vinotemp products are beyond unreliable. He advised that we chalk up their product disaster as a learning experience and go with a better manufactured and backed brand, like U-line.",

      "text": "This is a defective product. Also, the company doesn't stand behind its product. The refrigerator malfunctioned about 1 1/2 years after purchase and stopped working. The compressor burned out after this time with only minimal use. It was very disappointing. The customer service attempted to resolve the problem but it was not easy to get them to offer me a proper replacement after allowing a 15% discount on a replacement compressor which would have cost almost $200. It is unfortunate that the product did not perform well and the company was not supportive of their product. It is disappointing that Amazon sells this product for outdoor refrigerators.",

The interior is not plastic like the lower end units. And the shelves are glass, which makes for easy cleanup. The only negative is that it has no door handle. I would recommend this unit to all my friends.",

Only two complaints are: 1) no handle - which means the unit has to stick out a bit in our built-in BBQ in order to pull open the door; and 2) the tracks to set the height for the shelves are somewhat limiting for loading it up with drinks.",

Only negative I would give is there isn't any pull handle or indented side to grasp the door when opening. We have room between the cabinet wall and the door so it isn't a problem for us but something to take into consideration if putting this in a tight space. Otherwise we are really please with the product!",
