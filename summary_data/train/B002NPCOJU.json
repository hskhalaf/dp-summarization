They just barely fit my feet with just a touch of room at the toe. I would suggest ordering a full size up from what you normally wear. If you have wide feet, bunions, or ankles that aren't slim, these may not work for you. That said, for me, average size body and bone structure (5'6\" and 125 lbs), they work fine. But I did order up half a size, and I'm glad I did. They seem to run a bit small, and definitely narrow.",

I have thin calves, so this isn\u2019t a problem for me, but people with larger ankles and calves may have trouble with this particular style since it can be a little tight even for me getting the boot on/off. It would be worth finding another style that works better from this company. Bonus: When they do finally wear out, which I imagine will be quite a long while, the company will take them back and recycle them for you!",

They are not as heavy as Hunter boots, but they're still rubber boots and therefore slightly heavy. I have plantar fasciitis so I have to always wear an insole and these, in the bigger size, allow me to wear them (but I could barely get my foot in there even without them in the smaller size).",

I also tried Bogs and returned because the circumference wasn't as wide and twice the cost!",

They are also a little shorter on the shaft length and may not keep out as much rain or puddles. Overall the colors and quality are good and the price is also reasonable.
