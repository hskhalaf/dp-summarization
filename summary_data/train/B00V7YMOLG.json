There is enough room in the pocket for a note book and music sheets. Plus the little pocket on top is roomie for many picks to put inside. The only thing is that the zipper for the guitar doesn\u2019t go all the way around, it only goes around in the front as shown in the picture. Which isn\u2019t a big deal.

It's very thin; using this would be comparable to just covering your guitar in sheets of printer paper, and it will not prevent dents and scratches... This would be a cheap option for if you wanted a way to carry your guitar on your back. Otherwise, stay away from this and just invest in a better case with actual padding...",
