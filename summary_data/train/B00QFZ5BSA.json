All the weight is sitting on the center bolts and the stand rocks left and right. If the center bolt or an 1/8\" shorter it would be fine. I'm either going to have to add felt feet or cut the center bolt down and 1/8\".",

      "text": "I think if I had bothered to read everyone else's reviews, I would not have bought this product. Like several others, I have hardwood floors and, for that reason, keep an ample supply of floor pads. Good thing, because they saved this purchase. The (wordless) instructions show the supplied plastic caps going over the spikes. Good luck with that. Even rather forceful coaxing with a rubber mallet didn't make it possible to install the caps over the spikes. Fortunately, my felt pads were just thick enough to extend the stand bottom surfaces past the connecting rods. So if you have hardwood floors and really want these particular stands, then BYOP - buy your own felt pads.",

Overall I\u2019m very pleased with these. I wish they were a few inches shorter but that\u2019s ok. Definitely one of the better looking affordable speaker stands on the market",

I use the ISOACOUSTICS insulators as well. Treble and Bass come through without vibration. I still use headphones for crazy loud (Ear Killing) music, but... Good stuff if it fits your needs.",

However, product arrived with both glass bases chipped (packaging was solid and undamaged) and no mounting considerations for a wooden floor (had to use my own felt pads). In tightening the rods during assembly, one of the metal base plates came unglued from the glass plate. I was able to superglue it back, but without the speaker on, you can see the ugly replacement glue. Lastly, the metal aluminum tubes holding up the speaker are not filed at the edges, so be careful running wires through them lest you scrape off the wiring insulation. All in all, an OK product, but don't look at it up close.",

So the stands (with included feet) will scratch a hardwood floor or wooden table. I circumvented this by creating a small mat which I use under each stand. The manufacturer should have included a separate set of blunted feet for use on hard wood floors.",
