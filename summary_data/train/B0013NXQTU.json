It's very hard to tighten it down because the top part of the pole is made to spin to keep the flag from twisting up. Because I can't get it to tighten down together, the top half of the pole hangs to the right a little more than it should. Aside from that, it's a very nice pole. Well made and my flag looks awesome flying in the wind.",

So, he had me order him this spinner pole after he noticed how great the one works on our deck. He's a happy camper now!",

So if you're new to flagpoles, you need to know there's a difference between banners and flags, and grommets and such.

After less then one year it fell apart virtually rendering the pole useless. Think if this was made from aluminum or something similar it would have lasted. It literally fell apart and the flag to be blown from the top and hang. Of course at that point it was tangle free so that part held up.",

The anti wrapping feature actually works! We have wind here in Colorado and I would find my flag either wrapped up or strung up in the gutter frequently. This pole never lets my flag wrap up and a gutter hang is far less frequent (I think because the flag moves freely and does not flip us as much).",
