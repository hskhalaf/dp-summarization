The two speeds are a nice feature, and most grasses and weeds can easily be trimmed on the slower speed which also increases battery life. Of course the bonus of being able to use the 20V DeWalt batteries is also great (if you have other DeWalt cordless power tools). I am happy with my purchase and overall quality.",

These are minor when comparing to the tugging on gas powered cords and the noise they make. Don\u2019t over think it, just get it. It\u2019s quiet and does great job. I plan to get the blower next!",

Dewalt is also not offering a reasonably priced replacement string cartridge, which Black and Decker has. You have to wind it yourself, and it jams up constantly.

Weighs less, Runs about 40 min on setting 1 and 20 min on setting 2...high. Would agree...the line it comes with is junk. NO more yearly bills to repair, no more gas and oil to mix, no more pulling and pulling and pulling to get it to start.... PS it also has a variable speed trigger",
