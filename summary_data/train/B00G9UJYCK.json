As a hobbyist videographer, this was a deal breaker for me as most of my video is typically run and gun.",

Works well with later Sony 'A' mount lenses (with internal motors NOT screw drive ones which need LA-EA4) such as Sony 70-400 telezoom. It does have one issue: a tendency to lose contact with the body though... requiring re-seating 2/3 times to regain contact (cleaning contacts does not seem to help... it's as though the contacts need 'stronger' springs to maintain reliable electrical connection). Best way to use Sony long lenses on A6000 or A7-series cameras.",

The adapter is plug and play, my NEX6 and A7 both recognised both the lens (Sony SAL70200G and Sony SAL85F28) and the adapter immediately and presented the autofocus options as required. Speaking of Autofocus, the lenses focus quickly and very accurately but the focus points are focussed very much in the centre of the frame, more so with a full frame body like the A7 or A9 series. In use, shooting with the adapter is very much like shooting with a Sony SLT camera. Face recognition works well as does tracking autofocus.",

      "text": "Given what this does I am surprised that this adaptor is so small, compact and lightweight. However being a same-brand adaptor, the autofocus speed when using lenses should be quicker. I use it with a SAL-1635Z and the autofocus is very slow compared with the nearly instant autofocus of the kit E mount lens. I also find that the fit on the E mount side of this adaptor, where it attaches to the camera body, could be more rigid although this may have more to do with the E mount design rather than the adaptor itself. Very good value for money as only a bit more expensive than some metal-only adaptors e.g. AI-NEX.",
