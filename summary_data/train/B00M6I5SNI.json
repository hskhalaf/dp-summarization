I wish it was a spray rather than a foam to apply and rub in, at the end of long days I'm sometimes tempted to skip it.

I am happy to report that, after 4 months of use, I am seeing significant hair growth where I have been applying it. First, after 1.5 months, I noticed patches of tiny 1/2 inch long hairs starting to grow in in the recession area of my hairline. Now at 4 months, the new growth is almost 2 inches long. In all honesty, when it comes to hair loss, there is no magical cure out there...but Rogaine is a step in the right direction.",
