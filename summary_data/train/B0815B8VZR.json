Because of that it's not nearly as precise or effective as the GenieBidet I have that is also a built-in bidet into the toilet seat. Right at the 1.5 month mark it is not working. Just gurgles water out the jets. I'm past the return window, so there goes $100 down the drain. I should have stuck with GenieBidet. Would not recommend due to the mechanics of it and the short lifespan.",

We were skeptical of reviews claiming the cool water was a non-issue, but to our surprise, it's true. We currently have snow/freezing temps, and all four adults who have used the bidet agree that the cool water wash is no problem at all. Installation was a breeze. All that's left to do now is order one for ourselves.",

The soft close feature stopped working after only a couple weeks, and the front sprayer is aimed too far back while the rear is a little too far forward (so they basically spray the same place). So you have to scoot around to get it where you want it, but it otherwise gets the job done.",

This was better for us because you see the left side of the toilet when coming into the bathroom. Having the water connections on the right side of this seat hides the hose attaching to the seat better.",
