Like most cookbooks, it calls for lots of 'foodie' ingredients that I don't have and many I have never heard of. The recipes involve long lists of odd spices and weird 'health' foods they don't have at the grocery store. The crockpot is only one part of long, tedious preparations that take hours and tie up every pan in the kitchen. I suppose those who cook as a hobby may get something out of this book, but I just wanted some simple keto recipes for a crockpot.",

One could say you could switch that item for dairy alternative like coconut milk, but you have to also mix addition ingredients it\u2019s not a 1:1 swap.
