Nowhere on the website or documentation provided with the watch does it say that the feature must be turned on. Also if water damage voids the warranty, how can they claim that the watch can be submerged in water?",

I usually place it on the charger every night or every other night as a habit & not because it's running out of juice. The heart rate measurement is surprisingly accurate; it matched the reading done by the nurse on a recent doctor visit. One limitation is that I can't get an ECG trace yet awaiting a software update. Also, the free watch faces are limited. Samsung should make more available. Overall it's a great purchase.",

The apps connected with the watch are easy to use and can be rearranged and removed or added depending on what you want. The watch faces are customizable so you can make the phone fit your style. Notifications are easy to receive and answer. The active 2 also has lots of accessories like watch bands and screen protectors. I would recommend this watch.",

      "text": "I've never been much of a jewelry wearer but I have really come to love this watch. I got it for Christmas 2019. I carry my phone in my back pocket and so many times it is inconvenient to use it. I can check the time (of course), use it as a phone, send texts with it, track my daily steps, have the outside temp displayed, and also be able to change the look of the face/display with more choices than I could ever use in a lifetime. I can also access my contacts, measure my heart rate, there's an event calendar, alarm, and I get notifications. There's really nothing to not love about this watch.",

      "text": "It's fine if all you want is a smart watch that does sleep tracking. But if you expect accurate heart rate readings, forget it. As soon as I start exercising, my heart rate rapidly climbs to way higher than normal. I can put on 1 of my 2 other heart rate monitor and get much more normal readings. I have been using Polar products for decades and they are superb at heart rates. But since I have a Samsung phone, I thought I would try this. I will not make this mistake again. Stupid me, I waited 3 days too late to return it. I am terrible disappointed at this watch and at Samsung.",

Return it and got the Galaxy Active 2, and I'm impressed. The battery lasts for almost 48h and that includes wifi/BT always on, sleep tracking, and 40 min of music plus exercise tracking.
