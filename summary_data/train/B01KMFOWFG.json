I emailed the company and they didn\u2019t bother to respond. The basket no longer locks into the fryer so it will not run. You have the choice of holding it closed or using a piece of duct tape. Not exactly what I expected when I bought it. So my advice is to buy from a different company who may actually care about their products. The fact that they didn\u2019t even respond to my email says a lot about the company.",

Using cheap nonstick coating is one of the ways of cutting manufacturing costs. It is apparent that Simple Chef cut corners and produced a low quality appliance. Also, manufacturer information is not available online and the seller was unresponsive when I contacted them for the manufacturer's information. I do not recommend this product.",
