Little didn't I know that I would end up using it. It worked, and without it I would have been writing her obituary instead of this review. So my advice, stop wasting money on crap you don't need and buy something like this that you do need. It may just save yours, or someone you loves life.",

Though the battery life is expected for 4 years. And it does seem prudent to me now that a second backup battery would be a smart investment on such a safety device as this. One note about buying replacement batteries.....customer reviews on replacement batteries from different sellers seem to be all over the place. I recommend going straight to Phillips and buying their OEM battery directly from Phillips.",

Hope I won't have to use it but it gives me a great peace of mind knowing it is available if needed. Although it's expensive, I don't think I could live with myself if someone I know died and I didn't even try to save them just because of cost. After all, don't those we love have lives that are priceless? What's a little financial sacrifice in the short term for potential long term happiness?",

      "text": "We hope to never have to use this defibrillator, but if we ever do, it appears to be very straight forward and easy to use. There is an excellent short video that comes with it explaining its use and the product itself seems extremely well made and researched in order to make saving a person's life (not the calmest of experiences) an easy to understand process. It is also lightweight and compact. If we ever have to use it and it is succesful in saving a loved ones life, you can be sure we will be writing another rave review.",
