Buying through Amazon was easy. The installer called the next day and we had the new washer/dryer installed within 3 days of order! The install and haul away worked great. We had already removed the door to the laundry room and moved the old appliances because we wanted to clean up the area really well, so install and removal only took the guys about 30 mins.",

When the load is spinning, it goes so fast that it sounds like a helicopter above our house. It's not annoying, it only proves the quality of the machine. Simply add the clothes, add detergent, fabric softener (optional), and bleach (optional); then select the cycle, and you may adjust water temperature, soil level, and spin speed. I expect this machine to last many more years.",

We never had the steam function on the old dryer so only after the new unit was installed that we found out that an additional water line was needed. Not a major problem as we can buy from AZ the necessary parts and DIY install. The problem was, it was very tight space and we were naive enough to believe that all necessary parts for hook up were included and provided by the installers. In addition, the installers came with a Ryder truck and were very rude and unprofessional. We are from Connecticut so your installer might be different.",

      "text": "WOW! This machine is terrific! Have had it for exactly 30 hours. If you read the manual you\u2019ll understand how it works best. And boy oh boy does it work! We just moved into the house last week and it seems I haven\u2019t done laundry in about a month. I did all the accumulated clothing, plus all the packing towels, and 5 sets of sheets in a day. Everything came out perfectly. Love how large it is. Love how you get the countdown timer. Love the accelerated wash cycle. I have Not used the steam setting yet. I know It\u2019s very soon, but I think I\u2019m going to love this machine.",

      "text": "Best washer on the market in my opinion. I had purchased a Maytag front load machine that gave up the ghost after 3 years. My brother let me use his Kenmore elite until I replaced mine, and I was hooked. The capacity is huge so I'm down to 3-4 loads per week with a large family. Having it delivered and installed through Amazon was a breeze, and saved us $80 over the local guys.",
