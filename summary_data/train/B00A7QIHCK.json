      "title": "A worthy alternative to the kit zoom lens",
      "text": "A beautiful little prime lens for the Micro Four Thirds system, roughly equivalent to 35mm on Full Frame. Build quality is excellent, with a metal barrel and lens mount, and an encouragingly positive clunk to the mechanism that disengages the AF clutch to put you into MF territory. Low light performance is great, decent bokeh and sharp throughout. Olympus OM-D and PEN cameras have Image Stabilisation built into the camera bodies, so bear in mind there'll be no IS on for e.g. a Panasonic body. It's my goto lens for use with both my PEN F and EPL-7, and a more than worthy alternative to the kit zoom lenses.",

      "text": "The one niggle I have about this otherwise delightful Micro Four-Thirds lens is the lack of an auto-focus feature common to all other lenses acquired for my main photo-taking system (Lumix and Olympus compact SLRs). You should therefore measure or judge 'nearer to camera' distances with greatest care, to ensure sharp focus, especially in low-light situations.",

I can't fault this lens but I did have to buy a lens hood for it from Amazon. If you have an EM5, just watch how you have set up your manual focus as so far, I don't see any use for the manual focus on the lens as you can't see an enlarged view in the viewfinder. Will have to read the user manual again. Very happy with my purchase and a great price from Amazon.",
