I have a big projector screen, which is awful for trying to calibrate Wii remotes. This means that I have to look at the cursor on screen as opposed to looking down the barrel of this gun. When it comes to the immersion factor I'd probably be just as happy with a $6 Zapper. If you have a really big TV or projector screen then this isn't worth the money.",

So, if you are just playing a rail-type game which does not use the nunchuck, it is fine, although the handle is a bit big. Otherwise, stay away. Nerf also has a gun that converts a wiimote into a one handed pistol. It seems to be better built than this product. Plus, you get a Nerf gun!",

The PerfectShot performs as advertised, but my big complaint is that the sights don't zero with the screen. Because of this it is very unnatural to use as when you go to shoot something, your natural reaction is too look down the sights and pull the trigger. When you do this your shot is way off target. You would better off using your Wii's controller.",

The Perfect Shot on the other hand is just that, perfect. Easy to control and aim. The only draw back is with the game in general. It is not a light gun, because that is not how the Wii works. Which can make it difficult at time to aim correctly but with practice comes progress. If you are looking a gun for the Wii, this blows the Zapper out of the water. Not to mention shooting games are extremely fun.",

While the Zapper is too small, made for the grip of an 8 year old, the Perfect Shotgun was clearly designed for an adult hand. And the aiming (House of the Dead & Umbrella Chronicles) is very good. The only drawback with any accessory is that not all Wii games are compatible. Make sure before you buy a game that it's compatible with one or all gun accessories. Resident Evil 4 heartbreakingly is not :(",

I tried calibrating it in the Wii menu but it's still not that accurate. I think this is an inherent problem in the Wii but not something that's explained anywhere. Reloading via the nunchuk is a nice feature.",

I play Ghost Squad without cursor sights on and it's great! Very much like being at the arcade.

They needed to make the but of the gun slimmer so it would fit in your hand better. A real gun's but is not that fat so why did they make this gun's that way.

The controller sits in the gun angled slightly off. As a result, the point of aim is about 6\" to a foot above the point of aim.

The game makes use of several buttons on the Wiimote, but the Wii Perfect makes it difficult at best to get to those buttons with the split second timing required. Overall, its not a bad purchase for anyone I don't think, but with certain games can have a ruinous effect on the overall experience.",

The spring loaded trigger also make your trigger finger tire much faster. This does, however, add to realism, and overall challenge if you are looking for it.

Unlike the Zapper, this gun feels sturdy and is way way easier to aim with than the Zapper. So far, I've only played it with House of the Dead, but its been extremely fun. I highly recommend this gun over the Zapper or the Wii Remote alone.",
