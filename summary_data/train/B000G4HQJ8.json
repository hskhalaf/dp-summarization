So, if you are satisfied with how the Nike PG2 performs, then this shoe will surely be OK for you. In fact, this considered a good precursor to the critically acclaimed Nike PG3.",

I have pair of original Jordan \"quilted\" sneakers from the 70's I think that I wore maybe twice because his foot is too different from mine. They were great walking down the aisle of airplanes and having everyone staring at them, but nothing to compare with the comfort of these PG 2.5s. Paid exorbitant amount because they are getting rare, but could not let this pair pass.",

What arrived were the grey pair my son wanted. All i can say, accident or intentional, is thank you. He's as giddy as a little school girl with a new pair of shoes! The shoes look great. Tongue lights up. Son swears they fit well. Appear to be designed to hug the foot/ankle for minimal slip.",

The large metal eyelet sits right on top of my ankle bone, rubbing the skin away during most lateral movements. Even with a sock covering the ankle, the shoes are still painful. Wearing a low cut no show sock is not an option for me wearing these shoes. I wouldn't purchase these again.",
