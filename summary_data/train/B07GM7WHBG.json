During the day when I'm not tracking exercise the HR monitor seems OK, but once I start an exercise the HR monitor is very inaccurate. During an intense workout where I'm short of breath and sweating (and probably between 150 and 180 bpm), the HR monitor says I'm between 60 and 90 bpm. Display and band are very small and difficult to use or put on if you have bigger fingers. Overall, I'm very disappointed in this product and will be returning it.",

I do wish the battery lasted longer than 5 days... but when charging only takes like 2hrs. I always just put it on to charge while I'm in the shower or early morning when I'm having coffee while the kids sleep. Fast charging!!! I loved it so much I bought my husband one about 4 days ago.",

Keeps very accurate for my steps and knows when I am doing my treadmill at the gym. Charge lasts about 4 to 5 days depending on how active you are. App for the smart phone gives you a great view of everything. Very nice device!!!",
