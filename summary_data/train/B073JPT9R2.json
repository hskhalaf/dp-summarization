The noise level could be better, but it's still not terrible, and because the control is on the front and can be turned 360degrees to turn the fan on, up, down, or off- I can adjust it even in the middle of the night without looking. Puts out a really decent amount of air even on low, and keeps cool air circulating really really well. . Will DEFINITELY buy another if we ever need another tabletop/desktop fan.",

On the whole, considering all the cheap crap out there, it is worth the $42. Glenn",
