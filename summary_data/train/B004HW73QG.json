      "text": "Bought this camera for work as I needed something relatively cheap that I could throw in my laptop bag without worrying about damaging it, yet also took good pictures. This is working out great. The auto function is perfect for going right from shooting a picture of a car from far away right to getting a close detailed macro shot of a part label/serial number without having to mess with the settings. Picture quality is good for a camera at this price. Have had camera for almost 2 months now and haven't had to charge the battery yet, although I don't use it every day or for long periods of time. Very happy with this purchase.",

The layout is basically the same as my old one so I didn't have much to learn,there is a learning curve with any new device,so take the time to play with it to understand how it works. The pictures are great,there is a difference from what you see on the LCD to uploading to your computer, but have some fun with it. I'm happy with it but all my cameras are Canons as are my printers. :)",

It doesn't delay shots as 530 did, waiting for the flash to charge. Not sure if it is plus, as because of this more opportunity of low quality photos with poor lighting. That is, you should control it yourself, not rush when taking photos. It was 8GB memory card included, charger, and 1 square battery.",

I would spend the extra money and get a camera that is capable of recording 1080p video as well, and that isn't made entirely of plastic.",

Of course we can also just photo shop the lightning and all but I don't want to do that for every shot with this camera. Natural lighting was fine.",

Canon tried to charge us for the repair because we only had the Amazon receipt. After some back and forth they finally decided they would repair it at no charge but didn't have the parts to repair the camera and sent us a replacement free of charge. It turned out OK, but was a bad experience that shouldn't have been that way. The shipping to send it back for repairs cost us an additional $16. We wish we hadn't made the original purchase.",
