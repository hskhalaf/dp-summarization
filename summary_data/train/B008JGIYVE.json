Make sure to follow the quarterly cleaning instructions to avoid any unnecessary clogging (and a fairly disgusting cleanup job after) and that the \u201cout\u201d line doesn\u2019t have to work hard through a too high placed tube. Roughly 4ft seems optimum, anymore can break the pump it seems. Saved a lot of money on an older model, enough to warrant a second purchase when a mishap managed to break the old one. Worth every penny, and especially with a cat that refuses to use a box with only one clump in it.",

My only complaint is that it is a little small for a multi-cat household--I wish there was a larger size you can order, but this is the only size available currently. Also, the scented cartridge is a bit too strong. I have ordered the unscented for the refill.",

I would love to put this in my laundry room but my washer actually drains into my pond and did not want the waste going into my pond so it takes up a good portion of my bathroom but is definitely worth it. No issues so far and the instructions have detailed how to for common problems. My last auto clean box was no where near as nice and lasted two months before it broke. This is well built and hope it last a really long time.",

The problems with it are that the fill hose leaks (not much, but enough to leave a puddle once a day) and it doesn't dry the litter at all. Since the litter is always damp, the cats refuse to use it. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ITEM. YOU WILL REGRET IT. You will spend plenty of time trying to get it to work and wind up frustrated like me, giving the product bad reviews online. Please don't wind up like me. Avoid purchasing this piece of cat poop.",

    "description": "Style:Cat BoxCatGenie, The world's only self-washing cat box. You will never touch, change or buy cat litter again. The CatGenie Secret? Washable Granules, not litter. Collecting cat waste in a box of litter is unsanitary. Cleaning the mess out is unpleasant and carrying heavy cat litter in and of the home is just a waste. The CatGenie is dust, germ, odor, and litter free and automatically washes, sanitizes and dries itself. CatGenie has a Two-Year Warranty. Easy DIY set-up. Recommended setup locations: Bathroom (toilet) -If you have a rigid water line in your bathroom, you may need to replace it with a flexible one) or Utility/laundry room. When you purchase the CatGenie, everything needed to make your home litter free is included: The only tools needed are a wrench or a pair of pliers. Some non-standard hookups may require additional parts not provided by PetNovations, Inc. Included supplies should last 2-3 months for 1 cat and about 2 months for two cats. Several custom Cat Activation Choices- Cat 1 - 14 straight hours active, 10 hours sleep time (you choose when it is on) with a 10 minute delay after the cat uses it to clean Cat 2 - 14 straight hours active, 10 hours sleep time (you choose when it is on) with a 30 minute delay. For multiple cats giving them time to use it before it cleans Cat 3- 24-hours active, with a 10-minute delay after the cat uses it to clean Cat 4 \u2013 24-hours active with a 30-minute delay. For multiple cats giving them time to use it before it cleans The CatGenie is the greenest cat box ever and quite possibly, the most economical. The plastic in the SaniSolution Cartridge is recyclable (unlike cat litter). Each cartridge holds 120 washes and when set on Cat Activation provide 240 washes (A year supply of Cartridges takes up less space and uses less plastic than one container/1 month's supply of cat litter).",
