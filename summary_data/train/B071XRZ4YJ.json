I bought a watch kit to help shorten the links and broke the tool asap. I finally was able to shorten 1 side and now I clasp it further to 1 end rather than trying to shorten the other side. BUT, it was worth the work cause you can't get much cheaper than the cost of this watch.",

And if you didn't want to do it yourself you could always take it to a jeweler who has all the special tools",

My wrist is very small therefore my husband took out 4 links. If I buy another watch I would try a little wider and heavier band. I need to revise my review. After one week this watch stopped working. I still gave it two stars because the watch and band are nickel free and did not give me any allergy. I hate to go through the return process now.",
