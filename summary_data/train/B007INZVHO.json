Later in the day it was 70 and they weren't hot. Moves and flexes without bunching or pulling. Velcro held really well. Only negative is that the tip of the trigger finger is just a little bulky so putting your finger into the trigger guard area isn't 100% smooth. But I would recommend and buy again if needed. Might just go with the next size down.",

The major cons for me, the little finger is to long and the material doesn't let me bunch it. The seam on the inside of the pointer fingers is too thick. It's annoying but for half the price and double the durability I'll take these over the other brands.",
