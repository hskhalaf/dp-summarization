I have tried suturing on bananas, pillow case, chicken breast... not the best experience. I wish I knew these practice kits exist before! The kit came with full set of essential tools and nylon threads. I was able to practice all the primary knots over and over again to get a steady hand and become much more competent. The attending physician complemented me on how well I know my knots now and that my hand movement has become much more confident and techniques much more professional. Thanks!",

For practicing interrupted suture, running suture, matress (Donati) and other types of \"epidermal\" surface are excellent! The nylon sutures run a bit more \"stuck\" than in real skin. Silk runs well. For practicing deep dermal suture I think needs improvement since the \"dermal\" component is very stiff and no undermining is possible; hence, is hard to approximate the \"dermis\". Bottom line: I would totally use this to train first-year dermatology residents on skin suturing but it's not realistic for deep sutures.",

      "text": "I am a 3rd year medical student and got this kit to practice my sutures. It is a great kit, the practice suture pad is a great quality and has held up with multiple uses. The suture kit has all of the tools you need to practice your sutures. Finally, the suture itself is great, the best part is the nylon is 75cm so you are able to practice a lot of knots with just one suture.",

I bought this a year ago and took it out now that I'm on my surgical rotation. The material is so flimsy and fragile that even a 5.0 mono tore the skin while trying to practice a simple buried suture. Even moreso, the pickups are extremely poorly made and even when gripping my hardest, the space created is too big for the needle and the needle ends up falling out. When I tried using something bigger, the thick needle tore through the skin. Sorely disappointed with how much I paid for this piece of trash.",

Had some issues with sutures pulling through with the material but again, I think that is to be expected with the silicone material. I especially like that it sticks to a counter or table so it's not sliding around while you're trying to work.",

    "title": "Complete Suture Practice Kit for Suture Training, Including Large Silicone Suture Pad with pre-Cut Wounds and Suture Tool kit (25 Pieces). 2nd Generation Model. (Demonstration and Education Use Only)",
    "description": "Our large suture pad (17 cm x 17 cm) is a great suture practice tool and can be used for extra practice, study or teaching. The suture pad is made of the highest quality silicone material, comes with three layers of tissue: skin, muscle and fat, providing the next best anatomical simulation to practice on, after an actual human flesh or a dead animal. There are 14 cuts of various types (10 types), width and depth and lots of space to add additional cuts. \n\nOur suture pad has been redesigned and improved after medical students used it and came up with ways to improve the product - students are the primary users of our product, so who to trust if not the actual user? Our latest product update features a built in \"mesh layer\" between the skin and the fat layer, making the pad more durable and long lasting. \n\nMoreover, you are getting a complete package of tools needed to practice suturing and no need to look for other essentials. For a moderate price you get a great value! In the suture kit you get: \n\nLarge suture pad with wounds \nHegar needle holder \nAdson forceps \nSuture scissors \nScalpel blades (3-pack) \nSuture thread (16-pack) \nStorage case with zipper \n\nSo convenient and helps to keep you organized in a world of exams, study and school life chaos! \n\nThe suture practice set can be used for: \n\nExams and study practice \nTeaching demonstrations \nPractice before starting a real job or residency \n\n\nNOTE: This product is for demonstration purposes only and is not intended for use on humans or animals.",
