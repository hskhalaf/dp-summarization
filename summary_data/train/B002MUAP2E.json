      "text": "This inexpensive but well-designed razor holder makes it possible for me to shave my back with any razor of my choice, including the fast, effective wide double bladed razor provided. But I also like the idea that nearly any razor easily slips into the flexible rubber sleeve. My wife has already borrowed this for leg shaving that can now be done with less reaching. This looked like a good idea when I was considering alternatives and that's been proven in practice. I was concerned about the length, but it's plenty long and the razor can readily be positioned at different angles giving me plenty of reach to any part of my back. Well done, whoever designed this thing.",

Beyond that, it took a bit of time to understand the coordination involved, but it turned out well. The razor did not spin around or give me fits - the head did hold it very well. Off I went - still use it on my back to this day.",

Kids typically use these. Just slide the grip onto the handle's end (may need to stretch it), and it may be able to thicken your razor's handle enough so that it will stay in place in the Razorba during use. --Give it a try.",

      "text": "Overall a pretty cool item that solves a lot of guys problems. I would give it 5 stars but, I'm not very fond of how the razor attaches to the Razorba. I found the razor moving out of position sometimes. It is easier to use with a razor that does not have a pivoting head like a Gillette Good News. Perhaps if the attaching portion were adjustable it would ease some of the frustration with the razor moving about. Nevertheless less, it takes some getting used to but it works pretty well!",

One caveat - if you're very hairy (as I was) you'll probably want someone to do your first clean shave for you, and then use the Razorba to maintain after that point.",
