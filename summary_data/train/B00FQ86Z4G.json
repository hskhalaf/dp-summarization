EDIT: It does have a zip to throw it in the wash, but it's hard to get back onto the foam square. And it still feels like sticky peepee.",

She performed her circle dance before settling into sleep very day and the pad held together just fine. Sure, the furry cover could be a bit denser, but we have had no bare spots to contend with. I ordered a second pad only because the gutters overflowed and my garage flooded. The pad got wet and was going to take many winter days to dry out. I ordered a new pad to avoid risking mold of any kind as the result of slow drying out.",

The cover is nice and plush, and even though it says spot clean, I'm sure it will do fine on delicate cycle and air dry. I'm totally happy with this bed because Myrrh loves it. That's what matters most to me.",

Over a couple of washes the cover shrank and the shape warped making it very difficult to fit over the foam. Soon enough, the cover ripped and I had to throw it away! It would be great if the manufacturer made the cover out of a different material and/or place the zipper in a different location (i.e. the seam). Where the zipper is makes it difficult to put the cover back on because you have to fold the foam in 2 and stuff it in. Hence, the tear in mine. Will not be purchasing again!",
