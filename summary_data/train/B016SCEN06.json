I love that I know exactly what's going on my sensitive, acne prone skin. I leave this on for about 30 minutes after I cleanse my face and notice that my skin is immediately moisturizer and glowing. Vitamin c is supposed to help with hyperpigmentation and sun spots so I'm hoping to see some results after I use all of the masks. Going to try the Greek yogurt mask next:)",

My skin feels so hydrated and I feel like some wrinkles go faint.

I\u2019m 40+ woman living in dry Los Angeles and this is the only sheet mask that is fully hydrating enough to make a real difference on my skin. I applied it before bed and took it off after 25 minutes and then I covered my skin with face oil that I use to lock the moisture longer. On next morning, I definitely noticed my skin fully hydrated and plumped. It is worth giving it a try as a mini home-spa!",

It's mask design is a little bit different in a way that it allows firm holding on my face. Also it has lot of liquids so that I can apply it with my neck. After a week usage, I felt a difference! My skins are much more moisturized than before. I definitely recommend this to anyone (don't worry about allergic reactions, as they use 'organic' materials and the mask works for me who has sensitive skin) and will buy it again for my family!",

She said this is the finest mask she's ever used, the main thing she likes is how all of the liquid is still in the mask when you take it out of the package and not in the bottom of the package, and the how the mask is nearly bone dry after taking it off so you know the liquid absorbed into your skin.
