      "text": "If this camera would have broken during the 1 yr warranty, I'd be positive about it. But, as soon as the warranty expired, it broke. First, it stopped charging the battery. With a dead camera, it's impossible to download the firmware fix. Found someone with the same camera and borrowed their battery. Download was successful. But that lasted about 1 month. Won't turn on. Before this latest breakdown, the display would show \"Auotfocus\" and then \"Scene\" back and forth and I missed most of my shots waiting for it to settle down. Focus was slow and poor. Now they want at least $137.50 plus shipping for repair, if they can fix it. I'm done with Nikon products.",

The only reason for the four stars is that one of the major reasons I chose this camera was the wifi capabilities. You're supposed to be able to send photos from the camera to your iphone (the app is not available on ipad) by connecting the two. However, this worked only once, the app constantly crashes, even if you're just trying to send one photo. Since this was a major selling point for me personally, I'm pretty disappointed that it doesn't work AT ALL.",

Wi Fi Software Nikon provides is a little wonky, and it took me a while figure out - software needs major overhaul Nikon!! It has a built in flash, but no hot shoe probably because camera used for outside work mostly. Camera is certainly not compact, but it is much smaller than typical DSLR.",

      "text": "Camera just does not perform well. Considering the optics and the camera name, I was disappointed in the poor quality electronic viewfinder as it takes forever to zoom, focus, and record images even with high speed class 10 memory cards. Images are inconsistent and the fact that the battery has to be charged in the camera is another negative. If you are considering a super zoom, look to the Sony hx400 as it has same zoom but viewfinder is user friendly, and images are better.",

Also the camera was defective, and I when I sent it in to Nikon for repair, they told me it was refurbished, not NEW as it was stated to be. I will not purchase from DAILYBARGAINS ever again. Fortuantely, I purchased the warranty and recieved a refund from the warranty company. I gave up the super zoom and decided to go with a DSLR instead.",
