I will agree with a previous reviewer, this is not a great one for action shots.. the delay throws me off. Or maybe there is a setting for action that I haven't gotten to; I'm certainly still learning. I've had pretty good luck with the photos that I've taken: mostly just macro-stills for website stuff. I can see that a larger screen might be more desirable. All in all, I wouldn't choose anything else.",

However, its' macro ability is non-existent. That is one of the main reasons I buy a camera. My favorite cameras for that feature are Olympus, and I am about to buy a new one. I gave the Nikon 2 stars because it is compact and I carry it with me every day so I can leave my more valued cameras safe at home.",

Purchased rechargeables which took about 40-60 pictures and movies(I deleted so many practicing, it's a fun camera!). The pictures were really sharp compared to my previous 2mp camera. Really like the movie clip quality and sound. Fit in the palm of my hand(camera only, no case) and the strap is a very handy. Easy to upload pictures. Haven't used all the features. I am very pleased so far. I gave a 4 because I would like to have had a larger lcd. But,I chose the quality rep and the great price.",

The video feature stinks, it is literally a series of photos being taken, and when played back on computer, it's so grainy it's hardly worth bothering with. Outside photos are fantastic, but, inside photos tend to be grainy. I'll be buying another brand the next time around. I do like having to use AA batteries, but have to replace often. Sheesh, I guess I like this camera a lot less than I thought! I think I'll go back to Kodak.",

Forget the action shots, impossible. I am now looking to purchase the Sony cybershot and sell this one on Ebay.",

      "text": "I bought the Nikon Coolpix 7600 for Christmas and decided to return it. It takes pictures of very impressive quality and the buttons are straight forward and easy to use. BUT, there is a significant lag time when you take a photo with flash, at least 5 seconds. That does not seem like a lot but when you're trying to take pics fast, you don't have the 5-7 seconds. MOST IMPORTANTLY: it drains batteries like a tank drains its gas tank. It's unreal, I used brand new batteries and they were DONE after 25 pictures. (Some other camera's batteries can last up to 400 pics). Anyway, it's a great camera but the engineers at Nikon haven't thought it through.",

I've used it for family pictures, night shots, even surgery pictures (I'm a surgeon) and I'm very impressed about the quality pictures this \"little toy\" makes. I had a little doubt about this camera because of the \"blurry\" critics, but this only happens when you use the camera without a tripode of a flat surface in the circumstances in which the instruction manual tells you that it's necesary. About battery life... get some good rechargable ones and problem solved. I also recommend the 1GB SD memory card... you'll be very happy. Thanks amazon and nikon for such a good product",
