It's high quality and leaves my skin so soft and hydrated. It feels extremely healing and soothing to put this on. What I like most is that it does NOT leave my skin oily - it totally absorbs and I can put makeup on top of it without any problems. I\u2019ve tried other facial oils that leave my skin oily and my makeup melting from it! I also looooove the scent ... it smells like a spa! Highly recommend!!!",
