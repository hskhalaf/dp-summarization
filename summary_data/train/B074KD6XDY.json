I have been sent 2 replacements since I purchased this back in March and it hardly ever works and that is about the only thing I can count on. Step count off, stair count off, and the GPS has NEVER worked or it takes 20 minutes to pair up with a satelite and I live in the city. I can honestly say this has been the biggest waste of money I have ever spent on any sporting equipment, save yourself a headache and buy something else.",

I am guessing the barometer is broken but there is nothing I can do to fix it. I suspect the pedometer is not the best too.
