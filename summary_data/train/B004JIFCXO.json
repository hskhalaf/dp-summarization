I give it 5 stars!\" :) After verifying with the manufacture that this product does not contain wool yarn (which we have a serious allergy to), I purchased 2 of the Creativity for Kids Quick Knit Looms- one for my daughter, and one for myself- to learn a new handicraft skill. My daughter took to it immediately, her first time ever, and has been successfully knitting on both small and large included looms. The included paper instructions and online YouTube instructional videos make this product truly a quick and easy-to-learn craft. Thank you Faber-Castell for another kid and mother approved product!",

This loom makes knitting much less frustrating than trying with two needles, and allowed him to be almost completely self sufficient (I helped with the beginning stitches and removing the project and attaching tassels). This a great product to teach knitting and will introduce any child to crafts with yarn.",

You need to add a little plastic storage container for the small items, including the hook, which will make this simply perfect.",
