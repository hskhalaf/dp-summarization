Others have complained about scratches appearing, which I have had one. The scratch was also my fault and what happened would have scratched any surface! Those complaining of scratches just don't know how to take care of their floors in general. I love this and would purchase again! Oh, and it covered about 675sf.",

      "text": "This is an amazing product. I bought a bottle last year and didn't need another one until recently. Put the wax down last year, and touched up 6 months later.My floor was originally no wax linoleum put down 12 years ago, but it was not shiny any more and was difficult to keep clean. After using the wax, my floor looks brand new. It's high gloss and I can see the reflection of my furniture on it. It's also much easier to keep clean. I mop it once a week..no wax. Good as new. Highly r eco mended. I get lots of compliments on how good the floor looks.",
