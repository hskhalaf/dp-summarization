I\u2019ve learned how to get on and can do a little coasting. The skate is a little wobbly though. Also a friend tried to flip it and it slightly cracked. After comparing with my nephew\u2019s board I\u2019d say that if you\u2019re looking for something for the long term, go to an actual shop that specializes in boards: it\u2019s worth the investment. Overall though I\u2019m pretty happy with what I\u2019ve been able to learn with this skateboard.",
