I bought another similar bag for my little dogs that was much more stylish like a designer purse.. but both my dogs hated it, and the straps hurt me and were awkward. This bag may not be designer but both pups (separately) loved it and could easily fall asleep too. Neither one tried to get out like with the other bag. It has pockets on both sides very useful for bags toys and treats.",
