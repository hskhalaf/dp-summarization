I finally had to give up on it when after less than a week, it would no longer arm. I would arm it, exit, go back in and it would be unarmed. I restarted a few times to no avail. A factory reset might work, but I don't have time to play around with it. Bottom line is I need a higher quality and stable device. BTW - their support is pretty good if you need to call about an issue.",
