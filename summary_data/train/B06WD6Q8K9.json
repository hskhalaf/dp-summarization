You can set schedules for then so they can turn lights on and off. Our Alexa is right by the front door and when entering late at night we can just tell Alexa to turn on the lights and our path is lit all the way upstairs. In the morning during winter we use an Echo Dot upstairs to turn the lights on. So easy. We love these little gems! Would buy again and probably will.",

I use mine with my Alexas. I have bought several more since my initial purchase. Highly recommend if smart control using Alexa is your thing.",

The on/off button is hard to reach in certain places and this was a perfect way to control the lighting. This works especially well for the lights that do not have bulbs but small LEDs. I really love how I can remotely turn on/off the plugs. Pairing was super easy, and even easier with Google Assistant. Now I can control the lighting via plug switch, the app, and by google voice! I highly recommend this over the smart bulbs as these last longer and offer more flexibility in how you use them.",

If the smart plug was in the ON status before the power outage, it will return to the ON status after the power is restored. There is no setting to make this happen, it just does it by itself.",
