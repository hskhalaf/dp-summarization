All three panels came damaged on multiple corners(Please see Pics) The Box came without a mark so I doubt it occurred in transit. The damage occurred after painting because the paint is chipped on the cracks. What is most upsetting is that someone packed these and shipped a damaged product. The product itself is good and after spending an hour with a rubber mallet and wood blocks I was able to straighten out the panels enough to mate on installation.",

Went with the stainless steel slat style pegboard slots that also works with the old style pegs on the round holes. Got four panels 36\" x 16\" Black panels with Black accessories. The whole board measures 36\" high x 64\" wide. Tools look like they are floating. This is heavy duty and not cheap. Comes in different colors (white, orange, yellow, galvined, red, blue, and black). Scratch resistant and easy to clean. You can mix and match colors for accessories. Easy to install and looks great. Wife loves it. Awesome product.",

You only get 10 square feet of pegboard space with every 3 panels. That means it's 10 bucks a square foot to go this route (accessories considered). I'm fighting the urge to buy more of this stuff so that everything matches because it's just so expensive, and if you use your pegboard wall properly, you're not even going to see that nice glossy powdercoat underneath all your tools. My suggestion: know yourself and think ahead before buying this.",

These are a great idea but the little details of quality are sadly lacking. I bought 2 sets for some benches and while I like the way they will function the quality could stand to be improved. If anything the shipping box need better protection. Dented panels when opened means headache and time waste for installers.",

I DO wish there were more accessories, especially for larger handle tools. But it's a good start for organizing your tools if you want something on your wall. The black color is really nice looking. My one real complaint? Some of the accessories arrived with the insert tabs crooked or bent. Not a big deal, I fixed them with a hammer. But hammering the pieces removes the black paint, so it's not ideal.",

The shelves provide nice storage for sewing iron and accessory boxes, the long thin hooks are great for rolls of tape or ribbons. The small hooks offer a place to hang metal pails at the bottom of the board. Not only are do regular pegboard hooks and baskets work, there is the great option to use powerful heavy duty neodymium magnets to hang scissors, magnetic spice racks for large cone spools and my small drill, magnetic spice tins to store thread spools and a magnetic paper towel holder--all available on Amazon.

The included mounting hooks for tools are so much better than the standard pegboard hooks that are commonly used. The metal will last a long time, and having a choice of colors is a very nice touch! Overall, this is a great investment and I can highly recommend it.",

They need to be spaced a part just a tiny bit. Oh, and don't just assume since you found the studs on the first one that you are going to end up on a stud every time, I guess builders aren't quite as consistent in some homes. Sometimes I just put one of the screws in at an angle and caught the stud. Great Product!",

As far as installation.... easy, appearance when installed.... good, operation..... some hangers don\u2019t sit as tight as others and might come loose as they do on a standard peg board.

Unfortunately I bought a lot of standard pegs before I realized this, so that was an unnecessary headache. With that said, their proprietary peg system works great and I highly recommend it if you're only going to use those. Actually, the reason I'm writing this review is because I'm back to buy another after having one for the past year, I just won't be picking up any standard pegs this time around.",

Everyone that sees my workbench instantly asks about them. Look great and the hooks are phenomenal.

Took a total of about a half hour to install after unboxing, checking contents and reading instructions. Mounting hardware included is grately appreciated and made the install a breeze. Great end result. The included accessories fit the kit well and is about all I would have use for in my space. Good deal!",

To be fair thought, this is metal and can be easily molded back to normal using a mallet or hammer.

      "text": "Very happy with mine. I like the fact that it's metal more than I thought because I'm using small magnets to hang some of my small tools. I bought the kit, which is great. I also bought a set of standard peg board pegs and they don't seem to work great on this board although I haven't tried to use them very hard because I don't really need them because the slot type hangers that came with the set work very well. Overall I highly recommend.",
