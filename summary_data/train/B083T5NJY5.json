Not shaped or padded. offers no protection. Had to buy a third party case. This bothered me so much I removed a star. Note: Noise cancelling is focused on low frequency noise letting higher frequencies through. This is both a pro and a con depending on the situation.",

Worked well on everything so far background rumbles and aircraft noise us cancelled well with only the edge taken out of people talking. Battery. Seems good haven't had it run out yet ( i usually charge it overnight every two to three days) if you don't need bt and noise cancelling theres better for a 1/3 the price by sennheiser themself. In summary it is good and is mainly about the active noise cancelling and bt than pure sound",

      "title": "Good headphones, if noise-cancellation isn't your primary need",
      "text": "These headphones deliver very good, balanced sound without overdoing it on the bass or the treble. They are great choice for classical music as well. The noise cancelling feature is somewhat effective, but there are better choices on the market if that's your primary concern. While using noise cancellation, there is an audible hiss - this however gets covered up when you play music, so only an issue during very quiet periods. My main point of criticism is that these headphones are not great for people with large heads. The width is adjustable, but if you have a large head (like me), then it will be pulling up on your ears, which does get uncomfortable with prolonged listening.",

Not suitable for calls (wireless mode) as they just amplify all surrounding noise. Wireless mode has a constant beep that never goes away, had them replaced once but still the same issue. LOOK FOR ALTERNATIVES and don't fall for the trap of the 450BT. Abysmal from Sennheiser.",

Sound quality is everything you would expect from Sennheiser, and I am wearing this thing fort hours while working and barely notice it, so it is very comfortable (if you have a head like me, at least)",

The ear pads are too small, my ears do not fit inside comfortably. Poor design. A waste of my \u00a3130. AVOID!",
