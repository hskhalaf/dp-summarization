It has one large piece in the body vs two as the other models seem to have. It may be more durable as well. It works fine with beets which are very hard so it should be easy for other things as well. When you clamp it down on the counter it really sticks, which is important for stability. Blades are sharp enough as well. Easy to assemble and disassemble for cleaning.",

After reading some of the NEGATIVE reviews, I was hesitant about buying it and then after ordering it, I wondered if I\u2019d wasted my money and wind up manually shredding until my fingers bled. Well, I was more than pleasantly surprised when my little yellow grater/shredder performed like a pro with just feeding the chamber and cranking the handle. It got the job done, and I only lost a small slither of one fingernail.\ud83d\ude02",

Just make sure to clear the cheese after it is grated before you start the next piece or it squishes together and it takes some effort to clean out.",

My parmesan is imported and hard, wanted it grated easily. It worked hard at the grinding and it would be easier if the suction worked. I did grate the whole wedge so I have to give it credit of being able to grind though the cheese . The handle is hard to attach to the grinding wheel. I expect softer cheeses will go better. Because the suction does not hold I can't give it more rating. I will use it until I am too frustrated and start looking for something else. Directions would have helped.",

This is very small if I was not using fingerling potatoes, I would have to chop the potato to fit into the chamber. If I\u2019m chopping, I might as well go ahead and slice them by hand. Not for a larger tasks. Was very excited to put away my mandolin and use this handy unit but disappointed in the end. Love the color.",
