I just upgraded my tent to fit the extra width. If you want a cot that will have you sleeping like you are at home, or better, pick yourself up one of these cots. Trust me!",

It's my own fault for not checking dimensions. I've been sleeping on this every night for nine months, and it has easily held up to all its use. It's not extremely comfortable, but it's as comfortable as you could expect a cot to be. My own complaint is not with the cot itself, but with its carrying bag. The cot fits loosely in the bag. I was hoping it would be better than a large shopping bag.",

The cot is well made but I think the end spreader bars should have been made a bit more durable. It is relatively easy to set up but once you have it put together you cannot pick up one end and move it using the spreader bar. I use a inflatable mattress pad on top of the cot and that helps the comfort level and keeps me warm during the cooler nights. Without a pad you may get a bit chilly during colder weather in just a sleeping bag. Only time will tell on how durable it is.",

      "text": "This cot is awesome. I am 450lbs and go camping with the boyscouts a lot. This bed is comfortable and strong...it holds me no problem. When packed up it is large and heavy so you will not be hiking far with it. The bag also poorly accommodates the horizontal bar that the head and foot so i transport them separately. first installation is difficult because it is so tight, but once you get it in it will get easier. definitely a good buy. Some people have written that you need a pad to sleep on for comfort but i find it is just fine for a night or 2 without a pad.",

But I am amazed how well I sleep in it. I highly recommend this cot.",
