      "text": "I never thought I'd pay $100 for a set of in-ear earphones when I bought a pair of Shure SE215s several years ago. I'm still enjoying the 215s to this day, but the roll off on the high end was noticeable. I liked the comfort and the sound so much I wanted to try their bigger brother the SE535s to see if it improved on the high end. I wasn't disappointed - the 535s have a much better high end and a fuller mid-range. I really like them. However, there are some serious diminishing returns compared to their little brother. The 215s are 80% of the sound of these IEMs for about 25% of the price.",

Over the years the 3.5mm plug went bad, so I replaced the cable - easy and inexpensive. One ear phone broke by accident, and Shure replaced it for me.

I'm coming from a SE215, which typically sounded bass heavy and very light on the highs and mids. These definitely bring out the vocals and instruments you typically would not hear. It's nice that they give you multiple ear pieces, and I love that they create such a tight seal that they eventually become noise cancelling. One thing to watch out for is the cable can get snagged rather easily, but that can be easily avoided.",

The only reason I took a star away was because of its price and discomfort of the loop around the ear when moving around with the earphones in. The bendable plastic can irritate some listeners, but I can't say for all. The fit is great however. Owning the Triple Fi-10, I couldn't justify its price at 4 times, as I couldn't hear that major difference after switching through it several times. If you need an upgrade, may be worth trying, but make sure you're comfortable with it before you settle as it is quite a big investment.",

I listen to a lot of jazz, classical, and rock. The SE535s has remarkable fidelity; I'm hearing details I did not catch before. At least for my ear, and I would consider myself an average audiophile, the SE535s are the best in-ear phones I've heard.

Yes, the cables are proprietary and cost $25+ to replace, but compared to multiple hundreds of dollars for new earphones, it's an absolute steal. The cable quality is also vastly better than my previous Shures, making me think I won't have to replace the cables in the foreseeable future. So far so good!",

      "text": "I upgraded from SE212s that were getting a bit old. The price turned me off at first but I'm so glad I splurged. The low end is defined and not muddy at all. Mid-range is perfectly tuned. High end isn't tinny. These sound like my very expensive studio monitors. Other brands that pump up the bass end up destroying what the musician and producer originally intended. These earphones provide the truest experience. The sound quality is so good that I canceled my Spotify account because I could hear how compressed and lacking everything sounded. These earphones will highlight the good and the bad in the music you're hearing.",

      "text": "I moved up to the Shure SE535V earphones from the Shure SE210s, which are very good. The improvement in sound reproduction is quite remarkable. I am hearing things in music that is very familiar to me that I had not heard before. I use these earphones for listening to my iPod when on travel. I prefer the cable set up on the SE210s but that is a minor quibble. The price is a bit daunting but the quality of sound is worth the price. Superb earphones!",

Two weeks (!) later I received a package containing the left earphone from an SE425, the right from an SE535, and a less robust looking cord from some other model. I sent them all back and am now closing in on four weeks without headphones. Despite the awesome sound (particularly around the midrange), I can help but give these earbuds two stars due to the sheer incompetence of Shure's service department.",
