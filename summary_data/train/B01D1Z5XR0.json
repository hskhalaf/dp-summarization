Clumsy large and ....well useless. I love the fan. I am remodeling my house and put a fan box in the living room. In the summer my dog pants and gives me an approving node of thanks. The rod can be cut, I cut mine from 18 inches to 8. It really for the price is a not thought buy, the on;ly issues are the blades are metal and the rod might need to be cut and a hoel drilled for the retaining pin. No worries.",

Its just a matter of cutting to length and drill hole for the pins. The fan itself works very nicely for a singular directional fan. What I mean is it is not reversible and the controller is rather old resistor style. It may not be what you want for your livingroom, but works just fine for a garage or shop. I give it 4 stars only because of the short down rod and not reversible.",
