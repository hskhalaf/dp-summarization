      "text": "After many uses in lakes and ponds, the two Seahawk rafts that I purchased are still holding up perfectly well, with no punctures or deformations to notice. The included oars are also very durable, and don't bend when rowing vigorously. The \"3-person\" claim can be a bit of a stretch - two average adults fit comfortably, but things start becoming fairly cramped with three. I would recommend investing in a larger sized pump, as it does take a while to inflate the three separate chambers with the one included in the package. For the price, this is a great raft set.",

Definitely does not seat 4 adults. It's very sturdy and easy to maneuver. They only give you two oars to row with. It's best if you had 4 because it's not very aerodynamic, so if you can find 2 more it'll get you where you need to be quicker. It's a good buy for the price and very durabile.",

They barely get the boat moving.",

The material feels like those jumpy houses for kiddos. O ky downside may be that not all 5 of us might fit out on water. But who knows, I have yet to find out! But I love it! My man loves it! My 3 kids love it! Already thinking about buying another one!",

I did mods to it to help stability and comfort but have to say it's a good little boat. I will now purchase the motor mount to get a trolling motor. Rowing was easy. Yes it drifted in the wind but all boats do so not an issue. Met two other gents fishing the shore like I used to do, they now want one. My setup was purely for me fishing alone, 3 people I think would be a bit cramped 2 would be more comfortable.",
