      "text": "Absolutely loved this steamer when we first received it, until a couple of weeks ago. Unfortunately it is now falling apart. The part that holds the rack of the steamer in place has come completely out, and this is the part that the lid also attaches to. The 2 sections can no longer be safely stacked, and the lid only fits and stays on one section of the steamer, so instead of a double steamer we now only have a single steamer. Very disappointing... It is a great steamer, until it falls apart. 4 months seems way to soon for it to be already falling apart.",

I've so far used this steamer about 3 times within about 3-4 months and every time I touch the steamer, I get at least 2 splinters in my fingers. I guess you get what you paid for, this steamer is very cheap but that also means the bamboo aren't professionally crafted. You must wear gloves, or at least finger cots, if you are planning on even touching the steamer.",

Two things I would recommend getting, one is the pot adapter, so you don't have to use a frying pan or worry about water in the pot running out. 2nd are the cotton liners to place the dumplings on. I don't like using cabbage leaves as I have seen here before because I detest the taste of cabbage. Great product.",

    "title": "Helen Chen's Asian Kitchen 10\" Bamboo Steamer Basket",
    "description": "Easily steam vegetables, meats, seafood and more with this two tiered bamboo steamer with lid from Helen Chen's Asian Kitchen. This steamer features a sturdy two tiered bamboo design for long lasting durability. Attractive, lightweight, and harvested from a responsible, constantly replenished resource, bamboo is an ideal material for durability and versatility. Steamers accentuate the natural flavor of foods and retain the nutrients and vitamins while cooking with less fat and oil. Use the small steamer baskets as individual serving pieces right at the table. The steamer is designed to sit over another pot containing boiling water. As the water boils, the steam enters the steamer through the open slats in the bottom and is contained in the steamer by the lid. The bamboo steamer absorbs any condensation, keeping water from dripping back onto the food. When heated, it forms a hot container and, with the cover in place, can keep food warm for up to half an hour. This two tiered bamboo steamer with lid from Helen Chen's Asian Kitchen is the perfect addition to any kitchen.\n\n10\" diameter x 7-1/2\" H\n\nAMAZON.COM\nAn authentic tool for steaming vegetables and meats or serving dim sum at the table, this steamer from Helen Chen's Asian Kitchen line is crafted from tightly woven bamboo. In addition to being a sustainable material, bamboo is an effective steaming material because it traps steam, absorbs condensation, and retains heat. Here, the 100 percent natural bamboo slats are hand-woven into a layered cylindrical basket with a tightly constructed lid and secured with bamboo pegs. Tidy and attractive, the unit rests over a wok or, with a steaming ring, on a pot of boiling water to cook without fat or cumbersome equipment. Measuring 10 inches in diameter, the steamer is handcrafted, and detergent-free washing by hand is recommended. An instruction booklet with recipes is included. --Emily Bedard",
