Unfortunately, there was an issue that prevented an attachment from being removed from the base. There wasn't a question about replacing the item. I received the replacement processor in less than a week, along with a FedEx return label. Very happy to have my favorite food processor back i my kitchen.",

Shortly after getting someone on the line, (around 10 minutes and some hold music) we were told we\u2019d be sent a replacement after verifying our information. About a week and a half, we were sent a replacement and boy howdy, it\u2019s been hard at work ever since. With almost daily use, this has been an efficient upgrade and are happy with the processor. Highly recommend!!",
