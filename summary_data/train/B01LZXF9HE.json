The other molds I received are actually \"mini bears\" or even \"miniscule bears.\" This mold, if filled almost full (not completely topped off) will produce a size which is very close to the original gummi bears, once they've been properly dehydrated. Bears pop out pretty much effortlessly. I always give the very top and the feet and extra nudge. Adding a little Corn Syrup in place of a bit of the liquid helps prevent sticking, as does a bit of Citric Acid.",
