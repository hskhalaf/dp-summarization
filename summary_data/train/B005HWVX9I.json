This was so expensive to only last two uses. Of course, since I bought it in the summer (they have a tendency to be sold out or more expensive once fall hits), I'm outside of the 30 day return period and cannot find any way to contact the seller.",

You've seen those 3' x 5' rolled up blankets in the grocery stores, or at K-Mart.. they range from $4 -$7. I put one on TOP of this mattress pad, and then I put the sheet on the bed.

We can't say enough good things about the Electrowarmth bedwarmers.
