The only reason i gave 4 stars is that once the bamboo steamer get steamed and moisture soak in the bamboo will expand and causes one of the tier to elevate since they didn\u2019t have extra space. I would recommend to the manufacturer to give a little space during assembly since it\u2019s dry bec once it\u2019s use during steaming the bamboo floor will expand.",
