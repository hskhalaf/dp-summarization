Update 03/2015- all 3 of my light fixtures are starting to show rust in the chrome finish. Since these are bathroom light fixtures, one would think they'd be coated with something to prevent this from happening. Very disappointing since they were not cheap and will likely need to be replaced within another 1-2 years if I can't clean the rust off of them without ruining the chrome finish.",
