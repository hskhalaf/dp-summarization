Problem is, the complaints of it being a narrow made shoe are accurate. Usually when reviews say that the shoes are too narrow, I order them and they fit great. I always buy my running shoes larger than my regular shoes. I did that with this style, but even ordering one size larger, they were so narrow in the forefoot that even when I completely unlaced them, they were still uncomfortable. Put them right back in the box and started a return. Disappointed. Still trying to find a nice stability trail runner.",

This one has been just as good for my hip as the GT-2000. One noticeable difference was the room in the toe area. The Gel-Kahana 8 are much roomier in that area.

Cons: the outsole... it did NOT perform well as I walked across a tile restaurant floor. I slipped and slid across the floor as though I were on ice. At first I thought it was the floor, but I was the only one who looked like Bambi on his first day walking. I really like ASICS, but the slippery sole could be dangerous.

The whole shoe just felt very stiff and hard and there was zero arch support, nor was the insole that came with it very soft/flexible. Overall, the whole shoe felt very uncomfortable and hard when just walking around the house. Too bad, the bottom does look great for trails (looks very grippy).",

I've even used them to mow the \"death hill\" in my yard (the one that I usually slide down sideways while trying not to die with the mower), and they get good grip, haven't been pulled off in the mud (yet), and drain quickly. They do not dry quickly, though.",

The fit is snug enough and toe box ample room for movement, in additional all you narrow heeled ladies : the heel stays put. Lace the furthest lace opening at lower top : easy to miss this ensures snug secure fit. And I just ordered another pair! thanks Asics",

The only problem I'm having, which I have with all my shoes, is the rubbing at the heel of the shoe causing a hole on the inside. But I think because I ordered a tighter fit it's helping with the shoe staying in good shape.",
