They both fit well so I\u2019m keeping both sizes. If you think you\u2019re between sizes & you\u2019re a little bigger in the bust, go with the 16. This holds in & camouflages your tummy with adjustable straps and better support through the bust than I\u2019ve found in other suits. I wish there were more than 3 colors:prints available. I would get them all!",

What is not fantastic, is the fact that the color drained out of this suit after the third time in our local YMCA pool. Conversely, my daughters' affordable suit from Target, did not fade at all. This tells me that the problem is isolated to this suit's lack of quality- not all swimsuits. Do not buy this suit unless you want a faded, trashy looking swimsuit.",
