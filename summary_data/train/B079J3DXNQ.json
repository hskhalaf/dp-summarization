    "description": "When your family members get pink eye, give them gentle relief with Pink Eye Relief. Similasan eye drops stimulate your body's natural ability to temporarily relieve symptoms without potentially irritating ingredients. Many other eye drops have vasoconstrictors that may actually worsen the symptoms of bloodshot eyes if used more than directed. With Similasan you can feel good about helping your family feel better without the use of harsh chemicals. Can be used with contact lenses. Drops will not damage lenses but performance might be better when applied without lenses. If you have redness, itchiness or irritation, it is best to avoid lenses for a while. Trusted by pharmacists and families in Switzerland for 40 years, Similasan is a leading Swiss brand of remedies that use natural active ingredients instead of harsh chemicals to keep families healthy. Our state of the art facility located near the Swiss Alps makes over 190 popular remedies for children and adults. Claims based on traditional homeopathic practice, not accepted medical evidence.
