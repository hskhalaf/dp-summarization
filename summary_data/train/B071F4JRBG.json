I loved the simple design, no small parts to keep up with. The kids like reloading and changing the different gun features. The product has held up to basic wear and tear. I have not even had to replace the batteries yet and its been 7 months since they received the toys. As soon as I can, I will be purchasing 2 more.",

They're well worth it. They're sturdy feeling, great sound and many options, register most hits even from the side. At further distances more than 15 feet you do have to be accurate and point right at the other gun, so you cant just random fire at your opponant. One of the switches doesnt click up when its turned on, it stays so far but that's the only down side I've noticed, on/off switches seem a little flimsy.",

So it gets to be fun indoors when trying to shoot at an opponent around the corner when you can't see them - simply shoot the wall opposite them and, if directed at the correct angle, will hit the target.
