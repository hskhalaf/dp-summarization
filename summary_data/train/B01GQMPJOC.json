I believe they recently released a new model with a signal-boosting base. That one might be better but the probe is still a problem for me.",

You can monitor your cook easily from your mobile device and what's nice is that the app will even tell you the time remaining until you reach your desired temperature. Because the probe measures the temperature of the meat AND the ambient temperature you get really precise reads. This has pretty much become my go-to gift for all occasions and everyone has loved it!

I'd buy a lot of them if they weren't so expensive. And add Google Home Assistance compatibility. The ability to use voice commands via Google Home would just about make this thing perfect.",

The battery doesn't last a full smoke which is kinda pointless if you have to pull out the old reliable thermometer to finish the cook. Really limited on customizing your alerts and what you can track should be able to set ambient temperature ranges with alarms etc Overall until it connects to WiFi and can last the entire cook don't waste your time with this one.",

During that two minutes it was not easy to use as user interface was not clear enough and contained too many items on it which made operation difficult (I am web developer and I know what the User Experience is).",
