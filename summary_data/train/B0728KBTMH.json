She is still too afraid to explore the house. Walks are out of the question. In desperation (and with Halloween night approaching with lots of doorbell ringing) I purchased the calming bites. She was a different dog! She was playful, only barked one time at the doorbell, and didn't shake or cower once! Count me as a skeptic turned Believer!",

      "text": "My dog is high energy and is not always the friendliest to strangers (we adopted her from a shelter.) This helps to calm her down without taking away her personality or drugging her up. I have only been giving her half doses even though her size determines she needs two. I give her one when we\u2019re causing anxiety by running errands in and out of the house all day and two when we go out in unfamiliar social settings. You are not a bad dog owner by getting these. In fact, you may be helping your dog out! Worth a try. Works moderately well for us.",

We travel a lot & my 10mth old pup gets nervous during car rides as she's had many emergency animal hospital visits so she associates the car with going back to be \"hurt\" again. Administering the bites to the dogs about 30min before getting in the car allowed both dogs to relax on the youngest pups 1st 8hr roadtrip. I've tested the bites on the puppy as well with the bites for when there's company in the yard, work being done on the house and when there have been fireworks and she was not affected.",
