If your RV stove burns food on the bottom, and raw on top, you NEED this to dissapate/spread heat evenly. it fixed the problem INSTANTLY. Just place it on the bottom-most pan under the lower tray so burner heats this first and radiates up to food cooking. It just so happens this works well for pizza too, but it stays in our oven as a heat dissipator for ALL baking.",

      "text": "My stone arrived cracked. However, even if it arrived intact I still would have returned. The handle on the peel is loose and not sturdy and the peel is comically small considering the size of the stone. Why would they pair a ~9\u201d peel with a 13\u201d stone? Unless to plan to make only small personal pizzas this will be useless.",
