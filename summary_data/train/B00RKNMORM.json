Each crew takes about 50-100 pictures per day, every day. The camera's live in a dirty environment and even though they try to take care, the camera's get dropped, exposed to rain are generally pretty abused every day. We paid big money for \"more durable\" camera's like the Fujifilm FinePix XP90 but the money was wasted. The Elph 160 has done the best over time.",

Also, the fact that you cannot select a mode (e.g. Sunset) makes the camera not really worth the price. The thing that makes this a 2-star camera is the flimsy and hard to open battery / memory card door. It is going to break and break soon. Something that flimsy and cheaply constructed should not also be hard to open and close. There is no excuse for such a poor design feature (one that seems to be getting worse with every generation of the PowerShot). Canon should be ashamed of itself.",

Although you can buy that stuff at any store, so not that big of an inconvenience.",

The button is pretty sensitive making it easy to take picture. The 720p videos are great and they come out exactly how I wanted it. Overall I really like this camera. The picture quality is amazing and it is very portable and light! Highly recommended",

It's small and plastic and very cheap looking . Cameras that I have owned from years ago looked much much better . This one looks like a toy you get at a dollar store . Hope design improves or I won't be buying anything else in this price range from Canon ever again",
