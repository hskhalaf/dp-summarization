On the other hand, the leaf shutter opens up some really interesting options using off camera flash in full sunlight, even the on camera flash makes an amazingly effective fill flash. Out of my 5D2, 5D, X-E1 and X100s, this is now my favourite camera.",

    "title": "Fujifilm X100S Digital Camera - Silver (16.3 MP, APS-C 16M X-Trans CMOS II with EXR Processor II) 2.8 inch LCD",
    "description": "Style Name:Camera\n\nThe X100S has the ability to capture high resolution images, comparable to those taken on full-frame sensors. This is down to a combination of its newly-developed 16.3 megapixel APS-C X-Trans CMOS II sensor and EXR Processor II, which together increase resolution by approx. 25%** and reduce noise by more than 30%***. Clear images with minimal graininess, even at high ISO settings, can also be produced, thanks to the removal of the optical low pass filter and the introduction of a more powerful processor.\n\nSENSOR PERFORMANCE COMPARABLE TO FULL-FRAME OUTPUT\nThe X100S features FUJIFILM's newly-developed 16.3 megapixel APS-C X-Trans CMOS II sensor with a unique, highly randomised, colour filter arrangement. The benefit of the new array is the elimination of the need for an optical low-pass filter; these are used in conventional sensors to reduce false colour and moir\u00e9 effects but they also reduce image resolution. The removal of the optical low-pass filter allows the X-Trans CMOS II sensor to maximise the light it receives directly, enabling users to capture much finer detail and optimise resolution levels.\n\nA wide range of accessories available The X100S uses a Lens Modulation Optimiser to reduce optical effects such as lens diffraction, which happens when light passes through a lens. Even when stopped down to f/16, the X100S retains sharpness and texture in the smallest details, demonstrating the extent of the sensor and lens combination's capabilities, perfectly.\n\nThe excellent sensitivity of the X-Trans CMOS II sensor is coupled with the new EXR Processor II's advanced signal processing capacity, which can reduce noise by more than 30%** compared to its predecessor. Even when shooting in low-light, at a high ISO setting, the FUJIFILM X100S will produce crisp images with minimal grain.\n\nTHE WORLD'S FASTEST AUTO FOCUS AND HIGH-SPEED EXR PROCESSING\nWith built-in Phase Detection, the X100S offers the world's fastest AF speed of just 0.08 seconds*. The Intelligent Hybrid AF can switch to Contrast AF, dependent on the demands of the subject or scene, to ensure that the camera always auto-focuses quickly and with precision.\n\nThe EXR Processor II delivers processing speeds twice that of FUJIFILM's previous generation processor******. The fast responses result in an impressive start-up time of approx. 0.5 seconds****, and a shooting interval of 0.5 seconds. In addition the X100S delivers a burst shooting rate of up to 6 frames per second (max. 29 frames) at the full resolution of 16.3 megapixels and the shutter time lag is a mere 0.01 seconds.\n\nENHANCED MANUAL FOCUS PERFORMANCE WITH THE WORLD'S FIRST***** 'DIGITAL SPLIT IMAGE' DISPLAY\nMaking use of the built-in phase detection pixels for AF action, the X100S is the world's first***** camera to offer a \"Digital Split Image\" feature, which displays dual images on the left and right to be lined up for manual focusing. This enables accurate focusing especially when working with an open aperture or macro shooting.\n\nIn addition, the X100S offers a handy Focus Peak Highlight function, which emphasises the outline of the subject focus plane. It provides the photographer with a guide, even in situations where it is difficult to calculate focusing accuracy, allowing users to enjoy manual focusing comfortably, however challenging the conditions.\n\nPREMIUM HYBRID VIEWFINDER FOR EASY IMAGE COMPOSITION\nHybrid viewfinder to help with composure view larger. Offering users freedom when composing photos and adaptability for a range of shooting conditions, the X100S's Hybrid Viewfinder combines both an Optical and an Electronic Viewfinder. \n\nThe electronic viewfinder uses a 100% coverage, extra high resolution, 2,360K dot High Definition LCD panel. It shows depth-of-field during macro shooting, as well as white balance settings, allowing users to accurately compose their shot while continuously looking through the viewfinder.\n\nThe premium quality optical viewfinder offers an easy-to-see magnification of 0.5 at a 23mm focal length and a horizontal apparent field of view of 26 degrees. The all-glass construction uses high-refractive index glass to minimise chromatic aberrations and distortion.\n\nWhile in the optical viewfinder mode, users can make adjustments to shutter speed, aperture, ISO and other settings without having to take their eye off the viewfinder. The shooting frame (Bright Frame) and text brightness automatically adjust according to the ambient light available, to ensure that the information on the display is easy to see at all times.\n\nThe system features an OVF Power Save mode, which activates the power-saving function in the optical viewfinder mode to double the maximum number of images per full charge from 300******* in normal operation.\n\nWith FUJINON's proprietary coating, the viewfinder cleverly resists fingerprints and can easily be wiped clean, so that users can enjoy the optical viewfinder's clear display without compromise.\n\nFUJINON 23MM F/2 LENS OFFERING PREMIUM IMAGE QUALITY IN A COMPACT BODY \nSpecifically designed for this model, the FUJINON 23mm f/2 Single Focal Length Lens has a fixed angle of incidence of light into the lens, which facilitates optimum optical design. Taking full advantage of this, the X100S demonstrates advanced levels of image clarity, not only in the centre of the image, but also through to the edges of the photo. The versatile focal length of 35mm******** delivers an angle of view ideal for a diverse range of subjects and scenes.\n\nThe lens consists of 8 elements in 6 groups, and includes a high-performance double-sided aspherical element and highly-refractive converging glass elements, which deliver a high level of detailed performance with minimal aberration, excellent sharpness and beautiful colour reproduction. Moreover, FUJINON's proprietary HT-EBC coating is applied to effectively control image flares and ghosting.\n\nOther benefits of this lens are the beautiful, soft, round-shaped Bokeh that is produced from the 9 blade lens diaphragm. In addition the lens allows you to get as close as 10cm from your subject in macro mode for stunning close-up shots. And by activating the built-in ND filter it enables blurring of the background in portraits, or applies a gorgeous creamy look to flowing water even in a bright setting.\n\nELEGANT DESIGN AND SOPHISTICATED FUNCTIONALITY \nHigh quality Japanese design The front of the X100S proudly bares the letter \"S\" as confirmation of its extensive evolution from the FUJIFILM X100. Down to the tiniest detail, the premium build and feel of the X100 is continued in the X100S. FUJIFILM's top quality Japanese engineering is evident from the high precision components used and the perfectly optimised body.\n\nThe X100S's top and base parts are made of magnesium alloy to achieve a lightweight, resilient, yet delicate design. A specially-formulated coating is applied to give its surface a steel look for an added premium feel. All the dials and rings have been milled from solid metal, with attention paid to the finer details such as finger grips and enhanced operability. The exterior is finished with synthetic leather, which is durable and resilient to the environment yet reproduces the texture of real leather, while still offering the practical benefits of additional grip and comfort.\n\nThe layout of the dials and rings allow users to operate the aperture ring on the lens with their left hand, and the shutter speed dial and exposure compensation dial on the top panel with their right hand, meaning all the settings can be adjusted comfortably without having to take your eye off the viewfinder. And to make you feel even more at home, you can even customise your shutter sound by choosing between the four different sounds available: Lens Shutter, Focal Plane Shutter, Mirror Up and Silent Shutter.\n\nThe menu system has been also updated to incorporate a Q \"Quick\" button which allows you to quickly call up frequently-used menu items such as ISO setting and Film Simulation modes. In addition, the Fn (Function) button allows users to assign functions frequently used while shooting, for convenient use at the touch of a button.\n\nARTISTIC PHOTOGRAPHY\nThe X100S features FUJIFILM's proprietary 'Film Simulation Modes'. Users can choose from ten simulation options which replicate the results achieved by FUJIFILM colour reversal films (Velvia / PROVIA / ASTIA), professional colour negative films (PRO Neg. Std / PRO Neg. Hi), monochrome filters (MONOCHROME, Ye filter, R filter and G filter) and SEPIA.\n\nAlso available on the X100S is the Advanced Filter function; users can choose from 8 different artistic effects which can be previewed on the LCD screen:\n\n * Pop Colour \u2013 great for boosting contrast and colour saturation\n * Toy Camera \u2013 create shaded borders as if you were taking a photo on a toy camera\n * Miniature \u2013 adds top and bottom blur for a diorama or miniature effect\n * Dynamic Tone \u2013 create a fantasy effect by dynamically-modulated tonal reproduction\n * Partial Colour \u2013 highlights one colour and leaves the rest of the image in black and white (choose from red, orange, yellow, green, blue or purple) \n * High Key \u2013 enhances brightness and reduces contrast to lighten tonal reproduction\n * Low Key \u2013 create uniformly dark tones with few areas of emphasised highlights\n * Soft Focus \u2013 blurs the focus of the image edges to create a softer effect\n\nIn addition a Multiple Exposure function enables users to combine two separate images together for special creative effects. And for greater artistic freedom, the aspect ratio can be selected from 3:2, 16:9, and 1:1 (square) to accommodate a wide range of photographic styles.\n\nFULL HD VIDEO SHOOTING\nThe X100S can shoot at 60fps during Full HD video recording (1920 x 1080) for very smooth video capture. Plus shooting at the high bit-rate of 36Mbps will result in reduced noise and enhanced image quality that reveals every detail, from individual leaves in the trees, to subtle changes in facial expression. During video recording, users have access to many of the additional modes available in still image capture. Film Simulation modes can be used, White Balance settings can be adjusted, you can even make the most of the fast lens to produce beautiful bokeh and also operate the Intelligent Hybrid AF for high-speed and high-precision focusing. \n\n * FUJIFILM research as of November 2012.
