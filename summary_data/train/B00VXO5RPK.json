I can get away with using this and putting my hair up the second day. I have not noticed any white streaks either as I used to occasionally notice with the Living Proof. The Moroccan oil appears to have a slightly purple tint to combat brassiness.",

      "text": "I have thick, heavy blonde hair that gets grease pretty quickly. I've tried so many different types of dry shampoo, but most just make my hair feel heavier and don't really blend in. This dry shampoo actually absorbs all the oil and it really looks like I cleaned my hair that day. I used to wash my hair 5-6x a week. Now I shampoo 2-3 times a week, and use the dry shampoo almost every day in between. It also smells amazing!",
