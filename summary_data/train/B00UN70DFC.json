      "text": "This is a good quality thunderbolt 2 dock. All ports work as they should. I am using various usb peripherals, a few Esata and USB3 drives. I also bought it for the Firewire port, as I have a bunch of older Firewire drives. Haven't tested the Firewire yet as those drives are in storage. The thunderbolt 2 port connects to my 2012 MacBook Pro without any problems and I have also used it successfully with my newer iMac and a thunderbolt 3>2 adapter. All in all I'm happy with this purchase.",

      "text": "The OWC Dock I had before this would do this really annoying thing where it would disconnect and reconnect really fast. I use the dock to support all of my hard drives while DJing but I can't have the hard drives disconnect in the middle of someone's wedding. Exchanged that dock twice and tried different laptops with same problem. This little guy is a life saver. It's smaller and so much more reliable than the others. 23 trouble free events since the purchase of this and I couldn't be happier. It also supports big 10TB external hard drives which is a huge plus.",

      "text": "Was a bit skeptical purchasing this for $200 -- but it gave new life to my 2011 iMac running High Sierra. Thunderbolt plugs into my iMac port, then daisy-chains two laCie drives, then on to a second monitor. The two USB 3.0 ports are each connected to a (powered) 4-port USB 3.0 hub, connected to a total of 7 USB 3.0 drives. And the two ESATA ports are connected to two legacy ESATA drives. Everything works great, wakes up properly after sleeping, fast and reliable. Very happy with this purchase.",

There have been a lot of mentions of excessive heat - I've seen none of that. Maybe I'm not abusing it enough. :) It's a well-built product, feels very high-quality compared to a lot of the cheap plastic USB hubs and other peripheral products I'm seeing. I'm digging it.",
