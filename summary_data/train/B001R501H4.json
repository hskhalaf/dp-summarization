I will use these for our home remodeling, which involves a lot of ceiling work, but I will also use them for painting as well as just anything that requires use of a mid-height ladder. They arrived quickly, the learning curve was practically zero. I walked around for a few minutes and went right to work. I keep a ladder set up to place all the tools at the height I need them.",
