Be aware that for installation you'll need two additional items: plumbers putty or silicone and an electrical cord (unless you can reuse your existing one). Due to the extra sound insulation it's a bit wider than most other disposals, so consider the space under your sink before deciding on this one. YouTube has great installation videos of you're inclined to install yourself. It's easy. You should definitely NOT pay someone to do it.",

The only thing I'd suggest is that KitchenAid make a brushed nickel sink insert instead of the shiny chrome. As for Standard Plumbing Supply, the item came a few days sooner than I was to expect, so kudos to them. Item was well packed. Caveat: be sure to remove the plug on the unit before you're finished installing, or you'll have a mess. :)",

Though our existing plumbing had to be modified, due to farmhouse sink. One reason I went with this model is, it is a little shorter then competitors model in this price/sound range. Which we needed given the farmhouse sink already cost us a few inches. We actually still have over 6\" tonthe cabinet. It is extremely quiet, you can't really hear it over the running water once food has been \"disposed\". Seems to dispose of food very well too! Have been using now for a few months with no issues!",

He removed the plastic pieces, reinstalled it, and the buzzing stopped but it was still louder than my 20 year old Kenmore that it was replacing.
