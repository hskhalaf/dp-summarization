Due to hoop weight I will only use this hoop full clothed and probably with waste belt. I\u2019m 5\u20192\u201d 140lbs. Box wordIng states hoop is sized for 100-160lbs.

The 5.5 lb hoops have ridges and/or bubbles on the inside and extended hooping can put pressure on the hip and rib bones. The 3lb and 4lb hoops are smooth inside so they are more comfortable if you want to go long. In any event, I love all of my hoops. I am a mover and shaker when I use a hoop so I get cardio and waist training. I highly recommend all weighted hoops be included in a fitness routine. What a blast!!!",

At first, you need to get used to the weight, so the instruction suggest to hula hoop for only one minute or so per day, so you can get used to it. I leave it in the living room, and my husband and my daughter would just start hula hooping for fun! I also love that you can take it apart for traveling.",

I'd also tug at each new addition, to make sure it was \"locked\" in. I've had no issues.",

No middle-age back pain or strained muscles since I made hooping part of my routine, I did have some tenderness at first, as others have mentioned.

Feels like you're constantly getting punched in your sides. To counter this, I used an abdominal sweat wrap for a little extra padding, and that seemed to prevent any possible bruising. Although it is fun, I got a bit bored with it, and a little discouraged because of the pain, but I still use it occasionally for a nice twist to my workout.",
