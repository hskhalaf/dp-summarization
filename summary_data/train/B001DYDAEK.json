I love that it's so compact. I went to three countries and used it every single leg. I even used it in a long car rides as well. The only reason why I'm not giving it a five start, was because there was a defect on the stopper. However, I reached out to the company, and they will send me another one. I can't wait to take the new one my next trip, which is next week.",

I'd suggest you sit at home and adjust it and your experience on the plane will be great. I flew from Vancouver to Ottawa on an overnight flight, and slept the entire way without issue using this pillow. I'm looking forward to using it on my over the pacific flights coming up.",

Will be taking this pillow with my whenever and wherever I go. Looking forward to using it it my car as a passenger.",

      "text": "I've dreaded overseas flights in the past. I couldn't get comfortable and relax enough to sleep with the airline pillow or ubiquitous \"C\"-shaped neck pillow. But travelling recently with the inflatable Travelrest pillow changed all that. Between its compact uninflated size, the ergonomic shape, and the \"leash\" that attaches to the seat's headrest, it met all my expectations -- AND allowed me to relax and fall asleep on a 12+ hour flight without disturbing the passenger in the seat next to me. From now on, I won't be travelling without it.",

Worth getting the cover for it as well, it added even more cushion to the pillow.",

As noted in other reviews, the key is not to over inflate. But in addition to a sleep pillow it can also be used to assist the lower back, mid back or even used as an arm rest. GREAT product!",

Also it's firmer than some of the neck pillows I've purchased in the past which also helps the support.
