      "text": "I hoped the dimensions listed for this product were erroneous, but unfortunately they are correct. This is the third Pearhead Memory Box I've purchased. As you can see in the photos, they used to be larger, and they used to have a removable tray that I used to store flat items, such as photos and sympathy cards. The urn I have inside the larger box would not fit in the new box. So, congratulations Pearhead. You saved a few pennies per unit. Your product is now smaller and less functional than it used to be. You are no longer serving the needs of your customer base.",

      "text": "I've lost TWO dogs/pets in the last year and purchased one for each of them. This is a very nice memorial box for them. Large enough for ashes, collars, etc. that I wanted to place inside and I like the picture/paw print space. Tape is a little light though, but that may be only because I had the vet make the paw print. Which I do recommend that you specify the dimensions to make sure it will fit if you do the same.) Overall good product.",

I was able to fit his ashes, collar and his clay paw print and still have room in the box. I was not able to put his paw print on the front because it was too big. Will definitely purchase again.",

Although it is plastic it seems very very durable. Pictures are easy to place into urn. The rest of family liked it as well. Great product for the price. Highly recommended and would purchase again.",

I added my own touch with the fancier paper for the background, and we didn\u2019t use the plaster for his footprint as we were given one when we had him cremated. The edge was a little bit dented and missing some paint, but it was minor, and not worth the hassle of exchanging it. I definitely recommend this.",
