      "text": "Nice model truck! I bought this to turn into the Fall Guy GMC from the old TV series. I believe this is the exact truck they used to make only in a different color and without any graphics. If you've put together a model like this before, no surprises here. This comes molded in one color so different parts will require you to paint them. There are also around 100 pcs and most have to be glues together. So, if getting for a present, remember the glue! Good detail and nice classic truck!",
