Finally, something to perhaps keep in mind, Canon cameras are among the very few cameras now being made that can actually still be repaired if necessary. Parts are actually made readily available for repair/replacement, not so with most other cameras now being made. Even the high end/ more expensive cameras made by several well known and regarded companies seem to be assumed to be disposeable after their presumed or planned obsolesence. just consult your local camera repairman, if you can find one...",

      "text": "i know very little about photography, but i do know when a camera is easy to use and takes excellent pictures. pros: - inexpensive - takes excellent pictures of stationary objects cons: - flash is slow to recharge - the camera is miserably slow at focusing at in on distant objects when you use the optical zoom - if you loose patience with how long it takes the camera's auto-focus to focus in on an object or person, the pictures will invariably come out blurry - battery life is short when you use the flash regularly bottom line: - still probably worth it if you want a very basic point-and-shoot camera under $100",

This isn't a professional camera, so you can't expect professional results, but just like most Canon cameras it blows its competition out of the water. If all you need is a simple point and shoot camera that takes great photos - there's no need to hesitate with this superb Canon.",

The quality of the photos is actually really very good especially for the price. It does have a few cons. It's pretty slow between taking photos and the battery life is pretty short with regular AA batteries. Other than that, it's easy to use, light, cute and handy. It's awesome for the price!",

However, the pictures are lackluster compared to our current availability of inexpensive high resolution cameras and there are many better options available. I will keep this camera since it handles my desired tasks but If I weren't doing CHDK photography, I wouldn't purchase this camera again even for $40.",

We bought it to use to take school picutres for a slide show. It's cheap, and easily replaced if lost or damaged. Don't forget to buy the right memory card for it, since it doesn't have any internal memory.",

It uses two AAA batteries not a battery pack. Resolution of screen is bad. Shooting modes are all in the menu, no physical buttons or knobs for easy access to the modes. Lens zooms in and out slowly with a weird sound and not smoothly.",

The designers foolishly designed it so that the required AA batteries are spring-pressed against the flimsy \"door\" (the one that must be opened to insert the batteries). Part of this door was visually protruding from the camera body by 1/6th inch within a week. Also, this camera is more expensive than it seems, because the AA batteries you've got to buy add up with time. Other cameras come with rechargeable specialized batteries that last years.",
