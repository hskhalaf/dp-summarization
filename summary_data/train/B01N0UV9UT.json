I have a ridiculously hard time finding items long enough for my arms and covering my torso. This fit me where \"normal\" length dresses normally do. The drawstrings go all the way to the bust so if it is too long, it could be shortened. I will be taking this on a cruise where I plan on keeping my pale skin unburned as a swimsuit cover. I will see how it does in skin protection factor.",

I am usually a small but in this top the shoulders were tight thus I exchanged for a medium. I do have broad shoulders (5\u2019 6\u201d 125 lbs.). Unfortunately when I received it I did notice a few whitish spots on the front but I figured it was packaging dust or packaging residue. I packed it for my Aruba beach trip and the spots did not disappear after I washed it. If I had not already worn it, I would have returned. If it arrived with no discoloration I would have given it 5 stars.",

Usually I know swim suits run small so I bought this top in XL but I was swimming in this top (pun intended) I'm just frustrated that manufacturers can't stick to the same sizing. Other than the wrong size, the quality looks GREAT, it's also very nice and LONG. I decided to buy again in sizes M and L so that I can try both and see which is best... XL is going back. I recommend you buy what is true to your size. I am 5'7, 153 lbs.",
