We have a NOAA weather station close by. If I calibrate it today, it will be in range tomorrow but usually off by a tenth or more. After a few days, I need to check the NOAA site and recalibrate. Using it to tell relative pressure from day to day is what it's good for but, at the price, it is a reasonable device. Would I buy another? Probably not. Would spend more next time.",

You DO have to tap it lightly with a pencil or other small object to get a current readout. The setting \u201cdial hand\u201d is fun to use if, for instance, there is a massive high or low pressure system overhead.
