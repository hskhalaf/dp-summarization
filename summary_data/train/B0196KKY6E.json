Only thing with this floatie compared to the gigantic flamingo is being that the wings aren't as large as the flamingo, the duck is easier to tip over in. Just have to be careful not to lean to far to either side or back because I've seen so many people flip over on this raft. Still love it though.",

I used a bIt of polyurethane sealant over the tiny, tiny hole to no avail. I'm not going to throw it away, because all I have to do is re-inflate it and it will be good for another 12 hours of play.

The challenge was blowing it up. We had 5 adult men try to blow it up at the hotel. Since we opened the box at the hotel we had to go source a bicycle pimp. Would be great if the manufacturer could include a small motor included in the price or propose for purchase. It was also difficult to deflate and a pump would have made it easy. Bit of inconvenience but we managed and it was a hit.",

    "description": "Size:Giant| Style:Without PumpDesigned from high-quality materials and assembled with precise manufacturing standards, the GAME Giant Derby Duck is that perfect fun-loving oversized inflatable that is exceptional for a day at the lake, pool parties, beach vacations, and more. While there are several imitators on the market, this is the original Derby Duck, featuring the patented sunglass-wearing duck that is the star anywhere it floats. With its easy-to-inflate technology, 300-pound weight capacity, and multiple handy features, this ducky float is both stylish and functional. GAMEs Giant Derby Duck is the perfect option for fun in the sun and splish-splash entertainment. Its been designed from high-quality durable 0.03 mm vinyl materials and assembled with careful manufacturing standards to ensure longevity and extend its lifespan. Our attention to detail and quality permits this inflatable duckie to hold multiple kids or adults while boasting an impressive 300-pound weight capacity. While the material is incredibly strong, its easy to fold and store as well. It has also been designed with multiple quick-fill valves, making it easy to inflate and deflate. For those days on the water, weve added 5 handles that are easy to grasp and use. These convenient cup holders have also been designed to permit users to secure rope to them, which makes connecting with other floats, pulling them to and from the water, and tying on to a dock a snap. Additionally, this giant inflatable has two built-in cup holders, allowing you to keep your favorite cool beverage close to you while floating in comfort and style. The Giant Derby Duck is an iconic product made by Great American Merchandise and Events (GAME). GAME is a cutting-edge innovator in the special event marketing and merchandising industries. Along with manufacturing and designing high-quality products, GAME also provides services to diverse nonprofit organizations that raise millions of dollars for charities across the globe.",
