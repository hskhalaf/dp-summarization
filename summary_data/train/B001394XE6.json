Was offered a replacement. but they could not guarantee that one wouldn't be the same. The sea team lacks physical ownership, they have orders fulfilled by drop-shipping them.

      "text": "I have had my SECA balance-beam scale for over two years. I purchased it to precisely measure the effects of my diet as I was in the process of losing twenty pounds. I have It in my bedroom which is carpeted. To eliminate the possibility of the carpet causing errors, I placed it on a square platform made of crisscrossed flooring boards. This is a well-made piece of equipment. Easy to track your daily weight. Forget those on-the-floor digital scales. They show big variations of weight from hour to hour. The beam-balance scales are not even affected by the position of the moon in its orbit.",
