Maybe they're referring to other products. But this rotating book case is fantastic, easy to put together, and nicely stores books that do not fit into already-full wall book shelves. I packed mine full of books, and it rotates well. I would be careful if I had little kids, who could easily push it over. But I plan to order another one.",

It must have miniature books on it, because it can\u2019t hardly be used to hold general sized kids books. There were a few places where the bamboo was split and other places it was coming apart where it had been glued/sealed. All in all, we will get use out of it...just not what I had intended. Bamboo is sustainable, so that helps.",

There's one extra small hole on one side of the board that must be in the center facing inside for the rods. Step 2's image of the base was different from the base we got, but we eventually found the pinprick holes for the screws on one side. --- FINAL PRODUCT: - super utilization of space - rotates well, seems sturdy - different levels are slightly different heights, allowing larger books - you can remove one or both rods in the center to accommodate \"deeper\" books - superior, in my opinion, to a one-faced bookshelf to maximize space",

They function, but not neatly. Went together well. Stand is solid, I placed heavier items at bottom, of course. Very useful in my bedroom office as I can keep items at hand yet not take up floor space with a shelf unit.",

It has not been cracking where the screws are (which are not the best quality as two broke in the process of putting it together,) but in the middle of the shelves. I am atributing this to poor quality and that the room I have it in is on the colder side. (There is no way that they are cracking under the weight of the DVDs.)",
