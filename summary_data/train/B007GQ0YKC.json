I\u2019ll probably update my review at a later time to speak on that, but for now all I can say is the assembly was -5 stars for sure.",

The posts and connection points are joined by pushing spring loaded pegs into the holes of the adjoining piece, sounds simple, but those springs are super tight and I had to fight almost every one. I used a flat head screwdriver to push the pegs down until I could force the post over it and get it into the holes. Two hours later and I'm almost done but I gave up for the day. This is the kind of toy that makes you seriously consider never buying anything again that requires assembly.",
