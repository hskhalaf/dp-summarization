Coverage sucks, the network appears available and connected at longer ranges, but is useless. The device is lit up like a Christmas tree with lights all over, very distracting. Total piece of garbage. I will never buy Netgear again, goodbye and good riddance, your tech support sucks too. Moving on to an Apple AirPort Extreme 6th generation, adios Netgear, what a joke!",

Regardless, so far so good with the V1.0.0.61CH firmware, which handles DHCPv6 PD from Comcast much better than the buggy TP-Link AC1200 C5. Lack of external antenna makes it connecting at at most 270Mbits/s, whereas the TP-Link AC1200 C5 was consistently connecting at 300Mbits/s.",

Like the previous generation, these newer ones have a USB port, but unlike the older generation, the port can supply enough power for an attached USB hard drive. Pleased with the purchase.",

It is tough to find a modern router that will run OpenWRT, by the time most routers are supported they are no longer sold. However, you can buy this one used or semi-new from a reseller for fairly cheap. It supports the \"a\" standard so you'll still be set for a couple years. Performance has been very good. I've only needed to reboot it once since I bought it months ago. Highly recommended if you are looking to run OpenWRT as an aftermarket solution.",

Just to compare my old router, I was getting 2 Mbps download speed wireless on a 20 Mbps wired speed with my old b router. Now I am getting 20 Mbps wireless with WNDR3800. Printer works wireless using the USB port perfectly. Also the USB hard disk works perfectly fine. I am very happy to have this router.",
