Like another reviewer said, Amazon should remove \u2018books\u2019 from these dishonest amateur authors masquerading as experts, blatantly exploiting Buffett\u2019s name, and delivering nothing but copied and pasted content. Instead of wasting your money on this, buy and read Essays of Warren Buffett. There are no easy paths. You need to dig in and read that. If a book appears too good to be true, it is.",
