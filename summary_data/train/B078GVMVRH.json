There are plenty of non-Philips brush heads available here on Amazon, and I've tried a few, and many of them are just as good as Philips.

I love the way the brush cleans and it worked great for exactly 1 year. 6 weeks ago, the base started losing charge very quickly. This was annoying but not horrible, so I continued using and charged more frequently. 3weeks ago the base stopped working altogether. It still turns on and off, but when you place brush on your teeth it is no longer vibrating correctly. I will purchase this same brand but from another site. Not sure if this version is knockoff or just the base model, but 1 year was a waste.",

They work great until the warranty runs out, this is the fourth one I've bought in the last couple years. They give you a tongue cleaner but don't fall for it! Actually using this on your tongue like a regular toothbrush destroys it. The ring that surrounds the metal stub that the toothbrush head goes on will fail and become wobbly. When this happens all of the vibrations go into the handle and it's worthless. For as much as they cost, this seems like a design flaw. Even the more expensive ones fail this way.",

Also, I can move the stem around manually through a much larger range of motion than expected.

Ever time you change direction or get the back teeth etc. I think that is how they get away with using a cheap low-power vibrator \"motor\" inside, stop the action if you demand too much from it.
