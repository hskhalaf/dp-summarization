      "text": "I bought these in a size 8.5 but found these really tight in the toe area - probably a 9 would have been better, maybe even a 9.5 although 8.5 is generally perfect for me. The soles on these are very springy which I got for bad knees - its almost like running on marshmallows is the best way I can describe it, so if you like a firmer sole, these would not be suitable. I didn't feel these were built to last, they are very lightweight with a think fabric upper.",

The have been my main daily running shoes and I really love them.",
