Even though they sent software with it I was told on the phone don't use and let windows update/vista take command. That worked well. Basically the most economical color laser out there on toner. The quality is very high as long as you use good laser paper and I would say the unit is fast at a color page level. Quality seems great but I have had only a few weeks. I would purchase it again so far and very happy with it.",

I think it also stopped doing that. We paid $200 for it new at Best Buy, or maybe even a Circuit City, when they were still in business. Overall, it's been worth the $200 we paid for it when they first came out. It had the easy change toner cartridges, etc. That was a revolutionary feature in its' time.",
