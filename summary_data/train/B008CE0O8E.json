Recommend that you power into the chock SLOWLY and watch for clearance around the brake discs and fender. It did hold the bike upright while I was securing it with 4 point ratcheting tie-downs. The chock came with 4 M10 (approximately 7/16\") carriage bolts, washers, and self-locking nuts. I did add my own 7/16\" galvanized fender washers under the nuts since my trailer bed is pressure treated pine. Traveled 1600+ miles round-trip from Atlanta to Key West with no issues.",

The manufacturer states that a bike should not be ridden into the chock, i.e., it should be manually pushed into the device. This makes sense because it is not robust enough enough to withstand repeated impacts, even at low speeds, from a motorcycle. However, in my situation it was mounted so that the forward hoop directly bears against a heavy frame member of the trailer so I have no hesitation about slowly and carefully riding the bike up the trailer ramp and directly into the chock.",

Packaging was not sufficient, the boxes were ripped open and other hardware was missing. Not worth the bother to return it. I will just replace the hardware myself.",
