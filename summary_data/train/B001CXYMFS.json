Doesn't slide around on the table/desk. Main 3 complaints: 1. squeaky (somewhat, not horrible) 2. Not reversible (a pain to me) 3. Springy and wants to return to center too easily I'm sure a more expensive unit wouldn't have these issues, but just wanted to express my concerns for others that are looking. You can separate the throttle from the stick, however, they will not bolt together on opposing sides. The cable between them is a little short too when they are separated.",

It has an edgy look that seems to be designed for the \"gaming\" and less for \"simulator.\" It feels pretty cheap but operates well (it is made out of plastic after all), it's still a quality product that feels sturdy. It's well built. The ability to split it apart if you need more room and there's a set of 10 buttons allowing you to map out what you need (I think it can do with some more buttons). Overall it's a great value and a good starting first HOTAS.",

I've updated drivers, calibrated the controller several times, and used the deadzone function in Elite Dangerous. Nothing stops the random drift from occuring. This leads me to believe that the sensors are of poor quality. I am not hard on controllers or electronics. I am very careful with the equipment I buy. I can't recommend this product. While it worked, it did well. It's still playable, but extremely annoying for doing anything other than trading in Elite. Save your money and buy a better HOTAS.",

All said and done, at the retail price point of 50 bucks, this thing is awesome. I had a Saitek about 10 years ago and this thing makes that joystick look like garbage. The quality of this joystick is very high, enough so that 50 bucks feels like a deal. The gameplay is smooth and works as advertised. Glad that the joystick and throttle separate.

I like resistance in the throttle like most throttles and flight stick, but this one is loose to where if i take it out of position from center, it can drop either to up position or down position without it being able to hold its position by itself. I am not sure if that is normal, but it seems kinda inconvenient to me if you want to keep at a certain speed without have to constantly holding the throttle in that position. Other than that, great buy. Shipping took a day longer than Amazon said for, but great product!",

BTW, it's not apparent in a lot of the descriptions and photos you'll see for this product, but the stick and throttle parts can detach from each other. They're connected by a cable, on the bottom of the units, and the cable can go up to approx. the width of armchair arms.

Other issues dealing with sensitivity of the controls make the Thrustmaster useless for any serious flight simulation. Good for games, I suppose, which the low price indicates.

With the exception of one button that has become a little loose, this controller has performed flawlessly. I recently though I would upgrade to a \"big boy\" controller, so I bought an X-55. A day later I boxed up the X-55 and sent it back - I realized there was no need to upgrade and I missed what I had been accustomed to.",

      "text": "Used for Flight Simulation, it is precise and allows for gentle turns with a nice degree of resistance on the joystick. On the negative side, the throttle is top heavy, such that it is hard to locate it at one setting and have it stay there. An adjustable friction brake would be a good addition. A nice feature is the ability to separate the throttle from the joystick, but sadly for me, the interconnecting cable is just too short to span a Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard..",

I would definitely recommend this stick for any entry lever flight sim enthusiast.",

Amazon was able to promptly handle the return and I purchased one from a local retailer and tested it before I brought it home. The defect I experienced seems to be a common issue with this model, it has to do with a manufacturing failure and Thrustmaster did offer to replace my product but Amazon was able to refund me quickly. Good customer service all around, good product, just unfortunate luck.",
