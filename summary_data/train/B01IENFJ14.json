The only downside is having to hold the power trigger down the whole time you are vacuuming. If you have to vacuum a large area, it eventually rubs your thumb raw.",

Only ran for about 30 seconds. I plugged it back in and let it charge for the required 5 hours. It still would only run for about 30 seconds. I concluded either the battery or charger were defective.

However, most of the stuff and accessories were never used and within their original packaging so we assumed this is a returned item before any use and went with it without returning. Nevertheless, I\u2019m disappointed that the seller didn\u2019t check their items before shipping considering this is not a cheap product. Other than that, it looks like there is no problem with the product itself. Does the job. We will see how it will hold up in time.",
