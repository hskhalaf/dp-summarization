The bottom compartment is really useful if you want to separate your supplies. The top compartment is also lined with a material that can easily be wiped down incase you have any spills. The only thing I would like to see improvement on in this bag is the zipper, it gets a little tough to use but that is because the bag is so sturdy it has a thicker zipper. Highly recommended. Definitely a great deal for the price.",

      "text": "I've been wanting a nice quality leather toiletry bag, like my Dad has. This fits the bill, and exceeds my expectations. It is made from beautiful leather, and it has held up well over the last year. However, I can see this lasting many more years to come. I love the fact that it comes with bottles for you to fill with your own shampoo/body wash. It's a nice size, and shape. Fits nicely into our luggage bags. The color is gorgeous as well.",

There's a tiny zipped pocket in the large compartment but no elastic straps to keep things in place just a large cavernous space. The bottom compartment is decent with straps and pockets to keep your items organized. The bottomline is that this bag is overpriced unless you think the good looks are worth it.",

I had to dig through everything to find what I wanted. This bag is constructed in such a way that everything can be secured and easily retrieved. I can lay open the bag on the counter and everything is readily available. I am completely satisfied.",

The bottom of the top pocket is lined with plastic which is great since dopp kits often get wet on the inside and thus ruined. You also can't beat the price. I checked out many other dopp kits of this quality and all were much more expensive. I highly recommend this product.",
