When I walk it sounds like I'm wearing a stiff wooden soled dress shoe. They literally echo down hallways and thud against floors. I've never had a skate shoe or sneaker with as stiff a sole as these new balances 574's. Sometimes the sole will even creek, which I find annoying, but after putting in some in-soles this seems to have mostly resolved itself.",

Retro vibe to them and the colors (burgundy) are really beautiful, except for the inside and sole, such an ugly obtrusive grey! Not sure why they went with it, but at the same time it's the only color I can imagine working with the rest of the shoe (though it maybe should've all been burgundy..hm, or navy blue?). Anyways, super sturdy. So sturdy, in fact, that you can hear them clacking down the hall 100m away - they're built like a rock! Overall, I love them, but they're a very .. particular .. shoe.",
