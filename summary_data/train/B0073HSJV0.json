      "text": "Received this item the morning of a big concert we were attending. Was concerned that I wouldn't have enough time to familiarize myself fully with functions/features available. The instruction booklet is well written and easy to follow, plus being the owner of a Nikon CoolPix made this easier to set up, as the primary settings are almost identical. This camera takes wonderful pictures, especially with the zoom. Made our concert experience one of the best we've attended, and we have so many professional looking photos to prove that. I am not a photography buff, so am particularly pleased with the ease of operation. Highly recommend this item to anyone wanting crisp photos without needed an encyclopedia to decipher the instructions.",

THE LENS SHUTTER WOULD NOT WORK PROPERLY,KEEP GETTING STUCK. I WENT BACK TO USING MY KODAK CAMERA . IF I PURCHASE ANOTHER CAMERA IT WON'T BE NIKON.

I didn't think it has a smooth zoom out and the side zoom I didn't like as much as the top one. The camera is a nice size and weight but it's not for me.",

Taking pictures, I noticed that it is slow to respond, slow to focus, and the images are not as clean and crisp as expected.

Definitely use the manual open flash in darker situations, but if you don't, it creates these neat surreal photos. So far, it is only a little wonky in the super bright daylight. It's just a bit washed out -- but all photos are. Great camera!",

      "text": "I bought this for a friend who wanted to get into photography and get away from the more simplistic point and shoot style cameras. This is a great first step without going into the larger, more expensive, devices and having to worry about lenses and such. For those that have been trained or are more professional this may not be a great option due to the lack of view finder and some refinement of lenses, etc. Other than that it is a great camera with simplistic use such as regular AA batteries, large vibrant screen, and great steady shot mode.",

I see that it takes more time to save the taken image and get back to a position to take the next picture. There is a slight delay. One thing I need to say, I got the camera three weeks ahead of the original 'expected' shipping time. I am still learning - may be I will learn to love it more eventually.",
