I'm hoping the company will comment and reply on this. Otherwise, all the ports work except for the card reader. Prior Review: Love this thing. It works exactly as advertised. I'm currently powering my macbook pro by plugging in my power brick into the usb c port on this adapter, then the adapter into my computer.",
