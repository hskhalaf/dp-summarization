      "text": "Pros : - Size, - Web OS, - Magic Remote Huge Cons : - Black Levels The TV is beautiful but overpriced (even with Black Friday's price tag) for the highly disappointing black levels produced. On 16:9 letterbox the top and bottom bars are highly visible as the TV is only backlit from the bottom. Dynamic dimming is making it even worse ; almost offensive, you see the black bars dim on and off constantly. I've tried a lot of settings advised on expert websites and it is still disappointing in a normal evening setting. I'm thinking about returning it and get something better. (on a positive note, the sound is great).",
