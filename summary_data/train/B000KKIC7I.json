This means zero clean up, rusting, etc. of the fancy firepits that most people (some who live in the country and can legally burn) buy now-a-days... :? (still trying to figure out why on that one). We store it from the rain by hanging it up by a simple long nail, under the carport. We've had it about a year now, and it's still in like new condition. we are very happy with this item.

The joints are simple rivets; it won't surprise me much when they start to wear out and need to be replaced with something more substantial. However, the price is good, and they perform their basic function well, so it's hard to complain.",
