      "text": "Bought this for my Duck/Chicken Coop. For the money, this thing is perfect. I love it. However, you need to know that this thing is small and would not look right on a larger building. I have a 24'x24' pole barn and this would be WAY TOO SMALL for that. This thing would be perfect for a small shed, in my opinion nothing significantly larger than 10' x 10'. My coop is 4' x 10' x 8' high and this is perfect for it. I don't think you would hardly notice it on my pole barn however. So if you are dressing up a small shed, you can't beat this for the money.",

The price of this item is on the low range of what these go for, but that does not indicate poor quality. The quality is very good, it was shipped securely and goes together in no time at all. The angle of the base can be adjusted to pretty much any roof pitch, and it could even mount on a thick post or 4x4. This adds a whole different visual dimension to our little backyard chicken coop.",

The way the rooster piece sits on top, it really moves and spins easily so it seems that if the wind were to blow that it would work the way it should. But either way, I don't care because the point was to make my little coop in the city feel like the farm. Really pleased with my purchase!",
