I was using it so much that my arm started hurting until I realized I was using it at the wrong angle. I do 3d printing and designed a stand to make it even better and more ergonomic. I would highly recommend this product especially with a padded rest and angled stand like the one I made. You can find my stand at Thingiverse. [...] and make it yourself if you have a 3d printer. With or without the stand, this trackball is a great value.",

      "text": "I purchased this mouse in December. Very, very comfortable - wonderful to use - actually love it. But 9 months later, the spring holding the battery in place has become too soft. Clearly someone in China cheapened the compression spring and removed one coil - saved cost by a fraction of a penny. The battery frequently falls out and no longer makes contact - making it impossible to use. Very frustrating for such a nice mouse. And very bad for Logitech. I've decided to purchase a different brand and type of mouse. Don't want to buy a new one every 9-10 months. Barry",

One thing to remember with all trackballs, they must be cleaned a minimum of once a week. Hair, dust and grime stick to the ball or fall into the top and build up on the rollers. This results in a less smooth feel when moving. It is easy to pop out the ball and I keep a dust/hair removal brush in my drawer to clean. Also clean the actual ball with damp cloth.",

I prefer this particular trackball because it works well in a small area and I do not have to move the mouse around I just move the ball instead.

Especially with the price being so reasonable, this is a yearly thing on my Christmas list as they tend to wear out after about a year.",

But last year I couldn't find my \"old\" trackball and took a chance on the \"new\" style - always has to be Logitech because nobody else makes a decent trackball mouse. I was nervous about using a cordless, thinking the battery would die often. I've been using my mouse for a year and only a couple of weeks ago the battery died. I keep rechargeable batteries on hand so that's not a problem. It's been great! I don't use my computer for gaming, but I'm sure it would be good there too.",

This is our second track ball and this one is very smooth rolling the ball and the buttons have a crisp and definite clicking action. Its wireless connection is very useful in that you can place it anywhere. It frees up desk space. No negatives so far",

One thing, apparently I have a slight tremor in my thumb. I didn't notice it until I started using this mouse. It becomes an issue when trying to click on a small box. This is especially true after I drink caffeine. Other than that... I'm sure there's a way to reduce the sensitivity. Might be tricky at work since I don't have admin privileges.",

      "text": "I\u2019ve been using this model or similar on Windows for years but finally decided to get one for my iMac as well since I now have a free USB port after shuffling some accessories around. There are three reasons I\u2019m taking away a star. Two I knew in advance and those are a required USB dongle instead of Bluetooth and AAA battery instead of rechargeable. Third is it doesn\u2019t support horizontal scroll from my experience. None of these are more than an annoyance for me and overall the comfort and ease of use make this an indispensable peripheral especially for the price.",
