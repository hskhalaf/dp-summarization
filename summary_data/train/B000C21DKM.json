I have had flawless cakes and other baked goods without spray oil (and even without butter). I have been hand-washing it to make sure nothing compromises the non-stick coating -- this is a great piece of baking equipment that I'm hoping will last for years!",

      "text": "So everyone has seen the Seinfeld episode where Elaine starts the muffin top shop..... I always thought it was a great idea but a bit wasteful. Now Cuisinart has come up with the solution! If you are the type of person that doesnt like the crispier muffin tops as opposed to the bottoms, this pan is not for you. I love it because it makes a large muffin top that is a little larger than normal tops but overall is less food than a hole muffin. What a great idea!",
