I knew nothing about the Sony soundbar when I purchased the TV so I bought the sound system entirely based on Amazon shoppers recommendations. If you are not computer savvy (like me), then I suggest you get your young nephew or niece to help with the installation of this equipment. Then, fasten your seatbelt, because this makes your TV a cinema or a live sporting event, and a rock concert, with no more effort than pushing a factory pre-set button, which I do, or, you can instruct the entire system to meet your specific audio qualifications.",

Connected easily to my 2 year old Samsung 70\" TV. System turns on/off in automatically with TV. System recognizes TV remote for increase/decrease volume. Sound quality outstanding, voices come through very clear. Have not noticed the surround sound as filling the whole room, but that may be movies from Amazon Prime, Netflix are not supplying latest Dolby signals. Be careful about HDMI and optical cables. System comes with 1 HDMI and you made need 2 HDMI or 1 HDMI and 1 optical cable.",

You can set distance to tv, db settings for sub/bar (under hdmi advanced settings) and under home you can set sub volume, Dolby, vertical sync and also pre set settings. Once I figured all that out the sound is good. The distance setting made a big difference, before setting volume was set to 35-45, now I'm at 24....35 is really loud now. Thought is was a little expensive, but so far nice equipment, update to new firmware if needed, had 1.51...updated to 2.050.",

Horribly disappointed that everytime you start, you start with song #1 and there is NO random play. Seriously SONY? Hoping that SONY will release a firmware to fix this issue.

      "title": "Great Sound!",
      "text": "I had been using a soundbar designed for clear voice but it was lacking full spectrum; this soundbar does both. It has great sound coupled with very clear voice. I am using optical input because i do not really need the upscale audio and I have all of my stuff already plugged into the TV. If you wanted to use HDMI it does seem scarce on inputs, but there are workarounds. I also have a Sony TV so this integrates well with it and is easily controlled by my Logitech remote. I am very pleased with the product.",
