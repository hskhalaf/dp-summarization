On a long and windy trip all three of our packtalks developed cracks in the antennae and one completely snapped with the antennae hanging on by wires. I called and Cardo does not sell replacement antennae, but will cover it under warranty. Given that all three are having the same problem, I'd have to say that this will be a real weakness if you intend to use this product extensively. The warranty coverage is good, but doesn't help much when you're traveling everyday and can't get a replacement til you get home.",

I will never do business with this company again. I've owned many Sena headsets and have had no problems with them. I'll likely buy Sena when this unit fails.",

I also have a problem where music will cut in and out, which happens to one of the other 6 units we've tested for 4/6 working properly. Update - two weeks in and the unit won't charge and is an expensive paperweight. Contacted support which states up to three business days before hearing back.

      "text": "I just replaced one of my units because the USB charging port broke off inside the unit. It uses the USB micro port which doesn't stand up to long term use but the port on the Cardo Palk Talk slim eventually breaks off completely inside the unit. I was always very careful with mine but now my other unit also has a broken USB charging port. A redesign is need to resolve this issue. The port should be changed to a USB C and be better supported by the housing. I like the functionality and still prefer Cardo over the Sena but I don't want to have to replace them every two years because of a deign defeat.",

I am not impressed (at all) by the Cardo App, it has not mattered to me since Siri and Alexa both respond. Great connectivity and have even had phone conversations where the other party had no idea I was on my bike. Sound is phenomenal and works great with google maps as well.

The system worked well and range was good. We were out on very flat roads so it was a good test. I suspect we went to about 1,000 m while at highway speeds.
