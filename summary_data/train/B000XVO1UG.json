You need to purchase a pedestal or console legs as well as a faucet/handle/drain combo.",

The only change we had to make was to modify the slot in the bottom of the pedestal to accommodate the standard sized drain line from the sink. The hole at the base, directly below the drain is too small for standard plumbing, leaving you the choice of either having an exposed drain pipe back into the wall, or behind the pedestal on the floor. This is probably 'standard' but I like to completely hide the plumbing fittings in my sink installations.",

By installing this combination in my storage-starved bathroom, I got a big drawer in the base and some nice deck space on the sink. Now I can put something down near the sink! The design puts the widest part toward the wall and projects only part of the sink basin in to the room, which is a perfect compromise. Other sinks were too big for my space or too small for my needs.",
