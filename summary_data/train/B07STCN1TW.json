I do not smell the typical citronella scent that most mosquito candles have but they have a nice fragrance. The scent fills up the room but there is no smoke. The only time I noticed any smoke was when I blew out the candle, but once I put on the lid of the candle there was no more. Works well and smells nice.",

They can enjoy each candle for days. The box they come in is decorative so I do not need to wrap it either.",

They all smell nice (amenable scents, and not too strong or too faint), they look nice (in the set and individually), and they burn nicely (no popping, smoking, or discoloring the wax). I am very pleased with this purchase. I just wish they were a little bigger since I burn mine for about an hour every day. Still, even using it that much, it lasted over a month, so it has a good life... I just wish I could get the lavender one in a larger size because I was so sad when it ran out :)",
