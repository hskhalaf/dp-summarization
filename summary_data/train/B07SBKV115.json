And after that, you can direct it to clean specific part of your home. It haven't stuck anywhere in my home yet. I have two vacuum robots, this one definitely wins over the other brand.

The unit cleans and seems to do a good job it just isn't the item they pictured in their sales add. third pic down on left side shows self cleaning dock. Very Misleading.",

So I started doing research. I love how this one maps the house and cleans in straight lines and not random passes. In addition I have five cats and I don't have to clean the hair off the rollers. That's a win for me. I highly recommend this vacuum. Lastly, it's fairly quite too!",

The map function often will not come up, and accessing it causes the app to stop. I had two successful runs telling the Shark which rooms to vacuum, but this morning was unable to access that part of the program when I wanted to exclude the Master Bedroom from the daily vac. The Map function is very frustrating.",

We had bought a roomba 675 at Christmas but thought the IQ mapping would be better than the random roomba. That wasnt the case. The shark left very little nap in the carpet vs the 675, and the shark moves so much slower. Hands down the 675 won and that's why we returned the shark.",

Keeping the vacuum clean and especially the brush roller will give the robot a longer life. I noticed the improved brush roller is designed to not get hair stuck on the roller, it is designed for someone with pets. I have a cat and dog and my home gets dirty fast, so having asthma I keep my bedroom clean. The Shark goes under my bed and cleans my hardwood floor. I paid a little more for this Shark, and it is worth it.",

I love that it cleans under the couch, and under the bed. It does seem to mostly not get hair tangled on the roller - I have long hair and it gets everywhere. My place is much cleaner overall, so I\u2019m very glad I got it.",

Since I had not been cleaning out the dustbin regularly on the first unit, i reasoned how hard can it be. Well it's not hard but it does need to be done daily and this really gets old. Had I known how much this pickups ever day and how often you should clean it it would have bought the self cleaning unit again!",

This new one NEVER stays connected to WiFi (even though it predominantly cleans within 40 feet of wireless router and the old one is on a completely different floor from the router. The new one is so much harder to empty, and if the cup is full, it dumps the dirt on the floor as you pull it out. Very disappointed with this one.",
