I've needed a board with more area for some time so decided to treat myself with this chopping block. It's thick without being too heavy. I'm not sure if I'd be able to manage a solid wood block of this size as easily as this product. It will take me a bit of getting used to since this is my first \"block\" style board and it raises the cutting surface quite a bit up. I've included pictures of the underside and also of the side with measurement since it is not on the page currently.",

What really puts this above the rest in my opinion, is that it is not only a great cutting board, but also a nice addition with snacks, appetizers, etc when entertaining. You will be very happy with this purchase. It will also make a great gift idea, which I plan to do myself.",

It is just beautiful and a joy to chop and cut up food on. My wife on the other hand is not as pleased as I am since it is BIG and HEAVY. But that is because it is a very solid and well built product. I can see myself buying a carving board from these folks in the future.",
