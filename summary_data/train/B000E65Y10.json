He expedited the delivery at no extra charge, the camera was in better condition than advertised, included fresh batteries, AND included a 2G SD card. He even wrote a personal note to go with. I like this camera more than any newer, \"better\" model because it takes clear indoor and outdoor photos with little input from me as I am not a photographer. It uses AA batteries (which are very easily replaced even when I am in remote places) and has a separate slot for the SD card.",

Its 3X zoom is decent enough for product shots as long as you use a tripod and have plenty of light on the subject. For good sharp pics use the macro setting and get in close. Otherwise it's a decent point and shoot camera, a good spare to pack on trips with a 4-pack of AA batteries.",

The biggest problem is that when the batteries are down to around 90% power (multimeter measured the two AA batteries connected in series at 2.71 volts when removed from the camera), the camera begins having difficulty turning on and staying on. With fresh batteries, the camera turned on fine. An AC adapter for this camera is available for purchase. This camera takes AA batteries, so this device is definitely a candidate for having multiple sets of NiMH rechargeables on hand to keep taking pictures.",

My only complaints are that the construction seems a bit flimsy, but our other Kodak is still going strong after 6 years and multiple drops onto hard concrete, so I hope its durability runs in the family.",

The photo make look in focus in the viewfinder, put upon printing, the focus was soft (using a Kodak EasyShare printer dock series 3). You probably will never use \"5 megapixels\". If you print normal 4 x 6 inch snapshots you will most liekly use a \"cropped\" 3:2 setting that is 4.4 megapixels (interpolated). There is a huge time lag while the camera records the picture to the SD Card. Very annoying. Don't be in a hurry to take another picture. The litte viewfinder is useless.

      "text": "Bought our son this camera for his 10th birthday. First day worked fine. Second Day, it would not turn on...red blinking light only when the on button was activated. Replaced batteries (per troubleshooting guide). Returned it; figured we got a lemon. Bought a new one...same model. Same problem! But on the first day. Called Kodak. Got someone in India barely speaking english, which only added to my frustration. They wanted us to return it for repair. No thanks...we're returning it and getting a CANON.",
