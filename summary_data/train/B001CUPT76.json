The openings and seams are very well constructed and effectively keep out all the rain and wind. The one drawback I found was that it is hard to get the child/puppy in and out of the stroller because the shield will not open far enough. I have to actually lift it off the front of the stroller, fine if you are out of the rain, but not if you are still in the rain.",

It is long enough to come down over their legs (Babies 'R Us had one for sale that looked way too short). It does have a funny plastic smell...not sure what to do about that. My daughter didn't complain though. Overall, it did the job and I'm glad we had it with us. Kept the kid and the stroller from getting soaked.",
