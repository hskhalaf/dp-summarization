      "text": "These jeans are exactly what I was looking for. Lightweight, very thin (but not see through), stretchy, but still have a jean feel and look. Its the perfect balance between leggings and actual jeans. The stretch is perfect. They bounce right back. I only wish the pants came a little higher. They sit right at my belly button, which is good enough for covering the belly. I just like that extra security. I am 5'9, 260..the xxl fits perfect. The only other con, was it does not have \"tummy control\" to smooth the love handles or belly flub..but for the price I cant complain at all. Will be ordering more!",

They're comfortable and soft, and a bit long, but for me that's fine because I'm pretty tall and will enjoy rolling these up on warmer days to wear as capris.

Maybe if I had a pooch or was pregnant these might work. The material is nice; not too thin but moves with you. The dark wash color is great. These might work well for women with long thin legs and a little tummy. They were a miss fit my build :(",

      "text": "Have only tried them on so far but seem great. The are long! Perfect for me, but if you have short legs these will be way too long. Sizing seems accurate - I\u2019m usually a small or size 2 and go back and forth between regular and long length depending on the brand and these are perfect. The upper portion needs more - structure? Support? Not sure the word I am looking for, but the waist area feels/looks like a legging and wouldn\u2019t pass for jeans so I\u2019ll mostly be wearing these under things. A thick waistband would make them much more flattering.",

The fit is good and mostly flattering (I'm wearing XL), the length is abysmal. I hate pants that don't reach your ankles, and these have to be constantly pulled down because they ride up on my legs; also for some strange reason the left leg of the pants keeps twisting around so the inseam is on the top or bottom of my leg instead of on the inner side like it should be. Overall it's an okay purchase, but honestly the Amazon brand leggings were much higher quality.",

Material is thicker than the no nonsense regular legging which I wish I would have found out sooner as they would have been fantastic for winter but are fine for warmer weather as well. They fit a little looser than skin tight leggings especially at the knee and below but not baggy at all. All in all I think these are a great value and will buy more pairs.",

They wash really well and I must have washed these over twenty times now and they still look new. No fading and no shrinkage. Highly recommend!",
