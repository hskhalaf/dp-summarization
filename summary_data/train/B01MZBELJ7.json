I submitted a warranty part replacement order and have not heard a response in over a week. I have attempted to call the offices each day for the last week and not a single person has picked up after a 30 minute hold each time. The weight tree does not allow two olympic barbells to fit. The design of the weight tree is to angle the weights towards one of the olympic barbell holders, thus not allowing the barbell to fit as it hits the angled part of the tree.",
