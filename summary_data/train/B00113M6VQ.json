I use them for different exercises, including upper and lower body. I some times use them for my taekwondo staff routine. The 8 has a nice grip but it came bent. The 12 is much thicker, but I don't mind as much as other reviewers. The padding is nice, so they don't damage my wood floors if they tip over. Dumbbells are more useful, but these are a good addition to my home gym.",

I like not having to change weights as you have to with a regular weight bar and lifting it is better because the weight is evenly distributed instead of just on the endsof the bar.
