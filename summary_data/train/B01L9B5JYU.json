His cute responses to voice and movement, the heartbeat when patted, the heavy breathing / light snoring, as he goes off to sleep make it impossible not to smile. Sometimes the little bark, becomes a bit much, but so far I have avoided turning off his sound, although the time may come.",

She is much happier with this little guy. The only thing I would improve is have its legs move or make it an even smarter. I would of paid double the price if it did this.",

She is in love with it and thinks it\u2019s a real dog. We took off the bandanna and substituted a dog collar with the dog\u2019s name. The dog is amazingly life-like and I highly recommend it for anyone in a situation where they are missing their own dog or just for a comforting companion.",
