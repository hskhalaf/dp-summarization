The last one I lost at the SFO International airport and it was never found so I bought the same exact watch but this time it was solar. I will wear this watch on my travels all over the world. This Seiko is light, beautiful, and looks exactly like a gold bracelet on my wrist. The only difference with this one and my last one is that this has a slightly more complicated closure.",

It fits like a bracelet which is what I want. Also, the clasp is easy to use and a significant upgrade from years ago. They are uncomfortable if they fit snug. I can't comment on the water resistance as I take it off to do dishes etc... It took me so long to find this one that I want to take the very best of care",

The band itself is flexible and does not pinch as many of the cheaper ones do. Hour markings are beautifully displayed, large enough to be easily read. Solar powered, charged per instructions, and it has performed perfectly. A unique combination of elegance for those special occasions yet casual enough for everyday wear. The quality of this watch puts it in a class by itself when compared to others in the same to moderately higher price range.",
