The next height up, which I have, are better suited for smaller children (ages 5-12 say) but these are good for adults looking to have a bar height feel. I prefer the next height up because of my height of 5'3\". These are still great for average sized adults. No issues with construction which only involves attaching the back of the stool. Overall, nice.",

I have the copper color which I would say is more of a bronze/grey. There is no red in the color. The wood seat is a nice deep brown. True to the color in my photo. For the price I am very pleased with these.",
