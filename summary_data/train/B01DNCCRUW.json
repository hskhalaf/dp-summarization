These bags alone would be fairly padded for general use, though they are not rigid. I think it would be odd to carry one around with the handle on the top. The carry strap maybe should have attached closer to one end than the center. BUT, they are inserts. The material looks good and feels durable. I have no doubts my equipment is safe inside \"ebag & the inserts.",

This is perfect for that--it has dividers that can make up to 8 compartments for lenses, camera bodies or flash units. It only has one zip pocket so there's not a lot of room to compartmentalized those loose odds and ends you collect. It's also pretty bulky and heavy when full so it's better suited to safely holding your equipment in the closet at home rather than out on the road.",
