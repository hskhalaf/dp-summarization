I searched through so many and almost gave up and ordered real adult sized ones for my little girls princess tea party but I found these! They came quickly and were a big hit. She has already shattered 2 of the 4 cups and a lid to the milk vase but at this great price point I'll just buy another! Highly recommend!",
