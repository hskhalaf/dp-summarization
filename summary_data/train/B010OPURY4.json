The idea of using a sprayer always turned me away from cloth diapers, but these have made the sprayer almost completely useless. It catches most of the poo and I can just toss it in the toilet or garbage and toss the diaper in my wet bin. Every once in a while the liner shifts and I have to spray off the diapers, but not often and normally only when my daughter has a major blowout. I will continue to buy these for her and for our next children.",

I haven't (never do) flushed any, but it gives me peace of mind that they will break down in the landfill versus sit there for eternity. I will definitely continue to use these. I have tried most of the brands out there (that I can find on amazon) and these are easily in my top 3 choices.",
