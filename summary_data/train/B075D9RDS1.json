I like the look of this toothbrush holder and I love that my electric toothbrush fits too! This seems very well made and I appreciate the extra thought that was put into this design such as the rubber feet that were added to the bottom of the holder. This even came with 5 toothbrush covers, very thoughtful!",

The black color is nice - we'll see if it peels off in the future, but for now it looks very sleek and neat. The best part is that it doesn't take up space. Would highly recommend.",

You know how that goes! I saw these and thought give it a try. Well they are not flimsy and have enough space for the brushes and the toothpaste. On mine I put make up brushes since it is just my one toothbrush. I love that there is no awful stuff at the bottom. I was pleasantly surprised at the durability of it and glad that I bought one for each bathroom! Highly recommend.",

I will definitely use this company again and I highly recommend them.",

Keeping one heavy toothpaste does not make it lean or unstable. The usual brush slot may not accommodate an electric brush. Two for this price is a steal. Highly recommend.",

I especially appreciate that it can fit my larger electric toothbrush in the slot designated for toothpaste. My only concern was that two of the spots where there should have been \"feet\" to hold it up were jagged metal stumps that didn't reach the same depth as the other feet. I'm not sure if it was a manufacturing defect, but it is sharp and might cut someone. However, the other feet hold the entire unit up very well and unless you lift the entire piece up, you should have no problem with scraping a finger.",
