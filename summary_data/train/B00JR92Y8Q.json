I just used a piece of clear tape, and looped it over the back. Then, I put the pins through the tape. If you are careful, you will not tear it. And, it is in fact glossy.",

The customer service was really nice, too. AND it came really well packaged. Great product, have it in my room.",

Maybe the Van set Grinten projection wasn't the best choice, since placing it on a rectangle requires either truncation of the polar regions, or a lot of wasted space in the corners.",
