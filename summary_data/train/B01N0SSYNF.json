It takes up such a small space and they hold more than what you would think! I used my cricut machine to make labels so I wouldn\u2019t forget what was in them. I have it stored in my cabinet with extra spices hid behind it. I will be ordering more for myself and as gifts!! Thanks so much!",

They do, so far, but I would like a stronger magnet. Also, It would be nice if you included some labels of the common spices. Both these improvements might add a little to your bottom line, but I thought the price in general was more than reasonable and you could easily charge more if you needed to.",

Be mindful of the holes on the sides of the canisters...make sure they are fully closed/blocked off before putting them back.

      "text": "love the look of this and it fit inside my camper cabinet door perfectly but... It is not airtight and spices will clump due to humidity and you have to be very gentle closing and opening the door or they will fall off.
