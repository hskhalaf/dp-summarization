It's useful after a more intensive facial cleanse. This rinse leaves the skin buttery soft and moisturized, though. However, it fails to meet some of the product claims. Good product, but I'm unable to use it for its intended purpose.",

I live it and it has made a huge improvement to my skin. I would definitely recommend to all, even to those with oily complexions.",

The amount of fragrance, which I suspect has alcohol, completely undoes the potential moisturizing benefits of this cleanser. After using, I've found that my face has some dry patches that weren't there before. I suspect that this cleanser is the culprit. The fragrance is extremely strong and lingers even after rinsing it off. Such a shame. I will never be purchasing from this brand again.",
