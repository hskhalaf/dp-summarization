My whole kitchen was flooded within seconds! This is pure garbage. Please do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY. Shame on Amazon and Honeywell for selling expensive and useless garbage.",

Wish they offered the same video on product page, went back and forth on model to select, but there were no videos I could access easily. Main decisions on which model were: Price, reviews & ease of use, portable. One slight negative, friends recommended put a frozen water bottle in reservoir vs ice, however the area is too small to insert a bottle.",

    "description": "Color:SilverLike a breeze flowing across a lake, Honeywell Evaporative Coolers provide a natural, cool breeze with the power of water evaporation. Honeywell Evaporative Coolers combine 3 appliances: Evaporative air cooler, fan and humidifier - into one compact energy-saving system. A fan alone creates a breeze by recirculating warm air, but when you add water and/ice to the tank, Honeywell Evaporative Coolers reduce the temperature of incoming warm air, transforming it into a cool moist breeze. Honeywell Portable Air Coolers are built to last and carefully crafted with the science of aerodynamics to minimize energy consumption while maximizing the airflow. An evaporative air cooler offers an energy efficient cooling option when the air is hot with low humidity, such as desert areas like the southwestern United States (recommended humidity level is 60% or less for maximum efficiency). For those living in more humid cities, please consider Honeywell Portable Air Conditioners.",
