Even dried on low the inside of the pillow cases completely melted and stuck together. They\u2019re literally lined with plastic that almost looks and feels like tissue paper, and even the lowest setting on the dryer destroyed it. Both pillow cases are welded together all crinkled up and are stiff and crunchy. Complete garbage. On top of it all, the \u201cgray\u201d has an awful green tint to it. I tried to return it and apparently the seller has to grant permission...we\u2019ll see what happens!",

This comforter is very plush and kept me comfortably warm during the winter. However, during the rest of the time it became unusable as it just kept me too hot when the temperature was over 70 degrees. The material is very good at retaining heat so it's great for sub 70 degrees, but not so much in temps over that. I put it in storage and will definitely use it when the temps cool down, but for now i've reverted to using an old blanket i had and am currently looking for a comforter with lighter/liter(?) material for any time use.",
