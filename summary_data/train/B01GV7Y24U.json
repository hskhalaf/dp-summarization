I'm saying this because the demo for this game was only released on consoles so most of the time that means the PC version could have some problem that means you can't play it until a patch comes out etc. No problems here it's a good AAA title.",

Nothing makes me feel better than second guessing every object and constantly checking how food I have left. A brilliant game that has some amazing re-play value (already planning a third full playthrough).",
