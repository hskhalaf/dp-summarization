What I spent on this vacuum, I would expect they stood behind their product. What actually happened is they tossed around old vacuums to me until my warranty expired then they told me tough luck.

This one does not learn the home, as more expensive ones do, but it does assess the room it is in and clean it systematically and so quite thoroughly. It is very easy to prep the room for it (takes about a minute) and it does well with area rugs that have short fringes. It carefully avoids spaces that will be hard for it to back out of, so misses some smallish areas that need to be cleaned separately. Still, it does the job I wanted it to--be thorough, pick up well, and get under low furniture.",

The battery life is impressive (1hr). The filter is excellent and it is extremely effective, picking up the fine dust particles. We have two cats inside and this little fellow keeps up with the shedding and small bits of cat litter they tend to leave around.

Roomba, even 630, never stuck on flat surface. May issue is that neato only detect obstacles that are on the level of neato's laser system. Roomba uses front bumper to detect obstacles, which is in real life more effective. Neato filter gets clogged really easy. I needed to use usual vacuum to clean its filter.

It's a great device. It is much smarter about how it vacuums so it gets done much faster and can cover a much larger area on the available battery charge. It has much better suction than any of the roombas as I've owned, but is a bit louder too. Durability is an area where the roombas always fell down. I've only had this for a month or two so it's a bit early to tell on that score. So far I'm pretty impressed.",
