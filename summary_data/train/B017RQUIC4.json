We purchases for a cruise but before that trip came we have been using it at our local water park and it is great. I no longer need to spend $10 to rent a locker each time.",

The cable that runs through the lid runs into the container. Thus there is a huge hole in the lid. How is that waterproof??",

It has enough room to keep many things and should work well anywhere you need to lock things down but if someone REALLY wanted to get into it it would not be too hard. Highly recommended.",

We just attached it to the beach chair and kept it with our towels and stuff. We were able to fit our money, car keys, and 2 cell phones (iPhone Plus/Max size) in there no problem. Also made life easier because the location of the beach chairs was way more convenient than the lockers were. Definitely recommended.",
