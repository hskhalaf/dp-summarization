This one is a new comer as it can make record the programs which is broadcasting while I am working in my office. I will never miss an important program with this radio. It's small, compact and great in sound. But it's SW is not as clear as my other collections such as Tecsun 9700 or 9702 or Sangen, or anther Grundig Potable radio. Neverthless, I still love this great radio. It's only drawback is that the recording you do with this radio is not MP3 format.",

The radio has good reception but the tone has no base at all. The mp3 player has an equalizer setting but there is nothing that affects the radio. Also, the Amazon listing did not mention that it was refurbished but there was a sticker on the box stating it was.",

      "text": "Everything works well. Tuner is excellent on FM and RDS works, but tries to categorize the station so it ends up with a smaller display. I got an extra battery here for about $5 and a separate charger for about the same. It seems that sleep mode drains the battery. I have to check this again. It runs a good 10 hours on a charge using RDS and at moderate volume. I stick it back in the case sometimes or throw a towel over it to give the sound more depth. Very easy to use for a Grundig guy.",

I have less expensive radios which are able to pick up moderately distant AM stations more clearly without a lot of background hiss and crackle. (poor signal to noise ratio) The tuning knob fell off, but luckily I was able to find it and secure it with a small drop of plastic cement. The record feature produces noisy hissy low quality mp3s. FM reception works well, but I like to listen to AM talk shows. Not my favorite radio. Would I recommend it? No.",

The type font on all the buttons is too small and the saddest that chose red lettering on black insured that the radio can only be used in perfect lighting conditions. I do notice that picking the free supersaver shipping lets the seller wait 3 to 4 days before shipping the radio. An $80 radio should include a buck wall wart for charging and operation made more insulting by the non standard recharagable LiON special battery.",

If you live in an area with heavy RF you will be very frustrated. I ended up returning the Grundig and purchased the Sangean 909X...granted a little more money but well worth it!!,",

You just have to tinker for a little while (or even read the directions!) to learn to operate the radio satisfactorily. The sound is adequate for its' purpose - although it sounds somewhat 'tinny'.
