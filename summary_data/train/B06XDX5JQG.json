      "title": "Overall Great Product, LG Missed The Mark On A Few Things",
      "text": "I love these because of the speaker functionality but having had 2 previous Tone versions, the sound on the Infinims is still the best. I also feel like the volume doesn't go high enough sometimes, especially in speaker mode. The surround sound can be amazing, but it all depends on what you're listening to. Much less fragile than previous versions (no hanging wires or jointed band design, which is what caused by Infinims to fall apart). A bit bulky but not really that noticeable in my opinion. Overall, great product but they by far aren't the amazing sound of the Infinims on in-ear mode.",

      "text": "Despite the names, logos, labels, and descriptions that describe this as their top-of-the-line premium model, I am disappointed. The ambient sound from the DTS speakers is tinny and flat. The downward rumble of the bass speakers is barely/intermittently noticeable, at best. When using it on phone calls, it's a 50/50 chance that the person I'm talking to will complain of a bad echo which only goes away if I put in the right earphone instead. The bluetooth range is pretty decent and once I memorized the position of the no-look switches, it got fairly easy to operate. All things considered, though, this does not feel like a premium product at all.",

One if the buttons fell off, and within a couple if weeks both earbuds locked up and wouldn't recoil. It's a neat idea, but definitely not worth the cost.",

The earbuds are commensurate with other LG Tones I've used. The size is fine for me (6'0, 200), but the unit is almost literally the size of a horseshoe (but flexible in the middle) and weighs just over 4 ounces (compared to about 1.5 ounces of LG Tone Ultra that these replaced. Calls sound good on external speaker (only right side works for calls).",

However, if you want to watch movies from your laptop or videos on your cellphone without having your ears plugged with earbuds, these are awesome! I like being able to hear what's going on around me and dislike earbuds and over-the-ear headphones. These have solved my problem. Thank you LG.",

Also looked brand new. I wish i owed a flat LG screen to unlock potential but i have played the exterior speakers with cable (awesome) and sounds ok without. Its convenient to even have that option 2 choose from. The earbud option do sound great for bluetooth and helps battery last longer. These have been the longest LG headphones i have ever owned and have to say will easily last a year i hope. My LG Tone Ultra New (not refurbished) from Target wore out in less then 5 months",
