I didn't know how much we were going to be using this to break up ice, but we ended up using this thing very regularly. We ended up with a very thick ice layer on a huge section of our concrete and we used this bad-boy to break up the ice which allowed us to clear up the concrete. We even used this on tough to scrape snow on the driveway. This is heavy enough to break through most any ice and it is very well made. We look forward to using this again next Winter.",

The ice was up to 1.5\" thick and, for most of it, I just had to drop the tool and let the weight of it break the ice for me. For the really thick sections, I had to use some elbow grease but - - wow - - in both instances, it worked great. Anyone who lives in winter needs to have this in their winter tool collection.",
