Thought it was off we use this same exact product for years but as soon as we purchased here on amazon we got a negative outcome. WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN OR RECCOMEND. Buyer beware",

They\u2019re inconvenient to turn upside down and get especially so near the end. We bought a separate soap pump and that has made our lives so much easier. For the soap itself, highly recommend.",

The fragrance is stronger and my family and my daughter's family have specifically used this Aveeno for years precisely because of its light fresh mild fragrance. We have bought so much Aveeno over the years and told all of our friends about baby wash and shampoo. Now we will be looking for another product.",

      "text": "I tried Babygarnic, Johnson, Walgreen brand and this one. I am testing them out before I choose a brand for my arriving baby. So far, this is the best for the money. Lightly scent, gentle and not as expensive as Babygarnic, it works on my oily long hair without leaving it too dry as Babygarnic does. Johnson & walgreen brand, on the other hand, is not good enough for my oily hair. I also have pimples along my hairline with Johnson but not with this one. So maybe this is better for babies with sensitive skin like mine.",
