Super low light performance across all focal ranges coupled with image stabilization makes this great for indoor photos with no need for flash. The focal range covers wide angle to mid-range telephoto to make it a perfect all in one lens for walk-around purposes. AF is super fast and tack sharp. The only drawbacks re the cost and weight. Right now Amazon is offering this fabulous lens for $330 off; weight you will need to deal with, but it is not a bit issue for me given the many positives.",

This lens focuses quickly and silently and rarely hunts unless it's very low light. I like the 77mm filter size which is compatible with many other high quality Canon lenses. The hood should be included and forms a large package when used. I guess that's the price you pay. No dust yet either.",

This speed of this lens makes a huge difference indoors if you don't want to use a flash, but the extra reach (plus the weather proofing) of the 24-105mm are ideal for outdoor use.",

The lens is pretty bulky though, but then again, so is my camera. Some people don't like the fact that you're paying a premium for an EF-S lens. Well, I don't think that I'm \"renting\" my glass and therefore expect 90% value in the future. So that's not a huge factor for me.",

I had done some online research and this lens got high marks from a lot of reviewers. Now that I have had a chance to use it, I will add my five stars. This lens takes crystal clear photos in some low light situations, something I really wanted. And the \"S\" size sensor on the 7D provides a 27 - 88 mm 35mm equivalent. For me, that range covers 98% of my applications. Great piece of glass!",

I love my 50mm 1.8 but it doesn't always give you the wide angle shots you need in tight quarters. Very quiet and fast focusing. It does struggle focusing in direct sunlight so I'd recommend a lens hood for sure. Overall, an excellent upgrade and fast enough for those low light conditions.",

    "title": "Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM Lens for Canon DSLR Cameras, Lens Only",
    "description": "Style:Lens OnlyFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nDesigned to meet consumer demands for a fast EF-S zoom lens, the EF-S 17-55mm offers image quality on par with Canon's highly regarded L-series lenses. The lens features a large circular aperture that produces a shallow depth of field, creating background blur that draws special attention to the photographic subject. The lens construction, meanwhile, includes UD and aspherical elements that deliver impressive image quality throughout the entire zoom range. And thanks to the Image Stabilizer lens groups--which shift to compensate for camera shake--the image appears crisp and clear on the image plane, eve in dim light. Finally, the lens offers a ring-type ultra-sonic monitor (USM), inner focusing, and new AF algorithms to help achieve autofocus quickly and quietly, along with full-time mechanical manual focusing that makes it possible to manually adjust the focus even in AF mode. As with all Canon lenses, this lens carries a one-year warranty. \n\n \n\n * Focal length: 17-55mm \n * Maximum aperture: f/2.8 \n * Lens construction: 19 elements in 12 groups \n * Diagonal angle of view: 78 degrees (at 30 feet) to 27 degrees (at 50 feet) \n * Focus adjustment: AF with full-time manual \n * Closest focusing distance: 1.15 feet \n * Zoom system: 5-group helical zoom (front group moves 27mm) \n * Filter size: 77mm \n * Dimensions: 3.3 inches in diameter, 4.4 inches long \n * Weight: 22.8 ounces \n\nThe EF-S 17-55mm f2.8 IS USM offers image quality on a par with Canon's highly regarded L-series lenses. It has a large maximum aperture which, combined with higher shutter speeds, can minimize subject motion blur. Shallow depth-of-field separation of a subject from its background is much easier to achieve and the f2.8 maximum aperture allows a bright finder and extremely precise focusing with f2.8 compatible AF sensors. The internal stabilization has a sharpness benefit equivalent to a three-stop faster shutter speed, making this lens outstanding in low-light situations. Smaller and lighter than lenses of similar specifications, the EF-S 17-55 mm f2.8 IS USM lens has a 35mm equivalent focal length of 27-88mm and is compatible only with the EOS 30D, EOS 20D, EOS Digital Rebel XT, and EOS Digital Rebel SLRs. To meet user demands for a fast EF-S zoom lens, Canon has specially designed a new lens with a large aperture of f/2.8 for select Canon Digital SLR cameras. The large circular aperture produces a shallow depth-of-field, creating background blur that draws attention to the photographic subject. The lens construction includes UD and aspherical elements, which deliver impressive image quality throughout the entire zoom range. Image Stabilizer lens groups shift to compensate for camera movement so that the image appears steady on the image plane, ensuring clear, crisp images, even in dim light. With a Ring-type USM, inner focusing and new AF algorithms, this lens achieves autofocus quickly and quietly, and with full-time mechanical manual focusing, manually adjusting the focus is possible even in AF mode.",
