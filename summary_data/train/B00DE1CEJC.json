Heavy weight, nice handles, flat bottom and the coating is superb. This is important to me because he cooks, I clean! Highly recommend this pan to others. I am not a paid reviewer.

The short handles make storage so much easier, and there's plenty of room to saute and stir a batch of onions, carrots, mushrooms, and peppers without tossing them out the pan. Love it!",

Cons: Lid doesn't fit properly---too large for rim of pan so I had to be careful of escaping steam. Handles aren't heat-resistant.

The lid has a metal ring around the perimeter of the glass that has a hollow channel engineered into the design. The hollow channel goes around the entire perimeter. While washing, water gets into this channel and the water can't be dried or drained, and the channel can't be cleaned. I think that this could be a possible health concern as bacteria could be present in that area, and when the pan with the lid is heated, expansion or contraction could cause the fluid in the channel to drip into the food.",
