Until I figure out this method, it took so long trying to get a reading it shut off before showinga single weight.",

The oversized 15\" x 13\" brushed stainless steel platform stands up to daily wear and tear while still keeping its great looks. The raised center section, along with the 2\" tall digits with blue backlight, makes it easy to see your weight reading. Most impressive is the 550lb capacity. Finally a scale to use in the privacy of your own home for those with larger frames. This scale runs on 3 brand name AAA batteries (included) and has a 5 year limited warranty. Weight can be displayed in either LB or KG with 0.2 lb / 0.1 kg increments. Even though the scale is large in stature it is very lightweight and easy to carry. The clean, modern lines, rugged stainless steel exterior and extra- large readout and capacity makes the 7410 high capacity scale from Taylor the right choice for everyone.",
