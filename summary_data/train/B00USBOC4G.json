Well worth way more than $359. The flames from the 3 ports are beautiful and gently. This is all about \"ambiance\". It does exactly what it's supposed to do. I would not recommend this for indoor use, but for outdoor it's fabulous. No smell from unit while operating. Suggest having a good Stainless Steel cleaner. I use \"Perfect Stainless\" brand cleaner you can get on Amazon or Home Depot.",

If you buy in bulk like myself dont settle for the 36qt for 200$. Regal flame websight or somtimes Walmart will sell 48qt for 210$. Ill put 2 quarts in the fireplace for about a 3hr burn. I want another one for downstairs but at a better price.",
