      "text": "Keys squeak and not easy to type on. Laptop takes some time to catch up with writing and loading takes quite some time too. Mouse is difficult to click and makes it almost impossible to get anything done. I figured with the graphics been advertised so well, that at least the webcam would be good to Skype. Unfortunately, the webcam is extremely poor graphic and skips when someone moves. Very embarrassing to say that the graphics are 'so wonderful' and then have a very low quality camera! Not suitable for gaming needs either. I must say that this laptop is the worst mistake I made.",

For starters, the touchpad is a pain to use, it is really difficult to drag and drop folders and pictures or to highlight documents. Secondly, the laptop is so slow it can just about run Windows 10, also it starts to go slow and freeze after 2 hours of use. Clearly this laptop is not designed for Windows 10 and only for browsing the internet (not watching movies) it really is a total disappointment and I have no idea what Amazon will do with all these returns.",

Win 10 doesn't come with any dvd media player loaded but free software players are still available on the web. Window media player now is sold separately. Most new Laptops no longer come with dvd players so this is a plus to be able to still play your old dvds.",

[ Subsequent to hooking up to my home lan, an Asus wallpaper appeared on my home Pc desktop without any prompting , that is Malware in my book.] So slow it is unbelievable, most probably due to things like MacAfee that are preinstalled. Will try and assemble the drivers that are needed and then reinstall a clean edition of Windows. Never had such a bad experience with a computer before. My guess is that it will then be okay.",

I was a bit disappointed when it arrived as it felt heavier than I expected. True enough - when I put it on the scales (no packaging or charger etc.) it weighs just under 2kg. Not sure whether I will return it yet.",

My 10 year old Mac works fine with the same Youtube video so it isn't a you tube or broadband speed issue. Also it appears you can't extend the 4GB or RAM that it comes with.",
