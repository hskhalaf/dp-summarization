I also find the ear tips to be less comfortable than the Littmann, but for the price, I would much rather purchase a bunch of these and break them rather than lose my Littmann. I also got the opinion of my nurse friend and he echoed my views on this stethoscope.",

I'd highly recommend this to any nursing major, PA, or nurse that does minimal to moderate jobs involving a stethoscope. However, if you use your stethoscope in a louder setting, or you use it on a cardiac / telemetry floor, I may suggest a better quality stethoscope. Great product!",

For my nursing program, I knew I had to buy a professional stethoscope. I did my research before purchasing this. It works wonderful and you have a 5-year manufacturer warranty. You can hear clearly and easily. You won't regret buying this. All the best!",
