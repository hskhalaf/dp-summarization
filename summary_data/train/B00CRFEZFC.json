It works great and you adjust the air pressure and the nail feeder actuator to help with under and over-driving. It consistently fired without any further adjustment as I used the tool. To be free of an air compressor for this type of tool is a wonderful thing-- especially when you are laying a floor, installing trim, or faux beams. I plan to buy the other air guns from Ryobi to replace other compressor-dependent guns. Thanks, Ryobi for inventing this!",
