I (like others that have commented) just left the water saver green \"filter\" in the shower head, but I might eventually try it without it. It's great even with it in there, but I bet it's awesome without it. I just don't want to waste the water and pay the extra water bill.",

The gentle rain is more relaxing than any multifunction shower we have ever used. The higher pressure function on the shower head is just the \"perfect\" higher pressure.

In the past I had several shower heads that had lots of different adjustment. None of which were used much. I found the setting I liked and left it there. The few times I did try to switch settings, I found it difficult and frustrating to twist the dial. Especially after a few years when lime deposits built up. The lever on the new Moen Velocity makes it very easy to switch modes. It looks really nice too.",

I wish I would have done that first, I have really good water pressure and removed the green filter from reading the reviews. Because of that I don't ever use the knob for the higher pressure.",

This shower head is large and it looks beautiful - we have a large shower - it's 6 feet long and 4 feet wide with a large bench at the opposite end so the size wasn't an issue but we had a cardboard template attached in place beforehand to check the size). Worth the money and we expect it WILL last a lifetime. Plumber installed so no info on DIY installation. (Oh, we bought the arched shower arm - looks fantastic in a 40's bathroom).",

The spray nozzles do trap debris from the water, but you can move them side to side with your finger and it will usually clear up the stream of water. Occasionally I do soak the head in some household vinegar to remove internal deposits. It does not seem to damage the finish at all. Highly recommend this product. It has a great warranty also.",
