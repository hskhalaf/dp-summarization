I bought a dome as well, and although it was big, they didn't like the enclosure capturing the smell, so again they would pee outside.",

Plus I'm sure my cats are happy to suddenly have a litter box double the size of the one they are used to.",

With my past cat we used a liner, so the idea of a cat litter box with no liner interested me. It actually works really well!! I\u2019ve had it for a couple months now and nothing sticks to it. Very easy to clean. No smells. Pleasing to look at (aka not an eye sore). Definitely go for this one over the self cleaning ones.",

I have already purchased 2 of the coated litter scoops and absolutely love them so I knew I wouldn't be dissapointed with this box. This box is as described. I purchased 2 of these boxes and I expect them to hold up nicely for the 6 months I keep a litter box before replacing it. With 4 cats it doesn't matter how fantastic your boxes are, they will absorb some odor. Remember to wash & deodorizer your litter boxes weekly and replace them every 6-12 months.",
