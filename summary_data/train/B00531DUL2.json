Took minutes to set up, I use it for my TV and a movie sounded really good. Also, my Ipod touch in docking station sounded good, now I don't have to mess with the Ipod. I think I'm going to order another one.",

The Freaq as I call in, immerses you in sound, clarity, and sonic bliss! I would indeed recommend this to anyone who listens critically to music. Deep bass, clear pronounced highs with a surround effect. I got mine for $50.00 but would have paid more. Love it, red color is cool also!",

The only downside is the docking of an Android device, you can't. I haven't seen a good docking system for Android yet. However, you simply plug it in with the cord and lay or prop it up. Bluetooth streaming is very cool and cordless speaker is a hit. She even brings it in the bathroom when she takes a shower! No regrets here.",

But it does have good sound quality for sitting on the deck enjoying a cold beverage and a tasty steak with friends. The blue tooth feature works perfectly with both my ipod touch and my Samsung Galaxy Epic phone. Definately worth every penny I paid for it and shipping was fast as well. I highly recommend this product.",

It is very \"tinny\" and has a very weak bass response. Even our old Philips DC310 [...] clock/ipod dock sounds better. We are not audiophiles and frankly I am not usually very picky about my speakers, but the sound quality on this thing is actually distractingly poor to the point where it is irritating to have it on.
