The 2.0's were my favorite until this came along, and it's incredible how well it fits right out of the box. Even though it looks similar to the 7.0 (which are my least favorite), they feel TOTALLY different. I will be ordering a second pair of these soon.",

      "text": "Have used these for about 2 weeks at crossfit and I really like them. They fit me well right out of the box, no rash on the heel or break in required (size 9 M). The toe box is spacious but not loose, I like it. Good for running but I haven't gone more than a mile on them. Coming from a pair of Inov-8 F-lite 250, I'd say these are a better cross training shoe. Overall I am very happy with them.",

I\u2019ve used them primarily in CrossFit classes, but also in Powerlifting and just for running. Definitely saw improvement in my squats, and after the first couple of wears, running is comfortable in them too (got a blister the first time I ran in them, but it was also the first day I wore them so they weren\u2019t broken in)",

These shoes fit really well. They are a little bit stiff and feel narrow the first time I wore them. After the first use they loose and fit perfectly. Can't be happier.",
