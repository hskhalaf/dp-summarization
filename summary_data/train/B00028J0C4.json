The plush fibers pull right out. As of the time of this writing, ALL of these pads I've purchased are now in the garbage can and already gone. For small dogs that do what my rescues do, these pose a health threat, i.e., if the dogs swallow too much of this, there could be problems. I actually had these fibers strewn all over the house.",

She suffers from some separation anxiety so she gets into mischief while in her crate. This is the only mat that has actually worked. We had some issues with her going to the bathroom in the crate so there were some times we had to wash the mat daily. The mat is still in great condition even after her wear and tear and the constant washing. Highly recommend!",

When not in the carriers, these provide a nice little bed for my cats to sleep on. Though not super cushy, my cats enjoy taking naps on this. Wherever I place it around my house, I will usually find a cat resting on it later. I have been very happy with this purchase.",

I would not recommend this as the only bedding you use for your dog if their comfort is a concern as it is really thin. I view it more as a liner/base than an actual dog bed.

It's furry but flat, so eventually if he bites it ... there's nothing to pull out of it. If you have the same problem ... This might help! Plus they have all sort of sizes.

Perhaps suitable for a very small dog. It is not as described and would not purchase again. Lesson learned.",
