I bought this because I wanted a tower fan for the kitchen, where needs to cool when standing up. I still find i need to tilt it a bit, but, its ok for that task. Also good for the breeze reaching you over furniture. That really is the reason for buying this over other models, aside from the fact that its one of the few models you can actually find in stock - well done british commerce. Oh, and getting it out of the box is absolutely ridiculous - never experienced anything like it.",

Difficult to attach the flimsy plastic base to the tower and tower wobbles precariously now it's done. Tower unnecessarily tall as only puts out air at the top so why the bottom of it. It does do what it's meant to do - fan the air. However, would do the same thing in a better and stronger case. Very disappointed.",
