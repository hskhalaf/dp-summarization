Right now I'm giving it one star. 05/09 Update: Replacement arrived as promised, sewing quality is just as bad (loose threads, etc.) and there are no ports for the bladder tube. As of today I still haven't received the return shipping label even though I emailed the seller last week. If I could give it less that one star I would.",

Fit and finish here, unsurprisingly, excellent. - I KNEW in advance that SOG had removed the \"hydration tube\" features to reduce the merit of the pack. - I did not know that the \"sternum strap\" would tend to \"ride up\" and choke me. Again, SOG had make a design revision to save money and removed the waist strap--poor decision. I do not recommend this pack, despite its excellent construction, design revisions have made this unit a totally different product than what is described; and what was so appealing to early reviewers.",

There's a soft line pouch up top for personal electronics, so display screens don't get scratched. The front pocket is extremely versatile, having many different sized pockets inside. All of the straps are very adjustable. This is the nicest backpack I've ever had. This will last at least 5 years and likely 10. You can't go wrong with this backpack.",

Just have to be careful with them. Felt top pocket barely big enough for phone. Had to use other picket on top with no lining.",

The stitching on zipper in the front lower pockets broke and essentially rendering the lower front pocket useless. I like the aspects of the backpacks except the zippers.

SOG offers multiple pockets on this model; however, they are not very usable as they are flat. When items are stored, the pockets bulk up and intrude into the cavity of the main compartment making it very difficult to store items inside.",
