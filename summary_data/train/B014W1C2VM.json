This one felt cheap, like it was manufactured from thinner, flimsier plastic. I think the water pump pumps water faster than the k-cup can accommodate: coffee grounds spill out of the k-cup, getting into the coffee and making a mess of the k-cup slot. Meanwhile, the coffee doesn't just drip out of the spout, it runs along the horizontal surfaces like rain along a clogged gutter, dripping in front of and behind the cup. I am returning this piece of junk and not going back to Cuisinart for a replacement.",

The brewing is instant with he ss-10 you do not need to wait for the water to warm up, that is awesome. The coffee flavor is good. Having the basket to brew your own grinds is great. It is nice to have the basket stored in the brewer so it wont get lost when your not using it. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a kcup brewer.",

Highly recommend getting one. It\u2019s smaller than the Keurig 2.0 model. Looks like better quality than the Keurig model. Works quicker and faster than the Keurig: turn Keurig on. Wait for the water to brew, then it finally brews and you get less than 12 oz of coffee. Cuisinart model: turn it on. Close the lid. Brews a little over 12 oz of coffee.

My top favorite features are - Easy to use, small size (fits in our pantry shelf), fast!- ready and super hot in seconds, accurate cup sizes for brewing, pretty quiet (compared to old keurig), and pretty sleek looking (silver model). Its also easy to clean and fill the water tank and has a filter option, which is nice. I don\u2019t really have anything negative to say about it except maybe the lid for the k cup compartment is a little tough to open/close but seems to be getting easier the more we use it. Million times better than our old k machine",

It is easy to clean and looks really nice sitting on my counter top. Besides providing a really hot cup of coffee, my second favorite feature is the large water reservoir. May sound silly, but I like that I can fill it and it lasts for a few days-makes for a quick cup of coffee. We have a Keurig at work and it has to pre heat before brewing the coffe-the Cuisinart starts brewing instantly. This is a great coffeemaker and well worth the investment.",

This one is great because it brews a SUPER hot cup of coffee and has adjustable portion sizes. So, if you find your K-Cup is too weak, make a smaller cup. The hot water will help brew a better cup too. Happy caffeinating.",

      "text": "Received our brewer in 1 day! We hve had several Keurig coffee makers. Comparitively speaking, they are very expensive and do not last long. Our $250 machine lasted about 2 years then started leaking. We have another Cuisinart machine with a carafe, but we find it to large. This machine is a little smaller that the Keurig it is replacing. Very satisfied with the machine. The only thing I would mention is that it doesn't have a \"AM\" indicator. Just a PM indicator.",

The lift mechanism (to open head) is more clumsy than original and the design is not as nice; looks cheaper. Biggest difference is that they no longer have blue LED lights in reservoir. This was useful because you could instantly see water level plus they looked cool. It is also more noisy. These are better than the Keurig branded machine but I wish someone would make a higher quality unit with better finishes which I'd gladly pay for.",

Coffee is half cold by the time it is finished brewing. I would return this in a heartbeat but immediately threw away the packaging I was so confident in this product. I would replace it with a Kurig if I could afford it.",

When pressing the components to prevent the annoyance its fine. Not sure why Cuisinart could allow such a poor execution. Definitely sending it back. I have never given a product a single star.
