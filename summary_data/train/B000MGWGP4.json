This is the only thing I have done differently so I think it must have been this supplement and drinking BCAA in the morning after testing my blood sugar. I am thinking it is this supplement,",

For some reason, this one wasn't as effective in keeping my falling blood sugar at bay, even though it's the same type of chromium and same dosage. I'm guessing it just has less potency. I'm disappointed because the price was so much better. I'll finish the bottle, but will likely look for another brand's Chromium after this. I do want to add that I have been happy with other NOW products but unfortunately this one didn't make the cut.",

The expiration date on the bottle is still good. When I opened the bottle the first time, it smelled funky. Not being one to give up, the 2nd day, I thought I'd try again. That time, the rancid smell was so bad it almost made me vomit. Can't believe this happened with a NOW brand product. They have always been an excellent company, in my past experience. Unfortunately, this chromium is past Amazon's return date.",
