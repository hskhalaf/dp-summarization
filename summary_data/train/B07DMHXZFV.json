      "verdict": "The construction of the Crossknit 3.0 keeps in mind all the challenges encountered by golfers. Because golfers go through 18 holes while walking on different terrains, comfort is a feature that it provides. The water-resistant upper, stable sole, and spikeless but grippy outsole are well appreciated by its users. Because of the positive feedback garnered by this shoe, it is safe to say that it has hit its hole in one.",
      "pros": [
        "Almost all of those who reviewed the Adidas Crossknit 3.0 would recommend the shoe to anyone",
        "A high number of testers have found this shoe comfortable throughout the 18 holes",
        "The selection of colorways and design appeals to several consumers",
        "The lugs are composed of a hard-wearing rubber which provides traction when teeing off and walking on the course, says a significant amount of wearers",
        "The composition of the soles is moderately stiff to provide stability to the foot, according to a few purchasers",
        "One purchaser appreciates the spikeless construction because it minimizes the need to change shoes after the game"

      "cons": [
        "An expert reviewer says that its style only caters to a niche audience",
        "It will most likely not appeal the older market of golfers",

I have the ecco biom boa's and they hurt my feet when I started walking courses. So I was looking for a new pair. These are the best shoes I've ever used to walk a course. I trust Adidas Boost the most of all the brands for cushioning when you walk a course. You won't be disappointed. I have fairly wide feet and these fit perfect.",
