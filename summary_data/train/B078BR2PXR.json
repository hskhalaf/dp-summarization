And I\u2019m glad that I did. I got the new one within two days. This one pasted the water test. It fits perfectly and after going swimming it withheld from the water entering. Will buy again when I change my phone.",

Initial test showed that it was watertight, but very shortly after I started using it, it wouldn\u2019t stay snapped together. Any drop would pop open the case and it was difficult to get it to snap back together. It also impeded the touch screen, mostly in the left lower corner. I put up with it as long as I could but just replaced it after a few months of use.",
