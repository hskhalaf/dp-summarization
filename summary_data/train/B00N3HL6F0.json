CON: If you want to have the kid drive the car through an obstacle course, it is very challenging to steer. This car is also INSANELY LOUD and plays obnoxious music and SFX. I am quite accustomed to noisy kids toys and have a pretty high tolerance, but this one is the worst. be warned. I have a 1 year old and a 3 year old, and I purchased 2 of these with hopes they could play/race/share with friends. You can not. There is only 1 radio channel availavle. see the 'questions' section and be warned.",

It was a gift, and the child opened the toy, only to found out it is not working. I contacted the seller. They were nice and very helpful, and very quickly they send me a new toy! It works. And is super cute. The child I gifted it to, loves it as well. This toy is really fun. (I would give 5 stars, but because the first order came defected and the child was disappointed, just like me, I had to take one star away. But they are nice company, that works with you to solve any issues!).",

I think as he grows and can learn to operate it on his own it will appeal more to him. It is very durable and holds up. I think for parents with kids nervous of toys that move, they should wait till the child outgrows they fear and can control it on their own, otherwise it is a great toy for many ages.",

The car is a bit awkward to control as it doesn't have multi-directional turning. It can go straight forward, or backward turning in one direction. Sometimes getting the thing to turn the direction you want in a limited amount of space is hard or impossible. Also as an aside, the antennae are a bit too rigid (especially for kids) and our kids were quick to snap the plastic covering of the antennae at the base, exposing metal antennae coil.

It is very safe for little toddlers. It has no sharp edges, no parts that can break off, and the antennas are flexible with capped tips that cannot be removed. That was my major concern for my 2 year old grandson. It has different buttons that make different sounds when pressed, with flashing headlights too. It's colorful and is lightweight so it can't do damage to your wall's baseboards. I wasn't sure I'd be keeping before it arrived, but I love it and know my grandson will too!",

The buttons were easy enough for him to handle and the little guy pups out and he can play with him.",

Fortunately the box was not damaged when it arrived, however, I tried to remove the mailing label, but could not do it completely, thus the box looked marred. Not cool for presenting as a gift.",

The controls only allow it to go forward or reverse turning, there's no forward turning, but for a two year old it doesn't matter. The car plays fun music when you push buttons and the removable driver is fun. My only complaint is that antennas aren't very strong. My son can sit on his bed and play with his car, but once it gets to the other side of the room it quits responding. For a two year old it's great and you can't beat the price.",
