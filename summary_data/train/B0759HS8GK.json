These Porgs are year-round molters and they will shed their fur all over the place no matter how gentle you are in handling them. Ultimately, this was a huge drawback, so we did what was best for the little guy and sent this otherwise cute alien life form back to his home planet. Maybe next time his breeders will get this one detail right!",

Apparently it ships with the Display mode which does only have the one sound. However, by switching to ON, his vocabulary increases to the 3 sounds as advertised. I'm sure my grandson will be delighted.",

This isn't as much of a \"plush\" since the whole bottom is hard plastic to support the battery compartment, and the center of porg is also slightly hard for the noise toggle.
