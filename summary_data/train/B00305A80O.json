The Chlorine tube is more of an amber shading so it is much easier to tell where your level is out vs the variable piss color of all the other kits i have had. Instructions and case are both very good. Just overall worth the few dollars more over other kits.",

Additionally; unlike other manufacturers, you can by the components individually. I happen to use the Ph the most frequently, therefore refills are critical. If you are just a casual pool person, try this, and see how much more accurate your readings will be, and your resulting pool maintenance improvement. If you don't care, then there is no hope for you.",

While it does the job it is a bit harder to use and judge results than the larger pro kits. For a single hot tub it is fine along with using good test strips. For a big pool I would choose the better and larger kits. For the money it is a reasonable choice for a hot tub.",

Not worth it. The test strips are SO inaccurate and cause more headache. Buy this kit, you'll be glad you did.",

      "text": "This is an oustanding test kit. You can tell that it is a high quality item, not a inferior \"made-in-you-know-where\" lookalike. The color standards are easy to view and the fill lines are spot on. You can also tell that the dropper bottles dispense precise drops so that your tests results are CONSISTENT and reliable every time. I had a stubborn fight with algae last month. Anyone who has ever had to go through that will tell you it's no fun. Never again will I let my water chemistry get off track !!! Skip over the kits sold in home improvement stores/mass retailers and buy the brand that the pros use.",
