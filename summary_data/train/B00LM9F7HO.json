The Scarpa approach shoe in question can also be considered a precisely fitting hiker with A-grade water protection.This grippy mid-top shoe, however, is marred with a few mishaps, perhaps the most unamusing of which would have to be its below-standard toeing sensitivity. Nonetheless, the Zen Pro Mid GTX is another one of Scarpa\u2019s greats, thanks to its convincing list of approach-focused qualities.",

      "title": "Fantastic boots",
      "text": "Extremely well manufactured boots - all the sewing and sticking is top notch with no no stitch out of line or smeared glue. The boots feel rock solid and pretty well padded on the inside. All my other hiking boots/shoes seemed like poorly made toys compared to this. Sizing works just about right for me. Unfortunately I got tripped by trying a pair of Scarpa crux that were running small and ordered the Zen 1/2 size larger and they were too large (my measured size is slightly above 10 and I usually wear 10 or 10.5 depending on the manufacturer or model. I ordered 11 and felt like I was wearing clown boots). Will end up reordering a smaller size.",

I do use wool socks which as a geologist I have learned my feet are the number one priority so I spare no expense on them. I usually wear a 10.5 to 11 depending and I got an 11 in these since I wear the wool socks which are larger. They fit great, I would not have wanted them any smaller.",

This included the infamous scramble up the talus field (the \"fan\"), then the \"slab\" and finally the \"chimney\" of the Huntington Ravine headwall. The Zen were great for this scramble, being able to smear and edge rather well. But the Zen were also very comfortable for this medium-distance hike. Over the years I've hiked in a great many boots, and these are definitely among the best. They seem to be good at almost any task you throw at them.",

As with most Scarpa's, the insoles leave a bit to be desired, but Dr Scholls fixes that up for $12. I use these for walking, not hiking....Scarpa has MUCH better options for hiking. These are too light, and not waterproof.....for \"real\" hiking....but they are quality boots, nonetheless! Highly recommend!",
