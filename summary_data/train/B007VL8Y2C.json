These other keyboards out here are just awful. In fact, when I purchased a new Mac Book Air laptop, I could not believe that the keys are so thin it's almost like typing directly on a flat surface. So, this keyboard makes computing all the better because it's easier for me to depress keys and it has a very comfortable touch and feel. If you're looking for a nice keyboard, that helps you to type fast, this is the one for you!",

Another feature that may need tweaking by the manufacturer is the caps lock. It lights up as on Apple keyboards when the caps are activated and briefly shows a capped A on the monitor. Then the light goes off unlike on an Apple keyboard. Depressing it again shows the crossed A (caps off). A constant light when caps are on would be much better like on standard keyboards.",

Saw this thing, knew LogiTech would be a \"step down\" but ordered it anyway. Turns out the keyboard is indeed plastic, but it looks fine and works well. I would argue the keyboard feel equals the Apple keyboard's excellent spring back. The Solar panel really does work. The keyboard so far has had no bluetooth interface problems and due to the larger footprint the keys are properly spaced. Happy wife. Happy life.",

Perhaps I just got some bad batteries, but seemed like an unusually bad design from Mac -- reading about several other customers that had the same problem in the forums. And Apple's response is \"too bad.\" This keyboard avoids all that with solar power. I've only had it 2 months but it works like a champ.",

      "text": "Very good compact keyboard that works well with multiple bluetooth capable devices. Pros: 1) Works right out of the box. 2) Works between multiple devices (MacBook Air, iPhone and iPad in the this case) with a push of a button. 3) No batteries required. 4) Fits stylistically in with Mac devices quite well. [Relatively Minor] Cons: 1) Squishy keys similar to standard Mac keyboards...but not quite exactly right. 2) Plasticky build quality. 3) Not backlit. 4). Odd \"Caps Lock\" mode where key only lights up for a few seconds. A good deal, especially when paired w/ my v470 bluetooth mouse.",

For now though, this keyboard feels great and is very convenient. Highly recommended!",

Sleek, lightweight, portable, smooth keys, ENDLESS juice!!Reviewed in the United States on January 27, 2017Verified Purchase This keyboard for me is fluid, easy and fast to type on. It\u2019s lightweight!! The size is (small to medium) perfect to \u201ctoss\u201d in my backpack! A protective pouch is sold separately. I bought another keyboard on eBay for backup since I noticed they\u2019re not making it anymore??!!! Huh?? And there\u2019s not another like it! Except maybe for the same model, but with the numeric keypad extension--but that defeats my purpose of portable size.\nOk, someone said Apple\u2019s keyboard\u2019s better. It may be--if buying batteries or having to keep it hooked in isn\u2019t an issue. But it still types smooth and easy!!\nOne reviewer had trouble pairing it. Drat! That's a real bummer! I\u2019ve had mine 4 years, and (fortunately I suppose) never had a problem pairing it with other devices back and forth, or with it un-pairing on shutdown. There have been occasions (maybe one every 2-3 months) where I did have to re-pair it by turning it off & on, hitting the button on the bottom and turning my laptop\u2019s Bluetooth icon off and on.\n\n4 years of Bread and Butter!!! Sleek, lightweight, portable, smooth keys, ENDLESS juice!! which also takes up LESS desk space! LOVE it!!Read more 4 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse USB Cords5.0 out of 5 stars Best Keyboard for multiple OSX/iOS devicesReviewed in the United States on July 14, 2012Verified Purchase Let me start by saying that I've used the apple bluetooth keyboard for about three years now, and after much thought, I decided to give this keyboard a shot. The reason for the switch was due to a few annoyances with the Apple bluetooth keyboard. I was considering buying the Logitech K750, but when I heard that a newer model was coming out with some new features I decided to wait for it. Now that I've used it I'm definitely glad I waited. I'll try to break down in detail some of the best features of the keyboard that I find most appealing.\n\nEasy Switching - In a nutshell, you can pair this keyboard to up to three devices at once, and switch between them with the click of a button. I only tested this with my Mac and my iPhone, but it was worked flawlessly so far. There's a bluetooth button on the back of the keyboard that will let you choose which key you want to pair your device with, and once it's paired you can go from typing on a computer to typing on your iPhone in about 7-8 seconds. With the Apple bluetooth keyboard it was a hassle switching between devices since you had to disconnect/reconnect each device if you wanted to switch. I don't really have a reason to use a keyboard with my iPhone and I assume it would be much better with an iPad, but it is pretty neat having the ability to type on it if i wanted.\n\nDesign - I was a bit skeptical about switching from Apple hardware to Logitech hardware. Let's be honest, Apple makes very good looking products. The thing that i was most worried about was the fact that this keyboard was plastic. I liked the feel of the aluminum with the Apple keyboard, but after using this keyboard for about a week, I have to say that I don't notice ANY difference in quality. This keyboard is built extremely well and feels very solid as you type. I find the keys to be a bit deeper than on the Apple keyboard, which I really like. The layout is identical to the Apple keyboard, except for a few buttons up top. There is now a mission control and launchpad button, as well as the three bluetooth buttons. Also, the screen brightness is moved to the F6 and F7 keys that were previously black on the Apple keyboard (they are used for the backlit keyboard brightness on most mac laptops).\n\nSolar Charging - I've only used this keyboard for 5-6 days so far, but ever since it was taken out of the packaging and paired up to the Logitech Control Center Software, the charge hasn't dropped below 100%. If you're thinking this keyboard requires direct sunlight to efficiently charge then you're wrong. A small desk lamp or a slightly lit room is enough to keep it charged. My keyboard sits about 15 feet away from a window with closed curtains and it still manages to keep a charge. I would even imagine the backlight from a bright computer/tv screen might even charge the keyboard in a completely dark room. It seems this will solve the battery problem with the Apple keyboard, which was going though about 3 AA batteries a month.\n\nNow for a few negatives about this keyboard. Most of them are small nitpicks, that might not be a problem for most people but they still manage to annoy me.\n\nThe first problem that I noticed was that the caps lock light doesn't stay lit when you click it. When you turn caps lock on it will light up for 2 seconds and then turn back off. I've often found myself typing out a sentence or two before realizing it was on the whole time. (I should probably look up more when I type I guess lol).\n\nThere is a few workarounds to this problem though. The Logitech Control Center Software has two options for caps lock. You can either have a small icon come up in the menu bar when the caps lock is on, or you can have notifications pop up on the screen, similar to the ones that would come up when you change the volume. I never really look up into the menu bar unless I'm checking the time, and I really don't like the pop up notifications either, so I turned them both off, but I do appreciate the options. I don't know how much the light would drain the battery if it were to stay on, and I assume that's why logitech didn't want it staying on, but oh well. I'll deal with it.\n\nThe other problems I noticed was that the mission control and launchpad buttons didn't work out of the box. I was able to add a keyboard shortcut for the mission control key, but I can't pair anything to the launchpad key at all. I looked up the problem on logitech's website, and I still haven't found a solution that worked.\n\nThe last thing that annoys me about this keyboard is that there's no previous/next keys. On the Apple keyboard they are on opposite sides of the play/pause button, but on this keyboard they aren't there. I usually listen to music when I type papers and I've grown used to changing songs with those keys. The play/pause button is there, but unfortunately the previous/next keys aren't.\n\nThose are a few minor nitpicks about the keyboard. Nothing too serious, and nothing that would deter me from using it. The pros definitely outweigh the cons.\n\nIf you're looking for a keyboard that you would use for a Mac or possibly an iPad then you should definitely consider this keyboard. It offers the most bang for your buck, and is essentially an Apple bluetooth keyboard with more features. I know that people are attracted to the Apple keyboard because of its nice design, but this keyboard is just as beautiful, and I couldn't be happier with it. A very wise buy for sure.\n\nEDIT\n\nAs of January 23rd, 2013, the power in the keyboard has still never dipped below 99%, and I still only have a small lamp and the light from my computer as a light source.\n\nI have also purchased an iPad and an iPad mini, and I find myself switching between these devices quite often. This is where the keyboard really shines since it is super easy to pair and switch between devices. Within 3 seconds the keyboard is paired with the iPad and is ready to type, and with the click of one button, the keyboard can be easily switched back to my Mac.\n\nOverall I am still very happy with my purchase, and still believe that this is the best bluetooth keyboard you can buy, especially if you ever plan on pairing it to multiple devices.Read more 194 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse dcl2.0 out of 5 stars What is the point of a solar keyboard that dies?Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2019Verified Purchase On one hand, this keyboard gave excellent service for the 7 years I used it. Very light duty, so it's not like it was stressed. But on the other hand, what is the point? A solar keyboard should be, an eco-smart choice. Runs for ever on light energy, and as long as it is not abused, never have to replace it, right?\n\nOn Monday, the K760 was fine, typing along as usual. I've never worn out a keyboard. I've never had one fail. Had them chewed up by a parrot, but not fail spontaneously. On Tuesday, dead as a brick. No power light. No Caps Lock light. No nothing. Plenty of sunshine, plenty of ambient light. But dead. I have to assume that the solar battery (?) has spat the dummy.\n\nLogitech phone support was useless, as anticipated. So I shall attempt to recycle this brick and go back to using my Apple keyboards with rechargeable batteries. What a disappointment.Read more One person found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse X. Lam3.0 out of 5 stars Not bad but buyer beware!Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2016Verified Purchase Overall, I'm content with the keyboard when its connected. I say that because after about 5-10 minutes of non-use, the keyboard disconnects from the computer or whatever it is that you have it connected to. Is it a deal-breaker, I wouldn't say that but it is quite annoying. After it disconnects, you have to tap on a key and wait for it to re-connect, which takes a few seconds, again, annoying!!! When you have a keyboard connected and you want to use it, you want to be able to use it RIGHT AWAY. Not have to wait a few seconds for it to re-connect and then start typing what you want to type.\n\nWith that rant being said, overall its a great little keyboard. Clean, looks nice, low-profile. I came from using a Logitech K750 which I was going to get again because I really liked it but once I discovered this one. I wanted to give this one a try cuz with the K750, it has a numeric keypad, which is nice but I rarely used it. I will say that the K750 didnt have that connecting and disconnecting issue. It was always connected and ready to use.\n\nJust and FYI to any future buyers out there.Read more 7 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse C. M.5.0 out of 5 stars A Bit Pricey - But Well Worth It!!!Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2019Verified Purchase I broke my other keyboard like this one and I decided to go out on a limb and purchase another one before its too late to find a keyboard that still has enough traction to depress buttons. These other keyboards out here are just awful. In fact, when I purchased a new Mac Book Air laptop, I could not believe that the keys are so thin it's almost like typing directly on a flat surface. So, this keyboard makes computing all the better because it's easier for me to depress keys and it has a very comfortable touch and feel. If you're looking for a nice keyboard, that helps you to type fast, this is the one for you!Read more Helpful Comment Report abuse See all reviews from the United States TOP INTERNATIONAL REVIEWS \ndrjonhandy5.0 out of 5 stars My favourite keyboard, ever!Reviewed in Canada on June 29, 2017Verified Purchase Love the idea that this never needs a battery, and the compact design is just perfect. (I don't use a number pad frequently, so the added length on another keyboard just meant that it didn't fit into my briefcase.) Construction is quite sturdy. Built in risers add a nice tilt to the keyboard. Nice solid action on the keys. Rock solid connection. In fact, I liked this one so much that I searched for another one on e-Bay, since Logitech has discontinued it.Read more Helpful Sending feedback...Thank you for your feedback.Sorry, we failed to record your vote.

But instead of buying that, i went for this because of the efficiency in instant switching between multiple devices and a slower panel that keep it powered. I have to say, i'm pretty much satisfied with the product. If you are looking for an alternative, buy with eyes closed. Not as premium as Apple's keyboard (which is designed out of aluminium), this doesn't feel any less premium as well.Read more One person found this helpful Helpful Sending feedback...Thank you for your feedback.Sorry, we failed to record your vote.
