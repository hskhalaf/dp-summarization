      "text": "Very nice! Love the colors. The wood is a darker finish and the metal hooks are a dark oil rubbed finish? It matches all the other hooks and hangers we got for our bathroom so that's a plus! Very easy to assemble. Comes with all the hardware you need. It did not come with dry wall anchors. So you may need those if you plan on hanging heavy stuff on it. I didn't find any need for them though. Comes with the screw holes already drilled and ready. Also comes with covers for those holes if you don't want the silver screws to be seen. So that was a nice touch that I wasn't expecting. Very satisfied with this buy!",

If you want to attach into studs you have to drill new holes. I put one drywall screw in the center hole, and into a stud. Then used the rack as a template to mount the drywall molly fasteners, which are not supplied, and secured it to the wall. One drywall screw will hold the 35lb rating they give in the description.",

We bought two so we would have 12 hooks all the way across wall. We did have to trim ends on both and they fit as snug as if they were custom made. I am buying more for each room now. Love them!!!!",

The wood is good quality and the hooks are nice and solid and right now I'm looking for more places in my house to mount more. Definitely need some in my honey's bathroom.

If you dont have studs where the 3 holes are, just use anchors to keep it in place, as we did, and it holds it in place just fine. Overall it is a good solid product and would recommend.",
