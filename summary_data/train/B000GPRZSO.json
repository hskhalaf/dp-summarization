I eat them when I crave something sweet and chocolatey, or on days when I think I may need some more protein (I am mostly vegan). There is no \"aftertaste\" like many protein and vitamin filled bars.. They are kind of \"light\", not overly gooey or chewy.. a bit of a crunch... great alone, or with some water, juice, smoothie, or even sliced thinly and put on a plate with some fruit, cheese, or ice cream... amazing product.!",

The taste is spot on, like I'm eating an Andes mint in protein bar form. Across the board I've enjoyed using the builder bars to get protein in on the go and I'll definitely be continuing my subscription to this one.",

I was a bit skeptical about the vanilla almond as I am not a fan of almonds but this bar is great, I do not find a strong taste of almond. I have seen some reviews that stated the bars had past their expiration dates, mine and all of the other bars that I have ever got from Amazon have been well with in the expiration dates.",

It's a vanilla yogurt like coating on the outside but very good. My other favorite is the mint chocolate. Amazing! Both great for a post workout or snack on the go if you have an active lifestyle. And if you like regular Clif Bars, I recommend oatmeal raisin walnut, blueberry crisp, and carrot cake.",

I store them in the fridge. I am diabetic and eat half prior to a workout and the other half post-workout. One bar will keep me satisfied for a good 4 or 5 hours.
