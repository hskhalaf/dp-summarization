Not much to complain about this machine... also purchased the smaller classic blue version and that has not killed anything, so definitely happy with this purchase. Also tried all types of rat traps with no luck before using this device. We are using this in our industrial warehouse. The rats run wild under the building and we set this up near the plumbing drain areas. We share our building with a restaurant and they must be feeding these monsters. Reminder to myself... never to eat at the restaurant were connected too!",

I secure its position w/double faced tape \ud83d\ude0f.... Or the little suckers find a way to reach the bait thru the vented end without a threat. I've caught literally dozens of mice over a 3 year period. I own 2 and will purchase a 3rd",

I had better luck with spring traps and bait. I ended up throwing it out. I owned a Rat Zapper by the same company during the late 90's and it was much better in performance.

I use sunflower seeds to bait it. The only down side is I cannot set it out in rainy weather. I solved that by buying an inexpensive plastic storage bin, cutting out an opening, and set it over the trap. Perfect protection from rain. Excellent experience with this product and I would buy it again.",

Since we are on a slab, the next thing we knew, they would be in our house, and we couldn't allow that to happen. So we had to defend our property, and the Zapper helped us do just that. The squirrels are just destructive. And nobody likes mice.",

I got lucky after it got left out when it rained... let it dry for 2-3 days and still worked, though a previous model short-circuited after getting wet. Cleaning it as per the instructions (letting it sit in 1/2 inch-deep water) doesn't cut it. Put on a cleaning glove, get some damp paper towels, and get your hand up in there!",

The metal plates in there are very sensitive (as evidence of the dead bugs) and rely on the vermin making contact between them, thus completing the electric circuit.
