I wish there were larger side pockets to store all the extra cards that you don\u2019t need to use weekly/monthly- I\u2019ll be keeping them in a large ziplock bag. The three yellow pockets on the bottom should be deeper as well because they have a Velcro closure but if a card is in there it won\u2019t seal. Even with those few flaws I would buy it again. My kids are 2.5 & 4 so it\u2019s a great learning tool for that age.",

Also, still need to figure out what I\u2019m going to do for the months where the 31st will need to be in a sixth row, since the calendar only has five (a limitation I did know about beforehand). You\u2019d think the makers of these calendars would actually look at each month of the year before making these, so that they\u2019d know that some months would require six rows!",

When I go this, it was a cheap looking plastic canvas material and had poor stitching. The material around the edges had to be cut at the bottom because it was much longer than the actual calendar. Also, the cardboard pieces were very difficult to \"punch out\" and some of the glossy finish peeled off when they finally were separated. This calendar also came with waaayyyyy too many blank squares- I would rather have had more \"No School\" inserts so that my money was put to good use on the cardboard.",

It had some super random cards that went with it but covered all the basics. It\u2019s much bigger than I expected it would be, so check the dimensions if you have a certain spot you have in mind. It wouldnt fit on a closet door bc it was too wide, but it did fit on our playroom door. I bought some of those Command hooks to hang it with. Works like a charm!",

More thoughtful is the extra blank cards for replacement if the printed cards are lost or damaged. (This happens often, the kiddos can rip off a new toy in minute!) My son loves it and this really helps him to learn as he can visualize and recognize the words as time goes. I think it's a worth buy especially if your kids are doing remote learning like mine. Highly recommend this.",

I might just laminate them so they last longer. Overall, I think this is a perfect calendar for small children.",

With her autism she gets really excited and obviously cannot control herself sometimes and she'll pull really hard to get the letters out and unfortunately it's already ripped apart. For normal school children I could see this being very nice and easy set to use though so I only docked it 1 start because I think a design change could really help make this thing last longer.",

Also, the TODAY, YESTERDAY, TOMORROW pockets would be better set up as YESTERDAY, TODAY, TOMORROW, in my opinion.",

The whole thing is really durable and well made. The cards that do in the slot are also very thick. The pictures are cute. They have plenty of holidays as well as blank ones to make your own. There are also pokets at the bottom to keep the cards you aren't using at the time. It is very big. I am very glad that I bought it. We use it at home as we unschool. I just keep it up and she enjoys looking at all that is on the calender and doing the weather.",

Slight problem - if the start of the month begins later than Wed. there won't be enough pockets for all 31 days of that month (no biggie) Material is nice & heavy - very sturdy.",

In general I'm very happy and impressed with this calendar. Highly recommend.",

My only gripe - the inserts to show special days are designed to cover the numbers. I'd prefer an extra line as you have for the weather so that the numbers are always visible. I still think its the best learning calendar on the market.",
