Thankfully I had not yet returned the item, so I risked asthma, opened it up and took photos ...I wish I could photograph the smell! Considering the beautiful items shown on \"Flexi's\" listings, as well as the rave reviews, I think Amazon should spend their energy trying to figure out how this could have happened, rather than rejecting an accurate review.",

I would really recommend this even though it's expensive. I have big dogs (Pitbulls 75 and 85 lbs) but like the Medium size because they are lighter and better for a woman's hands IMHO.

The leash appears to be made well and feels like quality workmanship. The handle is a comfortable design and it\u2019s easy to use. We are able to give her more freedom as she continues to recover while at the same time, remain in control of her and prevent her from chasing a bunny or squirrel. I highly recommend this quality retractable leash. We purchased a (giant) medium for our 50# Goldendoodle and it\u2019s just right for her.",

      "text": "My none month old pit-lab broke his previous flexi leash which was not one with the flat leash. I ordered this as a replacement. I was initially skeptical when it arrived. Unlike my other flexo leashes this does not have a housing around the spool at all. After using it for a week I have decided I like the re-design. With the older style ones if there was a tie-up or snag inside it usually meant a new leash. So far I have had no snags but it seems like if it does twist up somehow, which it doesn't seem like a possibility, it would be fixable. My pup is STRONG but so far this is holding up very well.",

Very smooth operation and spring has decent recoil, but not too much. Is heavier duty than our worn out flexi freedom 26'. Would recommend to anybody needing additional lead for their pets. Also, clasp has a stout plastic leader that protects stitching from becoming frayed by normal use/wear and tear/dogs that like to chew lead when attached to collar. I like this addition coming from the older flexi freedom 26'.",

I highly recommend this leash if you have a big dog who is a hunter. It is the only brand I will use. Prior to Flexi she broke 3 leashes in taking off after whatever her hunting eyes saw.",
