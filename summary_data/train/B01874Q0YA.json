The helmet fits securely yet comfortably and headphones around the back of my neck are no problem with this model. Cool enough for me although my average trike speed is about 8-10 mph and periodically up to 20; little annoying wind noise heard. I will update if I experience the color fading. I'm out triking every 3 days or more.",

I also really like the color and my fellow mountain bike riders like the fact that they can easily see me because of the bright pink on my helmet. I have not taken a tumble with it, so how well it will protect my head I do not know, but I like the coverage on my head and feel I would be well protected. Would recommend this helmet.",

Sizing chart states that the large helmet accommodates up to a 63 cm head, and while the head band did fit my head at 60 cm, the front portion of the chin strap was positioned uncomfortably right over my ears. No amount of adjustment could correct this. If the chin strap's front portion originated more anteriorly this helmet would have been useful. The overall quality seems nice. Maybe for someone with a smaller noggin, or someone with rear set ears this would be a good choice. I ordered a troy lee A1 as a replacement.",

    "description": "The team at Smith, having spent decades reducing lens fogging, knows quite a bit about ventilation. One look at the Forefront Helmet, with its breathable Koroyd tube structure, shows how willing they are to depart from convention to create a product that's truly great. The Koroyd tubes are tiny, extruded, co-polymer tubes that absorb about 30% more impact than traditional EPS foam, and, due to their hollow nature, allow air to flow freely in a way that foam simply can't. On top of that, the microstructures allow for less material to be used in the construction of the helmet, which adds up to a highly-protective helmet that weighs in at just about 285grams. It's not just a cool-looking helmet that protects your head, though. The AirEvac system, borrowed from its snow helmets, moves hot air away from your glasses or goggles to keep them fog-free. The visor has two positions to keep the sun out of your eyes, and there's also a threaded brass insert on the top of the helmet designed to accept aftermarket mounting kits for GoPro cameras and Light and Motion lights. The helmet's fit is secured via Smith's VaporFit retention system, which anyone familiar with Smith's snow line will be familiar with.",
