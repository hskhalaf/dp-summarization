It just said avoid contact with skin, getting wet, and getting into the air. I hope it's ok to breath in after vacuuming.",

It kills the adults on contact, and does control the eggs and larvae fairly well. It's natural and safe to use around pets, and is said to be able to be sprayed right on them. Well, I use coconut oil on my cats now, instead, but I spray Simple Solutions around my carpet and linoleum about once a day (had a recent flea infestation, so now it's down to the stragglers) and it does great!

It contains Pyrethrins, which are 'natural' compounds that act as both an insecticide and insect repellent, so it will get rid of much more than just fleas. Perfect for the basement! It's still a toxic (mildly) chemical though, so keep kids and pets away, especially cats. Added bonus - when you vacuum this up, any stray fleas/eggs in your vacuum bag should also be killed, so no more putting vacuum bags in the freezer or throwing out half-empty ones.",

Open a window and get a draft going through. DO NOT VACUUM IT UP!!! Leave it for days (it says up to 24 hours). People who are complaining are only leaving it in for a few hours. I promise you if you leave it in the carpet for a few days it'll kill the fleas. It smells citrusy so it's also kind of a room freshener. Give your animal a flea bath and high-quality flea meds. Don't go for the cheap stuff, especially if they've infested your carpet too.",
