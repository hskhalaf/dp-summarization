It takes about 2 minutes to grind enough for 3 cups each day, and I can read something or watch the forest outside my window while I grind.

It was just too big for me, and I did not like the materials felt.",

It also seemed to take FOREVER to grind enough to use. I bought this hoping it would be as good as I was expecting. It was. Much faster, holds more coffee, has a lid for unused grounds and the grounds were all much more uniform than the other type. Can't speak of longevity but overall very pleased with the purchase.",

The one down side is that you don't really know what your grounds are going to look like until you start doing it. There aren't any numbers/guides on the dial that adjusts the coarseness of your grounds, so you just kind of have to do trial and error until you figure it out.",

If you don't retighten, it comes so loose that whole coffee beans slip through. The nut holding the crank on comes loose as well with every 25 revolutions. Design flaw? Maybe I got a faulty product?

It's an OK little mill and the glass container holds enough ground coffee for about 2 1/2 full Chemex brews. My biggest complaint is in the construction of the handle. Out of the box, the tightening nut that holds the handle to the mill vibrates loose during use and had to constantly be re-tightened. Lately, the eye of the handle itself has begun to stretch and has started skipping and not turning the mill during finer grinds. It would just have been nice if a slightly harder grade of steel would have been used on the handle, instead of it wearing out after 90-100 uses.",
