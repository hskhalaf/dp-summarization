      "text": "I debated a long time before buying this polish. I love it! I can't tell you how different this polish is. First, the bottle is different. Classy, pretty, and rectangular. The color is gorgeous. One coat of color coats with no streaking. I wear this with a top coat and it lasts weeks with no chipping. This nail lacquer makes my nails and hands look pretty; a simple thing, maybe, but I don't bite my nails or cuticles anymore--it would mess up my nails. I also bought Tea With the Queen, a beautiful neutral shade. I have paid more for Deborah Lippmann polish and there is no comparison. Butter is better!",

I ordered this polish in Trout Pout and have used $1 polishes with better quality than this. Please do not order anything from this brand online or on Amazon, and at least try a bottle out and buy at a store instead of taking a risk by buying online. I'll never order anything from this brand again. Hope others wisen up and do the same.",
