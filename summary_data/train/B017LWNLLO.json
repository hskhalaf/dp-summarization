I'm using prefolds me my little guy is only 3 months and will be grown out of size 1 VERY soon. The inserts are just too expensive though; one of the big reasons I did cloth was to save money.",

I have had some wicking to the elastic if I don\u2019t change my son quickly enough, but I\u2019ve never had a blow out like with disposables. These hold in pee and poo really well, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend going more than 3 hours. Make sure your diaper is fully tucked into the cover once it\u2019s on & there should be no problem :)",

      "text": "When it comes to diaper covers it doesn't get much better than Thirsties, especially for your money. They are well made, sturdy, wash well and easy to use. The patterns are all cute as well. I will say that the snap closure may take an extra few seconds compared to the hook and loop closure but the edges of the hook and loop closure (velcro) rub on the baby's tummy leaving bad red marks. The snaps are great, give a snug fit and leave no harsh marks on your LO. I highly recommend Thirsties diaper cover in snap. You won't be disappointed.",

Grovia trainers are also pricy but offer a lot more flexibility since they can be used as diapers or underpants.",

I'm only giving it four stars because they suggest these can go until 9 months, and they probably won't fit beyond 6 months, unless you have a particularly small baby. My son is in the 60 percentile and 5 months and I don't see these fitting much longer. Even still, they are great quality and have great resale value.",
