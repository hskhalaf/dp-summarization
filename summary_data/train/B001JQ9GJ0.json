Our original cake topper fell through two days before the wedding, I ordered this and had it shipped overnight from Amazon, it arrived on time, and I was thrilled. We did not have time to order the customer hair color version, so my daughter painted the hair to match the couple and it turned out fantastic.",

It looks just like the pic. Got me and my husband quite a lot of laughs cause of them holding each others butts lol.",

It has some weight to it and I would not put it on a small soft cake, lol. I went looking for a dragon and a fairy, but this worked out just fine. Wife is happy so i am happy.",
