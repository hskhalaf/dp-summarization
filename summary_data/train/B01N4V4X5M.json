      "text": "After being plugged in to the charger for a day the speaker/battery goes dead. The first time it happened all the controls on top went dark. The 2nd time it happened (a day later) the lights looked normal for a max charge, but it would not play. The blueTooth was connected to an Echo Dot, which said that the bluetooth was connected but the speaker did not play. The same thing happened when connecting with the Aux cable, so it's not a bluetooth problem. To get the SoundCore working again, I have to unplug the power and plug it back in. At that point it looks like its charging a completely drained battery.",

Granted it\u2019s only IPX5 certified, but I\u2019ll just have to be more mindful of that. It\u2019s a trade off. At this price you\u2019ll be hard pressed to find a better, bigger, fuller sounding Bluetooth speaker. Update: This thing is a wonderful two in one device, a solid great sounding speaker and power bank. I had to go out of town for a week and packed this speaker with me. Since wall outlets were scarce, the ability to use this speaker as a power bank to charge my phone really helped during the trip.",

The bass boost does provide additional bass, but it is not significant (depending on the degree of bass in the original recording). The boost also darkens the mids and highs. Really, without the boost, the bass is fine and the mids and highs are clear. It's nice to have the option of not using the boost. There is distortion at higher volumes, especially with the boost activated. Blootooth paring is easy. It is not the best speaker, but it is adequate for the application I have in mind.",

Overall sound quality for this size speaker in my opinion is very good which is essential to me as I mostly listen to ambient/house/techno on this speaker and want that rich sound. Portability is also great. You can buy better sounding speakers for way more $, but for the price of this speaker, you cannot beat it.",

We downsized and started minimizing our home and no longer wanted clunky, large electronics in our home, so this was a great solution. It\u2019s really convenient to be able to bring your music to whatever room you want and have good quality. The sound was comparable to 3 small speakers we had connected to a receiver. We also discovered that if you put the speaker on top of a piece of furniture that\u2019s kind of high, like a refrigerator or a shelf, the sound quality is even better.

I was looking at a less expensive model, but SO glad I got this one. Much better quality sound than I expected.",
