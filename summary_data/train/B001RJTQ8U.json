It often has to be firmly tapped face down on the ironing board to stimulate steaming. The highest setting is not quite hot enough for cotton, definitely not hot enough for linen. Others mentioned the small water window - yes, that is annoying, and that it isn't a good iron for sewing - also true. Takes forever to reheat after self turn-off. I'm making masks these days and this iron was inadequate in several ways, so today I bought something else. Will take this to the give-and-take shed at the county dumpsters when that reopens.",

I would recommend using only distilled water for steam even though it says tap water is okay. The weight is hefty and it feels nice and solid. Happy I purchased this!",

As my mom is elderly I was looking for something simple that she could use without having to resort to a large book of instructions, or a lot of confusing settings. In short this was exactly what I was looking for a classic electric steam iron. It works and works well. This i a three pound iron and the heat is quick and the steam is produced in large amounts. Easy to use and the weight makes pressing a once over affair. In short if you need an iron and there are always times when you will, this product will fit the bill.",

I also find that it doesn't give me a perfect wrinkle free iron unless I'm using one of the higher settings. I also put LESS water than the max capacity line, but water still manages to come out every few minutes and leak onto my clothes as I'm ironing. Although it can be annoying to use, if done right it will get the job done but I was hoping for a lot better as it looks like it is meant to do more",

The edges around the holes are so sharp that if you ran your fingers around the edge of the holes you'd receive a bad cut. They grab the edges of fabric and crinkle them rather than sliding across like an iron should. The iron is nice and heavy, heats well and has easy to access controls - but the sharpness of the holes makes it useless - not to mention dangerous to what you are ironing.",
