My wife who is 5'2\" rides it as well as myself at 5'7\" with no issues. It has a quick adjusting handle bars and seat. I've taken it on the road and it works well for medium distance but I mainly use it for running my pooch and zipping around camp sights as we RV full time. Looks stylish as well and the seat is very comfortable.",

Well worth the price. It folds up easily and can fit in my trunk. I use it mainly for camping. I wouldn't want to ride it for very long distances, but it works well for trips around the campground. I love the included rack and use it frequently. It was easy to put together..",

But a serious problem is that the derailleur was not set correctly at the factory. Because of this, the chain went past 1st gear an into the spokes, because the plastic spoke guard is not up agains the 1st gear, like it should be, to prevent that. However, that's not usually a hard problem to fix except that these gears are not solid plates of steel. Rather, they are spoked, which lets the chain get stuck in its gaps. I had to remove the derailleur to free the chain.",

Being able to fold it up and fit it into the trunk of my car is fantastic and is just as easy as I hoped it would be.",
