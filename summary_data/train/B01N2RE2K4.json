My faith in Inov-8 shoes ( this is my third pair) has wavered somewhat. i know it's my wonky foot is the cause, but my previous running shoes have not had this issue.",

    "description": "Inov8 Road Claw 275 V2 Running Shoes These road running shoes deliver a fast, natural and smooth run with high levels of comfort, protection and grip. The updated Roadclaw 275 V2 is lighter and more responsive, specifically designed with increased levels of cushioning and durability for longer training runs and races. Standard Fit Inov8's standard fit offers a close-fitting heel that locks the shoe in position, while a wider toe box allows the toes to splay when running naturally or lifting weights. Standard fit suits those with wider feet and athletes using the product for long sessions. Lightweight, Breathable Mesh Upper The Inov8 Roadclaw 275 V2 is constructed for improved responsiveness and flexibility for maximum comfort. The synthetic mesh that covers the upper offers lightweight and breathable coverage, allowing air to fully permeate the entire footbed, creating a more enjoyable experience for you as a runner and keeps your feet cool and comfortable when the temperatures rise. The Roadclaw utilises the met-cradle design which secures the midfoot hold that allows you to move naturally. It provides you with greater stability and control throughout. Additionally, an external heel counter wraps around the rear of the shoe and provides support in the heel delivering this extra hold that aids foot stability. The effect that this has, helps a fatigued runner maintain a better gait cycle. Powerflow Midsole Run effortlessly on the roads with the unique Powerflow midsole technology. Powerflow delivers 10% better shock absorption and 15% better energy return than standard midsoles. The reliable underfoot absorption provides greater comfort over miles by reducing forces pressed upon the underfoot platform for a clean strike through transition. The patented Dynamic Fascia Band (DFB) mimics the 'Windlass Effect' delivering a kick of energy with each step, helping you to move faster and more efficiently. The Inov-8's patented dynamic fascia band technology repl",
