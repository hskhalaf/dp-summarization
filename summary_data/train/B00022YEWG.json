It looks great, handles really well (both in my big hands and my wife's smaller ones) and cuts precisely. The serrations are very small, but it goes through things like tomatoes with ease. However thin you want to slice it, this will do the job. It won't replace a good chef's knife for the big jobs or a small paring knife for the little things, but it's a treat to have in the kitchen.",

The sharpness has to be experienced to be believed, as it goes beyond any other knife I have used, including supposedly high quality Henckels knife (made in Germany). I believe that a significant reason is the softer steel layer in the centre which provides the cutting edge. You need to dry the blade relatively promptly after use, but really this just means don't leave it lying around wet. The design is also very attractive, it feels good to use, and I love the damascus patterns on the blade.",

    "title": "Shun Classic 6\u201d Serrated Utility Knife with Ebony PakkaWood Handle and VG-MAX Blade Steel; Single-Bevel Blade with Serrations to Tackle Tougher Foods; Multi-Purpose Kitchen Knife Handcrafted in Japan",
    "description": "Tomato skins and avocado peels can provide a difficult cutting challenge but are no match for the serrated edge and sturdy blade of the Shun Classic 6-inch Utility Knife. In between a paring and chef\u2019s knife in size, the 6-inch Utility Knife has a narrower and straighter serrated blade, enabling it to easily slice through tougher exteriors without tearing the soft interiors of foods like avocados, tomatoes, and fruits like kiwi. It also works well on foods with a tougher casing like some sausages and hard cheeses. Shun knives are made by highly skilled artisans through a more than 100-step process, providing exceptional quality. The cutting core of the blade is made from VG-MAX steel, a proprietary formula of carbon, cobalt, tungsten and chromium for increased durability, corrosion resistance, and sharpness. The core is supported by 34 micro-layers of stainless steel on each side of the blade, which creates the beautiful rippling pattern on the blade and adds stain resistance.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nMade from VG-10 stainless steel, Shun knives are specially constructed to be harder, less brittle, but also more flexible than traditional steel formulations. The VG-10 core is clad with 16 full layers of SUS410 high-carbon stainless steel on each side, for a total of 33 layers. These layers not only protect the VG-10, they create an exquisitely-detailed surface reminiscent of Damascus or pattern-forged steel, the kind once used for Samurai swords. As a result, the knives are simply stunning to look at--much like antique Damascus knives but without their tendency to rust. As an additional benefit, the slight patterning helps slice rather than crush delicate foods and keeps cut food from sticking to the blade. \n\n The 6-inch blade of this Shun utility knife features a serrated edge, which makes it ideal for slicing through ripe, summer tomatoes. Like many Asian-style knives, the knife's handle is especially suited to smaller users. In contrast to the traditional round profile, however, Shun's are D-shaped to prevent the knife from twisting in the hand, providing extra stability and a firm grip. The handle is made from ebony-colored PakkaWood, a fused blend of hardwood veneers imbued with waterproof resin that combines the warmth and traditional look and feel of wood with the strength and durability of plastic. The offset stainless-steel bolster is designed for ergonomic comfort and maximum safety, while a stainless-steel end cap provides the finishing touch. As sturdy as it is lovely, the utility knife is officially safe to put in the dishwasher--although it's so good-looking you might find yourself hard-pressed to do so. Shun knives carry a limited lifetime warranty. --Mary Park",
