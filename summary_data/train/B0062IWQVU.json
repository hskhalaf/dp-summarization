It comes with 3 plastic guards, but if you want a close shave you can use it without a guard. The blades are close together so it won't pull the pubes or nick your nuts. After your haircut your ball sac will be happy and silky smooth. Ready for action. My nuts haven't been this hair free since I was 13!",

Wanted to look a cheaper alternative (the cruzer now costs around $80) but this is not the one. Anyways returning it for a refund.",

The little blades bite constantly on soft skin even if you pull the skin tight first. The good news is that this shaver does a great job on the less sensitive areas as long as you take your time and give it time to clip the hairs. I almost returned it when it drew blood but was impressed with how well it trimmed the less sensitive areas. The razor attachment is a waste of time and an unnecessary additional expense. Better to use the #1 shield on this shaver and buy your favorite razor for the detailed work.",

It packs into space a bit bigger than a typical razor, but saves the bulk of packing the razor and another trimmer. Added bonus is it operates on batteries, so no matter where I am in the world, I will be able to use it without worrying about chargers.",

In 3 months it started malfunctioning, only turning on sometimes even after battery replacement. A month later it is now officially dead. There were also times the blade would nick my skin and cut it while shaving, even despite being careful by using guards. Overall a disappointing experience and would not recommend trying.",
