My only complaint (and it's a BIG one - hence the three star rating) is that you can't move apps to the SD card, so you have to be aware of how much space your apps are using. Otherwise, everything works great. I immediately updated all of the software and had more than enough room to add the apps to make my phone look/work the way I want, with a couple of gigs to spare.

      "text": "Fantastic shipping and great fast phone. Great sale too! Update 12/20, this phone is a POS. I am used to cheap smart phones and this one is by far the worst. To give a couple of examples: the keyboard takes sometimes 10 seconds to come up, the phone shuts off if you do things too quickly, you can't download apps because it just doesn't run them.",

So the first problem is you can not use it as a phone. I tried using it with my wi-fi and the browser stinks, jumping all over the place on nearly every web site. I can't think of anything its good for. Stay away . . . you've been warned!!",

In no way, shape or form is this phone intended to rival an IPhone 6 or a Samsung Galaxy 6 but in terms of a budget smartphone; the ZTE Speed fits the bill.",
