Also my feet don\u2019t sweat in them. And they cost about half what my old brand does.

Moisture wicking is working really well. My feet sweats a lot; this sock doesnt stink even after a 10 mile run. Since I recently got it, I have washed it only few times. There are some socks which look worn out after few washes. This isnt one. Definitely will buy more. I recommend this.",

A major problem with short running socks is that they fall below the heel lip of the shoe and leave your ankle susceptible to chafing and blistering.

The socks themselves are much heavier than I'm used to in a running sock, but on a 5 mile run in high humidity, my feet didn't feel any hotter and were perhaps slightly more comfortable that usual.",
