The part for the bar shipped promptly, arrived on time, and was exactly what I ordered per the specifications online. The Kip Bar was easy to assemble; we had no issues with set up. The bar feels study and safe. Even my husband and I tried it out a time or two. :) I also purchased the mat per Tumbl Trak's Customer Service recommendation and it fit perfectly. We love the Jr. Kip Bar!",

It is super easy to make higher or lower. Right now it is in my unused living room which is now the gymnastic room. I got the extra stabilizer bars and it is worth the extra $75. It does keep it from lifting. I did not put the plywood yet bc she is very light. All I have a mat. So far so good. She uses it everyday. Great product and brand.",

      "SUPERIOR DESIGN - The Tumbl Trak Junior Kip Bar\u2019s design makes it both safe and effective for your young athlete. Rounded corners, flat steel bait ensure that your athlete will be safe and confident when training.",
      "HIGH QUALITY - Steel construction with a smooth powder coated finish will keep your bar looking like new and functional for years. A 1-1/2in solid wood bar is tough enough to withstand the most rigorous training while providing a gym-like feel.",
      "SIMPLE SET-UP/ADJUSTMENT - Designed to be very easy to move up and down. The bar adjusts from 38in - 56in high with our specially designed spring pin knobs. This bar is also easy to assemble, allowing for it to be set up and taken down as needed.",
      "OPTIONAL EXTENSIONS - Is your athlete growing up and getting bigger and stronger? The optional base extensions increase the bars maximum stability weight from 75lbs all the way up to 125lbs and are super easy to install.",
      "WE KNOW GYMNASTICS - When you purchase a product from Tumbl Trak, you know that you\u2019re getting a TRUE gymnastics product. Coaches, former gymnasts, and industry experts make up the our staff ensuring you get the best product for your athlete.",
      "Weight limit of 125 lbs. is a \"working\" load which is how your athlete will use it (swinging, circling, hanging, kipping). Be wary of competitors who list a high weight limit that is indicative of static load (hanging only) and not working load."
