Some people said it\u2019s too small but I found that my larger cat loves to play in it just because of that\u2014 he likes to crouch and lie on his back paws up in the tunnel. The plastic fabric is sturdy as well. The cats have been clawing at the walls when they play and there hasn\u2019t been a tear. Peek a boo hole adds another fun element they use often and makes for some fun moments.",
