I used these once for a BBQ on a clear day, during the following days I left them out, but there was no rain just misty in the mornings. There was rain expected the coming weekend, so I took them out and placed them in the garage figured would not use them for a while anyway. The next time I stopped in the garage I noticed small black spots were building up on them, which within a month turned into large mold growth. Do yourself a favor and do not purchase these torches.",

Update...i put a thin collar of aluminum foil underneath the lid in between the top part in the bamboo part to provide fire protection against the wind blowing the flame over the side and it seems to work well and doesn't look totally stupid. I'm okay with the modification and if you are then I would go ahead and buy them and just put a little bit of aluminum foil around the top to protect them all over",

I don't care how the stuff pours if I don't have anything to pour in it. I had to purchase the oil separately. Usually in the Q/A, you can find information about whether or not it requires an additional item purchase to actually use the product. Very bummed.",

In fact, two of the four are a bit shorter. The last ones I purchased locally cost about the same but were several inches taller, and the pole itself was far thicker. They come complete with snuff caps and decent wicks, and the cans seem well made. Since these are holding a burning flame I think I will opt for spending a little more and getting something a bit thicker and taller.",
