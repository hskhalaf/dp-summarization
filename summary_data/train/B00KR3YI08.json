      "verdict": "Vibram took a gamble by discontinuing their hugely popular Treksport and welcomed the FiveFingers Trek Ascent. Based on the feedback, generally, most runners were even more impressed by the new model because of its comfortable, versatile, and barefoot ride with just enough cushioning and protection for long-distance runs. The shoe is designed for summer days as it is breathable and the traction is insane. It is easily one of the most sought-after shoes in Vibram\u2019s list of toe shoes.",
      "pros": [
        "Most reviewers deeply valued the comfortable feel and fit of the Vibram FiveFingers Trek Ascent",
        "Some runners consider the Trek Ascent is a good value investment",
        "Runners appreciated the not-so-aggressive outsole as it allowed them to easily traverse both flat and rugged terrains",
        "Several runners used the shoe for other activities like hiking, gym sessions, and other off-road adventures",
        "A few expert reviewers noted that this shoe was efficient during long-distance running sessions",
        "A moderate number of users consider the looks as the sleekest and most sophisticated among all Vibram shoes",
        "The fabric dries in no time, based on the comments of a handful of reviewers",
        "The black color allowed a moderate number of runners to wear the shoe without getting strange looks from other people",
        "The traction given by the outsole unit received positive remarks for being efficient",
        "The lightweight and flexible form of this shoe generated great feedback from runners",
        "It\u2019s easy to clean, remarked several consumers",
        "Some runners loved the Vibram Trek Ascent\u2019s breathable upper"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "A number of testers complained that the FiveFingers Trek Ascent had a tendency to stink",
        "A few runners observed that it did not have the same ground feedback as the other truly minimalist shoes",
        "A handful of people experienced some blistering because the cuff apparently rubbed against their skin",
        "Some consumers noted that the upper fabrics and the thin sole unit broke apart after a few uses"
