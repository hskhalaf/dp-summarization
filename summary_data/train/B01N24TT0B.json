However, in comparison with other drug store serums I have used (some with hyaluronic acid and some without) I found that this serum did not make my skin feel soft or hydrated. It almost made my skin feel stripped of the softness it usually has. I will be going back to my previous serum.",

Will possibly retry another time but directly from Peter Roth or even Ulta. When I muster the energy to spend $65 again on a serum.
