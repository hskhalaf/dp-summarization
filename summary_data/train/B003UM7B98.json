I've had many friends and family members ask where I got this jack so they could get one of their own.

So, bar came out, pump went up, no way to bring the pump back down without the leverage from the bar. I had to use a large socket extension to activate the release and lower the car back onto the jack stands. Just be aware and make sure everything is TIGHT.",

The adapter kinda words but doesn't well with the rubber pad. It's nice that it's lighter but there still must be a lot of steel because it isn't as much lighter as I expected.",

Took 8 pumps to raise the car, since this isn't a speed jack it was normal. Had a slight twist when fully raised due to driveway having a slight slope to it but since some parts are steel the jack handled it easily. The jack just plain works and looks very good as a bonus and for the price was a much better deal for me than paying $250 for an all aluminum jack. Good deal.",
