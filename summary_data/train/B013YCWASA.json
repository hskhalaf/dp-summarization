I don\u2019t know if this is a fluke with just the seat I bought or some defect that might recur in other seats, either way it\u2019s absolutely life threatening in the case of a crash. I returned it through amazon but will contact Britax with photos and video because this is absolutely shockingly dangerous. Photo attached.",

One, the leg straps are incredibly tight. Two, it's pretty difficult to unbuckle the crotch buckle to get them out. It's taken some time to figure it out, and it's still difficult.

      "text": "Like most people, I can\u2019t stand installing baby seats in my car. They\u2019re always a hassle and you constantly worry that they aren\u2019t installed correctly. This thing was an absolute breeze to install. Took just a few minutes to go from box to ready to use. My one issue is the location of the button to loosen the straps. I understand you don\u2019t want it accessible to your child, but you have to stick your finger down a tiny hole at your child\u2019s feet. My wife has small hands and finds it hard to reach the button at times.",

Most of us simply don't install our little ones' carseats properly, even though we really try our best. I am one of those people who is always a bit uncertain. This removes all the guesswork and makes it unfussy and seriously easy. This carseat is heavy but so worth it for the ease of installation. On top of that, this is one of the few carseats with side protection and a very high safety rating. This has to be one of my best purchases and it was on sale.",

The actual installation isn\u2019t bad, however, it\u2019s bulky so we prefer not to move from vehicle to vehicle (takes about 5-10min). The material is a little different so I\u2019m going to keep an eye on breatheability on long trips but so far my kiddo loves it for around town.",

She absolutely could not take a nap in it and it's hell to install and uninstall. Getting the seat to reach different incline and recline positions is also hell. I still love Britax brand but unfortunately would have to give this car seat only two stars because of how inconvenient it is and how uncomfortable the baby is if he or she happens to want to take a nap in the car seat while you are on the road.",

The Britax is easy and more intuitive to install and operate. There is also a little more space and the britax seems more comfortable for my daughter. She'll fall asleep in the Britax, not so much in the Nuna. I would definitely buy the Britax again.",

We bought another for my car, and it too has an issue. I'm still in the process of trying to resolve this with them. This would be a great product if it worked consistently. Unfortunately, from our experience it doesn't work more often than it does.",

    "description": "Color:Circa| Style:2 Layer Impact ProtectionThe boulevard click tight convertible car seat has the patented click tight installation system, an extra layer of side impact protection, click & safe snug harness indicator, and safe cell impact protection for peace of mind while you are on the go with your child. Car seat installation is easy as buckling a seat-belt thanks to the click tight installation system. In the boulevard car seat, you are surrounded in safety. This convertible car seat features the patented Britax safe cell impact protection system, which includes a steel frame, energy-absorbing base, v shaped tether to minimize seat rotation and staged release stitches that slow and reduce forward movement in the event of a crash. Britax designed the boulevard click tight car seat with 2 strong layers of side energy absorption; a deep foam lined shell and head protection will shield your child from side impacts. Plush foam padding and fabric, along with 7 recline positions ensures premium comfort for your child. The 14 position easy adjust harness grows along with your child and you can change the height of the seat with just the push of a button no re-threading necessary. Have peace of mind knowing your child's harness is within range of proper tightness. With the sound of a click thanks to the click & safe snug harness indicator, you will know it is correctly adjusted. The boulevard car seat can be used rear facing 5 40 pounds and forward facing 20 65 pounds, child standing height 49 inches or less. Car seat dimensions 23 x 18.5 x 23.5 inches (LxWxH). 14 position harness slot heights 8.35 inches to 19.4 inches. FAA approved. Seat area depth / width: 10.5 / 11.5 inches. Recommendation: the American academy of pediatrics recommends that all infants and toddlers should ride in a rear facing car seat until they are 2 years of age or until they reach the highest weight or height allowed by their car seat manufacturer.
