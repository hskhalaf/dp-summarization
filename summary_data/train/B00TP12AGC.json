I almost want to keep it for myself, but I couldn't do that to my German shepherd because he completely loves this blanket. My only con is when I first received the blanket, it had a horrible foul smell to it that made me actually want to puke (sorry if it's tmi). I immediately threw it into the wash before giving it to my dog, since that smell would've been unbearable. Overall, it's a great blanket and is super cute!",

Just remember dry on low, and do not use fabric softener, which I am learning as a dog mom is pretty standard with most dog products that are washable. I bought a navy and a grey for my pup, and a pink for my friends dog. All are holding up great to daily use!",
