      "title": "Favorite camera going on 3 years",
      "text": "I love the micro four thirds system for the smaller and lighter lenses (and thus more convenient and portable) compared to other systems. And this is by far my favorite camera body of any camera I've used, micro four thirds, film, APS-C or otherwise. It's unfortunate it didn't quite make it out in time to get the updated shutter mechanism, but on most lenses this isn't an issue, and the form factor, controls, and viewfinder are basically perfect. Even today, nearing 3 years after release, I can't identify a camera body I'd choose over this one.",

But once you get to know the body with use and practice, it's a winner.",

The body IS works well with Oly lenses, and the dual IS is extremely good with my testing (using the Panasonic 35-100 f2.8). The tilt EVF really opens up the ergonomics of the camera, especially combined with choosing focus points with the touchscreen. Video quality is top notch, even the 1080p is fantastic! If you are looking into m43's, I think this is the current best camera on offer when you add up all the features.",

Respectable low light still image performance. Good tactile feel - nice weight and balance. Handles well. Beautiful design - retro Rangefinder look - very attractive. Battery life not stellar - recommend getting several spares. Very customizable settings using hard controls and menu. Good enough for most pro work except perhaps high speed action; however the 4K still mode offers 8MP images @ 30fps, which with good lighting can capture impressive action shots.",

Love everything about this camera, the menu/navigation is superior to Nikon and Canon, IQ is stunning, lens selection is top notch. This thing is jam-packed with features. Auto focus is a dream, burst mode and 4K photo are awesome. Wifi works extremely well and always comes in handy. I guess the overall size of the camera could have been a bit smaller, but personally I think it's perfect. Of your considering this camera, I would HIGHLY recommend it.",

Love V Log and slomo on Gh4.Gx 8 does not have these features. Gx 8 optical viewfinder is fantastic. I will really miss that.",
