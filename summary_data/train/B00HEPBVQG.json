This is my first high heeled Timberland. The boot is well made and the design and fit are fine but not jaw droppingly awesome. It's good value for money (paid under $80 plus additional shipping). The front is a little too rounded to be chic but then, it's a brand that's synonymous with outdoors and ruggedness so that's what one gets but with heels. I'll try the wedge heels next.",
