My note would be to cut open all the colors and line them up in the box top to keep them upright - if they spill it goes everywhere. Only one funnel so they had to do it together and take turns holding the funnel and the bottle and working together. Super pretty finished product.",

Unfortunately when I received the package the box was taped like it had been opened before and pink sand was spilling out. With this being said, I had to get another gift for the little girl as I would have been too embarrassed to give this to her as a birthday gift. I will give 2 stars because the other sand was closed and not spilling out and the plastic containers were included.",

I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll have enough sand to finish filling the containers. Overall it\u2019s a cute project but would have liked if we got non ripped bags. 5 stars if the bags weren\u2019t ripped.",
