And the packaging.... overpackage much? yes. yes they do. Shocking considering the name and price of these speakers. I find most of these reviews hard to understand considering my experience",

They blow away others I have from a different brand, that do have a separate subwoofer. My other speakers sound muddy compared to the richness and clarity of these Bose speakers. I never expected to experience so much bass from these little speakers. Understandably, they don't have the same intense bass as a Bose surround system, but then that isn't a fair comparison. These speakers aren't inexpensive, but when you consider the quality and amazing sound, I think the price is reasonable. In this case, you really do get what you pay for.",

Once found, I played with the frequency response and ended up with some very fine sounding speakers that I'm content with. I would certainly recommend these and buy them again. If you want a powerful, major bass sound system, then you need to spend several hundred dollars more. The small Bose are just not going to do it. My only complaint is the point of manufacture. I would've paid more for the same speakers if they were made in the USA or anywhere else but the point of manufacture.",

Coming from Bose, I was expecting a deeper bass than what these offer. These sound just like any other average computer speakers. I analyzed the spectrum response and it seems quite even across the spectrum with a slight emphasis on the lower end between 70Hz and 150Hz, but then it quickly drops off once you go below 70Hz. Moving above 150Hz they slightly drop off until about 300Hz and then remain more stable until about 20,000Hz. I've seen Bose products smaller than these speakers produce a better, deeper bass than these.",

The Quick Start and Troubleshooting instructions clearly state to set the volume on your computer AND on your source application (i.e. iTunes) to 75%. That means set it and forget it at 75% and control all volume thereafter via the volume knob on the Bose speaker. I'd give these a higher rating, but I just received them, haven't lived with them long and the sound drop issue was annoying upon installation. I've not had that issue with other computer speakers.

Easy install with no issues. All told, a really nice sound for a reasonable price. If you are considering an upgrade to the sound quality that your computer delivers, I recommend these Bose speakers.

So, I figured they'd be good on my desk with my PC, but same thing with music. Annoying muddy bass ruined music. Music that should sound awesome with great bass. Not with these.

These on a MacBook, had a moment of concern as the volume was so low, but checked the audio preferences and made some adjustments to the volume and voila.

      "text": "I measured the frequency response of these speakers in my listening environment using Room EQ Wizard and a B&K 4007 mic which was recently calibrated at B&K's Denmark lab. These speakers are surprisingly flat out to 20 kHz, save for a minor dip around 40 Hz which is easily remedied with Equalizer APO on Windows. They are the best $100 I ever spent on speakers and are now my main monitors. Even without equalization, 40 Hz is awfully low so you might not notice the dip.",

The cord between the two speakers is also pretty short, making it a little hard to place them far apart for good sound spread. Still, I wasn't expecting perfection from such an inexpensive set of speakers, and for my Zoom meetings and such, they're just fine.",

These speakers are not intended to take the place of a home theater system as they can cost upwards of $500. However they are a nice compliment to a computer, projector or TV in a smaller space.",
