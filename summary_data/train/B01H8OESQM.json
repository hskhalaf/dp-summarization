She's normally size 6 however decided to order a 6.5 and there a perfect fit. Hi, I'm the wife. Lol ...I would recommend them to anyone but it takes about a week to get use to wearing them plus there the best thing I've worn.. I have bunions but it's not a problem. I'm now looking for a cheaper pair to wear instead of slippers. Love them.",

      "text": "I've taken onboard the manufacturers comments about trying to get used to these shoes but I think I will be sending back. It is very difficult to manipulate the smaller toes into the compartments and I have abandoned them twice now in favour of the usual trainers for the gym. The issue is that they are not really that flexible in the toe compartments and so it's really difficult to work them into the slots. I will give it one more try before returning but at this moment I can't say I'm overwhelmed with them. Update: I tried again as I said but I have to return them, they are just not for me. Perhaps my toes are too fat?",

I am wearing them and intend using these for winter and buying the next size up so will let you know when those come through. By the way I suffer from ingrowing toe nails and these have created less irritation as my toes are kept away from each other. Bit hard the first time you put them on as it feels unnatural to separate the toes but been wearing them a few days at work and on outside walks and they are very comfortable.",
