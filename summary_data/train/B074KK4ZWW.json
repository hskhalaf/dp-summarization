The shoe, however, is still hounded by a couple of misfires, the more concerning of which is the lackluster underfoot protection offered by its questionable sole. To sum up, despite its shortcomings, the Danner Camp Sherman is still a competent companion on the trail what with all its excellence in both function and form.",

Sort of OK for \"casual\" (not long walks on concrete even) but if I wanted casual, I could've bought far less expensive chinese junk than this chinese junk. Too late to return of course once used on a trail. Last Danner scammers I will ever buy. Edit: Not even OK for \"casual.\" Maybe OK for bedroom slippers if they were slip-ons. I will try walking barefoot on the trail for a while and see if there is a difference. Plainly crap shoes from a junk-bond company.",

Seems suitable for edging. On par with some 5.10s I had years ago. Might even say I like the vibram sole over the 5.10 rubber? Gasp. I was trying them for tree climbing (arborist) as an alternative to trail shoes. I don't wear arbor boots. Not enough flex in the sole for limb walking. Pretty decent for adventure though. Personally do not like all the padding around the ankle. Pulls my socks down, and rubs achilles on my left foot. Only complaint, but super annoying.",
