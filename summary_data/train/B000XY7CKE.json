My dog freaked out wearing this because it is pitch black on all sides and he couldn't see through the sides or on top. I like the idea that this is soft and comfortable, however, maybe making it pitch black and limiting the dog's field of vision is not the best idea.",

The cone has a stiff vinyl neckline which makes this collar considerably less than comfy, and there are several strips of oversized Velcro that attaches the cone firmly.

To keep my pup from licking his back wound, I found that a soft scarf wrapped around the neck did a lovely job.

This created a huge problem for our pet who is now on antibiotics to heal the infected skin where it was rubbed. I do not recommend this product for a animal that is needing to heal from a neuter.",

When I finally adjusted it to stay on. I kept it on her 20 seconds at most and took it off to return it. Too heavy, too big, too restrictive.",

He can go up stairs and eat and drink water with no problem. Also sleeps easier and more comfortable. I think I will buy a bigger one for our other dog just in case he ever needs it.

    "title": "The Original Comfy Cone, Soft Pet Recovery Collar with Removable Stays",
    "description": "Size:Large 25 cm| Color:BlackThe Comfy Cone is a soft, cone-shaped e-collar that helps your pets heal and recover from surgeries, procedures, allergy flare-ups and hot spots in comfort. \n\nAll Comfy Cones are made with foam-backed, padded nylon that is easy to clean and is water-resistant and repellent. The tight gauge of the nylon even prevents cats from getting their claws into the material! The Comfy Cone uses Velcro for tight closures, making it easy to get the cone on and off animals quickly. And the cone can be reversed inside and out, as well as front to back to support shoulder and upper back injuries. \n\nThe Comfy Cone comes with three sizing strips that let you adjust the size of the cone for a secure fit. Use the Sizing Chart and Measuring Guide above or on our website to determine the right size for your pet.\n\nAlong with the sizing strips, each cone comes with removable plastic stays that let you determine how structured the cone should be for your pet. Remove the stays for a more flexible cone and keep them in for firmer structure, like when a pet has had eye surgery. Once the stays are removed, the Comfy Cone can even be folded back for added freedom while eating and drinking or when checking wounds and irritations. All Comfy Conehave a reflective edge for safety and elastic loops at the neck to thread your pet\u2019s collar through. \n\nIt\u2019s perfect to use during recovery as well as during playtime at home or at the park!\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Comfy Cone is an alternative to a plastic cone and as with any medical devices, please supervise your pet when they are wearing it. It\u2019s best to purchase an authentic, new Comfy Cone for your pet. All Four Paws cannot approve of the condition or function of any Comfy Cone not purchased new and directly through an authorized retailer.
