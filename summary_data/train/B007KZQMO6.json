I needed a dual band router for our B&B so that the guests were on a different band than the business, thus keeping our personal information safe. The wifi speed may be good but the range is terrible. Guests couldn't move out of the middle of the house and couldn't get wifi at all up in their rooms. I had to buy a range extender to be able to use this effectively which just added to the total cost. Before this router I had one that reached every square inch of property (but wasn't dual band).",

Sometimes they work just fine, other they do not. So I had to buy another Router (Asus). Then I switch all of these into Access points. The last firmware upgrade dates from 2013. I am sure there is something wrong with the firmware. WD should provide support for these, even they do not do them anymore.",

Despite updating the software, my Linksys was disconnecting from the internet multiple times a day and failing to reconnect. Since replacing I've only been disconnected once. I wanted a router that would handle the increased load of 2 wireless TV's and my smart phone and this works flawlessly. The only reason I withheld from rating it 5 stars is the wireless printer/shared storage (2 USB ports) don't connect as easily as advertised. Even using the Dashboard app, it requires a bit more time and instruction to configure. So other than that, it works well and easily handles video streaming to several devices simultaneously.",

      "text": "This is the worst router I've ever had. It drops connection almost every day and has to be re-booted. I've followed advice found in in a Google search of my problems, such as turning off QoS, doing this, doing that, etc but the router still \"freezes\". I've also done a reset multiple times to no avail. I've seen several others online that have similar problems but there is no newer firmware since April 2013 to address the problems with it. I've only had it for a few months and can no longer return it but I've already ordered my replacement. Buyer beware.",
