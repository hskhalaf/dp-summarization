      "text": "Was wondering what all the hype was all about with this-read reviews and even did my own research, everyone that knows me knows I can't live with out hand cream, especially in the winter time hands get so dry, cracked, and thirsty. Received in a couple days and was totally blown away, all natural ingredients and non greasy unlike most other lotions I've tried. Absorbs quickly into the skin, cream is very thick but rub it to activate the shea butter and its very effective. Would definitely buy again!! And may try other products from L'Occitane",

Its soothing; softening; and non burning. It's quite pricey compaired to other creams like Neutrogena; or Aveeno; but both these work okay only the softening doesn't last as long as L'Occitane. The tube is twice the size and smells like baby makes your hands feel soft as a baby's bottom. I love this cream was given as a present; best present I got. The tube goes along way almost the whole year through. Don't buy the scented ones;there greasy and smell strong and sting.",

It just has a clean smell somewhat nutty, but not overpowering, The tube is giant size and packed solid. My skin feels very soft when I use it. I shake hands a lot at work and it is nice to get compliments on my skin, (I am 62 by the way, so I will take all compliments!) The one thing I wish they would consider is changing the little cap. It is a bit tricky at times simply because it is so small.",
