They're incredibly comfortable so I wore them regularly until they were down to the nubs. My second pair which I purchased on Amazon fit much tighter (as if they were the wrong size), and the materials (toe/top of the shoe) started falling apart very quickly. If I had done the review on the first shoe only then I would give these a 5-star rating. I just purchased the THIRD pair so we'll see how they are when they arrive. This will be the determining factor.",
