I spent quite a bit more than I normally would because I was relying on the reputation of Black Diamond as being a superior brand. Boy, was I wrong! The \"rechargeable\" batteries won't hold a charge and the lamp itself isn't even that bright. I emailed Black Diamond 2 weeks ago and still haven't heard back. Oh well ... live and learn.",

Again, white light would not function, only red. Waste of money.....grrrr!!!!!",

I went to charge it for a camping trip this weekend and the charging light is flashing red indicating a bad battery or an issue with the batteries... Tried swapping the placement of the batteries and still getting the red light. Unfortunately I am not pleased with the Headlamp having to replaced the rechargeable batteries this early in the game. I will use normal AAA's this weekend but I'll have to source rechargeable batteries to replace the bad ones in here.",

Maybe I received a bad unit, but sadly I had to return this product. I still absolutely adore my current headlamp which is a Blackdiamond spot.",

So, removed batteries, even tried standard AAA batteries, still doesnt work. Noted loose center battery and found the center battery does not make electrical contact but moves freely between contacts at each end. No spring tension. I bent (-) spring out and light worked briefly, then too loose again. Spring contact metal is soft and will not retain proper shape. Only way to use light is to place small wad of aluminum foil against (-) contact to shim battery against the contact. Too late to return to Amazon. Will not buy again.",

It worked great and was awesome to be able to recharge for about three months, then the batteries quit holding a charge for more than a few days, and then it wouldn't charge anymore. I put other batteries in it and it just quit working. Very disappointed. I gave it two stars instead of one because it has so much potential.",
