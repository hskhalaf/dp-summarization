Contacted customer support, they found the glitch in one day, posted an update within two days and the problem was fixed. So nice to see a company care about their product with such enthusiasm!!!",

At $80 a pop, that's $160! So, these were 1/4 the price. My other main concern was Compatibility with my other smart devices. 10/10 again for Compatibility.

Additionally, they seemed to have a very strong adhesive that worked extremely well after having cleaned the back of my tv thoroughly with alcohol.

Problem 2: First night the 1 strip worked fine and connected to my Google Home. Second night half the strip was a different brightness than the other half of the same strip. The one half was the correct white while the other half was a greenish white. I noticed them some lights were red and not lighting correctly. So now Im tearing down and sending back. No response from Govee and cheap lights. You get what you pay for.",

For the most part, that's not an issue. It was just something we discovered. I didn't have any trouble configuring the app to work with Google Home on my phone, but another family member did have some trouble on theirs.

      "text": "SO maybe i was super unlucky but one set out of 4 worked. The one set super bright, the remaining 3 sets are so dimmed it's so disappointing to my daughter who had received these as a Christmas gift. I had to pay for 4 sets to cover the lining of her room. My other complaint is that they don't come with connectors and you have to buy them desperately. For the price of the product of these Led lights should include them in packaging and they don't! So I spent all that money and time putting them up for only ONE set to work properly and out more money to purchase connectors.",

The lights have made life much more lively in the bedroom. Speaking of which, last week our toddler discovered the sound reactive mode where the lights change color in response to sound and she now hosts Baby Shark raves in our room at least 3 times a day.
