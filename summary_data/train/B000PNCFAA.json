At first glance it appeared different from most grasses I'm used to. But the smell! It smelled so good I knew I had to try it, or at least lay on it for a while. One bite and I was hooked! This food is remarkable after it's been soaked in warm water (just like me) and when you've had your fill you can lay on top of it. Would highly recommend to any tortoise!",

Had experience using mazuri with reptiles before but preferred ZooMeds \"natural tortoise food\" due to ingredients and being slightly cheaper. At first she had no interest (I believe due to the color) and I had to mix in small chopped up pieces of strawberries the first couple times it was offered. She eats it without doctoring it now and finishes the plate.",
