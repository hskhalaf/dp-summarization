Easy to get everything started and put together, directions and on line chat support made the whole process from opening the box to listening to music less the 30 minutes. Pretty good size and ease of use is good even. For my husband's big bulky hands. We will have to purchase more accesories like perhaps a plug for a wall or docking speaker as only a car charger is included. Very happy with purchase.",
