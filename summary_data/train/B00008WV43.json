      "text": "This ladle was recommended by Cook's Illustrated, and they were correct in their review. The ladle has a nice heft to it, the bowl has a lip on the edge which allows for easy pouring from any angle. The handle is angled which makes it easy to dip down into the pot, and there is a hook on the end which prevents the ladle from sliding down into large pots. There has been no rust after washing the ladle. The bowl is 4.25\" across, 1.75\" deep, and hold one cup. This is a perfect size when ladleing out soup or other foot items.",

I have struggled with a straight up and down handled ladle for years, and when dishing out the grub, it always put a cramp in my hand and made it impossible to get out of tall pots or scrape the bottom bits out. This ladle is perfection! Easy to hold, use and clean. The only thing I can say may be a down side is that the hook, which is awesome for keeping it from falling in the pot, can be a pain for storing it in a utensil jar, as I do because it hooks onto other items at times. Not a deal breaker though!",

My old ladles begone...this is not gonna flex to the thickest of stews, and will get to the bottom of a pot with ease to get that last serving.

      "text": "Fantastic ladle that is twice as large as my old one. Sturdy and easy to hold. Also pours very well without dripping. Looks like it's made from pretty solid steel. Saw some reviews that this used to be made in China, so just wanted to point out that the one I received is now manufactured in Vietnam.",

      "text": "I bought the smaller size of this ladle, the one recommended by America\u2019s Test Kitchen, and loved it and when this went on sale, I decided to try the larger one. I wasn\u2019t sure whether I would find it useful, but I am really enjoying it. I make yogurt and use it to transfer the full gallon batch from the pot to the strainer in just a few scoops. In fact, I often use it for leftover soup too though I generally serve the soup with the smaller ladle. Each time I use it, I feel good. It\u2019s a beautiful tool to use in the kitchen and lovely on the table as well.",

      "text": "I had this ladle on my wish list for a good six months before I finally pulled the trigger. My wallet hurt for a few days, but with the quality and design of this ladle, the pain of acquisition has been long forgotten. It makes a great tool for serving my soups, stews, and world-famous chili, and I don't have to be embarrassed when someone grabs the ladle to serve themselves. It is well-balanced and classy-looking. With its designed-in pouring lip, it would also make a great no-drip punchbowl ladle. Ante up! You won't be sorry.",

      "text": "Love this ladle, the angle of the handle makes filling dishes so much more comfortable. I had a commercial straight handled ladle that had me feeling like a contortionist when I used it. With this ladle it\u2019s just dip and pour with the flip of a hand, which helps reduce fatigue if your filling a lot of bowls. Not as important, it looks nice in addition to functioning well.",

I recently pitched my silicone ladle because it was developing a gummy feel. This one is pricey, yes, but having that hook on the end and being a good stainless makes it worth it.",
