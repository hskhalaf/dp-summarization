It is not required, but I always make backup copies of everything. Once you get used to the 24 hour time format it's a breeze to use.",

You can edit the beginning and end of recorded videos very easily within the unit, which comes in handy for those programmed recordings which don't start or end at exactly the time you set it for. Using an NTFS drive, you can record lengthy videos greater than 2GB in size. You can set the recording quality, which will of course, affect the size of the video file. Speaking of which, the video quality is superb - super sharp with excellent colors. I have no complaints about the unit as it works beautifully.",

I tried 8G & 64G USB sticks, a 1TB hard drive, and a 2TB SSD. All were brand new drives and freshly formatted with the required NTFS partition. The EzRecorder finally recognized one of the USB drives but refused to install the latest firmware from the drive. This has the potential to be a very nice product, but for now it's so half-baked that it's totally useless. I'm returning it as defective.",
