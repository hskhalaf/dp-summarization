I followed the instructions included and left it in the refrigerator to brew for 14 hours. I took the filter out and poured myself a cup. The coffee was smooth, cold, and refreshing! Super impressed with the results and look forward to using it all the time. Product itself seems durable and don't forsee any problems coming up!",

One piece of advice: make sure you set your burr or coffee grind to the appropriate size, I neglected this fact on my first brew so I had to filter my coffee the next day but no big deal! 100% recommended!!!",

I know this because I accidentally dropped it when cleaning and absolutely nothing happened. Don't try that, though haha :) In the end, a really solid piece for coffee lovers",

Cold-brewed tea definitely is smoother, and having two 32-ounce units allows a choice of different flavors - or even one coffee and one tea - on hand for serving cold or re-heating on a cold day (although we haven't made coffee in it yet). This is our second of these units and has an improved lid/infuser gasket system, with dual gaskets that don't need to be removed when you pull the infuser. Very nice.",
