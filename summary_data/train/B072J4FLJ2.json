Coming in with vibrant color variations, the Under Armour Horizon KTV was designed to allow runners to run faster and safer on various terrains.

Not too bad, but wouldn't buy again for this reason alone. Otherwise I like how they look, but not enough to continue wearing!",

If you cut from side to side the uppers don't give and the top of my foot has bruising, which is pretty painful. I thought that I could get away with wearing these around the house but I can't even do that because it hurts too much. I highly don't recommend these shoes!",
