Now trying to convince him it is a great place to be - still working on it ( he is only 12 weeks old). I have a red brick house and this looks very nice as an addition. Love it!",

I'm planning to insulate it better and make it more water tight by adding another coat of outdoor paint and sealant. When the weather turns, they'll be super snug. It was very easy to put together, but very much a pain to unpack, and the boxes arrived pretty damaged. But Twitcat 1 and Twitcat 2 are pretty happy in there.",

So decided to leave one....so I loved the style and look of this dog house (the reason I spent the extra money on it) but wished I'd bought a plastic dog house instead. The dog house was easy to assemble but didn't last but about 6 months. Supposedly it's made to withstand the weather, not the case in my opinion. It ended up getting a giant hole in the roof of the house. Oh and the dog that was using this house was a older dog with a very calm disposition. Wished I'd saved my money and bought a plastic house.",
