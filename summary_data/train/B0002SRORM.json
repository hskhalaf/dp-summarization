Where my IR edge series grinder would bog down, this little CP just powers thru. The small size is great for automotive use. It is a little bit noisier than my IR but still very tolerable.

I expect and require anything I take to the shop to earn its keep, it's going to get used. If your doing hours of handwork with any of these air tools the smoothness of the thing when running determines how much hand fatigue you will get. These by this manufacturer for the money are the smoothest ones I have found.",

With my use and a little maintenance occasionally I expect this tool to preform with no issues. I like the size and overall feel of the tool compared to my older tool this tool has much less vibration.
