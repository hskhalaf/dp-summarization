      "title": "Great Monitor",
      "text": "This is an extremely nice QuadHD monitor. My only complaint is that Amazon does not list the fact that the monitor is pre-packaged with every cable you can conceivably require. I ended up buying cables I don't need. Also, the 2560x1440 was only available to me through the HDMI cable and not the DVI-D cable. This may be a function of the video card purchased to drive the monitor, but I don't really care at this point as it looks great.",

      "text": "I am loving my new BenQ BL2710PT monitor. Tons of OSD settings- the controls take some getting used to, but are quite innovative. Gorgeous picture with my rMBP 15\". LOTS of cables came included, EXCEPT the 2 that I needed: miniDisplayport to DisplayPort, and a power cable long enough to reach the floor at a stand-up desk. (both were minor issues) I researched thoroughly, and almost purchased the Dell 27\", and then almost the Asus 27\" monitors. This BenQ is a perfect image, so beautiful at full resolution- 2560x1440 (only with the miniDP adapter). The only small drawback I've noticed: this monitor has a \"normal\" bezel, not minimal like some others. This is worth the extra $$ in my mind.",

      "text": "I replaced a 28\" display that was giving me eyesight problems after long usage. Read about the Low Blue Light capability, tried it, LOVE IT! Using this monitor makes a HUGE difference in eye fatigue. The stand makes it easy to move up/down and tilt back/forth. Rotating is possible, although only in one direction. Some stands for 27\" displays do not have as large footprint, however, so I can't say this is a five-star display. I'd give it 4.5+ if I could.",

I did a fair amount of research before purchasing and glad I ended up with this monitor. My only complaint are the monitor controls, especially for adjusting brightness. It uses sensor buttons which don't always register presses and requires multiple levels of navigation for common operations like adjusting brightness. It does have a sensor for automatically adjusting brightness based on ambient light levels, but it didn't work for me.",

    "description": "THE WORLD'S FIRST CUSTOM-BUILT 27\" 2560X1440 WIDE QUAD HD MONITOR\nFeaturing a 27\", 2560x1440 Wide Quad HD (WQHD) resolution, BenQ's BL2710PT delivers four times the number of pixels compared to an HD resolution ensuring users more crisp images than your traditional 1080p resolution. Tailored for CAD/CAM users, the BL2710PT delivers essential tools for professionals working with SolidWorks, PTC, AutoCAD, Maya, or other CAD/CAM software.\n\nWith a WQHD display, enjoy working with 77% more work space.View larger The Display Pilot Software detects the monitor's physical rotation.View larger BIGGER SCREEN, MORE SPACE MEANS MORE PIXELS, BETTER DETAIL\nWith a WQHD display, enjoy working with 77% more work space. Additionally, a WQHD provides 109 pixels per inch (PPI) allowing images to look more crisp than ever. Designed with CAD/CAM users in mind, the BL2710PT's Display Pilot Software provides a CAD/CAM mode that cares about the details. Whether it is handling a simple or complicated wireframe design, users will be able to better distinguish multiple line contours within their design. You will never miss a line again.\n\nADVANCED HYPER VIEWING ANGLE (AHVA) PANEL WITH DISPLAY PILOT SOFTWARE\nWith the BenQ's advanced AHVA panel and 100% sRGB color gamut, every color is delivered with the finest precision in an ultra-wide 178-degree viewing angle. And the Display Pilot Software detects the monitor's physical rotation and will automatically rotate the image in either a landscape or portrait orientation. With just one click, the software will partition your active windows providing an enhanced desktop work space.\n\nTECHNOLOGY FOR COMFORTABLE VIEWING\nZeroFlicker technology reduces discomfort of long work days by virtually eliminating eye fatigue. Traditional monitor screens flick 200 times per second. Though undetectable to the naked eye, viewing discomfort is experienced with these traditional monitors. The ZeroFlicker technology eliminates flickering at all brightness levels and effectively provides long lasting comfortable viewing. An additional Reading Mode emulates traditional paper brightness, contrast ratio, and sharpness allowing digital documents to easily look like you are reading a book. Plus, the BL2710PT features an Eye Protect Sensor which, based on the ambient light levels detected by the monitor, will automatically adjust its brightness throughout the day. This enhances the display's clarity and your viewing comfort. An optional \"Smart Reminder\" icon appears to remind users to take a break after a specific amount of time.\n\n\nSlim bezel allows for a smoother image to be displayed across multiple monitors.View larger SMART DESIGN CHOICES FOR BETTER WORKSPACES\nThe BL2710PT's slim bezel allows for a smoother image to be displayed across multiple monitors.
