I used 8 water bottles filled with sand for each Canopy Weight, which hopefully will reduce the amount of leaking sand, and wear and tear on the canvas. -Update 09-01-2017- Still no issues, I attend a farmers market every weekend where these are dropped, strapped, kicked, and on occasion drenched in water. As a helpful tip I suggest putting the sand into plastic bottles, One vendor mentioned that their sandbags have been getting a stagnant odor from the rain once they get damp - which in my case, not an issue.",

      "text": "Excellent. I used 2 bags of general purpose sand from Home Depot for the 4 bag set. Each of the bags gas two tubes for sand. I used heavy duty zip lock bags to hold the sand. Basically in each tube there are twp ziplock bags. I used an empty 'Rotelle' can to measure the sand; each ziplock has six slightly rounded cans. I got all of the excess air out of the bags, rolled them into cylinders, and slipped them in the tubes (two ziplocks in each tube). So the nutshell is I used 100# of sand and 16 ziplocks to fill these, and using the ziplocks keeps the sand from leaking and protects the zippers.",

Sometimes it's nice and sunny, sometimes it's rainy and windy ~ no matter the weather, these have held up VERY well. I filled them with sand ~ it doesn't leak! The handle is sturdy and is easy for me to grip and move them. They're super easy to attach, it's like putting little velcro shoes on your tent legs haha I feel at ease knowing my tent won't budge in the wind. ^_^",

They hold a TON of dirt or sand or whatever material you're using and I haven't had any issues weighing down a pop-up since. Make sure you bring some sort of shovel or trowel to help direct the material INTO these, because the opening is kind of small, so without a proper tool, it's hard to get the material in there. A++ product!",

There is several different ways to use these bags as shown. With Travel baseball season here, I will be getting a lot of use out of these bags.",
