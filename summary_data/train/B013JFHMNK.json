I used a standard 5-gallon bucket filled to the top as a measuring device, and my 15-gallon ones will hold right around 14 gallons, and I'm betting another gallon will fit once watered and settled.

They have stopped producing but this is the first year my plants have lasted this long alive.....hopefully will produce again in fall. I used a paper plate holder in the bottom to create a space as if in a hard bucket... They worked well I used mulch I created. Very Happy. No weeds will never grow in ground again.",

For this volume, I would think most plants want more depth for the roots, less width. Picking up a filled bag shifts/cracks the soil and disrupts the plant, as the bag sags in the middle when lifted by the handles.

These grow bags are perfect for any tree seedling or sapling that you want to keep in a grow bag for a year or two. These grow bags are also perfect for seasonal vegetables. We perpetually have about a dozen of these with herbs in them.",

I built several inexpensive \"coasters\" last year and they're great for keeping the 7 gals up an inch or two for draining and circulation. Good luck with that green thumb!",

The best part is the bags are still in fantastic shape. They look like I'll be able to use them for several gardening seasons.",

So far I have found that my vegetable plants really do not get large enough in anything less than the 20 gallon maybe 15 gallon at the least. So if you are trying to plant veggies use the larger ones unless you have some super plant food or an excellent green thumb.",

I'm certain this is due to oxygen reaching the roots and the improved drainage. If you live in an hot summer climate, you'll eventually need to water frequently as the peppers will become root bound in the bag. Even when they reach this stage, I've gotten exceptional yields from such plants. My only complaint is that I wish the bags would hold up a little better over multiple seasons, but at the price this is hardly a deal-breaker.",

Using the handles and each of us with a hand under to move them into the uhaul the pots really proved their sturdiness. Our trees are very happy in these pots greener and full of life.
