Which brings me to my next point, why isn't there a way to buy them in packs without the bridge? The 3 pack is 135 with the bridge, the bulbs are 50 each. So it's cheaper to buy 3 lights WITH a bridge which is (allegedly) worth 60 dollars than it is to just buy 3 lights? And there are no light packs that don't include the bridge? I'd really like a 100-ish dollar pack of 3 that doesn't come with an extra thing I don't need.",

Also have the lights hook up with Siri, which interestingly enough the scenes Siri has are quite different than the scenes Alexa has.
