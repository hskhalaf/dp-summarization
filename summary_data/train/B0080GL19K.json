Although it is Burberry, and smells nice, it is NOT the original scent that I have been wearing the last 7 years. Super bummed. I tried to return it and it was an item that is unable to be returned? I contacted customer support because it is pretty spendy for something I do not want... they refunded me.",

It's the right strength but a light scent. It neither that chemical-ish alcohol smell that I despise with fragrances (yet seems all too common), nor the sneeze-inflicting powder smell of overly-floral frangrances. This is a great daytime scent for going to work or just to feel pretty ;) It's not your grandmother's perfume, so to my fellow young adults, don't fear!

Its a little bit stronger than I usually like, but Brit makes it work.",
