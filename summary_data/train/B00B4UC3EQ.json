This is definitely one of my favorite creature comforts for our home improvements. I had an electrician do the rough in, tapping in to a nearby gfci outlet. Installed this myself, easily. It's perfectly big enough for two normal sized bath towels. Love having a toasty warm and dry towel to wake up to every morning. A must have add on is a programmable timer switch. I bought the Honeywell wall timer that Amazon recommended. Buy them both, you won't regret it. I promise.",

And you need to do this before the device heats up otherwise you will burn yourself. This product gets HOT. Also, no automatic shutoff.",

Installation is easy, if you are reasonable handy with drywall expansion screws, precision wall markings, and electricity. I did upgrade the drywall expansion screws to a larger size (Strongly recommended with children). We have been using the towel warmer for two months now and all is good. Happy Days!!! Next upgrade is cabinet plate warmer... Still looking.",

Also the on-off switch is inconveniently located at the very bottom of one of the side bars and you have to bend down and feel around to turn it off and on - not an easy , simple switch at all. You should certainly get a programmable thermostat that can control it.",

Tried 30 min to 90 minutes and I would say the towel is not warm enough to make it worth the cost. During the install the electrician warned me that 150 watts was pretty low and questioned how well it would heat. Should have listened and returned the unit right then. Very bummed!",

Overall construction seems solid, nice looking and a good value - that is until it died. Too bad, we really did want to like this one.",

Hoping the replacement works great for years to come, but I'm skeptical now.",
