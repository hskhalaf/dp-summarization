Its outsole is engineered to be stiff to make pedaling virtually effortless on flat roads. It also has rubber bumpers to make walking less awkward. Meanwhile, the top has ventilation features that keep the foot fresh during extended periods of rides. To top it all off, it is comfortable to use and quite stylish.",

      "text": "The BOA system needs to be improved. The lockdown system doesn\u2019t fully tighten the entire upper. It seems to pull only in one area causing discomfort and lack of fit. The lacing setup is a bit weird in how it feeds and the use of fabric lace loops doesn\u2019t allow for ease of sliding for the laces. If the shoe used the BOA plastic lace guides and a better lace orientation these shoes would be great! For reference I wear a size men\u2019s 7->8 shoe (dress->running shoe) and purchased a 40.",
