    "title": "Dremel 692 6-Piece Router Bit Set",
    "description": "AMAZON.COM\nA valuable addition to any woodworker's Dremel rotary tool, the Dremel 692 6-Piece Router Bit Set includes six high-speed router bits made from high-grade steel. Conveniently packaged in a reusable plastic case, these bits are ideal for routing, inlaying, and mortising wood and other soft materials. Ideal for a wide range of light to medium hobby, repair, and renovation jobs, this set ensures that you have the exact bit you need to tackle your next project.\n\n\n\nHigh-Speed, Durable Steel Construction to Tackle a Range of Jobs\nMade of high-speed, durable steel, these bits are the ideal size for rotary tools. The straight bits offer exceptional versatility, and the piloted edge bits help you add a personalized, detailed touch to wood frames, molding, and more.\n\nQuality Construction for Precise Cuts the First Time\nDesigned for use with the 335 Plunge Router and 231 Shaper/Router attachments, these bits feature high-quality construction that allows you to make exceptionally precise cuts the first time, saving you energy and stress. They're also well-suited for detailed work, such as building and sanding dollhouse furniture, model trains, or miniature buildings and planes.User-Friendly Design and Easy Insertion Process for Longer Life\nIncredibly easy to use, these bits work best when inserted all the way into the tool and then backed out slightly before tightening down. This insertion process provides plenty of shank for the collet or chuck to hold the bit in place. For optimum precision and longer life, it's also important to secure objects to a stable surface while working--if chattering occurs, simply increase the speed. It is also important to keep a light touch so the speed of the tool, not the strength of your arm, does the work.\n\nVariety of Bits for a Range of Projects\nThis set comes with a total of six bits, including a 3/32-inch piloted beading bit, 1/4-inch core box bit, and 1/2-inch chamfer bit that all work well for inlaying and mortising wood and other soft materials.\n\nAbout Dremel: A History of Brilliance and Innovation\nFounded in 1932 in Racine, Wisconsin, Dremel is the industry leader in rotary tools. The company owes its success to the inventive genius of its founder and namesake, Albert J. Dremel. In his lifetime, Mr. Dremel owned 55 patents on a wide range of products from electric erasers to a gas-powered rotary lawn mower. His most famous and important invention was a high-speed rotary tool, dubbed the Dremel Moto-Tool. Compact, lightweight, and perfect for a wide range of jobs, the rotary tool was an immediate hit with hobbyists and eventually became accepted as one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century. Today, the Dremel name remains synonymous with utility, durability, and innovation.\n\nWhat's in the Box\nOne 612 piloted beading router bit, one 615 corner rounding router bit, one 650 1/8-inch straight router bit, one 654 1/4-inch straight router bit, one 617 core box router bit, and one 618 chamfer router bit\n\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nSix piece router bit set, includes: (#612) routing bit, 3/32-inch piloted beading works well for inlaying, and mortising in wood and other soft materials, constructed of high speed steel.
