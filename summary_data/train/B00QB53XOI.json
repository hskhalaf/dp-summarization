At this point it is unusable...I would not recommend buying this product.",

If it stays the way it is, it will be fine; if it weakens at all, then I would have concerns that the hook may have the opportunity to separate from the dog's collar. I compared it to the leash that was given to me by the rescue when they dropped the pooch off to me. Sure enough the hook was stronger and the spring force greater. But for now is fine, and a good value for the money.",

It's a bit of an unnecessary detail as far as I'm concerned, but it might be appreciated by some and does make the handle feel quite stout. Overall, a very nice dog leash.",

This thing has seen some rough days, lots of pulling, the washer, the inside of her mouth, and her teeth and it is still holding together. Slight fraying on one small part where she tried to chew it. The only part that is coming apart is the padding on the handle. It hasn't torn off completely, but has cracked and split. Not a big issue, I only notice when I tie a poop bag to the handle and try to slide it along the inside of the handle and it catches on a crack. Great value for the price",
