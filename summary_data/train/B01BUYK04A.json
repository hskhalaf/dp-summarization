Its predecessor was a Canon T3i 600D which was pretty good for learning and I transferred much of the knowledge to the 80D so I had a good basic understanding but the 80D goes much further, more facilities and more 'power'. The supplied downloadable manual is very comprehensive but a little sparing on detail so I have made use of You Tube quite a bit. On the whole I am very happy with my purchase and am now in the process of acquiring some better lenses.",

This camera takes some fantastic pictures with minimal effort using the Auto function. I'm now getting used to this camera, and I've started to experiment with manual settings. The key things that stand out for me are:- Interchangeable lens Awesome Video auto function Decent battery life Great screen that's able to flip so if you are looking at the camera head-on you can see if you are in the shot. What I don't like:- Weight if travelling that's it, one very, very good camera perfect for pictures but also excellent for video.",

Noticeably better with the technically improved and more professional capability of the 80D when using the camera to take shots of subjects in motion in both still and video mode. The improvements to the various functions available are well worth while, and noticeable. The quibble about the lack of 4K doesn't bother me at all - I don't have a 4K television..! Overall, I am very pleased with the camera.",

Was a bit concerned that it would be to heavy, but I don't really mind, I have to admit. I bought a lense for it and don't use the kit lens, so I would recommend to just get a body with a better lens.",

Canon used the most sub-standard sensor (prob 5D rejects) they could in the 6D MkII..., avoid that POS at all costs. Anyway, this is about the 80D and it's a fine camera, not much more than the 70D, but a better processing engine and a few upgrades for those who don't have a 70D. If you have a 70D, this wouldn't be worth the \"upgrade\" to you, just subtle changes, nothing worth the cost of the \"upgrade.\" If you want a do-it-all crop sensor camera, this is it.",
