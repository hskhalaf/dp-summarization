Very annoying, as there was nothing at all wrong with that model. The ADS-3600W is also superb. Fast duplex scanning; virtually no sheet feed errors; on-board features including scan to email / scan to PC / scan to network folder; fast start-up. It's quieter than the 2600 as well, which is a bonus. I highly recommend this machine.",
