      "text": "My husband is in his 50's and requested an electric shaver. I bought this one bc of the cleaning feature. He loves it. He has a very thick course beard that he recently shaved completely off bc of the corona virus. He uses this shaver to shave his tender skin. He says nothing will replace a good ol razor but now he only has to shave with a regular razor once a week. The electric razor does well getting stubble removed and his face feels smooth to me and is less irritated. He hasn't had it long enough to give a review on the battery life.",

All other razors would not shave his sensitive skin, and the fouls kept cutting up his face, and had to be replaced every 2 weeks. Ordered this because of the reviews I read on line, said it was good for older men. He said it is the best and closest shave he has ever had. It is super easy to clean and he can operate it with ease. SO worth the money, wish I would have found this one a year ago! I would highly recommend especially if it is for an older person with thin sensitive skin.",

I had spent a lot of time checking reviews on Amazon & thought that I had made a good purchase. It is so ineffective that it just sits on the cabinet. I hate to throw it away, but will do that eventually. In the meantime, I am returning to the former brand. I had thought that I was upgrading, but this was a huge disappointment.",

When I used the standard razors, I started to form dark marks on my face and neck. Many of the African American males in my circle experienced a similar issue. This is because our skin is too sensitive for regular razors. It cuts the hairs too deep, so the hair grows back ingrown into the skin. REAL TALK: Invest in yourself. Nobody wants to go around with spotted, itchy skin (or see that).",

    "description": "Style Name:790ccThe Braun Series 7 790cc-4 electric foil shavers have the world\u2019s only intelligent Sonic technology that automatically increases power in difficult areas. Powered by a lithium ion battery, the Braun Series 7 790cc electric shaver is the smart choice for the discerning man. Significantly gentler and more efficient than any rotary shaver, the Series 7 electric razor contours to the curves of your face with flexible blades on a fully pivoting head for maximum coverage. This electric shaver also adapts to your beard density, using up to 10,000 micro vibrations per minute when needed. With less strokes and pressure required while shaving, the results are smooth skin without the skin irritation. And as the Series 7 electric razors shave as close as 0.05mm, as thin as half a human hair, that smoothness lasts longer, for a highly efficient and superior shave. The electric shaver also comes with a Clean&Charge station, the world's only 5- action alcohol-based system that hygiencially cleans, charges, and lubricates the blades and shaver. Engineered, tested and made in Germany, you are guaranteed exceptional performance every day, for up to 7 years. The best environmental temperature for charging is between 41 degree Fahrenheit to 95 degree Fahrenheit / 5 degree Celsius to 35 degree Celsius. Do not expose the shaver to temperatures higher than 122 degree Fahrenheit / 50 degree Celsius for extended periods of time.\n\nMANUFACTURER CONTACT INFORMATION\nMonday \u2013 Friday (8AM \u2013 4:30PM) @ (800) BRAUN-11 for more details on usage or refer to the website for usage instructions to help address any existing issues.",
