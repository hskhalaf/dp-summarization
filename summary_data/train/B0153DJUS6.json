Even comes with chalk. It has a cone center for ice. You can put fruit on top and even stack cups. I had no problem with any leaking. i did soak the nozzle in water before using.",

I had a $45 dispenser prior to these, and it broke within the first few uses. You'll spend a fraction of the price on these and they do a better job and hold more fluid as well! Love!",

The flow for the sangria dispenser did slow down when fruit got in the way. Just had to stir it a little and it worked fine again. They were easy to clean up afterward. For storage, the bottom stand and tags can fit inside so it takes up less room. I'll definitely be using these for other special occasions in the future.",

I did add some assorted fruit on and utilized the cup holder on top. We also took a about a foot of 1 and a half inch ribbon and placed in the base for a decorative affect! These were definitely a great buy and I am so glad I purchased them!! I can't wait to use them again. Oh, mine didn't come with chalk for the mini boards.",

A few dents in the tray getting the seedlings out, but otherwise they do well. I like it much better than the \"coffee pod\" method.",

There is a lot of liquid below the spigot so when you are busy with a party and you are keeping tabs on the drinks it doesn't look like it needs a refill when really much of the liquid is below the spigot access. The downside of the cups on top is if people start tipping the canister to get a refill then the cups have to be moved or they may fall over. Overall, great price for a useful and functional item.",

      "text": "I bought this to make a harvest cider punch and it worked so well! I had apples and oranges in there and they didn't get stuck like some have in the past. It's very light weight so it made traveling with it very easy, everything just sits inside of each other. There were no leaks out of it and it had liquid's held in for a very long time. Overall I would definitely recommend this.",

I'm so glad I chose this dispenser.",
