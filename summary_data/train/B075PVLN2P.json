Tracking the controllers uses sensors in the front of the headset, so motion behind your head is not tracked. Annoying in some games - compensate by turning head sideways, so target is in periphery. Display quality is good but not as good as the HTC. I wear glasses and they get pressed against nose bridge and cheeks. If you want to use Cortana, you will need to run a microphone cable to your sound card. In all, a good buy.",

The lack of adjustable lenses is a severe problem. It puts all of its weight directly on your nose, making it somewhat difficult to breathe. Update: I discovered that the problems I'm having are likely caused by the USB controller being overloaded. I'm going to try a PCIe USB card and see how that works It seems VR headsets are notorious for overloading USB systems.

Once I figured that out it was simple. The controller disconnected a few times at the beginning and we had to reinstall them.
