The cable is high quality, and the cord is flexible. I highly recommend UGreen cables, and will use them for any future need.",

      "text": "Failed after 3 1/2 months of use. I was using this to connect my Dell Visor (Windows Mixed Reality headset) to my PC. Yesterday the headset began to randomly lose connection. After troubleshooting drivers and cables, I determined this USB 3.0 extension cord was to blame. This cord never moves, so I'm not sure why it would fail... but it did. UPDATE: I raised this review from 2 to 4 stars for a few reasons. First, I\u2019m not 100% sure the issue was caused by the cable. Second, this company has great customer service. Almost immediately after my previous review they contacted me and sent a new cable free of charge. That\u2019s pretty amazing.",

Not sure if it is the computers USB port or the 6' length of the cable. Even at USB 2.0 speeds it still make a great extension cable.",

Only just got it so no feeling for how durable it is. The orientation is the same as the USB port it plugs into (the USB device will be \"up\" if it was \"up\" in the port).",

Makes for an expensive bundling wrap or something to tie materials together I guess. Or perhaps you may choke yourself with it knowing the money you spend in cabling only for it not to work.",
