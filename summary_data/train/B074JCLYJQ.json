This mud mask is the only mask that does not contain much chemical ingredients and the first ingredient listed is actual mud. I bought another tool to help smear this on my face easier. Cleaning up afterwards is a bit of a hassle but it\u2019s worth it in my opinion. It leaves my skin feeling baby smooth and visibly reduces pimples overnight. The smell isn\u2019t so bad either. I use this product once a week during my PM routine!",

Useable in a tight spot but there are definitely better mud masks out there.",

You have to put on a whole lot and still the product applies sparse and thin. I don\u2019t see any ingredients list on the container. It just feels to me whatever active ingredients are in this thing must be in very small amounts to compensate for the large tub. I just wasn\u2019t wowed and don\u2019t think I\u2019ll repurchase. May slather the rest on my body to see if I see a difference. That\u2019s one of the positives of this product being that you get so much.",
