However there are several points that I wish were understood before purchasing: It uses a ac power cord only for charging - no on-the-go charging with the car charger or USB. Automatic shut off cycles about 10 minutes with no audio, even when plugged in. It cannot be disabled per JBL. So as a computer speaker, it is of little value because you must keep turning it on. There is no auto-on when audio is detected. Otherwise it is a pretty and decent BT entry.",

However, my speakerphone is terrible (i sound like I'm far away in the distance to people listening to me), and the battery life is about 3-4 hours... really dissappointing battery life. I would not purchase again. I've owned a few different mini speaker models, such as the Urge Soundbrick and the Braven 570. The Braven is by far the worst - it's made of cheap plastic and breaks easily. The Urge Soundbrick is my favorite - battery life lasts forever. The sound isn't as great as the JBL Flip though. I guess it comes down to what you value in a little speaker.",

      "text": "The JBL flip was a great portable speaker. I had this speaker for several months and loved taking it to the beach! Until it rained! If you are an avid beach goer, you may want to look for something that can stand up to the elements. Pros: Easily connects to Bluetooth enable devices Great sound, fills a room, crisp sound Surprisingly loud for such a small speaker Cons: The smallest amount of water can ruin the speaker. Sand gets caught in the speaker grill and you cant get it out.",

It's been great because I have been rediscovering a lot of music that I haven't listened to in a while just because my iPhone speakers don't sound so great.",

It had a minor paint-looking mark on it with a tiny dent imperfection...something you might accidentally do on your own sometime in the life of the speaker....got $30 off retail because of it and it's PERFECT. I would definitely buy from the seller again and would recommend this product to anyone willing to pay for it. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! Thank you!!!",

Even doubles as a speakerphone for those times you have to take conference calls in your hotel room. Stay close to the desk though as the microphone is meant for close up. Comes with AC Adapter, but lasts for about 5hrs on battery. There is also an AUX Jack if you want to plug your phone or MP3 player into it.",

The new version of this speaker has microUSB charging and a longer battery life, but I've heard the new design takes away from the sound quality. If sound quality is a must this is the speaker for it =)",

I am not a sound snob, but I think the quality of sound from this speaker is fabulous. It's hard to believe that this little speaker packs enough power to fill my house with music, but it does. Do not look any farther for a speaker in this price range - this one is awesome.",
