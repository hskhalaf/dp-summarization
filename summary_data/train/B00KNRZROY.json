We don't use the hot tank. I like how the drip tray grate is flat, so you can set a glass on it and push the button to fill the glass. The spout extends down enough that larger containers, such as a gallon jug, can be filled, although they won't set on the grate.",

      "text": "I bought this because my old water dispenser bit the dust. It matches my LG washer and dryer perfectly. I don't use the hot or cold feature because the unit is not near an AC outlet; besides, I don't need these features. It only cost a little more than a \"cheapie\" and will probably outlast me (I'm 82).",

Only wish there was a way to change the temperature setting for the hot water. It is plenty hot and if I am making the baby bottle, I have to add some cool or cold water so it's not too hot.",
