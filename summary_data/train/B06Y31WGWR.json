Once cool, close pop-top and stick in the fridge. Husband is rough on things including his lunch box and so far these are holding up so nice!!

Excited that these are just in time for the holidays to send leftovers home with family.

Either way, the rubber seal has to be cleaned separately from the lid and that is annoying. I want all-dishwasher safe cleaning.

These are smaller than I thought they would be but bringing 2 along everywhere gets the job done. I even use them to take food to work, so 5 is perfect. 2 in vehicle, 2 in bike, 1 to work. The seal also keep everything air tight and fresh, and keeps smells from taking over your vehicle as traditional styrofoam or paper takeout containers do",

These are also dishwasher safe which makes them easy to clean. The lids for these containers easily snap in place which makes it leak proof so I can store soups and liquids without having to worry about them spilling in my lunch bag.",

If you know what you're getting into size wise and are ok with waste, I would recommend these. they seem to be of good quality so far.",
