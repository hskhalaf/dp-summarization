Concealers will typically settle into my fine lines (under my eyes), but this sets perfectly with powder. (If you don't get much creasing, you might not need to set it at all!) Incredibly lightweight (you won't notice it on your skin), easy to blend (I use my fingers), not too creamy, and very pigmented. I had previously purchased it on a 'clean beauty' site, but this is much more convenient. Would HIGHLY recommend.",
