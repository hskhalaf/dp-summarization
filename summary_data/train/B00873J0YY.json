Just remember to line up the squared carriage bolt with the square bolt hole, and tap/pound the bolt down \"through\" the rubber carrier, as in the picture.",

First, the hardware uses galvanized nuts and bolts instead of stainless steel. This means with repeated exposure to water, they will rust and potentially rust in place on your rack, making removal a nightmare. Second, the tie-down straps provided are short if you have a wide-body recreational kayak. What would have cost them to make the straps just 6 - 8\" longer?",

ALSO - my friend has a set and said she put a small piece of rubber between metal brackets...I installed without, but I see why she did, makes it a bit more sturdy. Will find a piece and do the same. Mine are cinched down tight so shouldn't move, but have just a bit of \"give\". Would rather be on the safe side. Otherwise great purchase and glad i got them. About to mount my kayak...",

The Jbars can easily support the weight of both kayaks, which weigh 36 lbs each. I also noticed that the J-bars do not rattle when I drive on the highway. I've attached a photo of the whole set up to show what the crossbars and J-bars are capable off.",

This way, you will not need to tighten the washer, bolt, and spinner on both sides of the bottom bracket when installing or removing the J-hook. The straps are terrible and I recommend buying a separate set that is more durable and less likely to release. Also, install a bow and stern line to the kayak so that you will not injure anyone on the road. You may even want to tie your kayak down with multiple straps or an additional rope on each J-hook/ rack crossbar .",
