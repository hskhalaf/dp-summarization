      "text": "Will be returning this item as it stopped working after using once in ocean water. Very disappointing as was not able to use for the snorkeling adventure that was planned the day after. I had checked and rechecked to insure that the slots were properly secured. I soaked it in warm water for 10 minutes or more then wiped it dry. Then I re-charged the battery thinking that perhaps it stopped as the battery ran out(although I doubted it as I used only for a short period of time). Still did not work even if I followed the instructions, so I had to quickly purchase another underwater camera for the outing(a Canon Powershot D20-which worked really well).",

      "text": "I bought this camera as a gift for my husband in December 2012. It took great pictures, he used it on his 17 foot sailboat for filming and picture taking. The photos were great! Then... We took it to the beach in July of this year and it suddenly stopped working. My husband sent it to Sony for repair and lo and behold, they told us the same thing they've told others here. It was our fault moisture got into the camera. My husband apparently \"abused\" it. They offered to sell us a new camera for $200, yeah right.... We paid $149.99 for this one. We told them no thanks. I guess we're out $150 and a waterproof camera.",

NO centered weighted average seems to be available. My Samsung S4 phone takes better video 75% of the time! The only decent part is image stabilization, but that's to be expected. Photos seem to be good quality, if they can focus. Burst mode seems to have trouble focusing. 4x zoom is very low, but this is expected as the camera does not have a protruding lens. Touch screen is a horrible interface.",

It's cousin was my graduation present over 6 years ago and I loved that little camera for as long as it lasted. I chose to purchase this camera for its focusing abilities, the Ziess optics, and its rugged construction. Its predecessor met its end at a photo shoot with a baby in a bath tub, so knowing that it is water-proof up to a certain depth is extremely reassuring. I suggest this camera for anyone from the novice pocket photographer to the photo enthusiast or professional with a limited budget.",

The waterproof aspect is priceless. It has been bombproof so far. My favorite feature is that it turns on quickly by simply sliding down the front cover; boom, it's ready to go. This is important when dealing with nature, as it is unpredictable. Huge fan of this camera. In addition; the HD video quality is second to none. I have posted a bunch of videos, I took with this camera, to Facebook, and people are shocked they are from my \"point and shoot\", and not my higher end Nikon.",

I usually can get around camera relatively easy but not with this one. I leave it on auto and it takes great shots. I have also played around with the continuous shooting. Still have to play around it with more to get the full benefits. I gave it four stars due to the battery life.",

One bit of advice for users of this camera- make sure you get your fingers out of the way of the lens when you're bodysurfing- of course that it easier said than done. But, if you can do that, the camera can capture some really fun images. I gave it four stars because I think it still has room for improved functionality, particularly with respect to the touch screen in the water. But really, how much touch screen sensitivity is it fair to ask for when you're out in the surf?",

Excellent detail and focus all the way to the infinity point. I love the easy to use menus and the HDR setting is the best I seen yet, very accurate to the results I get with Photoshop without all the hassle and mess.

The only concern I have up front is the slide down cover for the lens and flash. It seems vulnerable to catch or clothing straps and small branches while walking through the marshes and woods.",

I did have a problem, however with the color reproduction in the images when i photographed some of my paintings. The colors are not true, but this is to be expected with an inexpensive camera. On the whole it is a lot of fun!",
