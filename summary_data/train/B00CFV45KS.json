Amazing e-ink clarity; complete customization of fonts, font size, line-spacing, margins, etc. The back light is flawless and easily adjustable. My only complaint is that if you order your books into collections (Fiction, Autobiography, etc.) there is no way to order the listing of those collections themselves (although you can order the books within the collection). This is such a fine ereader that I'm tempted to buy another in case they stop making them!",

If you see an offer from Assurant Solutions regarding an extended warranty, it won't apply. Assurant only offers warranties for things that have an applicable manufacturer's warranty. Aside from that, this is a pretty nice device. It's no Nook Simple Touch in terms of hand-friendliness, but it's a reasonable approximation for having a distinct style and no rubberized grip. The larger screen is very nice to use. It's reasonably responsive, and the light is better than Barnes and Noble ereaders, though not quite as good as Kindles.",

You can also store your own books and organize them in collections. The interface is simple and effective while with the 1GHz proc makes the Aura HD the faster ebook reader.",

This Kobo Aura HD is by far the BEST of any of them. The size of the screen, the lighting, the quality of the text, the ease of organization, it is the best of the best. I highly recommend it. It is superior to the Kindle Paperwhite. I hated the Cloud Collections, so returned mine. Also you can't put your own fonts on the Kindle, so that was a deal breaker to me. Kobo is #1!",

Neither of the defective units had had any significant pressure applied at any point during its short life span. I have had numerous ereaders, including an old Kindle DX which has travelled extensively, and have never had such problems with one. Kobo has quality problems and the company is unpleasant to deal with when a problem arises. Not worth the trouble. Buyer beware.",

My Nook had a rubber-like case - it was easy to keep hold of, I could set it on the dashboard or seat and it wouldn't slide around, but the Kobo .. no matter how careful I am, it is so slick the slightest movement sends it sliding across the truck.",
