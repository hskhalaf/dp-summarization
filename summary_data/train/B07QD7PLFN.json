It works every bit as good as the corded shop vac that it's replacing. It also seems to weigh about half as much. Of course this wouldn't mean much of it didn't hold a charge for a reasonable amount of time. It does. I used it for about 20 minutes and when I was done it still had a charge. Also it doesn't lose suction as the battery discharges. It works perfectly until it is fully discharged. Hoover has always been a trusted name for vacuum cleaners and this one is no exception. Most highly recommended!",

It has clever little elastic bands to hold the accessories in place, and stored away, it looks like R2-D2 standing by in the closet ready to lend a hand at vacuuming up water or workshop debris. The filter is easily removed. the pieces go together neatly and It is a great little wet vac for home use.",

The wheels work well and make it very convenient to haul to the spot where you want to work. We vacuumed the car and it was very easy to get into spaces which were small. Great item and one that will work well for the yard and patio, we highly recommended this from a company that has been cleaning up for years!",

A fantastic shop vac, with just as much power as a corded vac, and the battery gives you so much freedom! Love it. Highly recommended.",

The hose it too short, as is the case with most wet/dry vacs, but comes with several useful attachments.

Probably only 30 minutes, long. And it takes a while to charge. It's well built and feels as if it'll last a while. Other than run time, I'm extremely happy with this product!",
