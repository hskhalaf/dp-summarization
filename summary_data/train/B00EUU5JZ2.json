Unfortunately, this item held up for less than six months. I've attached a photo showing how the couch has given out in the center and is now being supported by styrofoam blocks. I thought I could trust a brand name like serta, but all I want is a refund. I can't wait until I have enough money to buy a new couch, and get this one out of my sight.",

The middle leg buckled under. We were very disappointed with the poor quality of this couch.",

The dark Gray color is received is more of taupe, which could be a good thing for neutral tone rooms. It plays well with beige items as well as grays. Loveseat is also much lower than expected.

My only complaint it that because the back support is hollow, it can be a little harder than a solid couch.

Unfortunately we have had it sitting in our garage for two weeks, In its original boxes, and just put it together, so I really have not looked into returning it. It took my husband about two hours to put it together and the box it came in was on a regular UPS truck so there was no way to put it back into that box. I would hate to have to take it apart again.

The pillows constantly fall out and the seating is too low for anyone to feel comfortable on. The only thing I like is that the questions are pretty soft and it cleans pretty easily. At first it looks like a great buy for your money, but in reality I\u2019m going to end up having to buy a real life seat and get rid of this cheap one.",

The back cushions are held in place by velcro, but it's always coming loose and the bottom cushions are constantly slipping toward the front of the couch. We have a new routine: Lift the back cushion, push the bottom cushion back, reset the back cushion. Every. Single. Time. We're now trying to find a new sofa so we can throw this one in the bonfire.",
