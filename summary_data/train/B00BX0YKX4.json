Everything else in my house paired 1st time. Touchpad doesn't work with firestick, worked on everything else. I guess the common denominator is the stick and the lack of recommended items that integrate smoothly. Other than that is seems like a decent kyb. Backlight works great. The batt level and BT LEDs are too bright but if you put a piece of tape over them you'll be able to see the keys. Serious, they're that bright. Why do engineers do that? Good luck.",

Sometimes the connection gets less stable once its turned on but a simple turn it off and on usually fixes it quickly. For navigating windows this is perfect for simple task. Gaming with it will not work, it won't allow for the keys and the track pad to be used at the same time. Otherwise this works for navigation of the os no problem.",

Sometimes the ESC button worked, like 1 out of 10 times. The arrow/directional keys only work sporadically. The device is very lightweight and flimsy. Not useful for typing.

Listen, this is hard to see, use a different color. I will update this if I find any performance issues.",

If you type a sentence on this in a quiet room everyone will be wondering what that noise is or giving you at dirty look. As other reviewers mentioned, the touch pad makes keyboard use a little cumbersome. I used it for 5 minutes and put it away. Can't return it because it was impossible to remove the paper cover from the plastic box without destroying the paper. Maybe I'll find a use at home for it someday.",
