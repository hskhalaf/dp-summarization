The hygienist raved about how nice my teeth are, and said to keep doing whatever I'm doing. I felt that she did considerably less scraping than she normally does -- I am curious now to see if it's even better next time since I am using the product starting with freshly cleaned teeth. I feel confident giving it to my son, who just got braces, because of the natural and food-grade ingredients. I intend to keep using this.",
