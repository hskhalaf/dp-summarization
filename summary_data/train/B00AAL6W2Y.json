Going down the sink. I gave it 2 stars since they got the \"vinegar\" part right.",

I was looking forward to the 'tart, fruity and sweet' taste. It was simply sour. In my opinion the product is totally misrepresented. I consider it to be a complete rip-off. Basically it is an inferior balsamic vinegar with added flavor which isn't enough to mask its poor quality.",
