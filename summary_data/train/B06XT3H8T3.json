It would be nice to have some type of indicator to let you know when the battery is low. Other than that I am pretty happy with this purchase.",

The quality of the sound itself is fantastic and the volume level is amazing. It gets REALLY loud if you choose. With NO distortion. Highly recommended!",

It can be clipped to anything using a carabiner or tied to anything with a rope, and if for some reason if it were to come loose, the fact that it floats gave me peace of mind.

In other words, you can connect your smartphone, and if anyone else in your household is on their phone, they\u2019ll accidentally hijack the speaker from you.
