This tool does what it says it will do, put an evenly spread line of dry dusty stuff down right on the ground and where you want it. Looks like it will last a lifetime.",

It was easy to use and it has different widths depending on what you are marking and how thick you want your line. The lime would sometimes clog up if you didn\u2019t clean the canister properly. The grip also broke on the first day of use which I would blame on the terrain. The product however does exactly what it states and we continue to use it .",
