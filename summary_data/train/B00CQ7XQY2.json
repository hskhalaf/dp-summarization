It has the consistency of water, gets absorbed in your skin very quickly, and really help moisturize the skin and make the sunburn recover much quicker (and not peel).

After one night of use with this amazing spray, we couldn't believe that our skin was hardly red when we woke up the next day! It really is a life saver...oops, I mean a skin-saver! Since then, I have recommended it to others who can't believe how well it works! This little blue bottle is one of the first things we pack when were off to somehwere hot or tropical!",

The first couple sprays stung, but as he used it over and over the pain decreased and it healed faster than expected. We were surprised the pain subsided more quickly than usual and I think the scarring was less because this product stopped the burning faster and soothed the burn. I bought a second bottle right way. I was so thankful I happened to have this on hand!!!",

After Being Nuked All Day The Last Thing I Wanted To Do Was To Smear Sticky Aloe Products On My Skin. We Created A Fine Mist To Rehydrate And Discovered By Accident One Day When We Got Sunburned At The Beach That The Spray Calmed Down The Burn And Prevented Peeling Unlike Anything Else We Had Ever Used. We Began Testing It All Over The Caribbean On Ourselves By Purposely Lying Out In The Sun And Burning Ourselves With Consistent Results That Saved Many A Vacation. We Typically Stayed At Smaller Resorts Where We Were Able To Get Friendly With The Ownership And Management So As To Be Able To Leave Bottles Of Our Concoction At The Lobby Desk For Other Guests To Try With Results That Had The Vacationers Begging To Buy It From Us.",
