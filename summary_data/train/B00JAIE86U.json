Pros: -Lightweight -Good build -Battery life -Micro SD card slot Neutral: -Screen Resolution -Lenovo launcher -Processor speed -1 GB Ram Cons: -Time to charge -Lack of accessories -No HDMI out The cons, while not show-stoppers, are annoying. The battery life is as advertised, but time to charge in my opinion is excessive. Charging times of 5 hours are not unheard of in my experience with this tablet. Also, very few accessories exist for this tablet, even from the OEM Lenovo. But....I still like this tablet as does perform well.",

I purchased 32 GB; but I think that 16 would be adequate if this is your first tablet. One of the features that is also great to consider when selecting a tablet is the sound if you surf u-tube a lot or have a lot of music stored on the tablet. The speakers are mounted on each side which makes for great quality. le",
