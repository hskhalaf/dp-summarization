So decided to order this one because I didn\u2019t want anything super sophisticated like the brands out there and expensive. Setting up this thermostat was super simple and love how basic yet advanced it is. The app is very easy to use and it\u2019s completely compatible with Apple HomeKit. I have been using iDevices switches and outlets for sometime now and that\u2019s what made me pick this thermostat over the others. Works perfectly and would definitely recommend to anyone who would like an easy to use smart thermostat with just the right amount of features.",
