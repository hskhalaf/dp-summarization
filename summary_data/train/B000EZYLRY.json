No fixing this junk...tried good ole duck tape etc and now I just keep it in the corner and ask why an impact ball bag cannot stand a slow speed impact with a golf ball. By the way I am 76 years with a swing speed of about 76mph. This item violates every state's Deceptive Trade Practice and False Advertising Act. It most certainly is not as advertised \"durable\" and Amazon should close down 'Gary Wiren's Golf Training Aid site. Its a fraud.",
