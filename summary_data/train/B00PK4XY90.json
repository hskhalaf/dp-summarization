Much to my surprise STANLEY-BLACK + DECKER 'Matrix' bolt-ons work with my Craftsman handle and I've since picked up a trim saw.

We had to replace his jigsaw attachment once, as it did not live through cutting metal, as the gears are plastic... but I\u2019m not upset or shocked by that at all, just a warning. For small quick jobs, this is a great set and saves you from having to pull out big tools. This second set was purchased for our teenage son so he stops stealing my husbands!
