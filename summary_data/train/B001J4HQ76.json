Overall very disappointed with the speed and how it works. Returned for something that works and faster.",

Just place the boots on overnight and in the morning you'll have warm and dry boots. Simple. Eventually, the wrinkles in my boots should go away or at least not get worse. Plenty other reviews mention this not having an on/off switch, which would be nice, but I just unplug mine after I take the boots off. Might put a simple switch in some day. I also bought theto better dry gloves. Just placing gloves on the boot dryer as-is doesn't work well, especially since I typically want gloves dried quicker.",

I read a lot of reviews of people whining about not having an on off switch or having to unplug it to turn it off. I thought it was a legitimate concern before purchasing but have now determined that it was just whining. I have two pairs of boots anyway so there's always one pair on it. Pleased with purchase.",

I recommend this product if you have to wear boots everyday like I do. It puts out a decent amount of hot air (more than I thought) without any type of fan.

I used to let my boots dry in the boiler room for over a week and they wouldn\u2019t dry and fester all kinds of smells. Coolest thing about this product line is that there is numerous different attachments for helmets for drying and also gloves! Costs close to nothing to run it, and not much for an awsome product.

Pros: very low energy profile, measured at 34 or 35 watts using a KilliWatt meter, sturdy enough to accomodate heavier boots without tipping over, SILENT, 25 year warranty, additional attachements available for larger gloves and helmets/hats, fair price. Very minor cons: no on lamp or on/off switch, but thoose would probably wear out before 25 years. Needs more time to dry than blower style dryers that use generally five to six times the energy but risk adhesive seperation in some footwear.
