I should have checked before writing this review, but .... no buts, no excuses, I screwed up. This is a nice seat heater and it provides more than enough heat (thus the need for a low setting). I changed to 5 stars. My apologies to the seller. I was wrong.",

It usually provides enough heat but the warmup time in Minnesota's sub zero weather isn't that impressive. Not sure what the point is of the 2-position hi/lo heating selector switch, since ultimately, the in-seat thermostat takes control to limit the heat you feel. The elastic straps to hold the back to the seat were woefully too short to ever fit over the seatback in my Toyota Tundra. In short, more wattage in the heating elements and adjustable straps for the back.",

Just went through a very cold February and this helped her out a lot during her commutes to school. Just had one slight issue with it still drawing power and draining her battery even when the switch was in the off position. As long as she remembers to unplug it when she gets out of the car, all is good.",

A bit tough to get it on my car seat, but once in place it isn't going anywhere. I got it yesterday and tried it last night. Not super fast to warm up, but it did the job! Much more affordable option than the factory installed seat warmers!",

I would caution everyone to make sure the light goes out when you car is turned off. It stays lit in my car so I must unplug it when I get out of the car.",

It's not the product's fault. So, if you have a great memory or a car that does turn off the lighter then I would totally say this is a 5 star product!!! My husband didn't like it cause it drained his battery. I love it!!",
