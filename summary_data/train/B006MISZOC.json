That would be great for home staging but I use it all the time. Totally worth the price and, if you shop strategically on Amazon, you can get a really high-end look for pennies on the dollar.",

The welding on the frame is poorly done, so there are rough metal spots that can easily damage the mattress, pad, sheets.
