      "text": "I originally bought this fishing bag to replace my 3 tray tackle box. I have to say that this was an excellent upgrade. The bag is very spacious and comes with dividers to separate items. It can easily accommodate 4 Plano boxes while still having room for extra storage. it includes a pouch on the front for additional storage along with a place to keep your fishing license. Most importantly, it is lightweight and easy to carry over your shoulder. It is a great addition for the fisherman who wants to carry as much a possible while still keeping their hands free.",

Plenty of storage room and options with the included dividers. Had it out once where it rained on us most of the day and the bag held up very well in the weather. I especially am pleased with the undercoating on the bottom of the bag that generally is seen on more expensive bags. Only have owned it for about 5 months, however its seen heavy use this season and I have not witnessed anything fall apart just yet.",

I like the removable dividers for the main compartment so that you can make whatever pockets you need to in the main compartment or you can just have one huge open space if you prefer. The pockets on the sides are great as well. The shoulder strap is comfortable and comes in handy for freeing up your hands for your poles, net, bait or whatever else you may have. If you're a true fisherman and trying to get out of toting the traditional hard shell tackle box, this is for you!",

I mean, a couple times a week for a few hours each time. So far, this bag looks the same as when I bought it and has held up through boat trips, being laid on the ground, kicked, dropped, etc. and it still looks the same. It's not discolored from anything being spilled on it, doesn't stink and the bottom still looks good. There are so many pockets that he hasn't even filled them all yet. This feels so much better to carry than a hard tackle box.",

I could add another 11\" Plano box if I wanted instead of the middle section being open for miscellaneous gear.

HE loved the bag, has plenty storage, and cool attachment points. Construction was nice, appeared to be very durable, and should last for a very long time!",

      "text": "This bag is WAY smaller than the dimensions listed. The description has it at 18 x 10 x 14 in, and another one just below that says 13 x 16 x 12 in. But I just measured it myself and its actually more like 15 x 9 x 9. That may not sound a lot smaller, but when you compute the volume, its much smaller -- 2520, 2496, and 1215 cubic inches respectively, so its less than half the size described. Basically, it's a little bigger than an average camera bag....and WAY to small to hold all my gear. Big disappointment!",
