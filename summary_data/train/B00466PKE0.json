If your battery has two different connectors, the other one is probably for the balancing board. It helps charge your battery completely and correctly. I have a few hubsan quadcopters and purchased this for my new x4 H501s. You'll need to buy a EC2 connector though. I also had to solder connectors for my hubsan h107s, but no biggie. Check to see if you need additional connectors for your batteries and you'll be all good.",
