She went from about a minute and 30 seconds of hoovering food into her mouth hole to now about 5 or 6 minutes of frustratingly digging out every morsel. My only caution is that it barely fits one can of food so if you mix stuff with your dogs food (especially liquid) it probably will spill over either by you or by your dog trying to dig everything out. I mix a quarter cup of pumpkin into her food and that makes it just at the point of overflowing. It is not as deep as it looks.",
