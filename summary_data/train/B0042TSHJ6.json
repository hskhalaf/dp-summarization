I also own the Thera-Band Kickroller through a different supplier ( NOT Vesalius Health ) and the quality is distinctly superior. Please note I've never felt the need to post negative feedback, (or any at all) however, this is an inexcusable waste of my hard earned money. Please, don't be fooled.",

I use these for water aerobics or when I'm in our pool and want to get a bit of a work out especially for my arms. These seem to be made of good quality materials so they should last a very long time, but I don't leave them out in the sun when I'm not using them. The sun ruins everything.
