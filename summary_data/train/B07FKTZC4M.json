The components are high quality, and the RGB lighting adds a nice touch. The audio codec needed some tuning, it might be a bug. But it was quickly fixed. Aura Sync worked seemlessly, but some of the gimmicks you won\u2019t need. Fan control is excellent. With my Ryzen 2700 and a Arctic Freezer 33 cooler, I was able to reach 4.2 GHz at a comfortable temperature of 60 degrees C. Way better than the crashing with MSi. Overall, I don\u2019t see any reason not to like the board.",

      "text": "I like this board overall. It works well with Ryzen 3000 series cpus out of the box and was simple to setup. UEFI/BIOS is easy to use. Plenty of room for expansions as well. My one complaint is that there is no ARGB header on this board. That's my fault for assuming it was just a standard thing...but it isn't. I ordered a used one from Amazon Warehouse and it was basically new and only missing one thing listed on the box but it wasn't important so I can't fault it there. I bought it open boxed and that's what I got.",

However, upon shutting down as one normally would, and attempting to switch back on the computer, I noticed that the ROG Logo on the board between the I/O shield and the CPU would blink white once, and that's it. Nothing powers on, no posting etc. The computer is hooked up to a UPS and all other procedures done properly. I've tested the Power Supply separately using the paperclip method and the PSU turns on fine. Can anyone share some feedback or advice on how to remedy this? Thanks.",
