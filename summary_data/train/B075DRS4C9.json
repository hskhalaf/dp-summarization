      "text": "As you can see from the photo above, I love this seat cushion so much that I put \"Ask Me About My Butt Pillow\" on my college graduation cap. (And people did ask about it!) What do I tell them? It's great for driving (most car seats slope downwards in the back, causing lower back pain!) seeing a play, sitting at a desk, etc! It lifts your pelvis higher than your thighs, which helps naturally align your back and provide comfort. I sit up straighter when I teach because I use it. All of my friends who have tried it want one of their own! I couldn't recommend it enough!",

Looking forward to seeing how it does on some longer drives. I intend to purchase another to use in the house.
