I hadn't been able to find a replacement until I saw this one at Amazon. This case is awesome. Well-constructed, sturdy, has a quality zipper, and a real mirror on the inside cover (not the mylar type). The patent leather is nice and can be wiped off easily if it becomes dirty. The inside is lined with a fabric material, and my only concern is it might get dirty. Overall very pleased, and exceeded my expectations for the price.",
