      "text": "I absolutely love these socks! They are amazing quality, very comfortable, and they fit very well. The best part: they actually stay up on their own! Most of the thigh high socks I have bought do not do this, so I was happily surprised. They are well worth the money. They hold their color very well, and look great even though I have washed them multiple times. They work with a lot of outfits. These are simply my favorite pair of thigh high socks that I own, despite the fact that they were the cheapest. Would definitely recommend them.",

Ads say thigh high, but they stopped just north of her knees, so she rolled them down and wore them like boot socks. If you are over 5'6\", these may not be as long as you think. Fit and material are otherwise nice and they kept her warm.",
