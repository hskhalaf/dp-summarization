      "text": "I was thrilled that the item arrived within 24 hours so I could complete the new look in my living room. I don't know how sturdy it is, but so far so good. I think it would be nice if the holder parts were a little more apart from each other and perhaps have a wider base. It fits in my fireplace with some extra room. But all in all I am pleased with it and especially with the quick free delivery. The next day I also ordered a candle snuffer which came in LESS than 24 hours!! Very happy with that except that I wish it had a bit longer handle.",
