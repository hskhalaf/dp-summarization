      "text": "This mower exceeds my expectations. I wanted something to do touch up mowing at my townhouse. Perfect for that. It's light weight, folds up for an easy fit in the back of my station wagon for trips to my mom's for touch up mowing. The grass catcher bag is not large but adequate for small areas. Removal and replacing the bag quite easy. Love the three wheel design. It allows insertion into areas one must avoid with a traditional four wheeled machine. The cord requires some strategy and forethought, totally worth it to eliminate gas/oil and carburetors.",

I regret not purchasing something with a rating, but let this be a warning to others. Somebody had to go first. This thing is basically a toy... that doesn't work properly. The height level would go from the highest level (a 4) and then automatically slide back to the ground lever (a 1). I returned it immediately . -2 Stars if I could.",

My lawn is soft and bumpy with many dips. The front wheel seems to descend into the dips and cut too short. If your lawn is smooth with no dips this is a great mower for you. If your lawn is soft or has dips I would recommend the four wheel Sun Joe Electric Lawn Mower.",
