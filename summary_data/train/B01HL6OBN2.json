This is one more way to get my husband to eat more fresh fruit, because he hated dealing with the pits, buts loves cherries without the hassle.",

Flash freezing cherries is so much easier and quicker with the Cherry Pitter Stoner utensil. I like how the pitter leaves the cherry mostly intact. It is a bit more time consuming when you have a quantity of cherries, but I prefer the results better than the ones that do bulk cherries. I like the assurance of knowing that the pit has been removed. We will now enjoy cherries long past the season.",
