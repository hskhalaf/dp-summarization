Obviously some drop-off in sharpness at the edges at 10mm, but you would expect that and it is well within acceptable boundaries. I was surprised how little linear distortion there is for such a wide lens. Love it.",

I've not had it long, but it seems super-sharp for such an ultra-wide zoom and I'm looking forward to two things: landscapes/architectural shots and also seeing how creative I can be with such a wide lense in video mode.",

Maybe overpriced for what it is (but all Sony lenses seem to suffer from that!), but its flexibility, portability and range make it a brilliant tool - particularly for landscape photography. I have noticed some focussing issues in low light, but apart from that it is difficult to fault.",

It weighs barely more than the 16-50 kit lens and has a compact design. Well worth adding to your lens collection.",

Don't buy it unless you're rich and can support 799 each year apparently. Also, samyang is a much better / cheaper choice and the lenses are under warranty for 2 years.

Angle of view (APS-C): 109 degree-76 degree\nAPS-C, E-mount. Optical steady shot image stabilisation within the lens ensures smooth, blur-free photos and videos when shooting handheld, steady shot image stabilisation. Remove dust and debris from the camera body. Use a brush to sweep dust and debris from the entire camera. Use a large brush for the outside of the camera and a small brush for delicate parts. Do not press the brush hard against the camera; sweep gently. Remove dust and debris from delicate parts using a blower. Take the front lens cap off, and remove the dust on the lens surface using the blower. If particularly dirty, wet a soft cloth or lens tissue with lens cleaner solution, and wipe in a circular motion from the center of the lens. Do not apply lens cleaner solution directly to the lens.Do not use any organic solvent such as thinner or benzine to clean the lens. Replace the front lens cap to prevent dust from attaching to the lens. Press the lens release button, and detach the lens. Be careful do not touch the sensor's surface. Use the blower while holding the camera facing slightly downward so that dust and debris easily fall off the sensor's surface. Reattach the lens. Take the lens off and on in a dust-free location. Dust and debris may easily enter the camera and lens in a dusty location. For an A-mount: When you attach the lens, confirm that the mirror has been completely pushed down. After you are finished cleaning, check that dust has been removed. Set the shooting mode to Aperture Priority (A), and the aperture value to F11. Take a picture of a white wall, white paper, or the sky. Make sure that no dust shows on the image.\n\nBOX CONTAINS\nLens",
