The design with the \u201chandles\u201d is great to get my little guy interested and involved in his home care routine. I also LOVE that it stands on its own. The toothpaste was useless IMO\u2014personal preference was to start with a fluoridated toothpaste based off of ADA recommendations. It was worth it for the package just to try the brush, however.",
