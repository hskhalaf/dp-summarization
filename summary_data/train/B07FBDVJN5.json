Also, one of the brackets of another pole was bent inwards, as mentioned in many reviews, making it difficult to insert into the overhangs. I am returning this product.

Have a lot of good features included, pull-up bar, dip bars, one pair of J-Hooks, plus the safety catch bars have J-Hooks as well. 3\" hole spread works just fine for the pre-teen, teen, and myself for adjustments. It does have wobble to it but can stand up to a heavy load and use so far. Look forward to getting additional attachments for it as its a really good addition to the home gym for these kids given COVID restrictions for organized sports right now.",

Assembly was super easy with only one bolt size. I hand tightened everything until the whole thing was together and lined up before turning with the socket wrench. Lat pull down is actually really nice and a perfect addition. I'm a Marine and the biggest concern for me was if this would be sturdy enough for a lot of pull ups without concrete bolts or sand bags. It works perfectly and I highly recommend it!",

I emailed customer service to ask if there was a trick to it but got no response, so minus one for customer service. Otherwise I\u2019m pretty satisfied.

      "text": "I've had this attachment for almost a month now and its already giving me problems. I dont know the correct terminology for each little part, but one of the essential \"gears\" that are suppose to rotate as you pull are completely static. This creates extreme tension/friction when I try to pull in any direction. I could literally have little to no weight on it and it is not smooth at all and those rotating gears do not budge when they are suppose to run smoothly up and down the main bar. it's also starting to flake all over the place from the constant friction. I'm very disappointed in this attachment.",

It supports a great deal of weight and there are 17 holes to place the attachments to give you a great deal of versatility. (The holes are not labeled so I ordered some stickers to place next to them. That way it's easier to remember my settings for bench press, squat, military press, etc. In addition, the pull-up bar is a nice addition. The traditional pull-up hand holds have a grip, but I also added some grippy tape to the inside to give me more pull-up options. But overall, great value for the price.",

Currently the manufacturing plant is closed due to the virus and there's no way to get a replacement leg. The open-end wrenches supplied for assembly are cheap dime store versions unsuitable for use; expect busted knuckles if you use them. Otherwise, the unit is very attractive and would be suitable for the home gym.",

It's nice knowing that won't be a limiting factor/ceiling to my training in the future or for any other stronger lifters I may train with.
