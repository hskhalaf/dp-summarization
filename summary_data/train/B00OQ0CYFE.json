This hub works ok with usb flash drives, but it doesn't work very well with input devices (mouse and keyboard). There is about half-second delay between moving mouse and the cursor on the screen(which is very annoying to me). When I bypassed the hub and connected the mouse to the laptop directly, the problem disappears. Thus, it is the hub that created the delay. In addition, the hub has dc 5v power input connector, but the package didn't include the power adapter which also made me skeptical about this product. Not very happy with this purchase.",
