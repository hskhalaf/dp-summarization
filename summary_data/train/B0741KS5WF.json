The 2 extra are in one long string that you have to cut apart. And when I ordered the item, I was worried if it would fit comfortably as I have a 22 inch neck. It does fit fine and could be used by someone bigger easily. It is just what I wanted - not too wide and not too short - just perfect :)",

The strip of ice is a series of small water-filled connected compartments which makes it flexible. If these were just a bit bigger, I\u2019d give it an extra star, as it would last longer before losing its cooling power. It came with two strips, but for me it seems too much of a hassle to run inside, to the freezer, to change it out. I read you can order additional stops for freezing, so I suppose keeping them all in a small cooler outside, right beside you, might help.",
