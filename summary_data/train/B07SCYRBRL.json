I owned the Wii U version which did not receive the same features or new tables when the were released, and this all but makes up for it. Containing all tables released to date and various play modes that were not in the Wii U version. Overall the price is cheaper than it would have been to buy each table collection when the were released. The Only Down sides I see from this game are some lackluster voice acting, No Prequel Trilogy Tables, and a lack of music options (no music from the sequel trilogy or the anthology films).",

There ton's of tables focusing on the movies, characters, and TV shows and they are vastly different so you don't get bored playing. If you like Star Wars and own a switch buy this now but beware it is addicting!",

The game play modes make it a challenge and the game play itself is tons of fun. The ONLY downside that I have found is that the voices in the game aren't the original actors. They're close, but not the real thing. It's something you notice once, then quickly forget about. This game is a must-buy if you like pinball and star wars.",
