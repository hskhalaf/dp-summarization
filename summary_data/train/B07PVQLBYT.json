The highlights include the upper\u2019s accommodating construction, the midsole\u2019s reactive and cloud-like experience, and the versatile configuration of the aesthetics.

This shoe is solid enough when weight training and cross training, especially with the plastic heel at the back. This is a second pair which I\u2019m keeping in storage until my current pair wear out, as I don\u2019t want to be searching around again in 12-18 months time.",

Pros: - good for wider feet - look smart - good grip - dry quicker than other trainers I own Cons: - I found the grip very slippy (Especially in the wet) the first day or so of wearing them but they eventually wore in and provided excellent grip even in the wet.",

    "description": "Under Armour UA Charged Escape three Sports Shoes - Stay lighter than air during exercise with these essential men's running shoes.\n\nThese shoes are designed for runners who need a balance of flexibility and cushioning. A lightweight upper hugs the foot for breathable, flexible support, while a firm external heel counter gives additional support and keeps the back of the foot locked in place. On the inside, a moulded Comfort Collar locks in the heel with a soft, plush feel for zero distractions. A Comfort sockliner takes the shape of your foot, with added padding in the heel for cushioning at the heel-strike. The Dual-layer Charged Cushioning midsole is firmer below the heel and softer below the forefoot for a blend of support and comfort that's built to perform. In addition, a rubber outsole provides full ground contact with deep flex grooves for extra flexibility where you need it most. High-abrasion rubber has been added to heavy-wear areas of the sole to increase durability, and the shoe features reflective details for greater visibility on low-light runs. The runners are made of mesh.\n\nUNDER ARMOUR MAKES ATHLETES BETTER.\n\nWe started with a T-shirt that gave athletes an undeniable advantage and ultimately resulted in a complete renewal of sportswear. Today, innovation is our lifeblood and the key to achieving our brand mission.\n\nThe product details:\n\n * Men's running shoes\n * Dual-layer Charged Cushioning midsole\n * Firm external heel and moulded Comfort Collar \n * Fast-drying fabric\n * Comfortable and breathable\n * Material: Mesh\n * Fit: Men's",
