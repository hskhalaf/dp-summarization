After months of changing settings, the 2.4GHz band is finally no longer kicking my older devices offline every 20 minutes. When they say \"Shareport technology\", what D-Link means is that you will have to download their Shareport software if you want to be able to access the USB drive from anything but a full PC. The iPod and tablets in the house absolutely require the software to view the material stored there. It was not easy to configure, even so, and did not make a good family storage media device as I had hoped.",
