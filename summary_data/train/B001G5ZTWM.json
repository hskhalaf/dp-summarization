      "text": "This is the best littl point and shoot camera I have ever used. I have two of the now. While it isn't an SLR, in some instances I have found the photos taken with this camera on par with my more expensive cameras. The only real limitation that I have to be mindful of is the limited distance that is useful using the flash. The in-built flash is good to a distance of about 8 feet or so.... After that the picture is progressively u dear exposed at further distance, but with a little help from Lightroom or Photoshop, you can yield good results a bit further.",

      "text": "I've had the camera for a month and still need to use it in more varied conditions. So far I've mostly done inside snapshots, which came out great. I like the size and feel of the camera. The controls are easy to use and there are more manual setting options than the casual photographer needs most of the time. However, I'm looking forward to taking some landscapes and variable light shots to see how the camera works under those conditions. My last camera was a 5-yr old Canon Powershot SD 45. This camera is much better than that one. I think it is a good value for the price. Also, the black body looks really good!",

But if you are looking for a good point and shoot with some manual control, this one is great. It has automatic setting for point and shoot, but you also have overrides to adjust shutter settings, or at least choose from other semi-automatic settings such as nightscapes and action shots. It comes with a mere 32 MB card, though - enough for about 6 pictures. Order extra memory cards when purchasing this one.",

The feel is great, the interface is user friendly, and most of all it makes any amateur take professional photos. the photos i get from this camera is amazing. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",

From shot to shot, it is fast, compared with my older Canon. There is also a function where you can press the camera button and it will continuously shoot photos and that is supposed to be even faster. Clear and fast. That's what I need.",

You have to press it pretty hard for it to come on, making it more difficult to quickly capture a shot. Overall, I am very happy with the camera and would recommend it to anyone looking for a higher-end point and shoot.",

My biggest issue with this camera is that my photos are soft (not sharp) indoors. In good lighting, they are amazing. Also, I wish the LCD viewer was a larger. With that said, I love the face recognition with the zoom feature and \"quick shot\" feature that makes this camera work similar to an SLR. The video is very clear. I have only used the camera about 8 times so I will update this review upon further examination.",

Both are the very image of photography at its best, featuring megapixels that\u2019s the highest resolution among Digital ELPH to capture every detail of the world around you. There\u2019s never been a better time to think big, knowing that every enlargement will be sharper and more full-of-life than you\u2019ve ever experienced before. \n\n3.7x optical zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer for blur-free shooting\nThe PowerShot SD990 IS Digital ELPH has 3.7x optical zoom. A zoom opens up a world of possibilities in your photography, and thanks to innovative Canon engineering, it\u2019s housed in a camera that\u2019s sized to go everywhere with you. With many cameras, hand-held shots taken at the long end of the zoom can be marred by blur. The SD990 IS Digital ELPH incorporates Canon\u2019s exclusive Optical Image Stabilizer. The technology detects and effectively cancels camera shake, for clear, sharp images every time. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.7x optical zoom in action \n\nOptical viewfinder plus large high-quality 2.5-inch PureColor LCD II\nThe PowerShot SD990 IS Digital ELPH gives you large 2.5-inch LCD screen for excellent control when framing your shots. Canon\u2019s PureColor LCD II offers spectacular color, resolution and contrast even when viewed at an angle. The screen is highly durable and easy to see in any light with a scratch-resistant, antireflective coating. It also features Night Display for easy viewing in low light--a perfect feature for gathering friends and family around to see your images. \n\nNew DIGIC 4 Image Processor improves Face Detection, adds Servo AF, Face Detection Self-Timer and Intelligent Contrast Correction \n\nDIGIC 4 Image Processor\nCanon\u2019s proprietary DIGIC Image Processors have long set its cameras apart from the competition, and the new DIGIC 4 sets the bar even higher. Faster, more accurate noise reduction delivers better image quality, even at high ISO speeds. \n\niSAPS Technology is an entirely original scene-recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos, iSAPS works with the advanced DIGIC 4 Image Processor to improve focus speed and accuracy, as well as exposure and white balance. \n\nA new Face Self-Timer automatically detects an increase in the number of faces and makes the appropriate adjustments. For instance, to include photographer\u2019s face in a group shot, there\u2019s no need to rush in. Just put the camera on a stand or tripod, and specify Face Self-Timer, and the camera will wait for the photographer\u2019s face to get on-camera before it takes the shot. Motion Detection now tracks moving subjects in a much larger range, and the new Servo AF retains focus on a moving subject after the shutter button is pressed halfway -- allowing you to wait for the perfect shot without refocusing. Also, Face Detection and Motion Detection are markedly improved. \n\nIntelligent Contrast Correction\nDIGIC 4 also makes possible the new i-Contrast (Intelligent Contrast Correction) system, which controls the compensation level in pixel units to brighten dark areas while leaving bright areas unchanged for better images where the main subject is dark, and more natural transition. The PowerShot SD990 IS Digital ELPH can even use i-Contrast in playback mode to adjust images that were shot without the setting activated. \n\nRed-eye Correction provides three options for removing red-eye from subjects in flash pictures.\n1) The Red-eye Correction during shooting actually identifies and corrects red-eye in human subjects as pictures are taken.\n2) The SD990 IS Digital ELPH can be set to automatically detect and correct red-eye during image playback.\n3) You can manually locate any red eyes in a scene during image playback on the LCD screen, and command the camera to remove them. \n\nLife doesn\u2019t give you second chances to capture special times. That\u2019s why the SD990 IS Digital ELPH features ISO 1600 and High ISO Auto settings that reduce the effects of camera shake and sharpen subjects in low-light situations, giving you greater shooting flexibility. ISO can be expanded to 3200 when you select ISO 3200 Special Scene mode. \n\nA Wide Range of Shooting Modes to Capture Anything\nWhen you don\u2019t want to control the shots, the PowerShot SD990 IS Digital ELPH offers the satisfying option of Quick shooting mode. The camera\u2019s LCD screen turns off and the viewfinder displays the scene while framing. When the moment you want to shoot the focused moving subject comes along, this feature makes lag time shortest to capture the subject quickest. If the camera focuses on faces, the faces are also detected in the frame. \n\nWith 21 Shooting Modes including 16 Special Scene Modes, you\u2019re ready for whatever shot comes your way. \n\nPrint/Share Button for easy direct printing and downloading\nThe PowerShot SD990 IS Digital ELPH's Print/Share button makes direct printing easier than ever. Simply connect the SD990 IS Digital ELPH to a Canon PIXMA Photo Printer or SELPHY Compact Photo Printer or any PictBridge compatible photo printer, press the lighted Print/Share button and print! Also use the Print/Share button to transfer images to a computer (Windows and Macintosh). \n\nPrint your own ID photos in up to 28 different sizes or use the Movie Print function to output multiple stills from a recorded movie on a single sheet with a Canon SELPHY Compact Photo Printer. \n\nWhat's in the Box\n\n * PowerShot SD990IS Digital ELPH body \n * Wrist Strap WS-DC7 \n * SD Memory Card SDC-32M \n * Battery Pack NB-5L \n * Battery Charger CB-2LX \n * AV Cable AVC-DC400 \n * Interface Cable IFC-400PCU (USB) \n * Solution Disk",
