The guy I bought it from included a case, a flash, and a few other odds and ends that I'm really excited to mess around with. Absolutely phenomenal camera, I recommend it to anyone looking to start off with a pretty simple DSLR camera. I will warn you now, the Olympus lenses are pricey. I bought another and it cost me almost as much as the camera alone had cost, so make sure you know what you're doing, and take care of it.",

A rich palette of options gives the photographer professional flexibillity, all easily found on the camera's controls and menus. The autofocus is fast and accurate. The lenses are, well, spectacular. Sharp images edge to edge at all focal lengths. Compared against the 'big name' competition which costs many hundreds more, Olympus is the bargain of the market segment. I bought my daughter the EVOLT 500 system for her 21st birthday and she is shooting fantastic shots as well.",

These features along with the better price than both Canon and Nikon make this a great choice. From professional reviews this camera with it lens kit has the best lens vs the competition. Canon on their stock lens kit uses very low end lens. The 4:3 system also makes the 40-150mm lens work at twice the mm or 80-300mm. This results in the lens being much smaller than the competition, so you are more likely to take the larger lens with you on trips.",

The pictures I have taken so far are excellent. After reading comment after comment about difficulties with autofocus in low light (NEVER with any reference to what lens was being used and at what settings) I was a tiny bit concerned. However, I am really pleased with the AF in low light situations. Of course, both my lenses are 2.8. When my old Olympus C-2100UZ died, I was devastated and went through a few point-and-shoots with no satisfaction. I'm really glad to be back with an Olympus product.",

My kids shoot semi-professionally with a Canon D-30, I feel like my 510 is more user friendly and just as good. I thank Olympus for making the offer to help me buy the 510.

    "title": "Olympus Evolt E510 10MP Digital SLR Camera with CCD Shift Image Stabilization and 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 Zuiko Lens",
    "description": "Style:E510 with 14-42mmCL) D2) Olympus E-510 W/14-42MM ZM LEN\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe Olympus EVOLT E-510 digital SLR is a great camera to help you evolve as a photographer. Only Olympus digital SLRs are engineered to be 100-percent digital. Simply put, this means your pictures will have stunning edge-to-edge sharpness that cant be beat. Olympus Live View LCD technology is a unique feature that enhances your picture-taking experience. Whatever life brings, whatever youre photographing, youll capture colorful memories with the E-510s proven Dust Reduction System and powerful, 10-megapixel imager. \n\n EVOLT E-510 Highlights \n\n Innovative 2.5-inch Live View HyperCrystal LCD The E-510 features a Live View LCD to provide users with the freedom to choose how they compose their shots, using either the LCD or the optical viewfinder on the back of the camera. The Olympus Live View LCD empowers users to easily compose their subjects live on the LCD before the shot has been taken, offering a level of versatility that can not be achieved by other digital SLR cameras that only offer an optical viewfinder. By holding the E-510 away from the face and using the Live View LCD to compose, its possible to shoot upward from a low angle for dramatic composition, in close for detailed macro photos of a butterflys wings or photographing a parade over a crowd of people. \n\n The E-510s big and bright 2.5-inch LCD display with approximately 230,000 pixels includes HyperCrystal technology, which offers many times the contrast of conventional LCD monitors, and enables images to be beautifully displayed in vivid color -- both in preview and playback. The HyperCrystal LCD also provides a wide viewing angle, which ensures images can be composed from even the most obscure angles. The larger LCD makes viewing icons and text on the cameras menu a squint-free process. \n\n Detailed, bright, and colorful photos with 10-megapixel Live MOS image sensor The E-510 is loaded with an impressive 10 million pixels for high-resolution photos. The 10-megapixel sensor gives photographers the flexibility to blow up their prints to the large sizes supported by many of todays printers, or crop the image to print only a part of the image that is important to them. The high-performance Live MOS image sensor in the E-510 delivers excellent dynamic range for accurate color fidelity, and a new state-of-the-art amplifier circuit to eradicate noise and capture fine image details in the highlight and shadow areas. \n\n Mechanical Image Stabilization for sharp images Unlike other digital SLR cameras in its class, the E-510 employs Mechanical Image Stabilization, which compensates for camera movement. This new technology complements Digital Image Stabilization, which compensates for a moving subject. Combined, Mechanical Image Stabilization and Digital Image Stabilization provide a powerful solution, ensuring blur-free photos even in active shooting situations where photographers may encounter camera shake or a moving subject. This powerful combination resides within the cameras body, translating to blur-free images taken with any of the more than 30 digital-specific lenses. \n\n Dust Reduction System for spot-free images Olympus Dust Reduction System produces spot-free photos with the exclusive Supersonic Wave Filter. The patented ultrasonic technology vibrates to remove dust and other particles from the front of the image sensor, and captures the debris on a special adhesive membrane every time you turn on the camera. These spot-free photos liberate users from hours spent retouching photographs at the computer or sending their cameras back to the manufacturer to remove dust trapped inside. \n\n TruePic III for image clarity Olympus enhanced TruePic III Image Processor produces crystal clear photos using all the pixel information for each image to provide the best digital images possible for every photo with accurate color, true-to-life flesh tones, brilliant blue skies and precise tonal representation in between. TruePic III also lowers image noise by one step to reduce noise in images shot at higher ISO settings, enabling great results in low-light situations. \n\n Included 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 Zuiko lens The E-410 one-lens outfit includes a compact, Zuiko Digital ED 14 - 42 mm f3.5 - f5.6 lens (equivalent to 28mm - 84mm in 35mm photography) that perfectly matches the imager so light strikes the sensor directly to ensure rich, accurate colors and edge-to-edge sharpness. Its 3x ED Glass zoom lens covers the range most frequently used in everyday photography and weighs just 7.5 ounces, offering users an extremely dynamic, portable everyday-use zoom. Close-ups as near as 9.84 inches (0.25 m) are also possible throughout the zoom range. \n\n All E-Series cameras support the Four-Thirds Standard whereby Olympus and various other manufacturers produce high-quality Four-Thirds-compliant lenses and accessories that are specifically designed for digital SLR image capture. Because the E-410 is part of the Olympus E-System, it is compatible with a large and growing range of Olympus E-System accessories to further enhance personal shooting styles and applications. This includes the full line-up of Zuiko Digital Specific lenses and flashes. \n\n Lens compatibility All E-Series cameras support the Four Thirds Standard whereby Olympus and various other manufacturers produce high-quality Four Thirds-compliant lenses and accessories that are specifically designed for digital SLR image capture. Because the E-510 is part of the Olympus E-System, it is compatible with a large and growing range of Olympus E-System accessories to further enhance personal shooting styles and applications. This includes the full line-up of Zuiko Digital Specific lenses and flashes. \n\n Easy-to-use, easy-to-handle light and ergonomic design The EVOLT E-510 is extremely portable, measuring 5.35 inches (136mm) by 3.61 inches (91.7mm) and 2.2 inches (56mm), excluding protrusions, and weighing 16.2 ounces (460 grams) body only. The new camera has a classic penta-mirror design that is light and compact enough to comfortably shoot with all day. Beyond its portable size, the E-510 delivers unparalleled ease of use -- from menus that make sense and buttons on the body that are easy to understand and operate, to automatic settings for every imaginable situation. \n\n While the E-510 includes a full range of manual control options to customize your creativity, it also has 28 shooting modes designed to provide the ideal settings for a variety of shooting situations automatically. These include Digital Image Stabilization, Night Scene, Fireworks, Beach and Snow, and Candle Light to name a few, as well as an xD Panorama mode (for use with Olympus xD-Picture Cards). Users also benefit from special color modes and the possibility to apply a variety of Black & White filters. \n\n Accepting both CompactFlash Type I & II, Microdrives, and xD-Picture Cards, the camera provides a choice of data storage options for enhanced flexibility, and it is possible to transfer image files from one card to the other right inside the camera.",
