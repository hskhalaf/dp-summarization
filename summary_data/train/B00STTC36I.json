I'm tall and very thin (thanks chemotherapy) so I'm kind of hard to fit. I was expecting the waist band to be a little large. Instead it fits wonderfully. It doesn't ride down my thin frame. They are comfortable and having a pocket to put my glasses in is nice. If the company has other styles I'll be ordering more.",
