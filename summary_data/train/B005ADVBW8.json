I use a rope to connect them to my paddle board in case they drift too far away, but the only hook is on the side, which of course pulls them sideways, and if there is any current, it makes them feel as thought they will tip over.

      "text": "I bought this kayak for my Grandkids (ages 4 and 6). The quality is excellent, and the price included the paddle and the hand grip on the front of the kayak. The paddle is great for the six year old, a little long for the four year old. They tried it out in the swimming pool and had a great time with it. It's very stable. They can even stand on it, and jump off without tipping. We're taking it up to our cabin in the Sierra's and will be using it at Pinecrest Lake. I plan on adding a \"tow\" handle to my kayak so I can tow the \"Wave\" in case the kids get tired!",
