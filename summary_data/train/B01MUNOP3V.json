You will need a male RCA to female 3.5mm phono adapter, then a 3.5mm male to 3.5mm male extension phono cable. The microphone I used was Microseven M7WP-MIC waterproof available from Amazon. Use the white side of the micrphone to connect the RCA adapter. Use the yellow wire on the side of the camera harness wires to connect other side. If this helps anyone, it's worth it. Had this camera since March 2018, and microphone would not work until now (August 29, 2018).",

This camera is sturdy and loaded with features such as position presets, auto-focus, three intuitively modifiable detection zones, activity schedule settings, and greatly improved access security. No cloud account subscription is required as the camera can record to the build-in micro SD card (order separately) and offers superb freely downloadable foscam multi-camera management software (available for Win or Mac). Camera runs 100BaseT allowing modification of the standard Ethernet cable to inject the device power (12V/max 2000mA) via the extraneous 4 Ethernet wires for cabled (non-wifi) operation via just the Ethernet cable. Camera offers superb image quality. No complaints, highly recommended.",

The cheap $50 one is bulletproof and I have 10 year old cameras still working great. After multiple rounds with Tech service a new one was sent. This one is great, inside... If it is outside it cannot hold a signal. I put up the foscam $35 wifi non PTZ camera and it is much better. In my opinion, this would be a great camera if you put it inside or very close to your router but just not worth the money.",

The optical zoom is a real nice feature. Make sure to install this camera as high as you can as you are limited on how far the camera will tilt up.

The camera not only notifies me when it detects that my dog is in the garage, it allows me a full range view of the dog so I can track his movements. Its a cool gadget for those who have pets, they want to watch, but cant. I definitely recommend it, esp since it can be used for something other than just watching pets. The motion detection is pretty cool, because you dont have to always keep an eye out, you will get a notification on your phone when it tracks movement.",
