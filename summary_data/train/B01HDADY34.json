It has a pin that slides into a notch when the cover is locked in place, turning the safety lock indicator green.

The quality and build is superior. The pressure lid fits and works perfectly. The Fissler is more \"idiot proof\" that the others and feels safer to use. Cooking has been more consistent than the results we were getting with our electric model. Frankly, I don't see using that one again unless we are doing a huge meal and don't have room on the stove for it. Very happy with this. Would certainly recommend. Thanks for reading.",
