They were light enough for the 9 hour hike down and stiff enough for the challenging boulder slide crossings. The treads are great and even have some spikes for slippery conditions. I wore them on a trail in Colorado that still had snow and in areas where my husband was slipping, my footing was sure. Plus, they are really good looking!",

Then, I went ahead and bought these online. I have a very high arch and much prefer to have a wide toe box with a narrow heel. These shoes were perfect. I took them out of the box, walked around in the house for a few hours, then hiked all around Colorado for a week without having any issues at all. Love these Oboz!",

I am amazed at how this has allowed me to play a sport I thought I would have to give up. I can walk without much pain the evening after golf, and have no residual pain the next day. They are worth the price. We only have one pair of feet, you know...",

And when I finally decided it was time for new shoes, there was no way I was buying any other boot. The only negative thing about them is that the shoelaces get worn through easily just from tying them. But since new laces are cheap, I didn't consider that a big deal. The ones I wore out are actually still waterproof, even though they are slick-soled and worn down to the nub.",
