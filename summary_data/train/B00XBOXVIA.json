Took 3 weeks to find a supplier to purchase a replacement fuse. As I am not in the USA it was not feasible to return to Breville for service. Attempted to replace the fuse myself, forget it. Why has Breville not corrected this design flaw! Never again!",

Loved this oven, live in FL, in summer with the AC running full blast, didn't like using the big oven because it heated up the kitchen so used this as much as possible (hate dueling appliances, the electric company loves it). Then the fan would not work, looked up the extended warranty and shipped it off to get repaired. Guess it was more than just the fan, they refunded me the purchase price of the oven.

I can't push the oven all the way back on my counter top because the back of the oven touches the plug. The oven does get hot (that's what ovens do).

My only complaint was in regards to the heat distribution, as it was a little uneven, and food could quickly overcook if not monitored closely. However, what makes this a one star review is the fact that the control board went bad after less than one and a half years of low usage. One day, the toaster started \"freaking out,\" beeping frequently while the oven light and heating elements kept turning on and off. Very dangerous! (See video of this happening.)

It will take one 9\" cake pan, but who bakes just one layer of a cake? It will not take cupcake pans, or anything bigger than a strictly 9 by 13 pan, and that includes the lip of the pan. I'm sorry I bought it - $280 is very expensive for a toaster. The instructions say it will cook a 14# turkey, but that has to be some kind of a joke - I seriously doubt if even a 5# chicken would fit in this oven.",

To close the door, you must reach under a hot piece of glass to slide you fingers under the handle. I have been lightly burned several times. Also wish it had a second rack.

It is very easy to clean, the bottom crumb tray is large and comes out easily. Very easy to wipe off and re-insert.",

Convection fan is so quiet you can barely hear it. Open the oven door, which feels solid, and the rack comes out, making access easy. My Cuisinart was still working but the features in my new Breville make it a very worthwhile purchase. We have affectionately nicknamed it \"Brevy\" and consider it as a vital part of our family. Will check out other Breville products because this one is so well designed and multi-functional.",
