The cushioning unit, the rubber exterior, and the fabrics on the upper were also given praise. Overall, this trail running shoe for neutral runners proved to be a worthy update to the series.",

        "The underfoot cushioning system was deemed comfortable and easy on the muscles of the legs",
        "Some runners liked that the outsole wasn\u2019t too aggressive",

At first the Cascadia 13 felt a little clunky to get used to but having bought my second pair I can see that Brooks have just evolved the shoe enough to stay true to its roots without going crazy. I hope they do the same with the 14!",

They are light but sturdy. They provide good protection from rocks and the elements but it feels like you are wearing slippers. I bought my normal size shoe and have broad feet... but there is plenty of room. Then there is the sole, which grips the terrain like a formula one car. I've run through forests, riverbeds and scree but always had the confidence that I wouldn't slip or lose my footing.",

Side by side the Cascadia 13's in 10 are the same size as my ASR's in a 10.5. I can't comment on the run as I'm a failed runner right now due to my knee and currently wearing them for commuting. Very comfortable and light though.",
