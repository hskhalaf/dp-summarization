I ordered the 10-11 size and they fit but are closer to snug size 10 rather than an 11. I was hoping for a little looser fit as I wear socks with mine and slip them on to take the trash out and such. They will most likely stretch some and be ok. All in all though, they will do the job. Hope this helps.",

These are much less expensive and maybe not as well made but they are just fine in my opinion. They are very comfortable and they seem like they'll hold up well (time will tell). I like them and am very happy with them as a replacement. I am ordering a second pair to leave at the back door. I wouldn't be doing that with a $50 pair of Nikes!",

And, because I have dry feet and have to use foot balm and wear socks all the time, even in summer, I use them around the house. I have nothing to do with this company but am so glad I bought them.",

Water will collect in the sandal should you be on level ground, however emptying it is as easy as tilting your foot forward. This also means it is very easy to clean your feet while wearing these. They work great as Shower Shoes, Poolside Shoes, Slippers, and other purposes. I would personally not recommend beaches as sand can get trapped, but rinsing out theses slides is very easy should you have access to a hose.",

If it was more flat, or convex, or had drain holes, it would make showering with them on much better. As it is, they collect water, then track water and spill water. I'm still using them, and I have no plans to replace them, but I don't know that I'd purchase them again for my application.",

These have no fabric or felt in them to hold moisture, so that's good. The only reason they are not 5 stars is the high rim around the edge, which holds your foot in place but traps everything inside until you shake it out - so they're not quite ideal for shower shoes, and they are terrible for sand. Best used for hanging around the pool, or something comfy to change into after taking off soccer or football spikes. These won't get all grungy from sweat or moisture or dirt.",

The most important feature is, \"I going to call in the inner sole\", it is padded, has enough support, and lastly I like the way my feet sit down in the sole. The foot has side that are built up like shoes, aids in keeping the shoe on, I am not having to curl my toes up or down in order to keep them on. They are very comfortable, I will be buying again, and I highly recommend them.",
