This is my second pair of these hooks. I use them alot, and over time, the velcro, due to overuse, can lose some of its holding power. I'm in Louisiana, so dust and humidity contributes to this. So, I just purchased this second pair. These, in my opinion, are the best on the market. When it comes to weightlifting gear, my automatic go-to is Grip Power Pad products. They are an amazing value and high quality.",

Enabled me to get through my entire routine with more weight - without pain or forearm cramping. Definitely worth the money.",
