She seems to think it's 100% better with a little extra effort we put in with the wet food, and her coat has gotten thicker, softer, and doesn't seem to shed as much. On top of that, she actually wags her tail for her food now! Is a little of this food doing all of these things? It could be a coincidence, but just in case it isn't, I'm sticking with this addition to her diet. For anyone that's curious, her dry kibble is Diamonds Natural all stages chicken and rice.",

I swear, some days my dogs food looks better than mine. This food is simple, inexpensive and rich in quality meats. Besides, it's easy to add some vegetables on top if you want your dogs to eat more superfoods.",
