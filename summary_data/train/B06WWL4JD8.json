      "text": "My kids love their mini polaroid cameras but do not buy one unless you are prepared to set up a chore list for them to earn their own film!! The film is SO expensive and with all the modern technology, I really had to help them understand that you cannot just snap 10 photos of the same scene to assure ONE good picture. Each picture is 75% to $1.00 so it taught them to really slow down when capturing moments. These cameras also don't take great photos unless the lighting is perfect. Not good if the sun is out and not good in darker rooms. Overall though, they've had fun with them.",

However I am giving it a 3 star because I had to fix the problem myself plus go through 2 sets of film. Hope this helps anyone with a similar problem",

Unfortunately this is the second camera I got, the first one was defective and I had to return it.

They develop quick and the camera itself is durable and chic. The only con is that im not sure if i can ever turn the flash off? but either way its still a good camera!",

Changing the image settings for more/less exposure sometimes just results in pure black pictures, even when you're following the recommendation. Maybe it would be cool for kids, if it actually worked, but out of the 20 pictures we took, 11 of them were completely black.",

Colour is adorable too! The plus is the mini mirror on the front, same loading etc like the mini 8. The only thing is that some of the mini 8 accessories don't work on the mini 9, the Lens for example - you can damage if forced the Lens from the mini 8 to go on - you see the shape of the Lens aren't the same - so be weary !",

We went through two packs of film ($20 worth) and discovered that only the first two prints were working, and the rest came out blurry and dark, no matter the lighting condition. I contacted Fujifilm support and they agreed that it was a defective camera, and that I could send it back but would need to pay for shipping and wait 3-4 weeks for a replacement. Completely unacceptable, especially since I'm already out for the wasted film! I will get my refund from Amazon and look for another instant camera.",

I switched the film over to my friends Instax mini 26 - the first print came out perfect. I can not seem to solve the issue, therefore I assume fault is within the manufacturing of this product.
