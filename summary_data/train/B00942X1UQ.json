If you typically ride in a region that is warmer in general (Lake Tahoe for example), you may want to consider a wax that works better in warmer temperatures when that time comes as this wax doesn't glide too well in springtime conditions.",

Is that a scientific review? Of course not but nobody actually provides those so at least I'm somewhat reviewing the actual performance ;-)",

Recently took two boards out: one I did with Purl and the other from a shop after a stone grind and another well known wax. The Purl board felt so much faster. Tag line should be \"Faster than you and other waxes.\" Like other Purl reviews, it does take a bit more muscle to scrape off, but I think it is well worth the effort.",

      "text": "Good wax. But hard to scrape off. Gave me a good shoulder and forearm workout. But the end result was great. My snowboard was a lot faster and was able to go through the flat spots at the resort with ease. No need to skate through them. temperature was at around 50-55 sunny day. This was used on a sintered base board so the wax should hold up for a few days for riding.",
