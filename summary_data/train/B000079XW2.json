      "text": "Bought for my wife. We used it for the first time tonight to open a large can of red enchilada sauce. Went around once and lid did not come off. Went around again and were able to force lid off with prying mechanism. Unfortunately, we saw that there were SMALL SLIVERS OF METAL all around the edges. I can only assume that some of the slivers also fell into the contents of the can. I see other users complained about metal slivers. I should have read previous reviews but I have ALWAYS been very happy with OXO products - NOT THIS ONE!!!!! They should remove this model from the market before the shards tear up someone's insides!!!!!!",

After a full rotation just remove the top cap. It cuts in such a way that top of the can becomes a cap. Brilliant design. Quality is also good (as you may expect from any OXO product ).

I had a decent can opener that cost more than $10 from the grocery store, but it began rusting and not rotating so matter how much I oiled and cleaned it. I'm actually glad that happened because it gave me an excuse to buy this. It is AMAZING. I actually thought it was broken the first time I used it because I didn't feel the pull or resistance I'd normally feel using my old can opener. It actually removes the entire top of the can rather than puncturing into the metal. It's genius. I'm being \"that person\" and recommending this to everyone I know.",
