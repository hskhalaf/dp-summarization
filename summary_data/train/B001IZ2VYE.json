This annoys me (just a little) because the seller's images show a rolled up bill. It's barely tall enough for a matchstick. The inner compartment is not as long as the bolt. Other than that, it's a cool little hiding place. You'd never know it was hollow when holding it; it has a nice weight and feel to it.",

Its not how I expected it to feel based on looks. Also the weight of it seems slightly unrealistic on the lighter side in my opinion. Returned it today but in general decent item.
