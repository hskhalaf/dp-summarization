Once assembled, it was slightly wobbly too. I paid $70.00 but I see it's about $50.00. Its worth $50.00 but not $70.00. Check out my pics.",

It also, arrived very quickly and was packaged really well to prevent damage. To note - the \"weathered white\" is more of a natural color, and less white than you'd imagined. I liked it that way, but keep that in mind if you're looking for something white!",

But i have to warn that the assembly of this table will require at least 2 people, or some sort of support in holding up the parts while you are assembling. Besides that, the table works as intended.",

That makes sense. You get stickers to put over the holes because they are very visible without the stickers. I don't think other people notice as much as I do. Overall happy with the purchase.

Where you screw the table legs on, the manufacturer gives you stickers (that look like fake wood) to put over the screw holes that are 2 inches wide! The stickers would not stick so I had to super glue them on. Once I did this the table looks much better, but I don't think I should have had to do this with a brand new table.",
