I make a lot of cookies and this is a serious flaw. I'll just keep on looking!",

The metal is also a smaller gauge than previously so the quality isn't as good. Now I'm looking for something else. This sucks.",

They do stack and they can take up less room on my counter top. I also bought them because they are similar to some my aunt has that I have used frequently in the past. These are not as sturdy or heavy duty as I would like. They are fine for cooling things in pans or trays, but the wire is spaced a little wide for cooling things like cookies.",

      "text": "This set of 3 stackable cooling racks seems to be well made, with one caveat. I was a little surprised that the legs don't lock into place (at least not that I can find), so you'll have to use both hands to hold the legs in place while sitting the cooling racks on the counter or stacking them onto each other. Otherwise they tend to collapse, potentially dumping your baked goods into the floor. The folding legs are nice when it comes to storing them, since they take up less space, but there really needs to be a way to lock them into place during use.",

There is plenty of circulation and they fold up nicely for compact storage! They also clean up very nicely!",

Secondly, this rack stacks which is convenient if you are limited on space. It would be nice if the racks would snap together somehow, but instead they simply rest on top of each other. Finally, the space between the racks when stacked easily accommodates cookies, muffins, and bunt cakes. If you are baking something that rises quite a bit, then you can simply unstack the racks to give yourself enough space.",
