Whether sitting on as a sofa or sleeping as a futon, this product is solid. Also looks very nice with the rest of my mid-century decor.",

Since it is over 30 days, I cannot return it. I bought this because it had good ratings. I'm not sure why. The piece looks nice but the mattress springs are uncomfortable. I'm going to have to pay money to either have it fixed or thrown away.",

The only two things I don't like is that it squeaks a little bit because the frame is metal (but this is minimal) and it's a almost impossible to move back to the sitting position without a second person. All in all, I'd recommend it though.",
