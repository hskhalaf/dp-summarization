The problem is both transmitter and receiver have to be plugged into the same circuit. So the transmitter is plugged into the router and an AC outlet. The receiver is plugged into an AC outlet on the other end of the house. It is very unusual for both AC outlets to be on the same circuit being that far away. I hope this helps.",

Took a bit to figure out how to install them, even with all his technical ability and experience, but once figured out they worked like a charm! These have eliminated a lot of frustration for me!

I incorporated these into a powerline network with a pair of TP-Link's AV2000 units, and the setup of a secure and stable network was fairly quick and straightforward using the app the company provides. Some functions, particularly Wi-Fi config, are easier and more functional using the web app, and some using the mobile one - but grab your phone and your computer based browser, and between the two you'll get it done.",
