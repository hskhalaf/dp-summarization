I was able to take shots over my head at times or over crowds! Also was able to take unusual angles! Also noted that the battery \"metering\"indicator show the drain/remaining charge, that it uses more battery with the tilting screen on.I carry an extra battery anyway. We took excellent images with this camera!",

The live view LCD has its own sensor, and you have to be careful not to judge the shot by what you see there. Battery life is great.

I give this camera 2 stars only for the good use I got from it while working, but this defect is not acceptable for a such expensive equipment...",

I have taken photos with the A350 using both the 18-70 (f3.5 to 5.6) Sony lens and the 75-300 (f4.5 to 5.6) telephoto Sony lens. I shot pictures of a tree a few hundred feet away. I am surprised that non-SLR cameras show the leaves clearly, while the leaves are very blurry in my A350 photos, even after image stabilization turned on. I tried various f-stops and shutter speeds yet the results are disappointing. Anybody notice this? Does this imply the lenses are not \"fast\" enough?",
