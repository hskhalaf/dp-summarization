The straps were fine, but the piece that connects the back of the mirror to the rotating ball just broke off! I had only adjusted it one time and it didn't seem stressed, but it just broke! I will NOT be purchasing another one.",

Installation process for the headrest/mirror base attachment is straightforward and simple with two cinch on straps. The only complaint is the swivel head for the mirror base is very difficult to maneuver which makes it hard to adjust to the proper angle for viewing, but it may decrease excessive movement of the mirror when the car is moving. Overall, little complaints at this time, and brought two mirrors since they are pretty cheap.",
