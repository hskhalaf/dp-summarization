I came from a Benq RL2455 so I'm spoiled with the 1ms response. The picture quality is not the best out there but perfect for competitive games. You need to make sacrifices in the picture quality for now to get that great response.",

I like the height adjustable stand and the swivel. The colors are also nice once you get the custom settings you desire. I like how they put the buttons on the front instead of the side, it makes it a lot easier to know which one you are pressing. This monitor also had a \"Color Vibrance\" setting which sort of adjusts the saturation, something that the RL2455 lacks, but it's a great feature.",

The back arm of the monitor is a great addition to prevent your headphones from being lost and from being fallen. Overall the picture quality and motion blur is top-notch!",

Colors are great, the picture is sharp, minimal light bleed from the edges, options are easy to find, the monitor build quality is excellent and the input lag is noticeably less. If your a serious/mid to high skill player this helps with finding people and more importantly getting first shot off which is of course a huge advantage in FPS shooters. my accuracy went up 10-15% consistently since I started using it.

But so far, it feels majestic on my desk. Huge screen that's great for work and for gaming. The speakers are rather low, but what else would you expect from monitor speakers? I use headphones and external speakers anyway. The colors are gorgeous. The screen is bright. The buttons for the menus, etc. are located right on the front for easy access. I'm very glad I got this monitor. It's great.",
