The others would generally start cracking on the vinyl or split at the seam up the back of the leg, if not just wear a hole in the sole in a few short months.

My 3.5 years old wears size c9 crocs and the little kids 10-11 fits him now and have some space to grow into. The design is simple which I like and the color blue is his favorite. These are a great option if you don\u2019t want to purchase very expensive rain boots for kids or those very childish ones",
