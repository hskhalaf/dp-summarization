I had no problem removing the mascara, because most of it had already come off. If you're looking for Water Resistant mascara, THIS ISN\"T IT!!! VERY DISAPPOINTED!!",

It won\u2019t give you the look of false eyelashes if that\u2019s what you want but definitely longer. Unfortunately after a month the mascara seems to be drying out is starting to look more clumpy.

It says on my lashes...which is where I want it. Update: Years later- still using this mascara. I used to get \"infected\" eyelashes- you know, when an eyelash gets really sore, and the only relief is to pull it out. I never get that with this mascara.",
