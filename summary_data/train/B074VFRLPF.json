Included a picture because nude colors tend to look a bit different on chocolate girls, so I wanted to give ya a gander at what this color looks like on this chocolate gal. :-)",

Not sure if that happens to everyone so plan accordingly when you\u2019re deciding what color to get. Nice applicator and can take used to using especially with Ruler is not very forgiving due to its darker rich color. Definitely nicer when kissing others so it doesn\u2019t get all over them compared to lipsticks. Photo is after wearing it all day without re applying. I applied Vaseline before applying.",

It\u2019s def long lasting bc I had to use oil to remove what was left of it, but it was so patchy and streaky and cracked and somehow still very tacky in spots that I couldn\u2019t wait to get it off. What\u2019s worse is that I too late I found out that it can\u2019t be returned or refunded even though it\u2019s sold and shipped by Amazon. $7 down the drain. I hope it\u2019s only this color or batch that is bad.",

Love the matte look. But smudges/wipes off. I almost end up applying, letting it be for a bit, then wiping off the smudgy part. Then it leaves a nice stained effect.

You might need a slight reapplication to patch a spot that wore away too much after a big lunch but it will definitely stand up to a few kisses and some drinks.
