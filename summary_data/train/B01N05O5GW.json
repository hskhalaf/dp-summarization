I tried a MR Coffee. 2 brand new ones lasted 3 weeks each then only would make 3 cups then quit. The bunn does not spill water when you fill it and will take it fast with no problems. It also fits in the corner very tight. Have a cup of coffee on me Have Good Day!",

Plus this is probably more energy efficient. I had this style of Bunn a few years ago and actually threw it away because it was super loud while brewing and woke me / my family up all the way from the kitchen when it started brewing. Fortunately, this one doesn't have that problem and is virtually silent when brewing which was a huge relief when I first used it. Great product, great coffee, quiet performance.",

Specifically, there is a chartreuse colored disc that spin-mounts to the water dispensary area below the filter basket, which becomes clogged (with minerals from the water?) at every brew. It requires a slight dismantling of the unit for rinsing before EVERY brew cycle. I have read that this is a known problem with this model & that there is a different (metal) substitute disc available for purchase through Bunn Parts Department, but I haven't pursued it, yet.",
