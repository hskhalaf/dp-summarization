It has a handy loop on top to accommodate a lock, but I don't really want to have to remember a combination or drag a key with me. This fingerprint lock actually works flawlessly. It locks and unlocks quick and is strong enough that no one could cut through it short of a severe effort. Very pleased to have stumbled upon this \u2013 super handy.",
