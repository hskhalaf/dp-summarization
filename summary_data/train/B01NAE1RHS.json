Its taste is palatable enough that she simply chews it several times a day, and loves the taste. It helps prevent dry, red eyes and soothes a sore throat. It has high omega 3s but also some omega 6 and 9 essential fatty acids. We've ordered this many times and it has worked well for us.",

It has been part of my daily routine to help strengthen my body, and really helps with my skin, nails and hair, which have been damaged by having to take methotrexate. I appreciate the way this Flaxseed Oil has been extracted and produced without any garbage added, especially keeping out the top food allergens. Thanks!",

      "text": "I took this due to reading rave reviews. I have had issues with joint and ligament problems due to years of CrossFit. Recently, I have had issue with scapula muscle issue and some more soft tissue injury targeting around the shoulders due to excessive overhead exercises. After taking for a week, I have already felt pain in my shoulders subside. Omega 3s are extremely important for health, however, getting the correct ratio to Omega 6 and Omega 9 for proper absorption of the Omega 3 is hard. Due to the Fukushima radiation issue, I have also steered away taking wild caught salmon. This is an excellent product with great benefits.",
