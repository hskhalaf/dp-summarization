They good for wearing with a pack as they do not interfere. The short strings that are used to connect the binoculars to the harness both broke as they are EXTREMLY cheap. They broke on the 3rd day of use about an hour apart. Discard these as soon as you open the box and use real paracord.",

    "title": "Bushnell BinoculAR Accessory 19125C Deluxe Bino HARness Black Clam",
    "description": "A carry solution of unparallelled comfort and performance. Our new deluxe bino harness keeps the weight off your neck and keeps your optics front and center no matter where the hunt takes you.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nTake the pressure off while wearing your binoculars with this Bushnell deluxe harness. Equipped with elastic straps, the harness positions your binocular, rangefinder, or light camera comfortably upon your chest even while riding a horse or engaging in another bouncy activity. As a result, you'll disperse the weight of your electronic device onto your shoulders and torso rather than restricting it to your neck, making it far more comfortable to hold for long periods. When perfectly positioned, your optics will rest just below your chin, so you can sight an object in an instant. \n\n This deluxe version of the Bushnell harness has a wide, perforated panel for your back, helping it support heavy binoculars with large, heavy objective lenses. \n\n About Bushnell\nBushnell has been the industry leader in high-performance sports optics for more than 50 years. The company's guiding principle is to provide the highest quality, most reliable, and most affordable sports optics products on the market. Bushnell product lines enhance the enjoyment of every outdoor pursuit, including nature study, hunting, fishing, birding, and stargazing. Indoors, the company's binoculars bring the audience closer to the action in fast-moving sports or the fine arts at theaters and concerts.",
