I strongly disagree, because if he did so he might be convicted for cruelty to animals. After opening one of the packages and being hit with the pungent awful smell, I immediately threw all packs in the garbage. I am a long-time Salmon lover, whether smoked or fresh. This product smelled like rotten tuna fish.",

Packaged in 3 individual foil pouches containing 8 oz. natural smoked sockeye, 8 oz. natural smoked pink and 6 oz. peppered sockeye for that extra zesty taste. Our products are Certified Kosher and have NO PRESERVATIVES. Each juicy fillet piece is rich in healthy omega 3 oils, making this one of the healthiest treats you can buy. Sealed in individual foil pouches and processed to guarantee that unforgettable fresh smoked salmon flavor, NO REFRIGERATION is required until you open the pouch. This product offers only the best. RECIPES INCLUDED! Check out the rest of our products here on Amazon! All of our products are smoked, cured and packaged in Bellingham, WA. Product package contains only the smoked seafood. Herbs, crackers, cheese, beverages and other display elements are for suggested use only and not included in shipment.",
