These require no batteries, and have a much better 'grip' on the cards during shuffle. The hand crank is plastic, so after the unit is assembled you won't want to take it apart, but you shouldn't have to. The battery type units have two steel pins that the push activator will push together, but the flow of power generates heat in the pins and they will slowly melt through the activation part. This action weakens the part to the point it can no longer make contact. Don't bother. Buy this hand crank version instead.",

So now I don't have to pass along my shuffling duties when it's my turn. Only drawback is the handle pin isn't long enough into the shaft so the handle pops out a lot when spinning it.",

Once you attach the crank handle to the shuffler, you cannot store the shuffler back in the box. It doesn\u2019t fit in the box with the handle. Granted I could probably take the handle on/off each time we want to use it, but I don\u2019t think it was designed for that purpose and I may end up breaking it.",
