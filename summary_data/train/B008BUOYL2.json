      "text": "This is a wonderful product to project from an IPAD or mac book onto the wall. It does a lovely job and is bright enough to show good images in a \"not very dark\" room. It is fairly small and easy to hook up to IPAD. So what is the downside? The instructions are not real clear on how to get it to display the IPAD pictures. Turns out you need to use the remote (not the buttons on the projector). If you use the remote then it is not hard to figure out. Great machine but a little improvement is needed for the instructions!",

I combined it with a Jawbone speaker, a small but sturdy tripod, and a USB thumb drive full of movies and I have a theater to go. I can't speak for other projectors... so do some homework for what you need, but I love it.",

      "text": "So, first of all... I was impressed when I got it. It is really light and small. I was worried about all the reviews that said it was loud and about the brightness. For multimedia is great, the problem is watching movies, and only in really clear conditions. At night, in home, it's really great. And the fan is not that loud. My 2010 Macbook Pro is much worse. However, it just stopped working after a few days, and I wasn't even using it that much. I am getting a system fan error. Apparently, it's not communicating with the projector. So I'm still thinking about what I should do. Maybe I'll just get a refund and buy another brand.",
