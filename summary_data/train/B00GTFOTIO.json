Total time about 15 min for complete assembly of both. 4 simple steps! & they look great, seem sturdy. Not real fancy leather. Fabric is matte, be prettier with a soft gloss, but for the price I\u2019m happy. Terrible shipping experience with fedex, but Amazon had great customer service & that helped. All in all I\u2019m happy for now. Hopefully they hold up.",

Having two chairs for $69 is not just a pretty good deal, it's a bargain. They are very easy to assemble, come nicely packaged and have good quality overall. We've been using them every day for two months already, and they are still represent a perfect addition to our apartment interior.",

Giving two stars for the price, since they neither wobble nor are too difficult to raise/lower. I'm additionally curious why it isn't possible to buy just one of these.",

Leaning back does not cause tilting, it's only when all your weight in shifted to the front when getting on or off. I'm trying to figure out how to prevent that, but I will not return these gorgeous barstools.",
