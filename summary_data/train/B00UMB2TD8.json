Also, the helmet is extremely warm, comfortable, and it looks good. I would definitely recommend this helmet.",

I looked at this ski helmet at various ski shops over my 25 days of pre-COVID skiing in 2020 across Montana, Alberta, BC & Idaho. Every ski shop raved about how nice they are. Fit runs smaller than indicated, I don't have an extra large head (unlike a current US Persident), but it still took a larger than measured helmit to fit comfortably. So beware that these may run small. Looking forward to having a chance to use it in winter 2020/21!",

Although thankfully I haven't had a chance to test how much force it can take I can defiantly say that the helmet is well built and looks very sleek. My helmet had MIPS (Not all colors have this) and you should ensure your helmet does too, this will ensure that you get protection against rotational concussions. Although an expensive helmet it is worth every penny.",

One use only (!) which is ridiculous. How would you know if you fell hard enough to ruin it?? Part of skiing/boarding is falling down so I would have needed 10 helmets for 5 days of skiing and this was NOT an inexpensive helmet. Do your homework before you buy.",
