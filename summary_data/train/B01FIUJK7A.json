      "text": "I got this for my girlfriend who can't swim very well for snorkeling in Hawaii. She tried to go out without it, but she panicked when water got in her goggles and I had to hold her and take her back in. With the vest on she was much more comfortable. She could adjust her googles or snorkel with the vest on and didn't panic with it on. The vest also made it easier for me to spot her as we browsed the reefs and got a little separated. It's much easier to pack than a life jacket and you can adjust the amount of air in it so you could have more or less buoyancy to your liking.",

He hated it because it's hard to tip forward to snorkel when most of the air is in the chest part of the vest. Since he's a decent swimmer, a pool noodle would have been a better snorkeling floater for him. I got a junior one for my 6-year-old, and she wore it. The crotch strap pulled up wedgie-style and it was hard for her to push forward over the air hump to get her face in the water, but once she was in position, it worked well. After a while, they get annoying around your neck.",
