Apple appears to have fixed the problem with OS 10.14.3 Mojave; after upgrading, I haven't experienced the hang, at least with HFS+ formatting.

Here are results of transfer: WD Elements HDD 1TB drive - 12 sec SanDisk Ultra USB thumb Drive - 29 sec Samsung 500 gb SDD - 9 sec An unknown 250GB SDD internal boot drive transfers same file to unknown 2TB internal HDD in about 1 second. So fast the transfer does not show on the screen. Hopefully the Samsung SDD's hold up. Have had a few other SDD's, 2 out of 4 were defective. I'd love to phase out the HDD if the SDD proves reliable. I have ancient HDD going back 15 years + that still work.",

It comes with a software you can install on your computer or phone which allows you to lock your files. Great functionality, portability, and comes with nice cables. The only thing I would change is the surface finish is a little rough, so when holding the device, it does not feel nice to the touch. Hopefully the t6 or t7 will eventually come out with a better surface finish. I can not imagine buying a storage device from anyone else after experiencing the performance of this product.",

I had a question about data transfer, and called support; the rep was very helpful and courteous. It's built solidly, the transfer is seamless and fast, and with SSD technology I expect it to last a LONG time. You get what you pay for, and I don't want to risk another data backup loss like I have in the past. I've been super happy with this product and would not hesitate to recommend it.",
