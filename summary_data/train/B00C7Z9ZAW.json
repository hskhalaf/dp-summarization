My vacuuming activity looks like this: 1. vacuum for a few mins 2. notice its spitting out more dirt than picking up 3. Stop vacuuming, take apart unclog 4. Vacuum up the dirt that came out with the clog 5. Repeat... Also, it's a battle of wits to get the wand to come apart from the body. It has a button release but then you have to grab the wand at the top and try to coax it out of the death grip of its cradle. Enough is enough. Even though I paid over $400 for this atrocious model, I'm chucking it out.",

However, I would not have paid top dollar for it which is $400+. To me, it cleans but it could be somewhat better for the price being charged. It's about two steps above the Bissell One-Pass I bought on Amazon for $69 during the holiday season as far as cleaning efficiency goes.
