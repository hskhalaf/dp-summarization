It\u2019s TB1 but that\u2019s really good enough for hard disks.

      "text": "This is a great external storage solution for the new (Late 2013) Apple Mac Pro. You get 2TB of storage via Thunderbolt that performs similarly to an SSD (over 350MB/s read/write) at a (current) price point that makes it good value. It sleeps automatically when the Mac Pro sleeps and wakes instantly with the Mac Pro. It's very quiet. In my office, I couldn't even hear it (with normal ambient noise) and in my quieter home office, it's only barely audible when idle but you can definitely hear the drive head chatter when it's working hard. It's the perfect compliment to the new Mac Pro if you need more storage than the internal SSD can accommodate.",

Set the drive to JBOD (Just a Bunch Of Disks) to use as two individual drives and select between HFS+J or ExFAT per disk. Ideal for running Windows OS on a Mac.\n\nDaisy chain more drives for more speed - The dual Thunderbolt ports allow you to daisy chain more drives for more speed and higher capacity. Connect a Thunderbolt display and other Thunderbolt-enabled peripherals to achieve maximum efficiency and productivity.\n\nHigh-speed multi-tasking - The revolutionary bi-directional Thunderbolt technology delivers unmatched speed for multi-tasking while video editing, 3D rendering and completing other graphics-intensive projects.\n\nUser-serviceable - Want to replace a drive?
