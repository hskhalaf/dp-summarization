I worried about snapping off a chunk. In all honesty that didn't happen except when I forgot to check the movable gripper on the back side. Yes.. each time you must check the hinged gripper to be sure it didn't rotate the other way or you WILL break a sheet. I would give this product 5 stars if it: a) had a larger gripping area (this might not be a concern with lighter panels). and b) didn't have a part that can rotate unnoticeably out of position.",

It's amazing how well it grips the sheets. Using it on full sheets of Baltic Birch ply is a little more difficult for me because of the 5' sheet size. I'm a little too short to lift the sheet with the Gorilla Gripper and carry the sheet comfortably. I guess I need longer legs for this. I have no problem when using it on the standard 4' X 8' sheets.",

Problem is, particle board is so stinkin' heavy that to try to lift it with one arm, in the position that the gorilla gripper requires, is just impossible for me.

The unique Gorilla Gripper grips from the top, making it easy to position, providing wonderful leverage, permitting a full field of vision while carrying, and encouraging proper lifting technique. It has a soft-cushioned handle that serves as a lever, using the weight of the panel to create clamping force. With non-marring rubberized gripping pads the gripping plates pivot to remain parallel, self-adjusting to the thickness of the material. An excellent solution for anyone having to move sheet goods, whether every day or once a year! Considering the importance of a well-preserved back, the Gorilla Gripper is likely to be the best investment a construction worker, woodworker or DIY\u2019er will ever make\u2026and less expensive than one visit to a Chiropractor!",
