Pro tip: if you live in an area with Darice/Pat Catan\u2019s or a similar discount craft store or frequent the Wish app, they sell the embossing folders and die cutters for CHEAP. I\u2019m talking $1-$2 each for embossing folders and $3-$5 per die cutting set. It has been such a money saver!",

I am not an accurate cutter, which is once reason I looked into a die cut machine. The Sizzix brand is economical and is able to use dies from other companies. Other die systems are not as versital. Yes, the dies are expensive, but if you watch Amazon, EBay, and Missouri Quilting Company you will find the best prices and even a sale now and again. Update My sizzix quit working after cutting just a few pieces of fabric :(",

      "text": "The embosser works fairly well, However, every times I use it, the screw on the crank comes loose a little at a time and eventually the screw pops out and the cap over the screw pops off as well. I then have to rescrew the screw and then replace the cap, so don't lose the allen wrench that comes with it. Also, when the cap pops off, it can be hard to find, so make sure you use it in an uncluttered area with light tile. I am worried that having to tighten the screw so many times, eventually the screw head will become stripped.",

You do have to hold down the pad sandwich while turning the crank handle, but it moves thru easily with the longer dies and a little harder with the smaller ones for some reason. The Sizzix line is more affordable than others and you can use other dies in this machine.",

    "description": "Color:White/GrayPresenting a brand new look for the Big Shot! With a sleek white and gray color scheme and the Sizzix logo embossed on the handle, this version of the Big Shot Machine offers plenty of stylish appeal with the same versatility of working with the entire Sizzix product library (with the exception of Big Plus and Big Pro dies) - including our smallest to our big 6\" wide plastic-backed dies and embossing tools. If that wasn't big enough, this portable roller machine cuts and embosses many different materials. Create your own one-of-a-kind cards, invitations, scrapbook pages, home decor, fashion, altered art, quilting and much more! (To ensure compatibility, always check machine and accessory requirements. Machine accessories may be sold separately.) Included with the Big Shot are a pair of Standard Cutting Pads and the adjustable Extended Multipurpose Platform, which makes all Sizzix components thinner than a Big Die compatible with the Big Shot Machine and even works with other brands' dies and embossing tools! The diagrams on the Extended Multipurpose Platform offer easy guidelines about how to make the perfect Sizzix sandwich. If you like the look instead, check out our classic Powder Blue & Teal model Big Shot machine. Measures approximately 14 1/4\" x 12 3/8\" x 6 5/8\" and features a 3-year limited warranty. Construction: Solid core steel rollers, anybody cast roller housing, solid steel gears, ABS plastic exterior. With the Sizzix Big Shot, the only limit is your own imagination - now that's a big deal, even for a Big Shot.",
