      "text": "I love this projector! I've used it extensively for PowerPoint presentations I give at many locations. I always bring my own projector with me because this one is often much better than whatever is available where I'm presenting. It is so bright than I can deal with much more ambient light than with other projectors. It's very easy to set up and it's certainly easy to use. The colors are very good and the images quite sharp and clear. I carefully researched projectors, and this one has been perfect for me.",

I appreciate its easy and intuitive buttons for adjusting the image so that it is square to the screen. The on and off times are much shorter than any other projector that I have experienced. I would highly recommend this projector.",

I'm no professional, but I have been very happy with just how strong, bright, and clear the images from this projector are. And the colors really pop while remaining true, to my eyes anyway, to the original source material. Factoring in a quite well-designed carrying bag and very easy setup and this turns out to be an excellent unit.",

The image is sharp and high quality, and alignment is easy. Even when the projector is set up at an angle, it is not difficult to get it to project a square image on the screen. It runs quietly and image adjustments are easy. It includes a way to attach it to a tripod on the base. The remote is easy to use and most functions can be controlled with it. This is my first digital projector - I am very pleased with it.",
