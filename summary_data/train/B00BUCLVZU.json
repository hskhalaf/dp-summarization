Don't forget to buy your own cable modem too since that will probably ave you a bundle after a year or so.",

Tivo has not only addressed all of those problems they have made it easy to use, you can view shows from multiple systems, the picture is great. If I still have any complaints about Tivo and the Mini, it is their set up process, it can be very frustrating. You have to basically set it up and leave it alone for one or two days to complete the configuration. The other concern I have with Tivo overall, their streaming off premise is unreliable and copying to a device like an iPad is also unreliable.",

I'm not sure why it took so long to activate or why the message didn't just tell me it wasn't activated. There was an option to \"Try again\" that seemed to just cycle through over and over. Once the device was activated, it was a snap, but it seems the instructions/on-screen info could have been a little more clear about waiting a few (5 in my case) hours.",

I have 2 Mini's connected using an existing MoCA network, 1 using Ethernet over Powerline and 1 using a wireless bridge. No issues on any of them. This has allowed me to return all of my cable companies boxes and save money. I highly recommend the Tivo Mini.",

They truly know what they are doing with their product and put out a much superior product. To those that are worried about the cost. In the end you will actually save money by going to this superior product. I do not regret buying this product especially during this promotion that doesn't charge me an extra fee for each mini I have. I started off with one extra mini and will definitely be buying 2 more before the promotion ends.",

The only thing that I don't like is the setup. Once it is setup it works wonderfully and reliably. The setup is problematic, requiring the main Tivo and the Minis to call in to Tivo online multiple times. This is nowhere in the setup instructions, and even after multiple call ins the Mini still needs time to......setup?.....I guess? One tip I can give is to assign the mini to a static IP address within your network. It helps with the reliability of the system tremendously.",

Operation is fairly simply although it occasionally freezes, then resets itself in the middle of a program for no apparent reason. Wish it could work over our WiFi network rather than having to be hardwired to the network. Although I see room for improvement, I would buy it again.",

      "text": "I like the TiVo Mini, but it has a few annoying quirks compared to using a real TiVo. For example, if you have a buffer and hit record, it won't include your buffer and will start recording separately from the point at which you hit record. And you can't cycle through the other TiVo inputs. But for use on an auxiliary TV (e.g. Bedroom) it's great to have all your shows in one place and have a cheap way to access them from another TV. We have FiOS, so the MOCA networking worked right out of the box, and has generally worked very well. The lag between making a selection and having it play is minimal.",

I was able to eliminate 1 switch and have only had one momentary signal drop during the past few weeks. Overall, very satisfied with this purchase.",
