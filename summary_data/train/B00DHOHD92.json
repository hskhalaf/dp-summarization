The basic construction is nice, but i can see some rough areas that weren't shaved out of the cup areas, for example my ozara (large cup) had lines that weren't smoothed out. So i can see why these kendama's are slightly cheaper then the ones from Japan. But don't let that deter you, overall they work, and this one looks better then most out there for this price, so 4 stars. Knocked off 1 star just because i think just a little more work in the sanding process and these would be pretty good.",

They are more challenging than the old ball on a string toys of yore. They may be a little too challenging for five and six year olds who may get discouraged before they start having fun with it.
