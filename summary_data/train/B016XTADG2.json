There seems exactly one sweet spot where the cord and the speaker connect and will actually charge. It can take a very long time to find the sweet spot. Then, it will only hold the sweet spot for a few seconds unless, by some miracle, the forces of the universe align and it will actually charge as it is supposed it. Additionally, this problem seems to be getting worse. Thankfully it lasts a long time on a single charge so I don't have to deal with this too frequently.",

This does not happen with any other Bluetooth speakers I've used, nor with the laptops internal speakers. Further, the popping sound persists even when the Mac's audio is muted, so it is originating from the speaker itself. This sound is very annoying, and is the sole reason for the 2-star review.",

While it worked amazingly throughout the time I was able to use it, I am severely disappointed by the misleading warranty, which is stated on the product details to be covered by Anker. Despite this seemingly admirable 18 month warranty, it is instead covered by the third party vendor, Ultimate Electronics, whose warranty does not extend the 18 months which Anker advertises to their products. Thus, I am left with a brick of a speaker which no longer powers on, and did not serve me even a year of regular usage. Severely disappointed.",

The sound quality is great considering the price. Knocked off a star only due to heavy base when playing fairly loud, and obviously you can't control those functions.

However, this product is performing exactly how I want, and where I want. The battery life is exceeding my expectations but it is new so we\u2019ll have to wait for a few cycles to see how it sustains that performance. This speaker delivers full clear sound, across the entire spectrum. Last year, I purchased the amazon basics model that is similar to this one by Anker, and they are virtually identical to each other in looks and performance. For the price point you\u2019ll be hard pressed to find a better bt sound solution in the same form factor.",

Also, music from my tablet sounds just right on this speaker for my taste. The mid-range is excellent and there is enough bass to enjoy most genres. If you want a lot of bass, you probably should look into the much more expensive choices.",
