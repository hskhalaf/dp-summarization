I did have some snagging issues getting on and off of a roof due to the grippy asphalt, but nothing worth giving up the suit. I am an average size female (5\u20196\u201d 140 lbs) and I ordered a medium. It fits perfect. Tips: Keep the suit tucked into your boots! (I had a couple of ladies join me in my veil after climbing up the suit leg). Gently rinse suit in bathtub after each use. Be extremely gentle with the veil.",

Had to return it twice for proper size and probably could have used the smallest even then, but got tired of returning it.",

I wish I had bought it years ago. It\u2019s pricey but I sew so I know how much time and expertise was required to make it. The fit is a bit odd. The torso is long. I am 5\u20191\u201d and 110lbs and an XS fits (the S was huge on me), I wish the legs were a couple inches longer- not a big deal though, I wear thick socks to protect my ankles just in case the suit pulls up.",

I had a 4xl suit from another company so read the suit sizing carefully - they lay the suit down on the floor for measurements not your measurements! Wish it had thumb guides to hold the sleeves in place. ( I plan on putting my own in place.)",

The gloves I just ordered from another company is another horror story, but this suit is worth every penny.",

    "title": "Ultra Breeze Large Beekeeping Suit with Veil, 1-Unit, White",
    "description": "Size:LaregeBee Protected and Bee Cool with the Ultra Breeze Beekeeping Suits and Jackets. The Ultra Breeze is made of three layers of ventilated mesh fabric. The depth of the layers provides outstanding protection against stings while keeping you cool. Other single layer suits trap your body heat and are uncomfortably hot. Single layer suits have a thin barrier against stings, especially when wet from sweat. With the Ultra Breeze, beekeeping is a pleasure not a chore. Easy on and easy off \u2013 the Ultra Breeze has 2-way YKK brass zippers on the jacket and suits (up the entire length of the leg), multiple pockets, and a roomy detachable hood designed to keep the veil off your face. Made in America using high quality durable materials and excellent workmanship, the Ultra Breeze is the World-feet s Best Bee Suit. Sized to fit comfortably, our suits and jackets are machine washable; the hood is hand washable. Sizing is men-feet s sizing, so women will wear smaller sizes than usual. When selecting a suit, the most important measurement is from the back of the neck (at your shoulders) to the inseam of the pants. The approximate measurements are: X Small (34-inch neck-inseam, 5-feet tall, 100-pound), Small (37-inch neck-inseam, 5-feet 5-inch tall, 130-pound), Medium (37-inch neck- inseam, 5-feet 8-inch tall, 160-pound), Large (38-inch neck-inseam, 6-feet + tall, 210-pound), X Large (40-inch neck-inseam, 6-feet + tall, 260-pound) and XX Large (41-inch neck- inseam, 6-feet +, 290+ -pound.). If you fall between sizes, it is best select the larger size to allow for bending and stretching as you work with your bees.",
