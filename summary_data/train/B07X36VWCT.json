Night vision is not very good on Arlo. Batteries are pitiful and require backup sets charging constantly and camera access where you can change batteries frequently. (Frequent being every couple of days- at most! If they are not on at night or continuously) Camera system far more expensive than my nest cams. Didn't want Nest because of subscription cost, but that has now been adjusted to being reasonable. Arlo Cams are highly over-rated and expensive, but the battery idea is awesome and is really what I wanted.",

They hold a charge well, although will probably have to recharge them every 3 months or so. I've considered hooking them up to cables, but didn't have a problem finding spots that are easy enough to reach for that not to be necessary. There was a little learning curve to setting the cameras up right. It's good to use the setup assistant to define the area you want to cover and to play around with the sensitivity setting to get to a balance that triggers the right amount of notifications.",

Sure, with Arlo 3 camera and compatible SmartHub you can record at $0.00 costs. That\u2019s customer value. But only one account can view the video library. Therefore, your spouse or children, even if youngest library access, cannot view recorded video. You will have to pay an additional ~$120 year for everyone else in the family to have access to the library video. Sadly, the technical capability exists for Arlo to allow customers the ability for all family members to view local storage.
