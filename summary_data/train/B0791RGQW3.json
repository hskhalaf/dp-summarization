Plex won't work, says looking for server all the time so you don't get anywhere with it. Amazon music steams quite well but not every title is the original recording, some are from live performances, I guess copyright issues? You have to register for iPlayer, and most free apps which is a chore. Streaming quality on some is poor, Sky News for example is grainy. My verdict in another 5 years Amazon will have probably perfected these devices to perfection, it's called technical evolution!",

Apparently you could adjust the picture size on older Firesticks. but Amazon would probably prefer you to buy a new TV - not good for the pocket or the environment",

Connected simpy enough to our Powerline internet extender, which was only 3 feet away from the televison with Firestick in full line-of-sight. After only a few days of using the device, the BBC iPlayer app and the ITB Hub app would start to \"freeze\" for no reason. I have tried unplugging the Firestick on numerous occasions (which 7/10 times resolves the issue) but it is becoming increasingly common, and also very irritating, as it involves getting up and resetting everything about 3/4 times an hour. Not a great product, probably why it got superceded?",
