So now it's like one big pocket and stuff in the front pocket spills into the back pocket. Did I just happen to get one with a seam that wasn't done right? Or is this a problem everyone is having? I'm bummed to say the least. :-(",

I have no issues myself. I just leave it clasped and don it by putting my arms up from the bottom and then thru the arm/shoulder straps. I do a lot of bench work with very sharp edged tools. Sometimes they slip..the apron stops them without a second thought. I don't really have any down sides.",

I simply unstitched the apron strings on the front and reattached using snaps that can break away in case of entrapment. I also cut the length off the tie back and added snaps there too to minimize catching on anything from behind. The apron is now exactly right for me and will last for years!",

I'm 5'9\" and this is the perfect size for me. Something as small as a loop to hang it up when not using it is a simple easy thing that is a nice feature. I would definitely recommend this as purchase.",

I almost bought a fabric one from Duluth Trading Co. but some folks complained that it was too thin and didn't fit well on a larger person. I then came across this one and found that it was plenty heavy, hung off the shoulders instead of around the neck and had many pockets and a pouch. The leather ones barely offered a pencil holder. This apron is great. My only wish would be that they offered it in a brown color but it's so dirty already you can hardly tell.",

      "text": "I wear this apron in the machine shop, and it has pockets for everything. I keep the tools I'm using in the lower pockets, a micrometer in the front lower pocket, pencils and the ever-useful six-inch scale. The key feature of this apron is that the weight is on your shoulders and not the neck. A few hours of working with a cheaper neck-style apron will make it abundantly clear why this is the better style. The material is quite thick, and I wouldn't have minded it being a little thinner, but it was intended for workmen with heavy duty tools in mind.",

I didn\u2019t take care of it as I should and recently had to soak it in warm water with some Dr Bronner\u2019s soap and let it air dry- it\u2019s as good as new and now I am more careful about keeping sourdough starter and flour brushed off- when that stuff gets wet, it just becomes glue!
