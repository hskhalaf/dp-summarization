It also has a semigloss/matte finish that I prefer. My main comment has to do with their marketing... The best I can tell, the same product is marketed for various applications. I have read that the Marine protectant is the same 303 I have been using as their Automotive product. No big deal once understood, but confusing to the average consumer in the process. PROS Easy application Protects vinyl, rubber, leather Minimal out-gassing Matte finish CONS Confusing marketing plan",

And made my car plastic parts look like new. Here in Arizona we have a lot of wear on rubber and plastics parts due to amount of sunny days. This sure helps...

Sprayed on the 303 and immediately wiped down with a microfiber cloth. It\u2019s easier if you spray it on more liberally than the label suggests, but the textured surface of the bed liner will shred the microfiber cloth if you don\u2019t.",

It's hard to tell when a product actually works, but all I can say is my sailboat's eisenglass is about 5 years old now and still looks brand new. I've never covered the eisenglass and only take it down during hurricanes, but it goes right back up afterwards. I've used the 303 protectant since the eisenglass was new. I've seen other eisenglass yellow after 2-3 years in the Florida sun when the owner has used nothing, but I am proud to say mine looks fantastic. I also use the 303 on my motorcycle seats, since they see a lot of sun as well. Great product that I highly recommend!",

But, I assure you, it is very different: 1. When directions are followed, there is no greasy feel to this product. 2. It makes tires, vinyl etc look NEW, NOT shiny and wet. I hate the used car dealer look of armor-all shine on tires. This leaves a nice satin finish. 3. This lasts a LONG time. Some of the tires I have treated still repel dirt and water after 6 months. Every armor-all treatment I have ever tried tends to wash off in the first real rain storm.",

So far so good and if it protectect from the UV rays, then it will be all I hoped for.
