      "text": "Purchased 18x38. Everything arrived quickly and correctly. You need a 3/4 concrete drill bit, recommend buying 2 or more bits, depending on how hard/old your concrete is! Also a slightly wider concrete bit is recommended to flair tops of holes to countersink flush the anchors. A hammer drill is a must and 3+ hours of work. Unless you have help! I used a little marine grade calk adhesive in each hole and silicone spray on screw threads. Extremely happy with results! Can\u2019t rate durability since it hasn\u2019t lived through a Michigan winter yet! If you\u2019re somewhat handy, this is definitely a do it yourself project worth the savings of 3rd party installers.",

I highly recommend using a hammer drill with three-quarter inch concrete bit when installing the anchors. Otherwise, it would take all day To drill through hard concrete or stone.",
