      "text": "I received this bike in June of 2017. Its a great ebike and the price was good. I have been using it reliably for 5 months now. I had conversations with the manufacturer several times and he was great. You will not go wrong with this bike. Speed is good (reasonable for my 11 year old son) 20mph. Acceleration is fast. Battery lasts a long time. Use pedal assist or throttle alone. Everything you could want.",

      "text": "Love it, so fun. This bike will go about 18 - 19mph on flat ground with thumb throttle only I weight 200 lbs. The pedal assist is easy to use and adjust depending on your riding environment. When pedaling on flat it is relatively easy to hit 25mph (top speed the assets cuts out at 25mph) on the top pedal assist. Without any electric motor the bike still works well. I have taken it mountain biking and works great off road. I took a 30 mile road trip on flat ground most of the time on high pedal assist and I used up about 1/2 of the battery. Easy to put together. Highly recommend. 500W is plenty powerful.",

After speaking with the costomer service who suggested that we remove and re-insert all the little connections (there were multiple up front) the error never went away. I assume that the computer went bad just like that. I did like the style and had hoped for a better experience. Packing the bike in the original carton was not the easiest task to undertake. If you do purchase this bike keep the carton and packing materials as you may need them to send it back as well. I was excited and could not wait for this to come in but immediately let down. :(",

I have clocked near a hundred total miles and the battery is still on 5 bars. It gives the boost needed for steep hills and whenever you just need a little break. The quality of the components is superior and equal or better to bikes costing a $1000 more. It was easy to put together although the instructions a little vague in some areas. I have been recommending it to my friends and family.",

I'm five eight and I had to modify my seat pan and cut out an inch of the seat post down tube in order to have rider safety for this bike. And at 57 lbs with the battery --this bicycle is heavy --so you need a tow hitch type bike carrier to transport the bike to mountain trails. Or have a truck with at least a five foot bed. Good quality bike though-- and easy assembly Thanks",
