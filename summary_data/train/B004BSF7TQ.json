The drawers are very roomy but they aren't on rollers (which is fine for me, but may effect others purchasing it).

Mine came in undamaged but it does have its flaw. Some wood abnormality and the crystal knob has an extra plastic that sticks out that is sharp. The cabinets are deep enough to put in your hairdryer.

It's beautiful, classy, and the perfect size! I ordered it on a Monday evening and it was delivered Wednesday afternoon (standard shipping) WOW- that's just unheard of! It was packaged well, and ridiculously easy to put together. I have it all set up now and can't wait to go shopping to find a lamp and knicks knacks for the top. You will NOT be disappointed if you buy this table!",

Made as cheap as possible doubt it will last more than a few years. Glass has no bevel and you can see the glue on the edges. The paper thin felt is peeling on the inside, once again just shipped that way. It looks nice from 10ft away. Should have cost $50- $60 not $160. Im guessing they will all be the same if I try and get another one. Amazon needs to have a better quality control on what vendors it uses!",

I also noticed after putting the legs on that one of the legs doesn't sit even with the rest of them. Other than that it's a great vanity. Similar to the one at pier 1 at half the price",

Ordered my table a few days ago, and came quickly a few days later. Very fast shipping. My table was package very well. No dings, scratches or missing pieces. Took 15 minutes to put it together. Now, there was a strong paint odor upon opening the box and assembling it. But the scent lasted maybe a couple of hours and was gone. I will be using this table as my new makeup vanity.",
