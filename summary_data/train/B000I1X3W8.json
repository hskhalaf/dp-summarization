Although the weight adds to the camera and with battery pack brings it up to the weight of a full frame Canon, it is considerably lighter than the Canon 70d without the same add-ons, i.e., battery pack, and lens. Very impressive lens for such a compact size with the features I was looking for. Plus the USM is very quiet. I already love this lens. More to follow after photo journey use.",

This lens is a bit heavy, at just under 2lbs. Another thing I like about the lens is that the length of the lens does not extend when zooming in, everything is done internally. When taking close-up or macro shots you have to be about 4 feet away or lens will not focus.",

The fact this one also has IS really makes it worth going for. if you do a lot of hand held zoom shots, sometimes in medium to low light, the IS is a near must, especially with an F4. This one has it all and well worth the high price paid..",

For day time indoors or out, it does what a canon 70-200mm L F4 is expected of.

Focus is incredibly sharp compared to my previous telephoto experiences. Even with the IS I prefer to use a monopod because I feel like the camera is moving with that lens hanging out front.

    "description": "Style:Lens OnlyCanon's EF 70-200mm f/4L IS USM is a lightweight, compact L Series telephoto zoom lens with Image Stabilizer. The optical Image Stabilization in the new EF 70-200mm f/4L IS USM lens provides up to an incredible four stops of shake correction-a first for Canon IS lenses. The use of fluorite UD lens elements provides excellent optical performance in terms of resolution and contrast. These features, together with its water-and dust-proof construction, provide both the performance and portability to meet user demands.What\u2019s in the box: Canon EF 70-200mm f/4L IS USM Lens, E-67U 67mm Snap-On Lens Cap, Lens Dust Cap E (Rear), ET-74 Lens Hood, LP1224 Lens Case and 1-Year Warranty.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nCapture the far-off action of fast-paced sports or zoom in for an intimate portrait with the Canon EF 70-200mm telephoto zoom lens. The L-series lens offers an Image Stabilizer that provides up to four stops of shake correction--a first for Canon IS lenses. The use of fluorite UD lens elements, meanwhile, produces an excellent optical performance in terms of resolution and contrast. Add in a sturdy housing with water- and dust-proof construction and you have a lens that's both portable and high performing. Other details include an f/4 maximum aperture, a ring-type ultra-sonic monitor (USM) that enables quick and quiet autofocusing, compatibility with circular polarizing filters, and a lightweight body. The lens carries a one-year warranty.\n\n\n\n * Focal length: 70-200mm \n * Maximum aperture: f/4 \n * Lens construction: 20 elements in 15 groups \n * Diagonal angle of view: 34 to 12 degrees (with full-frame cameras) \n * Focus adjustment: AF with full-time manual focus \n * Closest focusing distance: 3.94 feet \n * Zoom system: 7-group helical zoom (72-degree rotational angle) \n * Filter size: 67mm \n * Dimensions: 3 inches in diameter, 6.8 inches long \n * Weight: 26.8 ounces \n\nHigh-performance, L-series telephoto zoom lens combining light weight and compactness with an f4 maximum aperture. Inner focusing and the ring USM enable quick and quiet autofocusing. Also, a circular polarizing filter can be attached and used without difficulty because the front lens element does not rotate during focusing. The tripod collar (sold separately) is the same one used with the EF 300mm f4L USM.",
