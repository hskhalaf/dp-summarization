It's not as popular as IOS or Android, but it works great. I love that it syncs right up with MS Outlook and/or windows computers without having to go through some corky iTunes or Google program. I've tried many phones of all types, and this one has a beautiful screen, fast speeds, good reception, and sound quality, and it seems to be really durable.",

For the firat time I see a product that had not just tech put in it, but it was carefully crafted and also very well designed. It is not perfect yet! as technology has it limitations still. The Nokia Apps gives some edge to it, and i am in love with it... Can't stop exploring... Nokia has given WP a bit of more salt. If you are not yet a WP person, just try this beauty and you will see...",
