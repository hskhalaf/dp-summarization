The only reason I would not give this 5 stars is because it does take a little bit to dry so it's tacky for short while, but other than that, it is perfect! It is like I am wearing false lashes it makes mine so long and thick. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!",

My lashes look fuller, longer, and it really lasts all day. Only be careful when you apply it cause the product will smudge easily until it dries completely. Will keep on using this hope it doesnt ever get discontinued, top of tops 11/10.",
