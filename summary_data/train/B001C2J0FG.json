However, I'm rating it 4 stars vs 5 because unlike my old one, it doesn't have a built in timer where it stops automatically when the set cook time is complete. It's the same hassle as my gas oven. Yes it beeps, but unless you're right there to physically stop the cooking, the convection microwave oven continues cooking, risking over-cooking food. Yes I can set cooking times but it doesn't stop once the time runs out. It keeps cooking. Bummer.",

Cooking time on the item was only 12 so the \"speed\" factor for convection cooking went out the window.

It beeps when it gets up to temp (finally no lie after 45 minutes) then you open it up and put your food in and it just never gets back up to temp while cooking, total fail! Fine for 350 degree cooking but that's about it!!! Stay away! I should of listened to the reviews!!!",

I thought it would be super to have these added features, and still think so, but not if the microwaving doesn't work right.",

Cuisinart would send a replacement but I had to pay to ship. I didn't have the original box either. Apparently this is not a common problem because the Cuisinart service center had never heard of it. I called a repair shop and he said it sounded like the board had failed and that a repair could cost $300 or more. Looks like others have had better luck but I won't buy another expensive microwave after this experience.",

We chose this one because of the brand name and it was within our budget. Unfortunately, the whole family has been disappointed in its performance; taking twice as long to bake something and it might still not be done. We won't buy another from Cuisinart.",
