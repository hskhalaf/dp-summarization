      "text": "These are great ramps - especially for the price. They weigh only 19 pounds each and fold to only 46\" so they fit easily in the bed or cab of any truck. I used them for loading and unloading my Honda CRF450R, and Suzuki DR650. The ramps handled both bikes with ease. I bought 2 so I can walk up one while rolling the bike up the other. The flat plate design is much safer and easier to walk on than crossbars. It provides excellent traction for tires and shoes. The ramp being arched along with the flat plate design results in smooth loading and less effort needed to push the bike up the ramp.",

What I've noticed. The welds are clean and strong and there doesn't seem to be any bowing when loading a 275 pound bike. The way they built the hinge has one section sitting on a big piece of aluminum. I don't think it will ever bend the wrong way when loading. -This was my major concern when purchasing.",

Arched for maximum clearance, this plate-style dirt bike ramp features a heavy-duty hinge system that allows the ramp to be folded in half for compact storage and transportability. A high-traction surface with raised ribs provides excellent grip in any weather condition, making the loading process as safe as possible. This ramp is held in place by a set of rubber-coated fingers that grip the tailgate without scratching and an included adjustable safety strap.\n\nWe recommend always working with at least two people when using single-runner ramps for loading. These aluminum motocross ramps are not intended for riding your bike up because they are not wide enough to put your feet down when loading and unloading.",
