My 28 year old tried hers today to see if hers worked as she goes to work in early a.m. when dark and the same. Sad if they would have needed them. Poor product. When I asked Amazon if they'd replace, answer was no....gave me $4 credit.",

Unfortunately, less than a week later when I needed it to frighten a bear in our yard, the sound was weak and nowhere near as loud.",
