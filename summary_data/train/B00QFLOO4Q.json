The materials, balance and feel of the clubs are not quite the same as high-end clubs, but they are very decent and the price for the entire set is less than I've paid for single clubs. After watching her hit them a couple of times at the range I would recommend them over buying an older, used set or some of the other beginner sets I looked at for her.",

I am 5'5 and the regular length fits perfectly. 8/20/2018 update: still love my clubs but after playing several games, now I am looking for a few more clubs to add: 3 wood and Approach wedge or pitching wedge.",
