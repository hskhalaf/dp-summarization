      "title": "Very Good Video Editing Software from Cyberlink.",
      "text": "I have been using Cyberlink products for around three years now, and bought this recent edition to continue my hobby of Photos and Videos DVDs. So far, so good, the software is working well, hardly any crashes or stuttering. Easy access to the website as well for updates and downloads of extras such as titles, effects etc. I already had Director 15 but did not delete this programme from Hard Drive, instead have both programmes running together although not using them both at the same time of course! Very good value too for what you get. Worth a try.",

      "text": "I've only been using this for a couple of weeks and I'm really only using the basic editing to allow me to post JPEG-4 on-line and sending short videos via WhatsApp. Being a bit of a novice I have found Cyberlink Power Director 16 very easy to learn the basics and getting good results. I will spend more time learning with some tips I've found on YouTube before playing with all the many extras that come with it. So far I'm very happy with my purchase.",

      "text": "Had an old Serif movie editing software, but with the purchase of a drone, thought I'd update to something newer. Really disappointed with how laggy this is on my machine, which isn't old. Only trying to work on the very simplest of editing jobs, just cropping clips and adjusting speed perhaps. Nothing fancy. Stalls while working on clips, preview is choppy and every now and again it corrupts a clip and loses your editing efforts. Not recommended.",

Every time I start it running, within a couple of minutes I get a BSOD (Blue Screen Of Death). I've passed my returns window, so I am feeling robbed to be honest.",

No response from their customer support after 48 hours hence I have uninstalled it and sent back for a refund. Will go back to using the basic software that came with my camcorder that never suffered from these problems",
