Suggestion for the manufacturer: It could use a variety of leash lengths. Maybe offer a short length? Or make the current leash adjustable. Also, would love a hand leash option for when I need to unhook the dog from the waist pack. It might make the leash a little more versatile. I get that it's a \"hands free leash,\" but sometimes we need to use a hands-on leash. It would be nice to have the option.",

I run with our dog sometimes and used to use a very short leash for this but have found this so much more comfortable. Highly recommend for convenience and some better control especially for a dog under 40 lbs",

The leash, however, is really heavy, even for my 2 bigger dogs (75lbs and 45lbs) and my little guy got confused by the D ring-I think he didn't know what to do without me holding the leash lol. My work-arounds are to attach the split leash to one D ring with a carabiner and walk my little dog normally. Now everyone is happy!",

One feature that would make this great leash even better - a handle in the middle of the leash. There is one at each end, but neither of these are truly useful. A handle in the middle would be easier and faster to grab if you need to rein the dog in.",

Also, the bungee isn't too forgiving. if you're dog pulls to go after a squirrel, you may throw your back out if you're not prepared.

      "text": "So, I initially enjoyed it for how long it lasted; love the bungee concept. There are several things I'd change though; one is adjust the traffic handle to be higher up and easier to grasp. Not so easy to grasp, esp when line is fully extended, and you need quick hold of your dog. Love the free D ring on the belt, BUT the belt buckle could be some sort of metal because it is easy for a dog like my frenchie to easily chew and destroy the plastic buckle.",
