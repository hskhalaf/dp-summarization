      "text": "I'm a big fan of the long-running Merrell Chameleon stetch shoes, the combo of hiking tread and ninja sock-like fit is awesome. The upper on these Salewa's promised to take this a step further by combining S's great fit technology with a completely dirt-blocking collar, but frustratingly they suck to get on and off. Just really miserable considering that the Merrell's are almost slip-ons. Something like a velcro'd gusset is desperately needed. Unfortunately I was so excited by the tread behavior that I wore them and can't return them now. I also wish they were all-synthetic like my older Firetails- these would make great jungle boots if only they were rot-proof. Really sad about that part.",

I love the style, breathability, lacing down to the toe, velcro sole system with extra soles included, the behind the heel lace system, and the really awesome elastic top that keeps out dirt, rocks, and sand. Super comfortable too. They're amazing for hiking and outdoors but I also wear mine daily. These and another pair of Salewas are all I wear now. Took sometime to come from the Netherlands but worth the wait.",

With that said, like others have said, you absolutely SHOULD buy one size larger than your running shoe. They are slightly difficult to out in, but to me, that's great because they feel really solid when they're on. These are worth every penny.",

When I kept reading about it I got worried that I wouldn't like them, they'd be uncomfortable or incredibly hard to take off. None. Of. That. Je-Sus! Some of you love to whine about ANYTHING...The boots fit like a glove, it wasn't hard to take off or put on and they felt broken in from the beginning...Even had some room to put a hardcore work insert and they feel like heaven. With the warranty I feel quite happy that they'll be worth the price and put up with the abuse. Are there better boots? Probably but will they also be about $100-$200 dollars more? Yes.",
