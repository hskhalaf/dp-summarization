Tip: break out the metal retainer on the lower 'standing vertical' section to fit any size bottle like the larger Champagne bottles. Question: Mine smells of production plastic when I open it. I've soaped it clean. I've not seen any leftover shipping materials or plastic over the light bulbs that I imagine would produce that smell. Does anyone else have this problem or more importantly a solution for me? I would buy another one if I could solve this problem. Thanks in advance.",

My reason for writing this review is to report that the product is incredibly RELIABLE. It has never given me one problem of any kind, keeps my red wine at a perfect 56 degrees, has an almost inaudible fan, and makes an attractive addition to my liquor cabinet. I'm not making any of this up. It's a wonderful product. Should it die at this point, which I certainly don't expect, I'll promptly order another one. I am really impressed.",

The only time the light turned on without pressing multiple buttons was if you unplugged and reinplugged it. I\u2019ve had it for 4 years and still put ice in my wine when I pull these bottles out.

If you\u2019re not planning on storing only champagne you can use the top rack for the larger bottles and leave the other rack in for regular size bottles.

This fridge is great to keep the wines below room temp so in case of company I can just throw the bubbly in the big fridge to cool all the way down for drinking.

Tried switching on and off like other users described, but no luck. I'll probably try cracking open the back and fixing it like other reviewers did. Seems like the quality control Avanti uses (at least for this model) is pretty poor with how much variability people are getting in lifetime. Not a good deal in a wine fridge for such a short life span.",

Not a big thing as we rarely turn on the light anyway. Overall a nice unit for the price.",

      "text": "So far so good! My first wine fridge took a s*** after 5 months so after some research I replaced it with this one. I've had it about a month and it is working great! Only complaint I would have is that it cannot cool less than about 25 degrees below the room temperature so when we get 80 plus degree days and I don't want to turn the air on I have warmer wine than I would like. I'm still very happy with it for now.",

Good luck you might get a good one maybe a bad one?",
