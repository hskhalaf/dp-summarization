I haven't been able to go out with them yet as the weather decided to flip and start snowing in march but i hope to get out and fully utilize them soon!

I'm planing on air bushing the bellies close to the top color (or adjacent to the top) to make them different. Plastics is very soft, so hook set shouldn't be much of an issue and some slight modifications to widen the hooks outwards will benefit the hookup ratio.",

If you have never used frog lures before, I would suggest you get some. You can cast right into a patch of weeds, and reel right out of them due to the weedless nature of frog design, which also means you will get lots of strikes, so be patient and give the fish 2-3 seconds to get it in their mouth before you set the hook.",
