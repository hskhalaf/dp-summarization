Called goal zero didn't really get any help from them tested both air pumps that I have only pulled 4 amps and 3 amps should have worked but didn't. So called amazon to resolve issue they went above and beyond to help me. So the two stars are for goal zero and would give five stars to amazon.",

I used it to power a laptop computer and a clock drive for an astronomy rig. I never ran out of power. The only improvement I can see to this would be if, instead of a rigid photovoltaic, GoalZero added an option for either a rollshade unit. PowerFilm Solar now offers a foldable unit that ships with the Yeti 150, but their rollshade will stow more easily.",

Customer Service is GREAT, Notified me before original ship date that the product was going to be delayed due to upgrades on the device to make the battery last longer. Didn't mind the delay, because they actually took the time to contact me to let me know, and was very responsive and kept me informed of the progress.",
