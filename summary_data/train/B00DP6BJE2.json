Out of five, two had the fan die, one had the glass crack and eventually break, and two are still working. I'll say all of this is only after heavy use, but the two still in service were bought earlier than the ones that broke. Take it for what it's worth, I still prefer nuwave over other induction hot plates.",

I keep this cooktop as a back up for when I run out of canned butane that fuels my camping stove (single gas burner).

Since i live in southern florida, i don't like to heat up the kitchen and this is great since it doesn't use heating coils and only heats the cookware. The only drawback is you need to make sure that the cookware has to be induction ready. I take a magnet with me when i shop at bargain stores and if the magnet sticks it will work on the induction cooktop. And all cast iron works well, so if you like cast iron and know how to care for it, it is a great backup",

    "title": "NuWave Precision Induction Cooktop 1300 Watts",
    "description": "The NuWave Precision Induction Cooktop (PIC) offers precise temperature control, adjustable in 10-degree increments. With a minimum temperature setting of 100 Fahrenheit and an upper limit of 575 Fahrenheit (Sear), the PIC offers a wider temperature range than competitor models. This permits the appliance to act as more than just a cooktop. The NuWave PIC does the thinking for you. It offers state-of-the art programming technology with 100 hours of memory that allow you to prepare complex recipes with ease.. A delay function allows you to initiate cooking when it's most convenient for you, including an automatic shutoff function when cooking time is completed. The NuWave PIC was engineered with a circular design scheme, doing away with excess space that serves no cooking function. The PIC's round design also echoes the traditional feel of an intimate gathering place like the kitchen or dining room table. Mealtime is about community and the PIC was designed with that idea in mind. Despite its portability and compact size, the NuWave PIC offers a large cooking area, measuring 9 inches in diameter. In this case, bigger is better, with the PIC allowing for greater diversity in cooking vessels and portion sizes. The product also comes with unrivaled customer support and value-added resources such as lifetime membership to the online Precision Cooking Club. This invaluable tool features recipes, tips and tricks from the NuWave Culinary Team, designed to help you make the most of the PIC cooking experience. Pan is not included",

      "The NuWave PIC is equipped with programmable stage cooking functionality with up to 100 hours of program memory and performance.",
