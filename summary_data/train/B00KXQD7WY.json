It took about 10 minutes to update software but at no point was I lost in the process. I purchased 4x2.5\" WD 1TB Red Drives to pop in and they were already configured for SHR-1 (which is what I was planning on using anyways). I love the small size and the 2.5\" drives since they take up so much less space. Highly recommended.",

I have not seen my electricity bill increase in the slightest since I installed it. I believe this NAS is rated between 11-15 W of power draw; not bad...",

Within the Synology line, consider this unit is for its small size and cuteness. It uses laptop drives (or, preferably WD red 2.5\" drives). This makes it very compact and a bit quieter than units using 3.5\" drives. Each drive fits into a caddy on the back of the unit. The caddies are not screw-less as you might expect, but plenty of screws are included and installation is easy.",

Cons: Sata II, slow raid procedures timings like checking parity and syncing, only 512 ram (but for now, seems it is not a problem really).",

I subsequently ordered another, larger, and more powerful unit to run a number of software services on it. (Look out DVD's, VHS tapes, and audio disks. You are going in a box in the attic as soon as I can get you ripped onto this device.)",
