I took a shower after my workout and having cleaned the house all day, scrubbed my face with my normals face wash and the rolled my face with the derma roller. After I applied my moisturizer with spf and my face feels amazing!! Normally I have to reapply after I\u2019ve gotten dressed and then again later on because my skin is so dry. I\u2019ve applied once and my skin still feels great! I would highly recommend this to my friends.",

      "text": "First time purchasing a derma roller and I am satisfied with this. It makes sense that rolling this on your skin will allow the fantastic frankincense oil and other costly serums to sink more deeply into skin thereby enhancing the rejuvenating effects of those products. I admit, I was a tiny bit scared it would hurt but it does not. It's invigorating. I do not press hard and recommend you do the same. The needles are very small and fine. About the same size as acupuncture needles. I always wanted an accupuncture facial but they are rather costly. I feel this gives the same results. Pretty handle that feels good to hold, it's well made.",

      "text": "The packaging took quite a lot of effort to get into and I had to take scissors to the plastic container because the product wouldn't fit through the opening. The instructions on the box suggest that you shouldn't use more than the indicated time but there are no instructions as to how to use this product or how long the indicated time should be. It says not to reuse the head but then it says to always keep it clean. Very ambiguous and highly lacking instructional materials. Wish I had bought from a different company.",

The metal plate stuck right on the back of the case. This is hands down the best phone holder I have use and I have used many of them. It is simple, practical and it works. The design of the holder is attractive and low profile --you can hardly tell is even there. My issue with the other phone holders is that they are big, cumbersome, and distracting when attached to the windshield This phone holder addresses and solves all those problems. I highly recommend this product.",

Although this is only 0.25 mm, which is super short, it actually feels far more intense than a 540 needle version thats twice as long. This maybe because it has far less needles, hence, the pressure applied in over fewer needles, and deeper depth reached. Also these are sharper. My face is red right now! from 0.25mm. very happy with this. Buying longer versions of the 192 for my hair now.",
