      "text": "My husband bought a pair of these a couple years ago (red and black polarized) and he LOVED them! Unfortunately his car was stolen recently and the glasses were in them. He liked them so much that he bought the same pair again, this time in blue and they're still just as great as before. This is a nice departure from Oakley's usual look. These are very understated but cool and my husband has a wide head and is sensitive to sunglasses pinching his noggin. These don't pinch at all and he says they're super comfortable. I think they look great and they're is favorite sunglasses. Worth the price to get a really good pair.",

It said made in China, had no markings of Oakley on it what's so ever and it was cheap plastic! I WAS PISSED!!!",

When buying these sunglasses i would never buy from any seller other than Amazon because i simply do not trust other sellers because of past issues of not being \"Authentic\". This is a big deal to me cheap lenses give me enormous headaches and I drive alot in my line of work...these Polarized sunglasses take away most of the road glare and make a bright day very easy on your eyes...also I love the Holbrook style it fits my face well. 5 stars!!!!!",

Thought I order a pair of glossy black frame, green mirrored lensed glasses. But not only did I not get that, I got a pair of glasses that looked nothing like any of the pictures. The style and lenses are nothing alike, the lenses aren\u2019t even green (which is the main reason I wanted the glasses). Luckily they\u2019re still Oakley\u2019s and fit nice on my face so I\u2019ll keep them since I only paid $90 for them. To be honest, if my girlfriend didn\u2019t like the glasses I would return them hahaha",

While taking them off and on all the bright areas around me are darkened and colors seem to pop!! It\u2019s pretty remarkable. I tried to show thru my phone camera what I mean. It\u2019s so cool to see the asphalt darkened but the greens of grass still. I LOVE these!!",

    "description": "Oakley Holbrook sunglasses is a timeless, classic design fused with modern Oakley technology. Inspired by the screen heroes from the 1940s, 50s, and 60s, the Oakley Holbrook design epitomizes the spirit of exploration and adventure. The iconic American frame design is accented by metal rivets and Oakley icons, perfect for those who seek equal parts performance and style. Each pair of Holbrook sunglasses sport Oakley's famous Plutonite lenses that block 100% of all UVA, UVB, UVC and harmful blue light up to 400mm as well as a three-point fit system designed for comfort and everyday wear.\n\nOakley was created for world-class athletes, those who see the limits of possibility as just another challenge. Their dedication drives the brand to look beyond the conventional ideas of industry standards. It's in Oakley's DNA to identify problems, create inventions, and wrap those inventions in art. And simply to make things better than anyone thought possible. Decades of Oakley innovation have been awarded more than 540 patents that elevate physics to the level of art. Technologies transcend sports to enhance the lives of consumers, and more than 110 countries now enjoy a full array of market-leading products including premium sunglasses, goggles, prescription eyewear, apparel, footwear and accessories. These products represent Oakley's commitment to excellence - a passion that redefines what is possible for those who defy their own limits.",
