This thing is heavy duty and is sewn such that if I were to take a fall, there is redundancy in the fabric so it would lessen the force as my fall was broken. I thankfully haven't had a chance to \"test\" it out, but the build quality is superb. A Must for anyone working at heights. The hooks themselves are secure, but easy to clip onto surfaces/harness. They have a simple design, which is great if you are working with thick gloves, or like to minimize the time you are not clipped into an anchor point.",

I used the harness and the rope to get me safety secured on the roof and then used the bucket to hoist my tools up. Then when I was done, packed it all back away in the bucket with top. This way, it should all be there next time I need it. If it was stored separate, I would probably misplace something. Just a great idea!",

This connects to a harness, not a climbing belt. This is one part of a layer of safety devices providing Personal Fall Arrest. Inspect before use. Use properly. This appears a bit heavy, however, as you climb- the weight of the rebar hooks are on the tower.",
