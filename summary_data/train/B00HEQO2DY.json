Great support (firm) with contoured edges and it has a smooth top so dust doesn't stick which allows for easy cleaning (but a little less traction than others that are rubberized). There is a slight texture with it's \"weave\" pattern which makes it not boring. Super happy with this mat. My only regret is I didn't buy the longer one!!",

In our medical practice, there is alot of us that are now using stand up desks and I have had to order quite a few of anti fatigue mats, but this one is by far the best! After 10 to 12 hours of standing, my feet, knees and back are all in a great place. Keep up the good quality Sky Mat team, you are making the world a much more cushiony place to be!",
