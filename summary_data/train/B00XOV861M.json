      "text": "This grill was awesome for about a month. I have owned it for little over a year or more. After a month or so the hinge stopped working right so it left a gap in between the top and bottom. I contacted warranty and got another hinge to be sent. The hinge literally took almost a year to get to me. It was never in stock then had to be shipped from the manufacturer but it took over a year! That was with multiple emails a month. Well I just installed the new hinge and approximately one month later it develops the same gap in the lid \ud83d\ude02. What a joke. I wouldnt recommend any pit boss stuff.",

Amazingly it was delivered not broken, although as rough as the delivery company was, I was shocked. Silent Laborers came and assembled it (they are the best!), and the grill is stunning. My husband loves it, and all the features. He is used to egg cooking, so he plans to fire it up this weekend. Update: My husband has used this grill countless times, as we grill/smoke often. He says it has even temperature control, holds a steady temp for a long, long time. He LOVES it! It smokes flawlessly. I could not be happier!",

I put a gasket around the back side of the sliding vent door and gasket around the inside sealing edge to the daisy wheel vent and solved the problem. I have recommended this Kamado to relatives and have complete confidence that they will love one if they make the purchase. The only bad thing for me is the price dropped $70 right after I bought it...",

It's easily solved with a bit of hammering ... just to make the vent fit up against the grill more. Works great for doing lots of burgers and dogs. Works awesome with my dutch oven. Smoking with it is pretty easy, too, once you get the low temp figured out.",

The base is high quality and easy to assemble, and the grill itself has a good finish and sturdy construction.

The brackets are of poor quality metal, they do not readily fit as intended, and one marked LB was rusty and instantly cracked and broke as I tried to mount it. Photo included. Assuming Amazon or the manufacturer chooses to provide replacement brackets for mounting the side tables, I will upgrade my rating to 4 stars to recognize good customer service.",

With that being said, my 7 pound brisket was cooked in 8 hours and it is by far the best brisket I have ever cooked. Only complaint is the design of lower door.

I also replaced the thermometer, as coming from a Weber Smokey Mountain Cooker, that was often a weak point in another great cooking system.
