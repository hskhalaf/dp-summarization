Just two things to keep in mind: 1) Doing overhead lifts is potentially dangerous as the metal bar ends could hit your head if you're tired. These aren't as safe to thrust above your head as the rubber-coated hex dumbbells, for example. 2) Each central bar + pair of spinlock collars comes to about 1.5kg each, so factor that in when picking weights.

A bit more than I was intending to spend, but on offer at \u00a334.99. What can I say? They're dumbbells! One slight disappointment is that the spinlock collars aren't metal, but grey plastic. They don't really spin as nicely as the metal ones, and on reflection I should have bought the boxed version of these, complete with metal collars and a carry case, for \u00a35 more. I probably wouldn't pay any more for these, but at the price they're great value despite losing one star for the plastic collars.",
