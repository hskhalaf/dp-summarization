Just like some of the other reviews pictures in low lighting are grainy sometimes even with the flash and the flash does take a minute to reset. This camera also does NOT have a manual view-finder; only the LCD screen. My older Kodak also had a lens shroud to use in bright outdoor lighting and this one does not have one nor does it allow my older one to attach to this model. All in all, very happy. Just what I expected and wanted. A high megapixel camera on the cheap.",

Even on sports or children modes it took forever for it to process after a picture was taken, therefore making it take forever before the next picture could be taken. For the pictures I take, I want to be able to take pictures closer together than what this allowed. As for quality of pictures, don't know, haven't had any printed yet.",
