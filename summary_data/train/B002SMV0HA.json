This was purchased to exclusively be used under and around the table. The floor is sheet laminate. It picks up about 60% of food on the ground, but skips over most things smaller than a cheerio. Crumbs? Forgetaboutit. Under cabinets? No way. Corners? Just pushes the food into the corner, and then you can't reach it. I had high hopes, but this thing did not live up to my expectations.",

I have to run over the same spots repeatedly just to pick up the easiest particles. I can come in with my cheaper sweepers and they pick it right up.

It is not perfect suction device but it gets the job done. It is handy to have. It is not as lightweight as I would like but I didn't look at that when I bought it. It feels sturdy. It is not to completely replace a dust mop or vacuum but is great so you don't feel like a slob during the week. And I repeat, it gets the job done.",

I would definitely recommend this product... especially for someone like me, who prefer not to use the vacuum because it is heavy and noisy.",
