      "text": "I can't get a spare B016 replacement soldering iron anywhere for the 9378 station. Aoyue doesn't allow USA residents to order parts from them directly and I've had an order placed with Aoyue's only USA authorized distributor \"SRA Soldering Products in Walpole MA\" since October 2016 and SRA can't get them from Aoyue. SRA was also back ordered on the B016 ceramic heating element I ordered and it took Aoyue 8 weeks to ship enough elements for SRA to fill my order. I don't recommend the Aoyue 9378 based on my experience not being able to buy spare parts. I won't recommend any company that doesn't support their customer base or their one USA based distributor.",

The holder is convenient and sturdy. The only downside I found that was when trying to solder thicker wire, say 12 gauge, it does not provide quite enough heat. It looks to be a soldering iron for 14 gauge wire and smaller. My old soldering gun (Weller, I think), when it works, easily supplies enough heat for 12 gauge wire, but it is not nearly as precise as this unit. I would certainly recommend this product for 14, 16, 18 or smaller gauge wire soldering.",

Bonus points for being able to switch over to C or F temperature scales - saves time doing the conversion. Also - the wide variety of included tips came as a great benefit from someone just getting underway with soldering more than the occasional wire (mainly Pinball/PCB repair) My only knock would be that the quick set temperature values aren't as intuitive or easy to use as one would hope, but again this is minor and should in no way detract anyone from buying this unit.",

My cons: I don't like the iron/pencil (whatever you want to call it). It doesn't feel as thin as it could be. The wire isn't as flexible as I would like. The iron holder isn't the best but isn't the worst. It's a pretty good value but I would buy another Weller if I were forced to use this. If I could find a better feeling iron with a more flexible cord it would get a lot more use.",

Now the the tip never gets up to temp even though the Aoyue reports no errors. (Note: over 5yrs my Aoyue has only been on about 30hrs.)",

Also, unlike my previous iron that took 10 minutes to come to temperature, this iron is ready in about 10 seconds! Everything about this makes me happy, including the price.
