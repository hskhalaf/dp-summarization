How dangerous it could be should it drop while cooking?! We've used a pressure cooker of another brand in the past 5 years, no problem at all. So am really disappointed with Instant Pot!!! Before writing this review, I also noticed other reviewers mention the various problems of the valve (either missing or pouring out), can someone from the Instant Pot company explain why is there such a safety issue?

The problem is that it really doesn't do that, generally speaking. Yes, you can cook chicken, etc. very quickly.

We are a busy family and as a full time working mom, the Instant Pot allows me to easily make delicious, quick and healthy dinners for my family.",

      "text": "I really love this item. This is the best instant pot I have ever had in my life. I changed my diet to a vegetarian-based diet and this pot helps me a lot with the grains. Rice is my favorite. It takes only a few minutes to cook. Lentils my second favourite takes less than 15 min to cook it fully. The only drawback was the slow cooker mode. When I use it, it does not cook the beans fully over 12hr. Definitely, if you are looking for a slow cooker this is not the one!",

For example-cooking a butternut squash is 7 minutes, but that isn\u2019t counting a few minutes to build up the heat/steam in the chamber, and the time after to release the steam from the chamber. So, it ends up being like 10 minutes or so, not just the 7 minutes of pressure cooking time. Other than that, enjoy! ;)",
