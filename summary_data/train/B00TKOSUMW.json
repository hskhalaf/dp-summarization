      "text": "You wouldn't think a power light would be a big deal. I sure didn't. However, after owning this player for 7 months, I've decided the lack of a power light is a HUGE MONUMENTAL mistake. If you have a cabling issue (i.e. HDMI cable unplugged, power cable unplugged, or just a bad HDMI cable), then you have no way of telling if the unit is on or not without ejecting the disc. This makes troubleshooting a big pain. Playback is great. Menu system is fair. I have had no issues with this player. I would not buy this unit again due to the lack of a power light.",

So many times I try to turn it on and nothing happens and you have no idea if it's on or not because there are no indicator lights whatsoever on this item. I will replace it as soon as possible.

Although it works fine and includes simple, Wi-Fi connectivity to the streaming services I regularly use (NetFlix and Amazon Prime), I have given the unit 4 rather than 5 stars because the remote doesn't have an option to load and eject a DVD. Instead, one has to depress a button on the front of the unit. But the device is so light, that you have to hold it with one hand while depressing the eject button with the other. This is extraordinarily inconvenient if the device is located underneath a large screen TV, and close to the floor.",

We have only used the Blu-ray function so far; we haven't played a DVD or used the streaming function yet. I did connect it to a wired Ethernet outlet and updated the firmware. So far it works perfectly. One nice feature is that its remote also controls a Samsung TV, including changing the source, without fiddling with codes. Now we can watch a movie and control both the player and TV with one remote. Picture quality is excellent.",
