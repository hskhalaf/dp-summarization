The pods are constructed from a thin layer of aluminum that doesn't always retain its original shape while under pressure, which will cause your espresso machine to let grounds leak through to the cup. It's highly frustrating given their expensive nature in the first place. The only reason I noticed is because 3/5 of the pods do not have this issue whereas two of them do.

I think that seller, who is I believe Nespresso itself, should mention the defect in the product description. These are probably defects that they do not want to sell in their boutiques, and in that case, they should give a better discount rather than selling them for same price as the regular non-defected ones.",
