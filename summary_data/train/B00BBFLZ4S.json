    "title": "Samsung WB800F 16.3MP CMOS Smart WiFi Digital Camera with 21x Optical Zoom, 3.0\" Touch Screen LCD and 1080p HD Video (Black)",
    "description": "The Samsung WB800F Smart Camera is packed with an arsenal of Samsung's technologies so you can take shots in a variety of situations. A 16.3-megapixel backside-illuminated sensor gives you incredible clarity and detail even in low-light situations, and built-in Wi-Fi means you'll be able to share your images quickly and easily.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nThe Samsung WB800F Smart Camera is packed with an arsenal of Samsung's technologies so you can take shots in a variety of situations. A 16.3-megapixel backside-illuminated sensor gives you incredible clarity and detail even in low-light situations, and built-in Wi-Fi means you'll be able to share your images quickly and easily.\n\nThe 16.3-megapixel BSI sensor is optimal for low-light performance. View larger.\n\nA brilliant 3-inch touch display features easy navigation. View larger.\n\n16.3-MEGAPIXEL BACKSIDE-ILLUMINATED CMOS SENSOR\nThe WB800F is equipped with a 16.3-megapixel backside-illuminated (BSI) CMOS sensor that needs less light for proper exposure and quicker focus than conventional sensors. This allows you to take properly exposed shots in low-light situations. With the Low Light Shot feature, the camera will automatically merge three continuous shots into one clear, bright photo with little blur and noise, whether you took it candlelight, moonlight, or practically no light at all.\n\nTELEPHOTO LENS WITH 21X ZOOM CAPABILITY\nThe WB800F has a 21x zoom lens that gives you a large range to work with, letting you easily frame the shot you want. The lens starts at a wide 35mm-equivalent focal length of 23mm and zooms in to 483mm for close-ups. The sharp lens combined with the high-resolution sensor means you'll have crisp shots you can use to make large prints.\n\nHYBRID TOUCH DISPLAY GIVES YOU OPTIONS\nSamsung equipped the WB800F with a brilliant, 3-inch display that lets you compose and review your photos comfortably and accurately. The display has hybrid user interface that lets you use either the five-way button for menu navigation if you prefer traditional controls or your fingers if you prefer touch controls. Either way, the intuitive navigation makes setting controls and sharing images a snap.\n\nFULL HD VIDEO RECORDING\nThe WB800F lets you take incredible 1,080p full HD videos in addition to photos. The camera shoots video in the H.264 format, which allows you to record for longer than cameras using MJPEG video.\n\nWI-FI CONNECTIVITY FOR EASY SHARING AND FACEBOOK UPLOAD\nThanks to built-in Wi-Fi, transferring your images and sharing them no longer requires memory cards or cables. You won't have to worry about running out of space, either.\n\nWith the dedicated Direct Link hot key, you can quickly connect to Wi-Fi networks. Once connected, you can save photos and videos directly to a computer or cloud service as you shoot. Print photos wirelessly or share them with your friends instantly by uploading them straight to Facebook or YouTube. With dual band Wi-Fi support, you'll have faster and more stable connections to the wireless networks around you.\n\nCONNECT TO YOUR SMARTPHONE FOR MORE FEATURES\nThe WB800F works with Samsung's Smart Camera App (for iPhone and Android), which lets you instantly pair your camera with your smartphone and gives you features such as AutoShare and Remote ViewFinder.\n\nWhen AutoShare is activated, all the pictures you take on your camera are automatically sent to your smartphone. Remote ViewFinder turns your phone into a viewfinder and lets you preview images, adjust camera settings, frame the scene, and tag the shot location from up to 30 feet away. When you need to take a group shot with yourself in it, Remote ViewFinder makes it easy.\n\nCLOUD SERVICE BACKUP WITH MICROSOFT SKYDRIVE\nNever worry about losing your photos, even if your camera is lost or stolen. If your camera is connected to Wi-Fi, the WB800F will copy the images you take to a Microsoft SkyDrive account. This feature not only automatically backs up all your photos, but also lets you easily make more room on your memory card by deleting shots without fear you'll lose them.\n\nSMART MODE FOR SPECIAL EFFECTS\nTap the smart mode button to take advantage of numerous special shoot modes. Action Freeze mode lets you capture a high-speed scene, such as in sports, while Fireworks mode is perfect for the Fourth of July. Use Light Trace mode to capture perfect trails of light at night on a busy intersection full of red taillights.\n\nPRODUCT DIMENSIONS AND WEIGHT\nThe WB800F measures 2.56 by 4.35 by 0.85 inches (H x W x D) and weighs 0.48 pounds.\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\nWB800F Smart Camera, Li-Ion battery (SLB-10A), USB charging cable, wrist strap, start-up guide, and warranty card.\n\nWB800 SMART CAMERA\nCOBALT BLACK\nAT A GLANCE:\n * 16.3-megapixel BSI sensor for optimal low-light performance\n * 21x zoom lens provides versatile range\n * 3-inch hybrid touch display with easy navigation\n * Built-in Wi-Fi for easy sharing and data transfers\n * Captures Full HD Video\n\nSelect your shooting mode with the rotator dial.
