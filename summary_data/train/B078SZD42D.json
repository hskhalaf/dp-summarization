      "verdict": "With its comfortable confines and grippy outsole, those who are seeking for a new pair of hiking shoes may be enticed to check the X Ultra 3 LTR GTX out. Its low weight and zero break-in period are the extra treats to future owners. However, with its narrow fit and flimsy lace, it may cause potential buyers to take a step back. All in all, this Salomon offering remains likable.",

        "Most of the male users complimented the sticky outsole of the Salomon men\u2019s X Ultra 3 LTR GTX",
        "The true-to-size fit of this Salomon hiking shoe earned approval from a lot of online buyers",
        "Some wearers were stoked with its lightness"

      "cons": [
        "A couple of those who bought the X Ultra 3 LTR GTX disliked its restrictive width",
