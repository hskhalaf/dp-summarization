We ended up adding a cheap slip n slide and other tarps to the ends to make it 3 times the length and admittedly the kids loved it. So, now I feel compelled to buy at least one more wow slide to add to the first to save us some effort. But I\u2019m not thrilled about spending over $300 on them and I\u2019m not sure they are worth it. I guess I\u2019m just a sucker for my kid!!",

I gave it a two as we didn't try for too long as my kids got bored and cold. So I will edit my review if things somehow get better with one more try. If it ends up not being any better, we are returning it! Now we just need a warm day to give it another shot....",
