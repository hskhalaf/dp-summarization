Zed is on the larger size (90lbs) and we've observed that if a dog bed doesn't support him well he'll migrate elsewhere (like the couch!). As much as I enjoy my 90lb lap-dog, it's nice to finally find a bed that's Zed approved - the memory foam really seems to do the trick.",

For dogs who like to prop their heads on a cushion as mine does this has a raised cushion around three sides, a dog sofa. Ruby just snuggles into her bed - so comfy looking I almost feel like snuggling in beside her. But seriously - terrific product, highly recommend.",

I have no idea how, but it was raining for the past 2 days.

This bed provides great support for his large body type and head rest, he sleeps peacefully in this bed for hours at a time. I purchased the Medium size bed and it is big enough for him. The support provided in the mattress foam pad it great. This is our second bed of this same brand/make, the first one lasted for three years and was handed down to my cousins dog who is still happily using it and now they have matching beds which makes them happy cousin dogs.",

Our dogs love to pick up dog beds by their teeth and throw them around the room. Not this one! The way the corners curve and how the edges are set up, our dogs are not able to pick it up with their teeth. I would HIGHLY recommend this bed to anyone looking for something durable. Pros: Darker colors available Durable Easy to clean Dogs love it Long lasting Cons: Dirt can get stuck underneath the side padding",

If you have a slobbery dog, you might want to get a lighter color than I did. His slobber stains cover the whole thing after 1 day. A lighter color would hide that. I got a size large, but a medium probably would have worked for us. It was larger than expected.",
