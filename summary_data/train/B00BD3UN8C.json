They want THAT water, nothing near their food. We got this bc it's the most attractive (white ceramic vs green plastic) and largest of the fountains we could find. And the dog uses it too.",

Use the clear, extra wide Breathe Right nasal strips ( and stick one on either side right under the overflow streams.

      "text": "I have six cats. We had purchased another brand and it stopped working within three months. This one is a little more expensive but so worth it. Our cats love it! There are two good size streams of water on either side and they like drinking from both. The fact that this fountain is ceramic makes it much nicer looking than others and the best part is it cannot be easily knocked over or damaged. It is very well made and very easy to put together.
