The only thing that could improve is the swab to have a line attached to pull through the horn. It has a nice finish and lots of engraving on the bell area. He seems to be able to play it smoothly. We did switch out the mouthpiece and ligature from his old horn to this one, as they were better quality than the one that came with this horn.",

It comes with a transportation case and all accessories you need to play. Overall the quality is great and I am very pleased with the sounds I get. I am using Rico plasticover reeds and the sound is great. I recommend to buy a cleaning kit to keep that sax in a great shape. Jean Paul USA has a great customer service.

Upon inspection a week later and the zipper to where the backpack style straps is starting to fray. This hasn't not even been transported to school yet. So 4 stars for the saxophone and hopefully we can find a better quality case to protect our investment. Changed to 5 stars after the superb customer service received for the case. Truly can't ask for a better saxophone amazing quality and worth every $$$$",
