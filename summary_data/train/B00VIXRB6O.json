The bin is large enough that we don't have to fill it often--we do check though if we're leaving the house for more than a day. Customer service?

      "text": "Pretty decent autofeeder. It frees my time to feed my baby by myself. Initially, I chose the default cat feeding option, which will deliver two portions of 1/4 cup each at 8am and 5pm. My little senior cat just complained the little food given. I tried not to interfere and gave it a try for two days. Now my baby just get used to it and will not eat them all at once. One thing I don't like is that I have to re-calibrate the machine each time I add more food in the container. Also, to me it's not that intuitive to operate. Now I just need to find another water feeder.",

      "text": "This is a great device that takes a large bag of cat food. I feed my cat roughly 4 times daily, totaling 1 cup of dry food, and this has never missed a beat for 8 months. It has both AC adapter and ability to run off of D-batteries. I keep it plugged in, and have the D batteries installed in case the power goes out. Overall a great product, that's very programmable, and comes highly recommended.",

Takes a little bit of time to figure out programming, but it does give an accurate 1/8 cup as smallest, which we were finding other feeders dispensed far more generously.",
