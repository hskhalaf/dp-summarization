Go inside to charge it, wait till it's at %100 and turn it on to a distorted screen... Tried hard resetting it to another distorted screen. Now everything I had on that phone is gone. Biggest disappointment EVER, do not buy this phone.... do not waste your money.",

    "title": "Essential Phone in Halo Gray \u2013 128 GB Unlocked Titanium and Ceramic phone with Edge-to-Edge Display",
    "description": "Founded by the creator of Android, the Essential Phone has all the features you care about most without a bunch of gimmicks. A large, edge-to-edge display, 128GB of storage, all-day battery life, fast charging, and more. It's sophisticated. It's simple. And it's yours.\n\nPorts - 60GHz Wireless, SuperSpeed USB 2x accessory power pins\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\n\n\nMore screen, less phone The biggest screen-to-body ratio of any phone! With a stunning 5.71-inch edge-to-edge Quad HD Display, you get a large screen in a phone that still fits comfortably in one hand. So you can enjoy more of what\u2019s on your screen without all those intrusive bezels. \n\nBeauty meets brawn Crafted with space-age strength, titanium, ceramic, and Gorilla Glass 5. Its space-age strength helps withstand your day-to-day. And there's no branding or logos anywhere on the device. So your phone is more of an expression of who you are\u2014because it\u2019s yours. \n\n\n\n\nFor every adventure With a 13MP Dual-Camera and Portrait Mode, your pictures look great. And the Essential 360 Camera is big enough to easily capture everything around you in 4K \u2014 but small enough to fit in your pocket. So it can take it with you everywhere.\n\nStore more, worry less PH-1 comes with a whopping 128GB of storage. So you can easily store all your photos, 4K and 360 videos, games, and more without worrying about running out of space\u2014or needing to spend more money on external storage options.\n\nStraight-up Android PH-1 runs pure Android. No unnecessary apps, preloads, or anything that gets in your way of getting the latest Android updates and features. You get a smooth experience that is fast and fluid. \n\n\n\n\nRevolutionary accessories The Click Connector on Essential Phone makes using accessories easier than ever. They magnetically attach and power up using your PH-1. So you don\u2019t need to charge your accessories to use them. And because the Click Connector will be on future Essential devices, you can use your current accessories with future Essential devices.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Startup Describe your product in 3 words.\n\nFreedom is Essential\n\nHow did you come up with the idea for this product?\n\nI know people are going to ask me a lot of questions about why I started this company. Why didn\u2019t I just travel the world, ride my motorcycle, tinker with my robots, hang out at my bakery with friends and family. And to be honest I still do ask myself that sometimes\u2026but not too often. So why did I create Essential? Well, my hardware engineers wanted me to talk about how we are bringing real passion and craftsmanship back into this category. My software engineers wanted me to talk about our vision for making all devices, even those we don't make ourselves, play well together. My partners wanted me to talk about how we are using methods that could change how successful technology companies are built forever. And this is all true. But the real reason is because of what happened during a night out with an old friend of mine. As the night went on we inevitably began talking about what we didn't like about the current state of technology. Less and less choice. More and more unnecessary features cluttering our lives. An increasing sea of products that didn't work with one another\u2026 And just when I was about to drop another criticism it hit me: I am partly responsible for all of this. For all the good Android has done to help bring technology to nearly everyone it has also helped create this weird new world where people are forced to fight with the very technology that was supposed to simplify their lives. Was this what we had intended? Was this the best we could do? I left that night reflecting deeply on what was great and what was frustrating with the current state of technology today. After another long talk with my friend we decided that I needed to start a new kind of company using 21st century methods to build products for the way people want to live in the 21st century. \n\nWhat makes your product special?\n\nThis is what we believe: \u2022 Devices are your personal property. We won\u2019t force you to have anything on them you don\u2019t want to have. \u2022 We will always play well with others. Closed ecosystems are divisive and outdated. \u2022 Premium materials and true craftsmanship shouldn\u2019t be just for the few. \u2022 Devices shouldn\u2019t become outdated every year. They should evolve with you. \u2022 Technology should assist you so that you can get on with enjoying your life. \u2022 Simple is always better. \n\nWhat has been the best part of your startup experience?\n\nI have used the above principles to inform everything Essential is doing and they have helped me attract some of the best and brightest people from all over the world to join me in bringing this vision to life. We won\u2019t achieve everything we hope on day one, but if you\u2019re one of those people who also thinks it\u2019s time for something new, please have a look at www.essential.com to learn more.",
