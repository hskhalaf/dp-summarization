I am getting so frustrated trying to call and emails. That unit has only been used maybe 3-4 times. I need help and I don't know what to do.",

The options are excellent: Listen to music from your phone while riding, connect to other riders (up to 3 others and yourself) so you can communicate, can use Siri functions such as asking what time it is or making phone calls. The one thing that is excellent but can throw you for a loop is that each function has its independent volume level. When I first tried to use Siri, I heard nothing and thought it wasn\u2019t working. However once I turned up the volume, I found it was working perfectly. It remembers each volume setting. So after using each function and adjusting volume levels, you are good to go from that point on.",

I believe they are phasing this line of product out however, as there is a newer one out now. My only complaint is that they appear to have discontinued the SMH-A0303 base that could be used with these to let the student use earbuds rather than in-helmet speakers. Since this is the case, make sure you order all the accessories you want immediately if you buy this radio; they may not be available much longer.",

The noise issue appears to be only with the intercom feature which points to firmware. Phone calls are clear with no reports of noise from the caller. Research shows a large group of people have the same issue with both noise and unable to update. Sena tech support suggests I try on another computer even though the computer will update my SMH5 built in unit on another helmet.",

You cannot adjust the mike sensitivity and every little blast of air key\u2019s the conversation mode. Terribly annoying when it\u2019s just you and the device is constantly telling you that the intercom failed.

The unit can be charged while in use -- with either of the provided cables -- or quickly released to take in with you to charge in the house. How convenient.

Connection is related to line-of-sight, so when we're in a mountain or city environment there might be some fuzz, but we never lose the actual connection. We can hear each other easily up to 110kph, and probably higher if the wind noise in our helmets wasn't so bad.The system syncs up easily with 1-2 other units (never tried more than that). Recharges overnight (never timed it precisely). Holds up well under all weather conditions. I am glad that we bought this system. It has been by far the best possible decision.",

Pros: - Excellent battery life - Easy to install - Buttons easy to use with riding gloves on - Paired easily with Samsung Galaxy s4 Cons: - Have to repeat things multiple times when at interstate speeds. This may be typical for 3/4 helmets though. - Have to turn it all the way up sometimes to hear the other rider - Can't hear GPS directions while talking with another rider. (If listening to music, it turns the music down so you can hear the voice guidance)",

Listening to music, and paring with my Zumo GPS is really nice too. The sound quality is good and there is ample volume to hear while traveling at 70mph+. This is our second set of Sena's.

Volume level is easily varied and sufficiently loud when you need it.

Haven't had time to fully test the range but I can still talk to my gf even if she walks into a convenience on stops to get something to eat or drink.",

Hopefully this first one was just a fluke. I will say that it did have more useable and clear speaker volume than a Cardo Scala Q2 I have been previously using. I hope to post a more detailed and positive report on the replacement.",

    "title": "Sena SMH10D-10 Motorcycle Bluetooth Headset / Intercom (Dual)",
    "description": "The Sena SMH10 Motorcycle Bluetooth 3.0 Headset and Intercom was designed to keep you connected to your riding companions over longer ranges for conversation and music sharing--up to 900 meters (980 yards). When paired with a Bluetooth-enabled phone, it'll also let you make hands-free calls. The SMH10 features a Helmet Clamp Kit and Boom Microphone. The Jog Dial makes for an intuitive user interface that is much easier to control while riding. The Jog Dial default is volume control, and pushing the integrated button lets you cycle through all device functions with minimal fuss, which means you'll ride safer. The SMH10 delivers crystal-clear, natural sound through the stereo Bluetooth headset that gets an automatic boost in noisy environments while Advanced Noise Control technology cuts down on background noise for both incoming and outgoing audio. The Bluetooth music playback control features play, pause, track forward and track back functions, plus each audio source has its own adjustable volume level. Integrated voice prompts (available in English, French, German, Italian and Spanish) help you quickly learn your way around the device. You'll get up to 12 hours of talk time and 10 days of stand-by time on a single charge. And even if your companions don't have Sena gear, the SMH10 uses the Universal Intercom protocol, which allows your gear to work with theirs, regardless of brand. Auxiliary audio-in connection via 0.13 inches jack.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\nThe SMH10D-10 is a Bluetooth v3.0 + EDR Class 1 Stereo Headset with long-range Bluetooth Intercom designed specifically for motorcycles. With the SMH10D-10, you can call hands-free on your Bluetooth mobile phone, listen to stereo music or voice instructions of GPS navigations by Bluetooth wirelessly, and have intercom conversations in full duplex with a passenger or other motorcycle riders. This package contains two full sets of SMH10 headsets and mounting accessories.\n\nFeatures include Bluetooth 3.0, multi-point connection, and conferencing for up to 4 people Thanks to the latest Bluetooth v3.0 and the advanced digital processing technology, the SMH10D-10 offers the best sound quality for both incoming and outgoing sound in its class. Also, the easy-to-access and intuitive button operations make the SMH10D-10 a perfect companion for motorcycles.\n\nBLUETOOTH V3.0 WIRELESS\nSMH10D-10 can wirelessly connect to other Bluetooth devices supporting HSP/HFP (Headset Profile/Hands Free Profile) and A2DP (Advance Audio Distribution Profile). HSP/HFP is standard in all phones with Bluetooth features. Almost all Bluetooth MP3 players, smartphone, and audio dongles support A2DP to send stereo audio to Bluetooth headsets like the Sena SMH10D-10. Enjoy Bluetooth music playback control by AVRCP: play, pause, track forward and track back.\n\nOther Bluetooth features include Multi-Pair to allow intercom functionality for 4 persons, and compatibility with select motorcycle GPS systems.\n\nUse as an intercom, or connect to your portable devicesINDIVIDUAL ADJUSTABLE VOLUME PROFILES\nYou can easily decrease/increase the volume of the voice, music and intercom using Jog Dial. The SMH10D-10 can save volume levels of previously connected profiles. This means that phone volume (HSP/HFP), music volume (A2DP), and intercom volumes will be saved separately and return to its own saved volume level whenever associated profile is reconnected.\n\nProfile volume adjustment is only affected during the use of its specific profile. However, when changing volume during standby mode, then volume change applies to all profiles. Alert tones like low battery warning and connection tones can only be adjusted in standby mode.\n\nEASY INSTALLATION FOR MOST HELMETS\nThe SMH10D-10 will fit onto various types of helmets. The standard clamp, included in default packaging, will fit onto most helmets. For installations which may require extra wire length, ear buds instead of speakers, and wire microphone instead of boom microphone, Sena offers different types of clamps as an additional accessory (sold separately), to allow various installations and user preferences.\n\nTWO-YEAR WARRANTY\nThe SMH10D-10 offers peace of mind in your purchase with a 2-year warranty against workmanship defects. See the warranty card in your product packaging for full details.\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX?\nThe Sena SMH10D-10 Bluetooth Headset Bundle includes two full sets of the following: SMH10 speaker/microphone clamp unit, USB power and data cable, 3.5mm stereo audio jack cable, glued surface mounting adapter, microphone sponges, speaker pads, velcro pads, Allen wrench (for installation), and microphone cap, plus a manual and warranty.\n\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\n * Talk time: 12 hours\n * Standby time: 10 days\n * Working Distance (Intercom): Up to 900 meters (980 yards) in open terrain\n * Bluetooth: v3.0 + EDR\n * Audio: Built-in SBC Codec, 48kHz (DAC) sample rate\n * Battery Charging time: 2.5 hours\n * Battery Type: Lithium polymer battery\n * Headset Dimensions: 84.1 mm x 56.5 mm x 38.6 mm (3.3 in x 2.2 in x 1.5 in)\n * Headset Weight: 60 g (3.01 oz)\n * Clamp Dimensions: 223.8 mm x 85.5 mm x 30.6mm (8.8 in x 3.4 in x 1.2 in)\n * Clamp Weight: 84 g (2.96 oz)",
