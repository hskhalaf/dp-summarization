Ugh it's great and I've got it in my same bag I've had since 2003. Awesome company in terms of their products (all I know, maybe they kill environments and throw babies into space. IDK)",

We actually use these in our race cars to provide the drivers with cold water during our 2.5hr road races. They stand up the the G's , heat and vibrations that a race car produces. Great Product!
