It provides a larger surface area, the wrist wrest is much improved being wider and more comfortable, and the construction is better. This is my mouse pad of choice as the ability to switch surfaces between a smooth/speed or rough/control by simply flipping the mouse pad over suits my purposes well depending on what I'm doing. If you are already using a razer mouse, get this pad. Selecting the surface you generally use in the Razer synapse software really allows the tracking of your mouse to operate at a different level.",

For the price Razer could have done something more \"clever\". For now I'm more content with a classic cloth mouse pad.",

Divots have already formed in the felt in certain areas and I'm really not sure why. The foam rest isn't the most comfortable in an fps or if your armrest is not well above the initial resting point. Could be they did not test for use without it but this seems unlikely. The foam should be about half as thick with the same give and this product would be perfect as I believe this would save the longevity of the felt side as well.",
