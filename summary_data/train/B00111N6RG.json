Only reason I gave it 4 stars is the glass is kinda thin. If dropped or you over tighten the top it will break. Other than that, no complaints.",

Just fair warning: the machine requires the SMALL gumballs. We made that mistake, which left us with a very sad little boy when the large ones arrived, but couldn't work.

Any coin seems to work in the slot, although plastic toy money definitely gets stuck (I think it's too thick). The jam was simple enough to clear with a small screwdriver in the opened base.
