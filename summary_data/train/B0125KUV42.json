I had to cut Sebastian out of the plastic he was in because he was in there so tight, it was impossible to pop him out. My daughter loves all the sets and dolls, she picked this out herself using her birthday money. She's thrilled, the set is really cute. There's a slide and a swing, and a shell shaped tub for Sebastian. The slide is a little flimsy and the two pieces that make the slide are not staying together well.",

She has a wonderful imagination and with these sets, and all the small parts that come with them, I am sure she will have loads of fun to last the afternoon away. They seem to be well made through the packaging, will update if that is not so when she opens them on her birthday. My only wish is that Disney would make a larger carrier for all these little villages and their pieces to keep them altogether. Bright colors help keep the imaginations going.",
