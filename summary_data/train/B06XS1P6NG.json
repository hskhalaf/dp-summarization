They appear to be ok quality but a rougher texture means lower quality cotton so I doubt they will last long but then the price is really low and I got what I paid for.

They also show wrinkles, which encourages my daughter to make her bed, so this is could actually be a positive. I would not like these sheets for my bed because they are not my preferred softness and they are thinner than I like. However, my daughter likes these sheets and I liked the price for the set.",

I use no AC at night, so coolness is a big deal. No waking up sweating and throwing off the covers; no pilling or snagging by my snaggly toenails; no skimpy tuck-ins. Follow the detailed directions and wrinkles will be kept to a minimum. I need my beauty sleep, and knowing that these sheets didn't cost an arm and a leg really helps me sleep soundly. PS - Thanks to a mild case of OCD, you can be sure that I researched and compared all products before selecting these. Sweet dreams!",

Don't get me wrong they're soft i just hoped for more. I also purchased the 800 t.c. which arrive today. I'm sure they'll feel amazing since the lower t.c. are. You definitely can't beat the price especially for such good quality. I paid much more at Target for very similar sheets.",
