The keyboard sags in the center when resting your palms and typing. It makes this ANNOYING creaking sound that will drive you crazy. The good news is that I fixed it by applying some felt \u201cfeet\u201d under the center where is sags (see pic). Very easy, but WTF!!! Come on Logitech, are you guys sleeping at your work stations?!",

The pros are the comfortability, the big buttons, the raised keyboard support, the wrist support, the battery life is pretty good as well. The problems, the letters scratch off pretty easily. If I didn't know where the \"A\" \"S\" and the \"T\" buttons were I would be lost. The keyboard doesn't light up either.. This isn't Logitech's fault.. It's just something I want. Overall, this is a pretty solid keyboard. It's served me well. It's not a bad buy.. I would like to see what Logitech's future offering is.",

      "text": "Initially I thought this is a nice keyboard with the exception of how the Home/End/Delete/Page Up/Page Down keys are positioned. I've never used a keyboard that had this configuration and have really been having a hard time adjusting. The keyboard is also pretty loud and the spacebar has gone a little loose after just a few weeks of daily use. The springs seems to have lost some resistance so I keep inserting a space accidentally when my hand lightly touches the space key.",

The mouse in this set worked well for about 2 months then inexplicably when I do a single left click about 50% of the time the mouse double clicks on its own. It is really annoying because when you are trying to select an item or just highlight it the item opens up. Sometimes painful when web surfing or just checking my email. The mouse is very disappointing!",

Brand new keyboards, sealed in the box should come as brand new (no sticky keys or anything). this product however, feels like i paid premium price for a used item. Thanks Logitech!",

The keyboard continues to work fine however. The mouse worked great the first two months but things have gone progressively downhill after that... If you buy this for the keyboard, go ahead - if you buy it for the mouse or both, look elsewhere! I hope this helps.",
