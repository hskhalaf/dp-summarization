It is easy to use and extremely affordable as well. I actually bought this same phone (in white) as a present for my mother. Her phone has the answering machine included. She also likes her phone a lot too! She uses it on a daily basis and has no complaints about it!",

You will literally pull this phone out of the box, plug it in, and set it on the wall. Assuming you are just replacing your other wall-hanging phone, then you just use the same hanger already on the wall. It's very comfortable in your hand and on your ear! It's super simple to use. Plus, by keeping your landline you ensure your safety and security. What else could you want in a phone? Bonus feature, which we've not had before: it has caller ID (displays the number that is calling).",

      "text": "I really like this phone. My favorite thing about it is, you can scroll the caller ID, then just press 1 to call the number back. With my old phone, it wouldn't let you add 1, and then the call wouldn't go through. You'd have to write the number down just to call it back! It also has a nice display that lets you know when you have missed a call or have a new voice mail. I like the background display and button colors, that light up and make it easier to see. It's a nice, ergonomic design, easy to hold. The battery lasts a long time and charges quickly. Overall, very pleased with this phone.",

It is easy to set the handset into the base and to feel that it is set in there properly so it'll charge. The white is quite white. I have no complaints.",
