Another good thing is that I don't feel much extra weight by this trailer with my 27LB dog in it. Every part of this product is well made and looks great. Big soft tires make ride smooth and you can make pretty steep turns. Also you have a choice to open front part of mesh window. So dog does not feel trapped in the small place and there is a short leash, you can attach to your dog which keep them inside of trailer.",

      "text": "The two things I didn't think about when ordering this was how important pockets and a turning front wheel would be. There are absolutely no pockets or hooks. And the front wheel is stationary which makes turning or just staying on the sidewalk challenging and frustrating. The handle is also short and not adjustable and I'm 5'11 so I was slouching to reach the handle. Also the assembly instructions were extremely sparse. I'll probably be returning because of the wheel, height and pocket issues.",

      "text": "Shouldn't have trusted all the positive reviews and done more research before buying this particular brand/model. So far I'm not impressed. The instruction booklet for assembly was a poorly photocopied(?) paper, so it was hard to tell what was what. The parts that hold the handlebar in place are nearly impossible to get tight enough, so the handle wobbles a little. I haven't tried this on my bike yet, but as a stroller it drags to the left. This gets annoying on longer walks. I'm hoping this is something that can be adjusted. If I hadn't purchased this online, I would be tempted to return it. However, the dog seems to like it, so I'll make do.",

I mainly bought it for long hikes in the heat for my Jack russel/pug mix who's 10 yr and cannot last as long as us on long hikes. Also was looking for a bike trailer for him so this was well worth it. The only dislikes I have is that there is no emergency break anywhere on it, and it kind of free rolls on it's own so that's a pretty big con. Also, the front wheel doesnt pivot, it's on a straight bar so you have to lift the stroller to make turns. I would recommend, it's nice for the price. Easy to assemble and tranform.",

If i could get a brake to add i will probably do that. When using it on the bike no complaints at all...its very nice and most My Dog Loves it.",
