The glass is heavy and durable. Their easy to clean and don\u2019t feel too hot to the touch after I microwave them. These are a great addition to my growing kitchen glass storage collection.

The glass and band are a light greenish color - every brand has it\u2019s own. I have just pulled one out of the dishwasher and it held up perfectly! When I need more, I will be back! Thank you!!",

I\u2019m taking more of the responsibility on that since glass hitting ceramic, even from only about a foot and a half of height, is bound to do damage. However, the plastic top on one of the remaining containers has broken as well, cracking on one of the places it bends to snap onto the glass bottom. It still works but definitely impacts how leakproof that particular container is when closed. Other than that, the one container that is unbroken has been great, and is doing its job with no complaints.",
