The setting will allow the timer to be off, and so that only dollar bills will be used in making change, no coins, if you want. Honestly, I hope the shop owner doesn't ever come back from vacation! Please buy this, it truly such a joy to play.",

I really like the junior mode because it allows preschoolers to play with minimal assistance. We have been using OSMO since the firs year it came out and we all love it. It grows with your child and makes the iPad an active tool for learning instead of a video player. I highly recommend the Pizza company simply for the money skills alone since schools don\u2019t cover this skill any more. Plus reading facial expressions and following directions is a lifelong skill kiddo need. Two thumbs up to OSMO.",

I saw this game and thought \"let's focus that pizza frenzy\". It's worked. He loves this game. It's a fun concept of working out the visual logic of object placement and reading the emotional and vocal cues of the \"customers\", and then working out the math of the money they pay versus the amount of change they are due. There are several levels of difficulty, from whole numbers down to cents. It's fantastic. The visuals are engaging and the rewards keep kids playing. It doesn't' feel like homework, but there's serious learning happening. 5+stars.",

When we have taken off in the past the two ipads we had ended up getting cracked. So with our new ipad we don't let our daughter use for this activity.

A lot of fun, even for adults, and teaches on-the spot calculations of currency, going as minute as 5-cent increments for giving change, which could be challenging for older kids, too. Overall, very well made game, and very quick-paced, teaching the basics of running a business, paying rent, upgrading equipment, decorating, customer feedback, tipping, in a fun pizza-making context. The only negative so far is that the 2nd generation iPad takes a few seconds to process pizza toppings, which results in lower game scores sometimes, unless you are aware of it and wait accordingly to accommodate. But that could be the iPad issue, not a game issue.",

She loves making the pizzas (assembling the toppings) but the only frustrating part for her is handling the change. You can adjust how difficult the change system is (dollars only vs. dollars and coins, etc.) but this aspect of the game still stresses her out so I usually serve as the cashier while she handles the pizzas. I'm sure when she's got a better handle on math, this will no longer be an issue. Overall, happy with the purchase and the quality of the game.",
