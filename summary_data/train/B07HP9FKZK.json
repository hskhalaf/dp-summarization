The color and design are sharp and look of good quality. It is light enough for my kindergartner to carry, although it's pretty big on her. Both larger pockets have plenty of space for binders, computers, etc. You could easily fit a laptop in this, although it is a standard backpack so it doesn't have any extra padding that might protect a computer.",

I'm a college student and I use this backpack every day to haul around all my electronics and books and I'm very impressed at the quality. Not one stitch has broken and all the zippers work fabulously. The backpack is plenty spacious, but not to big for everyday use. There are lots of inner and outer pockets, some mesh, which I find really convenient for storing my pens and charging wires. The backpack is very well made and easy to organize, I would totally recommend it to a friend.",
