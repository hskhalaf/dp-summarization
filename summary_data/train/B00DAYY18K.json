Beginning in very cold weather and progressing through a very hot and muggy summer. She needed a new setup so I researched and found this MAKO series which is very flexible, good protection, and well ventilated. So far it has performed admirably and my daughter is \"cooler\" in both the fashion sense (the kit looks great!) and in the physical sense (much cooler in hot situations. Great buy.",

      "text": "I have used these leg guards for a couple of years now. I pitch in softball, and have taken some line drives off the shin, and wanted something to give me some protection. (Too many players don't know how to hit to right field with power, and end up hitting it up the middle when they try.) These guards have held up well for what I use them for. They are actually very comfortable, and I have pretty good mobility in them. They have also done exactly what I needed them for. A few less knots on my legs thanks to these.",

      "text": "Superior protection as the guards go up above the knee caps. I was concerned about the \"intermediate\" size fitting my 11 year old. He was in the junior sizes before but has outgrown them (he's 4'11\" and about 100 lbs). The intermediate size sounded so big but it was my only option if I needed bigger than junior, so I went for it. They do fit him! Obviously he has room for growth but they do fit and our catching coach said that now he doesn't look like he's wearing Lego-catchers gear (meaning the junior sized gear looked like miniature Lego pieces strapped on him). Love these.",

Least importantly - to me - he loves them because he thinks they look really cool.",
