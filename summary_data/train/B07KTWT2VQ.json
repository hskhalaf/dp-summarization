      "verdict": "The overall feedback for the Sensebounce+ has been moderately positive. Some consumers feel as if this Adidas running shoe is perfect for their daily needs. Casual shoe enthusiasts have even lauded its capacity to take them through tasks that aren\u2019t connected to athletics. The high-quality cushioning system and breathable upper have become the highlights of this product. On the other hand, the low-roofed forefoot and the slippery-on-wet-ground outsole have been criticized.Fans of neutral running shoes that are for the asphalt and other flat surfaces are the target market of the Adidas Sensebounce+.",

        "The versatility of this product\u2019s construction has been praised by those who like to use it for activities other than running",
        "Some heavyset runners claim that the midsole is able to carry the weights of their bodies with ease",
        "The breathability of the upper unit is appreciated by those who like a cover system that doesn\u2019t feel stifling",
        "In-shoe security has been thought of as precise and accommodating",
        "testers don\u2019t feel any wobbliness while wearing the Adidas Sensebounce+"
