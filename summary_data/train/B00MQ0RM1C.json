I almost didn't buy this because the pictures and detail did not show how long the bristles are. They measure 5/8 inch long and I am attaching a picture from the side. This brush feels heavenly, while removing psoriasis scales and totally stimulating my scalp! So relaxing, like at the salon! If you want a good scrubbing like fingernails, get this product! If you prefer fingertips, keep your flimsy silicone scrubber! I should have known...duh...Fuller Brush products are always amazing. Spend the extra cash, you won't regret it!",

Psorasis in the hair really needs frequent shampooing & this brush gently does the scrubbing needed without slipping out of your hands like the other octagon styles can.

The bristles hold up just fine and do a great job massaging my scalp while I let the shampoo sit. The downside is that it has sharp angles on the sides of the handle and sharp corners on the bottom. Since my hands are usually slippery and the material is slick, I have to grip the handle a bit tighter and it hurts. I'm going to try filing the sharp parts and if that doesn't work then I will continue using it until I find a replacement.",

      "text": "Recently bought the Fuller Brush Scalp Massager, it is a brush with short white bristles that are hard but giving on your scalp. If you have a dry scalp, or an itchy dry scalp, then this scalp massager brush is for you. I use the brush when I wash my hair with Tresseme Dry Scalp Shampoo, all you have to do is brush your scalp in circular patterns over the itchy or dry area's and the pores in your scalp open up. It feels wonderful, and I have found it to work wonderfully. Will Purchase Again if Needed, but the brush is very sturdy and will last a long time.",

Ordered this one because Fuller Brush has been known to have good products. It has stiff bristles and works great getting through the hair. I was skeptical about the style with a handle like this but found this works great as well. I will be ordering another one or two for my other showers.",
