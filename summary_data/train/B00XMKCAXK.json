Otherwise, it is a good product. However, I would advise considering what you, personally, use the mortar for most before deciding on a type. Stainless steel might not be the best idea for non-dry ingredients.",

      "text": "This tool has been a great addition to the kitchen. I've done spices, sugars, and various nuts and have been very happy with results. I did some research prior to purchase between the metal and stone types. Glad I did, as stone tends to retain some bits of food and this one cleans up well. In addition, the cover is a great value add-on as it helps keep food from flying all over. Though I wish the material of the lid was a bit sturdier. I can see myself needing to buy replacement lids in the future.",

I first searched Bed Bath and Beyond locally to get it in a hurry but I didn't like the ones they offered. I found this one on amazon and the free one day shipping was a perk, This set is beautiful! I read the comments before purchasing and yes the inside is a bit smooth for grinding seeds, but the grip on the bottom counteracts this. Easy to use, Easy to clean, and a Beautiful accent to the Kitchen. It was also the perfect size for making our pesto :)",
