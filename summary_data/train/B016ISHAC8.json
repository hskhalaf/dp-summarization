Right now, I\u2019m hopeful. If it happens that my knives continue to slide or actually slide off, the score will definitely drop. As an aside, it was easy to install & looks nice.",

Probably due to the metal which wraps around the front for aesthetic purposes? It does look good. However, my bread knife was too heavy (or maybe because it's slim and not much metal contact for the weight?) and the darned thing slid right off.",

The magnet has a mind of it\u2019s own, pulling your knives in a crooked display. I could over look that fact if it stayed mounted, not sure if holes in the tile is worth the product itself.

The problem is that the bar contains a number of individual magnets. Because of this, some spots on the bar have a stronger pull than other spots. The other effect is that the handles of the knives become attracted to each other. So when you remove a knife, sometimes the other knives rotate and and shift because the handles have such a strong attraction to each other. I found it unusable because of this.",

      "text": "This knife bar is exactly what I was wanting. I do not have a ton of counter space so wanted to get rid of the butcher block the knives were in but also did not want to store my knives in a drawer. The magnet is very strong. It's on my fridge and right now I have 12 knives on it of various sizes. Likely won't keep this many on knives on there, but that should give you an idea of the capacity it holds. None have fallen off or anything either. I've had it up for a little over a week.",

If screwing into a tile back splash, you will need a drill bit for cement/tile. Use a plug once drilled and it is simple. The company has a plastic piece that you pull out the metal piece that you secure to the wall. once done you simply place the finished bar and done! Love, Love it!",

While the magnet is very strong, it appears there needs to be some texturing to increase the friction so they don't just slide. A normal sized bread-knife barely stays on. I have even attempted to increase the grip by adding some sugru strips to it, which helped, but it is not close to as good of a hold as I would expect, need, or have found with other blocks. The appearance is nice and size as well.",
