The only reason I'm only giving 4 stars as the socket size markings are small and very hard to read. I'll have to improvise with some paint to ease identification. I don't understand why the manufacturer couldn't recognize the need to design legible sizing on the sockets.",

The combination wrenches are just ok, but if you're doing a lot of auto work you'll probably want to upgrade to a full set any way.

The 1/4 inch wrench's release button has been reduced in size from the thumb sized one on previous 1/4 inch Stanley wrenches with the same part number and this makes it harder to release the sockets. The case retaining clips are an improved design which are less likely to fatigue and snap off unlike earlier Stanley case clips. For the price this set is pretty unbeatable though I hope the 3/8 and 1/4 inch wrench has some loctite on the retaining screws.",

      "text": "This is a nice home set with lots of variety in socket sizes. However the largest deep wells are 1/2 inch and a 13 mm. I would have liked the SAE size deep wells to have included a 9/16 and 5/8 in the set. The largest shallow wells are a 11/16 and a 17mm which is fine. You do need some type of tool to help pry out the short sockets, I just used an old small / small bladed screw driver and stuck it in behind the deep wells to lock it in place. That way it's on hand and easy to access.",

    "description": "Size:123-PieceThe STANLEY STMT71652 123pc Socket Set offers a complete range of SAE and metric-sized sockets and drive tools. Our socket sets combine the most popular tools for easy accessibility. Stanley drive tools are forged from high-quality steel and finished in high-polish nickel chrome or black chrome. Selected ratchet handles are ergonomically designed and have an easy-to-use, thumb-operated reverse-switch mechanism. Sockets and extensions remain locked onto the drive until disengaged with an easy-to-reach, low-profile quick-release button. Stanley sockets feature our Max-Drive design, a unique radius corner design that provides 15% more torque* to tighten fasteners easily and simplify the turning of rounded corners. Max-Drive helps reduce fastener wear by minimizing contact on the outer 5% of the fastener, helping to increase life expectancy. It also helps reduce slipping on frozen or rusted fasteners. All Stanley ratchets, sockets and wrenches are manufactured globally to Stanley specifications, meeting and often exceeding ANSI specifications.",
