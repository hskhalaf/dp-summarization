      "text": "These are really nice quality and have great variety. However, several sheets were diecut wrong, so the stickers weren\u2019t centered even close to the cut patterns. Also if you\u2019re buying these as a teacher, know that each sheet has a very wide variety of sticker sizes, which makes it hard to use on a class set of grading - Who gets the giant fire truck, and who gets the tiny toolbox? Also the construction worker/police/firefighter sheet was very gender stereotyped. Again the quality is very nice (durable vinyl with bright colors), and it\u2019s a huge pack. I\u2019m not entirely disappointed with the purchase, but it just wasn\u2019t right for me as a teacher, and I wouldn\u2019t buy it again.",

Some of the stickers are not cut out correctly cutting parts of the sticker off. Also part of the clear plastic over the top of the stickers to make it glossy has peeled off and ended up making a big sticky mess. Otherwise it was well worth it.",

The stickers have a shiny coating on them which keeps them from tearing, and makes them easier to remove if they are stuck where they shouldn't be (like furniture). I had an issue with one sheet of stickers having a defect, and the company was very responsive with making my order right. I highly recommend the product and the company. I will be ordering from them again.",
