But once we got them on and off a few times, she would wear them all the time. She would have worn them until they fell apart, but of course she outgrew them before that could happen. They are made well, priced reasonably, and are very comfortable and warm. I will buy again.",

They last the entire winter and if his feet did not grow he could wear them into the next year. I would suggest these boots as an alternative to the more expensive brands.",
