      "text": "Seriously, save yourself the agro and do not buy this monitor. It looks amazing and the picture is terrific but it has a design fault where the chips that run the panel cannot handle the resolution and periodically crash causing at best a single frame or two of corruption on the half of the screen run by the chip that crashes. The internet and this page are full of people with the same issue and it look years for Acer to admit to the issue. Do you want to buy a \u00a3700 monitor only to have to RMA it and probably end up with a 2nd hand reworked panel in your new monitor?",

      "text": "I bought a used one of these from Amazon with great intrepidation, \u00a3600 for a used or 2nd hand device, I did intially think it was one that had been sent back due to light bleed or Bad bad pixel death. luckily I seem to be one of the fortunate ones, at least for now. I seem to have got one of the good panels, no dead pixels and very minimal light bleed. I was using this as a step up to eventually getting an OLED display in years to come so I'm very happy I got this particular panel. I was lucky but it can be a lottery as to whether you get a good one or not.",

      "text": "So I've tried gaming, watching tv, films, and workon this thing and it by far proves its worth with buttery smooth image and wonderful colour range. So far I've had several people look at this thing and say it's almost like they're looking out a window rather than a flat tv. But with that said the speakers are awful. I mean this when I say it that it almost sounds like I'm listening to a pair of headphones turned up to full sitting on the desk beside me. Whilst the picture is fantastic and I find the build nice and strong, if you are interested in this which I suggest you should be... By a set of separate speakers!",
