The intensive clean is definitely only for you if you like laundry that is scented stronger than gain. I wish they had a more natural scented version of Persil.Way stronger scented than regular Persil",

I has pleasantly surprised to see gripper tape around the neck of the bottle, to eliminate leakage. There was not leakage!!",
