      "text": "Best Sump Pump that you can buy. Nothing can stop it from working. One small problem is that the metal air hole in the pump will inevitably get clogged with gunk or rust so you need to drill a small 3/8th inch weep hole in the outlet pipe about 8\" above the base of the pump and before the One Way Check Valve. This weep hole will allow any trapped air to escape and allow the pump to self-prime. If you get a large enough air bubble, the pump will run continuously and burn itself out while failing to pump out any water. Weep holes are needed for all sump pumps, no matter what brand.",

I had water coming in, so I had to replace it with a FloTec. That pump lasted two years, so I'm back to Old Faithful. Durable construction, powerful and pretty quiet. The reason for four stars is the requirement to drill a 3/16\" hole in discharge pipe to prevent airlock. My pit is uncovered, and it's impossible to position that hole so that narrow shooting stream doesn't splash a little outside of the pit. A lot of manufacturers integrate that relief hole into the pump housing. Apart from that, I'm happy.",

Whether it happened during warehousing or shipping, by the time we opened it, our return window was closed. Shame on me for not prioritizing the installation within the window of return, but the packaging was terrible and clearly attributed to the damage.",

Since they ran 20% - 90% of the time, it was worth the electrical bill to switch brands. We still use a few on occasion, and they are more reliable than the brands that replaced them, but it ended up being cheaper to put in two 1/3 hp pumps (that were pulling normal current) after the electrical bill was included.

I'm a little disappointed considering this company is highly regarded for producing workhorse water movers. It's the spring thaw here in the North East USA and currently I have 10\" of standing water in the basement, so it must have given out a while ago. I've reached out to customer service regarding the warranty and will update again.",

Anyway, this thing is reliable, quiet and provides a comfort level during those daunting storms. Buy without hesitation and put your mind at ease.

      "text": "I purchased this pump to replace the 20 year old sump pump that was in the house when we moved it, and which recently stopped working,,,thankfully during a test and not an actual flooding situation. After doing extensive research online, I found that this pump was used by more plumbers and basement installation professionals than any other. So I bought it. It was painfully easy to install. Including cutting new pvc pipe to match the new pump requirements (the old pump was a pedestal-style) it took about 20 minutes to install.",

My grandkids, and Golden Retrievers love to swim in our pool, but they waste gallons of water each time they get out. So I hooked up a basin & Zoeller sump, and send the water to a holding tank to be filtered, & then back to the pool. Pump was easy to set up, works great, and runs very quiet.",
