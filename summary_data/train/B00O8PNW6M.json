I could see if I had a shirt with a zipper or button on it, but it was just my bare forearm. For $30, I would have expected better.

Which it obviously doesn't fit properly. Very disappointed. Company should have given accurate dimensions for this product! Otherwise, the map arrived in good ship and looks nice. Note: I also have the Maps International US map. This map's dimensions were as advertised and fit into the appropriate sized frame.",

Now I just need to travel more to scratch more countries. I would recommend it! It came perfectly packaged with no scratches.",
