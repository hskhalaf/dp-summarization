I saw someone with a strap around their mat, like a candy cane, so it would stay snug. When this arrived, it was much higher quality than I expected. My mat is one of the lite pros from a popular brand, and despite being \"lite,\" it's pretty hefty- and this strap really holds up!",

Other than that, great execution with the quality of secured stitching",

      "text": "I've only used it a few times thusfar, but the strap works well. A nice feature that you can't necessarily see in the pics is that where the loop is meant to slide up/down to loosen/tighten your loop, the strap is folded in half and sewn so it slides better but still has plenty of friction to hold once you tighten. As an aside, I got the longer length for a single, somewhat thick, mat (figured too much was better than not enough), and I have a lot of extra length, even when carrying it crossbody. For reference, about 5'8\" tall and slender build.",

I haven't used it in my yoga practice yet, as it is suggested, but I'm sure it'll be perfect for it. The pink is a pretty medium pink with contrasting purple stitching-- just girly enough!

The natural friction allows it to secure a mat without the need for annoying mechanical fasteners like D-rings or Velcro. It's easy to loosen when it's time to use the mat and the loops pretty much hold their position so it goes back on the mat without a lot of fuss. A light pull on each end and it's ready to carry again. I'm 5'10\" and the standard size is the perfect length with my mat (71\" x 24\"; 4.7 mm thick).",

      "text": "What can I say? It's a yoga strap. It is the perfect length for me, the loops are easy to adjust for a quick slip on or off your mat and as a guy, I like the black color. You can tell it is made of very durable material and I don't foresee it every coming apart. I keep it on my mat and inside my cargo net of my car. Always keeps the mat tight and never slips. So much easier carrying my mat into class now.",

Perfect for travel and for neatly storing in my closet. Beats the single loop of the yoga strap I had been using. Can also be used to stretch. Foot fits in one end and the other loop acts as a no slip handle. Highly recommended.",

Super easy to just slip the loop open to fit any size yoga mat- I have two rolled up inside in the pictures and this handles that with ease. My old one would not have been able to hold both together. You just slide it tight after putting your mat in and go. Amazing price for the quality as well- the material is thickly woven and super sturdy. So quick to slip on and off of the mat.",
