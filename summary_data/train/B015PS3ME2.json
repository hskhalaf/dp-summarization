My handlebars are the raised style (not flat), so my limited mounting space is already used for my headlight and bike computer.

And the 4 elastic straps insures the phone isn't going anywhere. Great purchase. Highly recommend. Had to change my original review----I only used for a total of about 12 times, and the plastic cracked putting the phone in. Cool while it lasted, but not I can't recommend.",
