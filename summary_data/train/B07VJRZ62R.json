The switch looks beautiful while docked & i\u2019m a fan on the pastel blue/green & cream colored contrast. If you already played AC on another switch console, you\u2019re now able to backup & transfer all of your save data by contacting Nintendo support. It\u2019s a little tedious but, worth it if you have 100+ hours of hard work. 10/10 recommend to those who have been trying to get their hands on this in months!

Also have been playing Link's Awakening and Super Mario Odyssey, beautiful games and looking forward to more. Seamless switching between big screen and small screen is really impressive.",

What I love about the Switch is the games are actually full length instead of the shorter and more casual games on the 3DS. The games are expensive but the PS4 and Xbox were too when they first came out. The Switch is still a fairly new console and a lot of great ports are coming to it. I always look out for deals and end up with games for $40. Overall I truly am enjoying the Switch being an owner of a PS4 Pro and Xbox One S.",
