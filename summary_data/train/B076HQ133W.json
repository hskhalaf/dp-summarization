The Ticwatch E doesn't have that problem with wear 2.0. I don't care much about the fitness sensors, so the fact that they were simple to disable was nice. It's quite comfortable to wear--lightweight and the band is flexible for a good fit. Finally, at $130 the price is definitely right for what you get.",

You just have to be patient with the slow performance and deal with its one day battery life. UPDATE 10 months after the screen got burned and its in process of losing every pixel.

Never used the mobile app. This watch is a bit older now but still works amazing. Have had it for over 2 years now. A little slow because it can only keep up with so many updates before being outdated but all the core features still work very well.",

I know it took a big jump in battery life from wear os 1 to wear os 2, but it's still kinda crappy to have to charge nightly.",

I can get through the day and into the night no problem....BUT, if I use GPS to track a 30 minute run, it just sucks the life of it. I will have to charge it before the end of day. I don't expect much from a smartwatches battery life, but I expect no matter what that at a full charge in the morning it will make it through one day (12-16hours). If the battery life gets fixed I would gladly up my rating.",
