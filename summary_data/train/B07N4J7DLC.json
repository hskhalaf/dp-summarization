It really is superior image quality with crisp lines, no motion blur and sharp colors with true blacks.

However, like most TVs, this one comes with the picture adjusted for market display (which is terribly over vibrant with far to much contrast). Get rid of the \"smart\" adjustments, and bang, awesome picture. It has HDR, but HDR, in my opinion destroys picture quality and realistic colors. 4K is awesome (simple equates to twice the pixel density both vertically and horizontally, compared to 1080 without the annoying alteration of color or brightness depth). I love Sony monitors and TVs because of their excellent reproduction of actual color and contrast edge-to-edge (I just takes a little time to remove the gimmicks all new TVs are set standard to).",

I never cared for 4k blu ray films but this 4k convinced me to upgrade my library from blu ray to 4k blu ray movies, I luv it, I was nervous to have a tv delivered to me because of some customers saying their TVs came damaged, I'm thankful that my tv was not damaged when delivered.",

That means it's integration with Google assistant is MINIMAL, you can play content from a small handful of services. Power and volume are flaky. Now you can use the remote to talk to the tv and get more done, but IMO that's not the point of a service integration. Picture and sound are really good, but I couldn't justify paying for a premium TV with outdated software that didn't work as well as my nearly 5 year old Vizio. So I returned this product.",
