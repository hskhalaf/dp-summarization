      "text": "I loved this card when I got it. It played all of the games I wanted it to, like skyrim in 1080p at ultra settings staying at 60 fps pretty consistently. I was happy with its performance. But I quickly realized how fast it's life was ending. In July of 2015 I build my pc, then in January of 2016 I started getting bsod left and right and before I realized it in June of 2016 my gpu breathed its last breath. So the point of this is to tell people save up more and buy a more worth while gpu or you might have the same fate.",
