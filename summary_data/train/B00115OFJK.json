Not only is Wacom good stuff to begin with, but the angle of the tablet and shape of the stylus are apparently leaps and bounds above the old Ugee tablet she was using. Her wrist and hand don't hurt nearly as much after her Iron Artist sessions, and she can doodle to her heart's content. With the improved ergonomics, her artwork has taken a turn for the better (not that it was bad to begin with) and as I hear it, the controls are easy, responsive, and reliable. Now I want one, too.",

If seller does not have driver disc, just download the new driver on Wacom support site! ENJOY!",

You can put this on your lap, but there will be a jungle of wires everywhere going this way, that way. This product is better suited on a desk where it has a permanent home. The pen cursor shakes violently when it gets near the edge of the display. When you draw, always center your image in the center of the display. I don't think it's worth over a grand. I hope they come out with a more affordable one in the future without so many wires.",

I now see that they have wireless items, but the size needs to be at least 20 inches by 10. Nothing can beat the traditional methods of art. Didn't love it didn't hate it.

The parallax issue takes a little getting used to, the offset of pen tip to drawing separated by the screen.

I feel the display could be a tiny bit brighter, and its calibration tends to get just a little fuzzy at the edges, but it's possible that these are user problems and not a fault of the hardware. The new model is the 13HD, better hardware and a cheaper price tag, so if you're buying this in 2013 you're probably making a mistake.",

      "text": "The Wacom 12WX brings to the table an awesome, effective, and easy-to-use deal. Personally, I've always found it easier writing directly on the screen and seeing my output as I input it, and mostly using Wacom's Cintiq 21 I wanted to get something cheaper but with the same power and productivity. The 12WX delivers in both areas. I use it for concept art and freelance work, and it's the perfect thing to have if the 21 is out of reach. Amazon had a great competitive price for it, and I have used it with no problems. Great buy!",

    "title": "Wacom Cintiq 12WX 12-Inch Pen Display",
    "description": "Style:Cintiq12WXThe Cintiq family of interactive pen displays enables creative professionals to work naturally and intuitively, by using Wacom's patented, professional pen technology directly on the surface of an LCD display.Wacom offers three options for working directly on screen: the all new high definition Cintiq 24HD, the popular large-format, second-generation Cintiq 21UX and the low-profile Cintiq 12WX. These high-quality displays, combined with the Cintiq pressure- and tilt-sensitive Grip Pens, offer world-class levels of precision, control and comfort for editing digital images, applying effects and filters, sketching, painting and modeling. The amazingly responsive pen-on-screen performance closely replicates the experience of working with traditional brushes and markers while offering all the benefits of a digital workflow. The Cintiq's scratch-resistant glass surface is completely flat from edge to edge, allowing the hand to glide easily over the entire surface. Both Cintiqs offer adjustments that allow them to be set up in different working positions and at different viewing angles. They also come equipped with finger-sensitive Touch Strips and ExpressKeys that can be customized to execute commonly-used shortcuts and modifiers to speed and simplify any workflow. The Cintiq pen controls the cursor in any application and provides pressure- and tilt-sensitive effects in supporting applications such as Adobe Photoshop, Autodesk SketchBook Pro, Corel Painter and hundreds of other applications. Cintiqs are compatible with both Mac and PC platforms.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nExperience all the advantages of direct pen-on-screen input in a low profile, lightweight design! At just 4.4 pounds, Wacom's new Cintiq 12WX combines the advantages of a wide-format LCD monitor with Wacom's patented, professional pen technology to give you the perfect companion for your Mac or PC.\n\nThin and light, the new Cintiq 12WX gives you the flexibility to work on screen the way you want. Easily rotate the 12.1\" TFT display when working flat on your desktop to find the right position for your hand, or stand the Cintiq 12WX upright on your desktop and adjust the integrated stand to a comfortable angle. With a flexible 6.5 foot cord, you can even use it on your lap.\n\nNo matter how you choose to use it, the Cintiq 12WX allows you to combine the advantages of natural hand-eye coordination and the intuitive pen-on-paper feel of traditional media with the benefits of digital workflow.\n\nThe Cintiq 12WX integrates seamlessly into multi-monitor environments to supplement a primary display or to control other displays. Alternatively, you can use the Cintiq 12WX as a stand-alone display. Its ergonomic design and lightweight profile make it easy to add it to your laptop, desktop, or high performance workstation.\n\nThe Cintiq 12WX delivers a highly sensitive pen-on-screen experience so you can work directly on your images and applications in the most natural way possible. With \"pen-point\" accuracy, fast cursor control, and 1,024 levels of pressure-sensitivity on the pen tip and eraser, the Cintiq 12WX gives you increased control, comfort, and productivity.\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\n * Using the pen directly on screen takes advantage of natural hand-eye coordination and provides the feel of natural media, but with all the benefits of a completely digital workflow.\n   \n   \n * With \"pen-point\" accuracy, fast cursor control, and 1,024 levels of pressure-sensitivity on the pen tip and eraser, Wacom pen technology gives you superior control over your workflow.\n   \n   \n * The Display Toggle offers increased flexibility in multiple-monitor environments allowing you to easily switch between screens or maximize pen control on different displays.\n   \n   \n * Ten programmable ExpressKeys provide quick access to modifier keys, keyboard shortcuts, and pop-up menus.\n   \n\n * Two finger-sensitive Touch Strips serve as natural ways to zoom, scroll, or change brush size.\n\n * The Grip Pen has a contoured, cushioned barrel to reduce grip effort by 40 percent.\n\n * A smooth, flat surface allows your hand to glide easily over the display while a sloped bezel on the front and sides provides a comfortable rest for your palm.\n\n * Thin, light, and durable, the Cintiq 12WX offers a pen-on-screen experience that rivals a pen-on-paper experience.\n   \n\nINCLUDED IN THE CINTIQ 12WX PACKAGE:\n 1.  Cintiq 12WX Pen Display\n 2.  Video Control Unit\n 3.  Grip Pen\n 4.  Pen Stand\n 5.  Five Replacement Pen Nibs (three standard nibs, one felt nib and one stroke nib)\n 6.  Video Control Unit\n 7.
