The only notable issue with it is that the battery only lasts a couple hours before it needs to be recharged. I bought a second battery as part of the \"Essential Accessories Bundle Kit For Canon PowerShot ELPH 500 HS, S95, SX600 HS, SX700 HS, SX610 HS, SX710 HS Digital Camera\" package from Amazon, so that one battery can be charging while the other one is being used in the camera.",

Can't say enough good about the 500 HD. I did have an issue with the lens cover sticking, but they replaced it - the new one has been working flawlessly. I can't see myself happier with anything else other than a DSLR - and you can't fit generally that in your jeans pocket. My T2i DSLR is wonderful - but nowhere near as convenient as this.

When I purchased this camera I also went ahead and found some no-name batteries that fit this model - a two pack for just $8.99. They work as well as the Canon battery that shipped with it.

Unfortunately, the touchscreen was frustrating enough to be a deal breaker and we ended up returning this camera. The touchscreen does not work as well as an iPhone. It can often take several taps to get the exact button correct. We decided to get another SD4000IS instead. It's too bad, because this is really a great lens and takes great pictures. A compact camera that works well in low-light situations is deal for parties, bars, and restaurants. But for now, stick with something that has physical buttons.",

    "title": "Canon PowerShot ELPH 500 HS 12.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with Full HD Video and Ultra Wide Angle Lens (Silver)",
    "description": "Color:SilverWith the Canon 5128B001 PowerShot ELPH 500 HS Silver 12MP Digital Camera with 4.4x Zoom and 3.2 In. LCD Display you will experience an even more intuitive touch panel technology. Do almost everything right on the LCD, like choosing an AF point, set exposure settings and record videos, all with the touch of one finger. The PowerShot ELPH 500 HS brings the art of photography at your command. It is packed with great Canon essentials like an f/2.0 lens, the HS SYSTEM, 1080p Full HD video and 24mm Wide-Angle Lens so every moment is captured in pure Canon brilliance.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n\n\nEXPERIENCE THE POWER.\nCanon's HS SYSTEM with a 12.1 Megapixel CMOS and DIGIC 4 Image Processor improves shooting in low-light situations without the need for a flash and lowers noise levels at higher ISO settings.\n\n\nThe Canon HS SYSTEM takes the frustration out of low light shooting. The system delivers clear, blur-free shots with all the ambiance intact, and frees you from the sometimes unwanted effects of using the flash. Beautiful low light shots are possible at both low and high ISO speeds, and the dynamic range is expanded to retain maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas.\n\nThe system is the result of two technologies brought together in a compact PowerShot. The first is the 12.1 Megapixel CMOS Sensor, which positions the light-receiving surface for optimal light reception. More light means clearer, blur-free images with plenty of detail and nuance, even in dark areas. Working together with the CMOS sensor to deliver the HS SYSTEM is Canon's advanced DIGIC 4 Image Processor, which actively reduces noise and delivers high speed image processing.\n\n\n\n\n\nMEMORABLE MOMENTS IN SPECTACULAR FULL HD.\nFull 1080p HD Video for exceptional quality with stereo sound, plus a dedicated movie button for easy access. Zoom optically while shooting video and keep footage stabilized with Dynamic IS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGET THE SHOT YOU WANT WITH JUST A TOUCH.\nA large 3.2-inch touch panel LCD offers easy and intuitive operation. \n\n\n\n\nA BIG LENS FOR BIG AMBITIONS.\n A bright f/2.0 lens, 24mm ultra Wide-Angle lens, great for shooting portrait photography in low light conditions or using a shallow depth-of-field for great images with beautiful soft backgrounds.\n\n\n\n\nA POWERSHOT THAT KEEPS UP WITH THE ACTION.\n\nGet high-speed shooting in a point-and-shoot camera: High-speed Burst Mode captures 8.2fps and Super Slow Motion Movie records video at high speeds to allow slow motion playback.\nSometimes, the action just won't stop for you. The PowerShot ELPH 500 HS digital camera is equipped with High-Speed Burst Mode that can capture 8.2 frames per second, letting you catch every single detail in pure Canon brilliance. \n\nYou can also add a fun slow motion effect to you videos with Super Slow Motion Movie. Super Slow Motion Movie will record your clips at a high speed so that when you watch your videos, they'll be playing in slow motion. \n\nCLARITY AND STABILITY AT YOUR FINGERTIPS.\n\n4.4x Optical Zoom Lens and Optical Image Stabilizer.\n\n\nA 4.4x Optical Zoom lens enables you to capture subjects that are close and far away. The added bonus of an Optical Image Stabilizer ensures that every moment you photograph will come out amazingly clear and focused.\n\n\n\nADVANCED SMART AUTO FOR STILLS AND VIDEOS THAT SHINE.\n\nSmart AUTO intelligently selects the proper settings for the camera based on 32 predefined shooting situations.\nThe PowerShot ELPH 500 HS digital camera takes the quality of your still images and videos to a whole new level - automatically. The camera's advanced Smart AUTO system detects a wealth of information about the scene you're shooting, then automatically selects the optimal settings for you. Now with an expanded range of 32 shooting scenarios, the camera handles a wide variety of situations, freeing you up to concentrate on composing your shot and capturing the moment you're looking for. From portraits to landscapes to action scenes, the PowerShot ELPH 500 HS digital camera has you covered whether you're shooting stills or videos.\n\n\n\n MOVIE\n\nShoot: \n-Full HD (1920 x 1080) at 24 fps for up to 14 min. and 34 sec. or 4GB per clip. \n-HD (1280 x 720p) at 30 fps for up to 20 min. 43 sec. or 4GB per clip. \n-VGA (640 x 480) at 30 fps for up to 43 min. and 43 sec. or 4GB per clip. \n-QVGA (320 x 240 at 30 fps) for up to 1 hour 58 min. and 19 sec. or 4GB per clip. \n-iFrame Movie format (1280 x 720) at 30 fps for up to 13 min. and 35 sec. or 4GB per clip.\n\nSUPER SLOW MOTION MOVIE\n\nRecord your clips in high speed (approx. 240fps), and then watch your videos in slow motion.\n\n\nActual results may vary from examples shown above.\nFinal image may vary depending on picture composition. Shoot it Your Way.\nAperture- and Shutter-priority modes for extra control of your images.\nFor photography enthusiasts, the ability to control aperture and shutter speed is key. The Aperture- and Shutter-priority modes on the Canon PowerShot ELPH 500 HS digital camera make it easy for anyone to take extra control over the look and feel of images captured.\n\n\nIn Aperture-priority mode, you set the aperture and the camera automatically selects an appropriate shutter speed. This lets you create sharp subjects with beautifully blurred backgrounds, and landscapes with foreground, middle ground and background all in focus.\n\n\n\n\nEASILY TURN YOUR MEMORIES INTO VIDEOS.\n\nMovie Digest Mode records a short video clip right before shooting a still image and then combines one day's worth of clips into one video.\nPutting together a video containing highlights from family vacations, important occasions and other special events is now easier than you might imagine. Using the Movie Digest Mode, you can have the camera automatically record a short video clip (up to approximately 4 seconds) every time you shoot a still image. The camera will then combine an entire day's worth of clips into a single video. No editing required \u2013 Movie Digest Mode does all the work, so you can sit back and enjoy your video!\n\n\nADD SOME FUN TO YOUR PHOTOS!\n\nNew scene modes, Toy Camera Effect and Monochrome, add an artistic look to your photos.",
