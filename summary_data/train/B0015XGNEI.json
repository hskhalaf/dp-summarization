Watch out though, the metal on top gets extremely hot. I found out the hard way the first time i used this toaster.",

Granted, the last toaster I had was from maybe 15 years ago and it was a piece of junk, so just about anything else would make me happy...but...I did shop around a little bit when I bought this one and it seemed to fit my needs. The only complaint I have is that the bagel setting doesn't really get the bagel hot. It toasts just the insides, which is great, but when I take the bagel out, it's somehow not warm. Nothing melts - not even butter. I just use the regular setting now, which is all I had before, so I can't really complain too much. 4.5 stars.",

For toast, you have to start on 3 and then decide from there because one piece will be toasted and the other will be lightly toasted.

      "text": "A little larger than expected, and the cord IS impractically short, but then ... it WAS made in China. I had to buy a short, heavy duty, extension I didn't need in the kitchen. Overall, a good toaster for the money. The elements have irregular hot spots on mine, but it toasts within a tolerable evenness. It has JUST the right amount of function buttons to become the most practical kitchen device I now have. Others are correct about BURNING OFF before using. WITHOUT ANY BREAD --- I set mine on 5 (HIGH) + FROZEN for the task, and set off the fire alarm ... without any smoke.",
