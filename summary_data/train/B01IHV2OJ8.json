The best part are the 3 \"windows\" you can open for the breeze to flow through so you don't get to hot in the tent. Great quality product.",

Either way, it's pretty cheap to break so easily. Bummer.",

Be careful setting up in high winds. We used this in 25 mph winds by filling up all the sandbags and keeping plenty of weight on the inside. It helps to have your back to the wind. My main gripe is the stakes that came with the tent are pretty much useless, they come up when you sneeze. Buy some good stakes and you will get much better use out of this tent. I picked up some better ones at Walmart and it made a huge difference!",

I didn't want anything too bulky or too expensive but I didn't want a tiny little umbrella that wouldn't really provide adequate shade. This was a compromise. It works well for us. However, there are times I wish it was just a few inches taller, e.g., if I have a sleeping baby in my arms and I'm trying to put her down, I have to clumsily walk into the tent on my knees. But the dimensions are clearly stated so it's my fault for not realizing how inconvenient the low ceiling could be for my family.",

With all of the time you same setting it up and taking it down..... the extra care and time taken to neatly gather it up will keep you happy with it....Or use a small bungee cord to wrap it up and though the bag away.",
