It started about once a week and now happens about 3-4 time daily. After jumping though all the hoops with Vizio Support they offered me credit towards another piece of crap Vizio purchase. But I'll never own another Vizio TV the rest of my life. I will sell this to a Pawn shop and buy a different brand. Do not buy Vizio. Do not buy this model.",

They only thing I would change is the app menu seems to pop up each time you turn it on, I would like a software update that would change this so that it only pops up when I engage it. Thank you Vizio for offer such a fantastic product and price!!",

I have to switch to another input and then back to get it to work. I figure it\u2019s only going to get worse so I ordered a curved Samsung 4K with HDR.

However, this is next to impossible for this kind of issue since this problem only occurs when things are moving rapidly on the screen and taking a picture of this does not show anything. Other than this issue, it's a nice product, but this is a deal breaker with me. Never will buy a Vizio again.",

Ultimately the Wi-Fi receiver in the TV wouldn't maintain a consistent connection to my secure router without me registering the MAC address of the TV to my network. Once that was done it worked great, but it took me an hour of troubleshooting to get to that point. Otherwise though this thing is light weight and a fantastic value.",
