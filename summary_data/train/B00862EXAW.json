Unfortunately I had already thrown out my old blender which was better then the Ninja. I then ordered the Oster and I have to say, despite the very basic functions and design, this machine works really well. It's a bit noisy (it's a BLENDER after all) but my smoothies come out...well - smooth! Much better than the more expensive one. I'm very happy with my purchase.",

Now I live in a house with 3 kids, a dog, and always have my radio blasting in the back ground so I'm used to noise, but this blender makes me jump every time I tried to blend something. I thought I'd get used to it, but thought to myself, that I shouldn't have to get used to such noise so I returned it after 3 days. I got a kitchen-aid blender for about $20 more and it's amazing the difference. No need to suffer folks, pass on this one, unless of course you really don't mind the noise. lol",
