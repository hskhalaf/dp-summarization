The plastic lever inside the chute which tells the machine that a ball has been dropped in gets depressed when a ball is dropped in, & the lever doesn't pop back out, so the machine can't recognize a ball in in the chute & will not launch, Called the number given (949-599-8313), no one answers and it says the mailbox is not set up.",
