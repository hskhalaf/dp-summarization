She can fold it up when not in use and it stores nicely in a hallway or behind a door without taking up too much space. When she does use it, it provides just enough padding for her to practice her kick overs, round offs and bridges.",

(I live in a small NYC studio, so...) and my friend actually found it to be very comfortable. LOVE these mats!",

I bought one of these to put under my yoga mat, but it didn't give me quite enough area for some of the postures, so I bought another one and put them side-by-side with my yoga mat straddling them. It's not the perfect setup, but I've been using them this way for a year now with no sagging on the edges where they meet. I also really like having two folding mats because it makes them easy to store in my apartment.",

Thankfully, it is not. Would I buy again? Definitely. And in fact, I may buy one for my wife!",

Most remarkable to me though is the fact that it does not smell plasticky or otherwise unpleasant right out of the box - quite neutral even with one's nose planted next to it.",
