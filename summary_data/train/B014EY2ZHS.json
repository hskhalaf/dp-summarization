I used to wear Crocs at work, but they are ugly and caused plantar fasciitis from lack of arch support. These shoes fit perfectly, are extremely comfortable, and look very nice as well. When wearing my scrubs, you can\u2019t even tell they\u2019re not tennis shoes. I will definitely remember this brand and product when these shoes eventually wear out or get disgusting from the OR. They are also very affordable. Absolutely recommend.",
