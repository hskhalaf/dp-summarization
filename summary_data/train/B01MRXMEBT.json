      "title": "Not for wide feet",
      "text": "These shoes are really good, except for people with wide feet. If you are using a (.5) size be aware that there is an elastic running from the tongue to the side. This squeezes the foot and creates cramps. See the pic for the piece I'm referring to. It has taken me months to get the piece to stretch out enough to stop causing cramps. I still can't tighten the shoes properly though. I buy Merrell as the sizing works for me and this is the only shoe I've had this problem on. Outside of that though these shoes are great and perform as you would expect. They get a solid 4 stars.",

      "text": "Slightly more substantial and hence warmer and dryer than the Merrell vapor glove. Doesn\u2019t entirely lose the barefoot feel, but on balance I find the wider toe box and better feel from the sole preferable in the vapor glove. Not convinced entirely by the clever tongue that forms part of th pe shoe on one side and is attached by elastic on th other. Not a bad transitional barefoot shoe or one for rough terrain or less pleasant weather.",

The build and fit is good, nice and snug and they feel secure when put to the test.",
