Cons: - Pillows Only gripe I have is I wish the pillows inside were like really small (wrist size) so I could wrap my watch in closed position around it. The strap stays in weird overlap position, I feel it will get damaged scratched up by rubbing against next link over time. Same box with small wrist size soft pillows(to allow for variable wrist sizes) would have been perfect.",

      "text": "I just received this watch box today, I got it in black and cream, and it looks nice. The stitching is all even and nicely done. However this box is not as advertised. The top is definitely not glass, but some kind of clear plastic. On mine, the keys work, but the lock is a joke. The average three-year-old could get into this box with a bobby pin or paperclip it under a minute. Since I don\u2019t intend locking it, I don\u2019t care, but if you want a lock, keep looking. Despite its shortcomings it will do the job for me. It will hold the six watches I have now with room for six more. For the price, it\u2019s reasonable.",

The reason for the four stars is due to the very small cushions that the watches fit on for placement in box. And some of my watches don\u2019t fit around them, they won\u2019t fasten for a snug fit. So, if your not careful moving the box the watches and the holders will slide around and come out of their individual units. Kind of annoying but nonetheless pleased overall.",

I have to unclasp my watches, put on the cushion then reclasp them. 2. Change the latch on the front so you don't have to squeeze the tabs to open it. This becomes a 2 handed operation. If I want it locked I'll use the key. Other than that, can't beat these for the quality vs price.",
