Doable, but a headache and easily remedied by having a real threaded attachment. Didn't drop the rating for this though, since once that is done the daily operation of the Aquawinder is a dream.

TWO UNITS.....same problem. Thy should make a better design. So, I manually move the hose left and right during rewind. Left hand helping push the hose in to the box, right hand moving the hose around the reel from left to right so it does not bunch up. If this issue dis not exist, and the rewid was a bit more powerful (and my water preeure is great) it would be a 5-star device.",

It will pull the entire length of hose without a pause. Now the hose is always stashed away nicely which also help prolong it's life. The wicker looks helps it not stand out like a sore thumb as well.",

Flip the switch and the power of the water pressure spins an internal impeller that cranks the hose in for you. Note that water is discharged out of a separate discharge hose (included) while it is doing this. However, if you point the discharge hose toward your garden or flower bed, or collect it, it is not wasted. Discharge hose needs to be attached to a nipple. It helps to squirt a little silicone lube or disch soap on the nipple first to ease insertion.",
