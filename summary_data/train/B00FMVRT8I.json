The product is very light weight and gives you a natural looking glow (which I really like because I am not a fan of overly glittery, chunky, or blinding highlights). I got this for about the same price as I would have gotten from Sephora but it was a bit cheaper and did arrive a lot quicker than it would have had I ordered from there",

    "description": "A limited-edition palette featuring three shades of Ambient Lighting Powder, the high-tech, soft-focus finishing powder that features state-of-the-art technology to recreate the most exquisitely flattering types of light. Create your perfect light. Ambient Lighting Powder is a groundbreaking collection of finishing powders that capture, diffuse, and soften the way light reflects on your skin. Unlike traditional powders, which merely cloak imperfections, Ambient Lighting Powder utilizes photoluminescent technology to filter out harsh light and refine the appearance of the complexion. The powders deliver a multidimensional luminescence to every skintone, making it appear softer and lit from within. The finishing powders enhance skin in any type of light, including flash photography. With three universal shades available in the Ambient palette, you can create your desired effect. It is formulated Without: - Parabens This palette includes one new limited-edition shade, Incandescent Light, and two existing shades, Dim Light and Radiant Light. It also comes with a complimentary 0.16 oz deluxe mini sample of Veil Mineral Primer. This product is free of talc, gluten, fragrance, and nanoparticles. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I learned early on how different types of light can truly flatter the complexion. Growing up, my mother had pink light bulbs in all of the lamps throughout the house. She loved pink light because it was the softest and most flattering, and she always wanted to look good. I used this concept of lighting in Ambient Lighting Powder.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Carisa Janes, Hourglass Founder",
