But she was taking two pairs of shoes and wearing a pair, so I thought it might help keep things clean and neat in her suitcase. She ended up using them and had not one complaint. If you travel, you need something to keep shoes from ending up on your clean clothes. I have used shower caps in the past, they were from the dollar store and cheap. And the shoes were knocked around and ended up on my clothes. So this is why I pushed her using these.",

Not sure, but at any rate, I think I had to reinstall one twice last time I took this on a trip. Luckily, we had a little safety pin handy. If you know that trick, it's not too hard, except at the end you have to watch out for the seam allowance -- it can stick out and block the channel. If you hit it, you have to back up the safety pin and figure out how to push the seam allowance out of the way.",

These nylon shoe bags also add further lens protection from nicks and dings inside my camera backpack during travel.",

When we packed to leave one hotel to go to the next city on our stop, we just slid our dirty shoes and soiled clothes into these bags and tossed them into our suitcases with everything else, with no worries about the filth of Rome or Florence getting on our clean garments. They took some of the stress out of our traveling, (at least for a mom) and every little bit of help is very much appreciated!",
