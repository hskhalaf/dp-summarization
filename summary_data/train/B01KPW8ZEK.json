This collapses flat and takes no room at all, so I will always have it in the car with me! Highly recommend!!!!!",

Set it on the back seat of car and were able to save time & money by having breakfast, snacks, drinks, & lunch available at my fingertips. Never leaked, restocked with ice from hotel every night and all stayed cold. And it can be used over & over again.

Had straps to create a handle for carrying upstairs or into the house easily. Great item, shipped fast, thank you!",

Only downside is that it doesn\u2019t keep your food and drinks with ice in it colder for more than a day. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this if you\u2019re going camping and looking for a cooler to last you several days. Only really good for a day trip (but that\u2019s what I bought it for) something to keep in mind when you\u2019re considering buying",
