      "text": "This is a review for the 8\" Sony DPF-D82 digital photo frame. The frame looks good, is well designed, very easy to use. The photos look great. I loaded the pictures on a Kigston SD6/4GB SDHC memory card, plugged it in the unit, and the frame operated flawlessly. You can display the photos a number of different ways, controlled by a remote. A bit more expensive than some of the competition, but worth it.",

We kept the Sony frame for ourselves and like the picture quality very much. Great picture clarity.",

That said, the image is wide screen, which is the direction the newer digital cameras are going. I am displaying the 50 to 90 year old family photos that are in an album on a shelf. Slective croping was needed to match the pictures to the display. I would recommend this product to anyone in the market for a digital frame, but you should understand the charastics of this product and the pictures you expect to display.",

We've experimented with the edited pictures but, after just loading some recently taken pictures, that's not entirely it. Best I can surmise is that Sony, as usual, have put in some proprietary format that doesn't make it compatible with all format sizes. When the pictures do work, they show brilliantly. Unfortunately, like all consumer electronic manuals, they are written by the pharmaceutical companies. You get so frustrated after trying to decipher the gibberish, you need a valium or stronger afterwards. Tried to reach Sony -- after a week, no response. So, they will be returned.",
