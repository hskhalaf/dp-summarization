If you are using them for a smart phone or tablet, install the free klipsh app, it will allow you to customize the mic for skip, play, pause, etc. Even though the app is for the S4, it still works. No volume control, but that's not a big downside for me.. Also, they come with 6 different silicone tips, be sure to try them all, as the fit is important to the sound you hear.",

I found these for cheaper online and ordered them and am happy to have them back in my ears. I use them when I am riding my motorcycle to listen to music and limit the amount of wind noise. I would suggest using them in reverse, that is the left bud in your right ear and right bud in your left ear. This allows them to sit flush with the ear and thus reduces the pressure of your helmet pushing the helmet into your ears.",

This is the ultimate hassle-free headphone thanks to a nifty single-button remote and mic which gives you total control of both your playlist and phone calls on virtually all of your mobile devices.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nKLIPSCH S3M BLACK IN-EAR HEADPHONES\nSpecifically engineered for mobile devices, the Klipsch S3m headphones give you a front stage pass to your music collection whether you are an Apple, Android*, Windows or BlackBerry user. Universal Headphone for Any Device \nThis is the ultimate hassle-free headphone thanks to a nifty single-button remote and mic which gives you total control of both your playlist and phone calls on virtually all of your mobile devices. The S3m also features durable, tangle resistant cables to alleviate the anguish of unkinking a clump of wires. \n\nLegendary Klipsch Sound \nNo matter your device, the S3m brings the best possible sound, producing dazzling highs and lows befitting of the Klipsch audiophile heritage. The S3m utilizes a customized 5.8mm moving-coil driver to deliver smooth, full-bodied sound that can hold its own. \n\nPatented Oval Ear Tips\nHeadphones can sound great, but if they don\u2019t fit, you\u2019re not going to want to put them in your ears. Unlike traditional, circular-shaped ear tips which don't fit properly in your oval-shaped ear canal, the S3m utilizes the patented Klipsch oval ear tip design making them virtually impossible to feel and perfect for long-term wear. Oval ear tips fit better, feel better and only Klipsch has them. \n\nThe excellent seal gained from the oval ear tips allows the S3m to have superior noise isolating capabilities, blocking unwanted background noise from reaching your ears. \n\nAll About the Extras\nAvailable in black, white, blue, red and jade, the S3m is able to complement your fashion choices as well as functioning with virtually any device that has a standard 3.5mm headphone jack. The S3m comes with three pairs of different-sized oval ear tips, clothing clip, a carrying case and 2-year warranty. \n\nFunctionality\nUsing the S3m\u2019s one-button remote and microphone, it is possible to: \n\nAnswer/end calls Volume up/down Play/pause Track forward/track back *To enable complete functionality of your S3m headset on Android, please download the free Klipsch Control App.",
