But for just a little over $200 per tire for a 10ply 35x12.5x20, I had to give them a try. I tell you so far they feel like they run smoother than my OEM Michelin tires. They do have a little more noise to them but nothing too bad for such an aggressive looking tire. These along with my new 20\" Method wheels has totally transformed the look of my truck. Only time will tell how long they will last but I may have found my new favorite tire.",

    "description": "The Courser MXT is an extreme off-road mud terrain tire perfect for light truck owners and extreme off-roaders seeking aggressive off-road traction and excellent handling on the highway. The MXT sports an attractive side biter design and wide, deep tread grooves for superior off-road mud and snow traction performance.The amount of rubber on the road is optimized to provide excellent extreme terrain traction and enhanced driving feel while the aggressive, deep \"side biter\" design increases off-road traction, and sidewall abrasion resistance.The scallops provide a \"mud-scoop\" effect, for superior off-road traction. Traction edges on the alternating shoulder elements add additional biting edges for improved lateral grip. The wide grooves between the outer tread blocks allow the MXT to easily clean out, increasing grip for superior traction. Siping for increased wet traction on the highway also provides extra biting edges for enhanced off-road traction. Even at half worn, 80% of the MXT's sipes remain functional, providing for more consistent performance throughout the life of the tire.Specifications - Size Load Rating Diameter Cross Section Max Load Sidewall 35X12.50R20E34.6912.53195BW",
