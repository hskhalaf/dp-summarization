I'm very happy with this purchase.",

It also does not go out very far and probably goes out about 75 feet and returns. I think the problem with it is just too light and small. It's probably perfect for kids though but for an adult I think it's too lightweight.",

My son, who is 11 years old, has a hard time getting this boomerang to come back to him. He didn't have any problem at all with the cheap \"classic\" style boomerang. I'll probably have to order one of that style now.",

I would recommend the Polypropylene Pro Sports Boomerang, which is the same price, flies much farther, faster, and is easier to control.",
