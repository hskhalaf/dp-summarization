      "text": "I got this wheel not for yoga, but to roll out and open my back for pain relief. I do regularly see a physical therapist and get adjusted weekly. However, sometimes you wake up and your back just hurts. That's when this wheel comes in handy! It's nice to roll out your back, you do hear your spine crack from the adjustment. This takes a little time to get used to, but once you get the knack for it, it's a trusty little device. Again, I haven't tried it for yoga, but that is my next step!",
