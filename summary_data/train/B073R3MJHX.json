The light fixture came assembled. Only had to screw on outter ring. This fixture is solid & heavy and seems well made.",

The lights look incredible! They were delivered in a few days, my husband installed them without any problems (all parts were there, no issues).

That won't be a problem once we install a dimmer switch. It looks great with our decor and everyone that comes in compliments it. It took my husband 30 mins tops to install it.

My handyman was able to adjust it so no problem. Just know that it can be moved about somewhat. The nickel is thin & fixture is light but it was a good value & looks good. It hangs above my small table in my breakfast nook.",

I sold everything from high end brands, to low end so I have to say when this arrived I didn\u2019t have high hopes but after reading the reviews, and needing something to put up quick while being on a tight budget, I was impressed when I pulled it out of the box! For the value, you absolutely cannot beat this! The finish is great, the size was perfect, and it is sturdy while achieving the look you\u2019d otherwise get with lights that are two-three time more expensive. Best of all my hubs had no problem installing. Highly recommend!",
