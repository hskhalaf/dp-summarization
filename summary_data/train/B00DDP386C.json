      "text": "The sleeping bag is very warm, as advertised. However- after using it for 1 single winter (not even camping- using it in my bed cause my house has poor insulation) the zipper came off the track. So, I tried to put it back on the track as anybody would- and it broke apart because it is super cheap casted pot metal. So this basically is just a big blanket now, not a sleeping bag that zips up. All they had to do is put a good brass zipper on it, perhaps a YKK made zipper. Wish I would have bought a different bag that would have lasted longer.",

This didn't matter at all to me since I was not hiking with it. I didn't deduct a star for that reason; this is a great sleeping bag for normal camping but it's no replacement for the ultralight bags which cost four times as much.

I used this bag the first night that it came, very quickly I might add, and it kept me warm and cozy, even though I could have had the truck running. I shut all the power off in the truck, as a test, and had no chills at all in -5 weather. Excellent product, and I recommend it highly.",

Also, I personally felt that the bag was harder to roll-up than any of the previous sleeping bags I have owned. To compress it adequately, you must fold it into thirds. This may sound picky, but since the outer material is so slick, it was tough to keep it tightly rolled up. I imagine this is true with many other brands, but why should it much extra time? Otherwise, the bag seemed very comfortable. I'm 6' 1\" and I had plenty of room down below. I did return it.",

Unless you have a hefty back pack, and a strong back and body that doesn't mind the extra weight. For me this is a more ideal sleeping bag for car camping, which is what I bought it for.

My plan is to Google solutions for keeping the zipper in place, maybe something like wax. Otherwise, it's a great bag for the price.",

I use to pile up blankets, and I would still get cold. This however, saved the day and I was cozy warm.
