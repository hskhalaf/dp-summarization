I have tested this card in a new rig for a customer and it runs COD perfectly well with the settings pushed past medium settings (which is ample). Overclocking is also very simple with MSI's simple-to-use software. Overall I would recommend this card if your budget doesn't stretch to a 1070 level card.",
