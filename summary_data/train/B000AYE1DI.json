      "text": "This item is NOT as described--it is NOT asphalt-impregnated. It is priced at the rate for the asphalt wrap, but is the standard double layer wrap. I talked to the owner of the company which produced it and he said the asphalt tape does not have the green writing on it. It simply has a sticker with the UPC code. This product should be priced at about $15 per roll. He said the retail for the asphalt-impregnated wrap is about $21 (plus shipping). Bottom line--this is NOT as described, and far overpriced for what it is. It is an excellent tree wrap, but if you need the insect and rodent protection provided by asphalt, this is NOT for you.",

I was especially concerned about the description that claimed a thin layer of asphalt was part of the tape's construction since that is what I wanted to further deter small rodent damage. I've had great success with that type for years. I thought surely by now the description would have either changed or the shipping error corrected. WRONG. My tape does not contain the asphalt as advertised, but due to time constraints I am forced to use what was sent.",
