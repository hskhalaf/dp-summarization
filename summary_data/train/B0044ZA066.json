Its high points include its compact size, the good quality flexible band for attaching the handle, and its ease of use for brewing a cup or two of coffee. The downsides include requiring multiple batches for more than a couple cups (\"Hang on, company, just one more batch!\"), and some irregularities in granule size at coarse grade grinding. I would never recommend this for espresso grinding, but it has greatly enriched my French Press experience. Thanks, Porlex!",

      "text": "This grinder grinds the coffee as fine as gunpowder. That may be fine for espresso coffee. But I want a coarser grind for my French press coffee maker. There are several grinds . . . fine through coarse . . . on the box. But ALL the instructions are in Japanese. Does anyone know how to adjust the coarseness of the grind? Thanks. for the link to instructions to adjust the texture of the ground coffee. It is as easy at that.",

Instead holding down on a flat surface with one hand, and turning the lever with the other, I hold it in mid-air turning both hands at the same time. Sort of a bicycle pedaling motion on on the horizontal plane. Very effective.",

The grinder is nicely adjustable and comes apart easily for cleaning. The only problem, as others have stated, is that the crank handle will often slip off of the shaft. You can develop a technique where you tilt your wrist to create downward pressure on the shaft end of the handle but the handle will still slip off pretty regularly.",
