The sound is more than adequate for my small living room, if a little bass heavy. It's the connectivity that's the problem. Super, it aint. Whether on Spotify or internet radio, the Revo unexpectedly goes silent after a while, displaying 'press play' on the LCD. Unfortunately, pressing play does nothing and the only way to get further sound out of the thing is to unplug from the mains and plug back in. Contacting Revo was a waste of time as they simply blamed Spotify.",

I contacted Amazon who were out of stock for a replacement, and I'm not prepared to chance buying from another seller who mightn't be as accommodating of returns (I'm in Ireland).

If I could rate only the radio: 5/5 Sound 5/5 Versatility 5/5 Ease of use (just get used to the joystick and it's a much better input device as it saves retail space, love you can just put your hand over the speaker and it mutes the alarm!) The app (not developed by the makers of the radio) brings my rating down.",
