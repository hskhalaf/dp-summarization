It was clearly marked as 8 oz so that's on me. Their Himalayan salt scrub is 20 oz so that's the size I was expecting. While the coffee scent is wonderful and it seems to moisturize and exfoliate very well, I just can't get past what a mess it is to use this. Brown coffee grounds get all over the place no matter how carefully I scoop it out. I'll stick with the salt scrub which seems to moisturize and exfoliate even better without the mess.",

Also, there is no miracle cure for spider veins and cellulite but I believe this is one important step for manually improving circulation (without paying for a massage every other day) and reducing aching legs. I use it in the mornings and you better believe my brain responds to that coffee scent! My boyfriend admits to sneaking some for his face, which has actually helped with the ingrown mustache hairs. So there you go! Multipurpose and the price is right.",

My batch was a little dry and my container was not filled all the way, about 3/4ths of the way filled. But all in all it was a pretty good product. I do LOVE art naturals.",
