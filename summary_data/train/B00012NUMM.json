It takes a really strong wind to make it touch the pipes. So, with a strong wind you will occasionally hear it ring. It still sounds great, no cheap clanking whatsoever. Usually 2-3 notes at a time. Surprisingly rich for a chime with just five tubes. I hang it only on very windy days, that's the only way to hear it ring.",
