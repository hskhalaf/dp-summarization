The 2 made in the USA trailer tires I have on the trailer took me less then 10 minutes to mount both of them.

If it was Mid-Summer I would cruised at 68-72mph do to hot road temps could likely cause a blow-out. So keep that in mind while pulling. If your inexperienced at towing I do not recommend towing at those high speeds. Compensating Stop time nearly triples if your trailer doesn\u2019t have a brake system.",

They buckle the side walls at 80 psi way more than the old bias with just 50psi in the bias tires. They have a Very soft side wall and this allows the trailer (7.5'x18') to sway a lot more than the original bias tires.
