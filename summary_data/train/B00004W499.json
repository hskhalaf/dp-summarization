We have a small, deep kitchen sink and it's a little bit of a pain to hold while cleaning. But this does not take away from a very capable grill. Invest in a few sponges made to clean this type of grill. Highly recommended grill!",

When I'm done cooking, I let it cool then soak in a laundry tub for about 15 minutes. After a light rub down with a Scrub Daddy it's spotless and ready to use again.

But, this season, I decided to try out the George Foreman indoor/outdoor grill. Figured I'd give it to a relative if I didn't like it all that well.. hehehe. This thing rocks. Cooks steaks in no time (at setting 4, or 5 if you like it a bit pink in the middle), and just about anything/everything else.",

So, George had it all wrong, you do need a little grease for the burgers, but he got it right with this one. The temp control seems to work pretty well too.

    "title": "George Foreman 15-Serving Indoor/Outdoor Electric Grill, Silver, GGR50B",
    "description": "Color:Silver| Pattern Name:Electric GrillThis is how real fast food is made. The George Foreman 4-Serving Removable Plate Grill and Panini heats up 35% faster* to deliver hot, tasty food that\u2019s made your way. Cleanup is just as fast thanks to the dishwasher-safe removable plates. They come with the George Tough nonstick coating that holds up through cooking and cleaning, alike. This is the must-have grill for couples or small families who want easy, delicious meals. *compared to current removable plate grill, GRP0004 **from 1/4lb. uncooked 80/20 ground chuck ***compared to standard George Tough\u2122 non-stick coating\n\nAMAZON.COM\nGrilling really can't get much easier than this. After assembling the grill (which takes only a few minutes), simply plug it in and allow about 10 minutes to fully preheat the surface while you gather your steaks, kebabs, or whatever's to be grilled. The electric heat has an adjustable range from low (for keeping food warm) to high (for searing steaks). The nonstick grill surface not only means you can use a minimum of added fat, but it also makes cleanup a cinch. The surface has a subtle slope, with channels that draw accumulated fat or other liquids into a tray just below the surface. The high domed and vented lid helps create a circular flow of hot air to ensure even cooking--particularly important for a large roast or whole chicken.\n\n The grill can be placed either directly on a tabletop or atop its pedestal. On its own, the grill surface stands about 6 inches high; with the pedestal, it stands about 2-1/2 feet high, not counting the domed lid. The pedestal is plenty sturdy for cooking, but the grill still seems a bit top-heavy, so pay special attention if grilling in a high-traffic area or near kids. Because of the easy electric heat, this grill can be used outdoors or indoors--when using it indoors, though, be prepared for potential spattering, steam, or other side effects of cooking. --Cynthia Nims",
