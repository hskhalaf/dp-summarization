      "text": "I would not recommend purchasing a grill from Dynaglo. My lid had a welding defect (see photo) and the left hinge broke away from the lid and therefore this assembly needed to be completely replaced. Rather than disassemble the whole grill and send back to Amazon I chose to pursue a replacement lid under warranty. I had conversations with two different customer service reps on 2 successive days and they both promised a response that day once I emailed them proof of purchase. They were less than friendly and I still don\u2019t have any response. Not very good customer service in my book.",

Unit arrived with a few dents and scratches due to all parts being somewhat loosely packed inside the barrel. Some areas did not get a full coat of paint resulting in rust upon delivery. Lack of an ash catcher is its main flaw. Quite a few gaps around the lid. Still decent but would not suggest paying more than the current $100 for it.",

The only problem I have is that to be able to attach the thermometer to the cover this one has to have a threaded hole which came plain. I try to contact Dyna-Glo customer service by phone and using their web page but is imposible. I really don't want to return the whole product (is really heavy and a nightmare for the logistics) but will have to.",

I did buy an \"open box\" warehouse deals grill for a substantial discount so I can't really complain. Now for the good news I love it and it robust, The thing that I think will help other customers realize that this is much better quality then the many look a-likes is the weight. The walls and lid of this are thick and that makes all the difference when it comes to long term use! Great product",

      "text": "Great grill, well made and easy to use. Set up is a pain and the manufacturer could have made it much easier by welding the flange pieces to the firebox instead of making you bolt them on. Otherwise assembly is straightforward. My only dislike is that the door on the side of the firebox does not extend down to the bottom of the side requiring you to scoop out ash instead of scraping it out. That said, it makes a better seal then the doors that do not have a lower lip. All in all I am very please with my grill.",

You don't get everything for this price: it is not so airtight that you can kill the fire by closing the vents, but you won't get that for this price (Webers may close tightly for a short time, but mine never did for long).",
