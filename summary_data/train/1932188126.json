Instead of following the rules we have just started dumping them on the table when we visit with family/friends and make a rule (no less than 5 letter words) or pick a theme (oceans, holidays, things, people, places) and have the common goal of using every single tile.

It is a time-based game of who can use all their tiles the fastest. I wouldn't recommend this game be played in a group that is not evenly matched- it is very obvious if a player is falling behind more quick spellers, and could result in bad feelings. It only works well if everyone is evenly matched.",

Usually after a while one of us improves in a game to a point when we can't lose. But Bananagrams offers a fun, quick paced game that we both enjoy and both want to kill eachother over.

Despite an almost no win record it's still fun and I like the speed. We've reworked the rules to include abbreviations which helps adult beginners enormously and I use the cell phone/google to look up words faster than I can flipping through a dictionary. Google can decipher my spelling and get me where I want to go.",
