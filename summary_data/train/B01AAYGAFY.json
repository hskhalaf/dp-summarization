That being said, it does have good suction and cleans well. It's just not the right vacuum for me.",

I purchased this one and to be honest...this one picks up the hair better and actually is easier to use with better attachments for 1/3 the cost. So... if you are on the fence which one to buy...buy this one. It really is an awesome vacuum. No regrets so far!!",

First they said my order was shipped and on the way, then a week later they said it was not shipped and they have no idea when the filters will be available to ship.

After using it three times, I will be returning it and trying something else. The rotating head is always shutting off because hair is wrapped around it, and while the suction is strong enough for sand & lint on the floor, it doesn't pick up dog hair (we have an American bulldog) in our low pile accent rugs. I think this would be a great product for someone that doesn't have pets or anyone with long hair.",

      "text": "Not happy with the overall performance of this vacuum. Even though I clean out the vacuum after each use, sometimes when their is a small amount of dirt/dog hair, the cyclone does not spin which makes the vacuum lose suction. The floor piece works good enough, but hair gets stuck in the brushes and is very hard to remove. Also dirt collects above the brushes. The 3-piece tool set is very cheap. I use the brush piece a lot and it is so flimsy which makes it harder to clean woodwork. Also, the cord is not very long, so I added an extension cord to be able to move from room to room (I live in a small apt,).",

Finally, the hose kinks continuously. Overall poor performance - I would not recommend this vacuum for any carpeted areas.",

It would have helped to mention the all plastic hose in the description. Otherwise, a good little vacuum.",

      "text": "The floor attachment power runs through the suction hose, taking up space in the hose. This provides a perfect place for hair to get stuck while traveling up the hose and soon leads to clogs and a loss of suction. These are very difficult to clean out as the hair is wrapped around the power cord inside the hose. Also, it is not very easy to pull around and we have since thrown it out for a different brand.",

      "text": "I like the unit in general. The cup is small but easy to clean out every time I use it. Unfortunately the hose kinks very frequently. This stops the suction on the unit completely. I am sure this will lead to the hose ultimately cracking and needing to be replaced, a rather poor choice for a vacuum cleaner hose. The unit is also not exactly filter free. There are two additional filters. One before the motor and one after. Why aren't both before the motor to protect that as well as keep the room dust free? It seems that the unit is designed to fail.",

I thought buy spending a fair amount of money would be beneficial, not In this case for sure.!",

      "text": "It is a cheaply made vacuum. It is lightweight, and easy to maneuver. The hose is thin and kinks often. The filter needs to be removed and washed after 4-5 times vacuuming the house, otherwise suction decreases quickly. Cord is short. Does not come with a floor brush. I like canister vacuums, but the power brush, always breaks after a few years and I end up trying a different vacuum which never lasts very long.",

I'm super disappointed in whomever compared this vacuum to the Kenmore canister vac. Ugh. For the money I could have gotten my Kenmore fixed. (I was a private housekeeper for ages and the Kenmore can't be beat but I'm not a millionaire and can't afford Miele...so...) I have 3 pets 2 cats and a Chihuahua and I used diatomaceous earth to keep away little crawly demons and this vacuum immediately died but I waited too long to return it. Don't be like me kids, get a different vacuum.",

But he problem is, you have to stop every two minutes to take the plate off the back and suction that end of the tube!! We have pets and the hair builds up every 2 minutes (with daily vacuuming). If the cleaning head of the machine was perhaps a bit larger, or the tube it may work better. Suction is great! But its time consuming to use.",
