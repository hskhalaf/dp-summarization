      "text": "My 16 year old Siamese was really struggling to get around and was having a lot of pain in her hips and back legs (along with some heart and urinary problems). We tried another glucosamine product from our vet but the pills were too big to give her and when I mixed the powder in with her food she refused to eat it. I ordered this liquid and I\u2019m really blown away by the difference in her in just a week. She went from constant discomfort and very limited mobility to RUNNING (yes, she ran for the first time in almost a year!!!) this morning. I\u2019m really impressed and thrilled to see her improving so fast!",

It has a strong beefy smell to it and BJ acts like it's a cat treat. Highly recommend!!!",

After a couple months of using this she was definitely moving better, after 6 months NO LIMP! and racing around like a kitten. She likes the taste OK just messy to dose with the eye dropper. Switched to this from powdered additive as cat doesn't like wet food. Cat tolerates dosing pretty well. I switched out eye dropper that it came with for an oral dosing syringe and dispenser cap I got from my vet. Now much easier to dispense and administer. Seen definite improvement in cat's mobility.",

I figured it was happens chance, and tried this stuff again a few weeks later, but the same thing happened where he lost his appetite for several days.

One time we ran out, and her fur started looking matted again until we got more and started this treatment again. We put about 1/2 dropper full on her morning food, for a 15-pound cat.
