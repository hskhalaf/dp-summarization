I have discovered that if the kitten is only surviving on this formula and no mother\u2019s milk at all, it is important to dilute the powder a little bit than to have too much powder. Directions say use two parts warm water for one part powder. It\u2019s important to level off the powder when measuring because the kitten will become terribly constipated if the formula is too rich. If this formula is all the kitten is eating, it is important to also include a kitten probiotic in their diet. I\u2019d also recommend using the Miracle Nipple to feed.",

I switched formula to find that did not help much either. It was not till I got a cat probiotic to put into the formula that digestion became easier and started to clear it up. Cat is back on it and love the taste. Not causing runs anymore although kmr should put it into the formula to help kitties digestion.",

I mixed up some of this and put a little out whenever I fed him. He laps it up eagerly. He has regained the lost weight, has a shinier coat and will now eats his cat food. I'm so glad I found this.",
