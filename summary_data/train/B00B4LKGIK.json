I made the mistake of not letting it dry enough prior to applying eyeshadow on my first use, so the makeup didn't go on well at all. It also has the highest level of zinc oxide (17%) in a facial sunscreen compared to any other brands I've researched, so that's a definite win for someone like me who's terrified of the sun due to being riddled with melasma.",

It is super white. Can never be evenly applied to my face. It will stuck in my fine lines. Sometimes I have peeled off skin here or there due to dryness, and this sunscreen exaggerate them all. It won't make your face shinny though, just matte uneven white. I don't want to waste it, so I asked my boyfriend use it. He has fair skin tone. Even my boyfriend, a man who never cared about skin care products, hates it too!",

It never sinks in; just sits on my skin and feels thick and heavy. I don't use a ton of this either and it still feels like this, which is even worse because you're supposed to use a lot of sunscreen.

I don't use it all over the body, because its WAY too expensive, and the tube is small. However, for the face it lasts a pretty long time, because a little goes a long way, and it feels silky smooth going on. Much like a skin perfecter lotion for your face. I'm trying to find something comparable, thats maybe cheaper... but as for right now... this is what I'll stick with.. it truly is great stuff!",

It had a seal on it so they just didn\u2019t put enough sunscreen inside. Which is upsetting since I paid more than I should\u2019ve for getting less than half Of the amount",

I do put it sometimes on my anti-acne CC cream, which has some coverage, and when the two colors mix, the result is great. I love it.",
