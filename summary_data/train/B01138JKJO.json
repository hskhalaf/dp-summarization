Plenty of inputs, easy to use, great picture. They don't have built in \"smarts\" but I like that so I can add a device of my choosing that I know will work with my network, etc. Have paired these with Google Cromecasts (regular and Ultra) and it works just great! The USB port will even power the standard version, so there's no extra power needed!",

The stand is really finicky, takes a lot of precise adjusting to get it so the TV sits level. Also note that the native refresh rate is 60hz, the MEMC setting apparently makes it \"120hz,\" similar to what Vizio does about their motion technology. They should advertise this TV at 60hz though, 120 is misleading.",

If it broke after the first day and the company or Amazon refused to replace it, that would be something I might need to know. But for $227, for a 50 inch TV, seriously why are you complaining. 5 stars all day long if it lasts a year. I have had mine 3 years, no issue except the remote kinda sucks. So buy a universal remote and solve the problem. Get batteries. Stop crying!",

      "text": "Fantastic TV for the price, I play Xbox, watch live and recorded TV such as football and action movies all with no glitches or artifacts on the screen. This TV has a nice remote and 3 kind of cramped HDMI ports on it. It comes with a stand as seen in the picture, the stand is easy to assemble and seems to balance the weight of the set well. When viewing the TiVo interfaces, the black backgrounds are very dark, the Xbox has very dark greys, and overall it is a very nice picture I use on the standard settings. The energy saving setting appears to be standard picture with less backlight.",
