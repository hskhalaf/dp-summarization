When this machine was working, I would have given it a 4.5 but now that it is in need of repair and Breville seems to ignore it customer service claims I will give it 1 star out of generosity.",

I've always been impressed with the ability to get consistent shots and the frothing works great, as well. The only repair I had was a $25 pump that failed last year. I replaced it myself (since this is such a popular model, parts and instructions are easy to come by). The attention to maintainability also comes through in the recommendations for descaling. Unlike other manufacturers, Breville doesn't push customers to buy expensive descaling powder. Instead, they recommend simple vinegar. Works fine and is a lot cheaper.",

It wasn\u2019t as much about the functionality of the product as it was about the science (formula) behind making an espresso. And don\u2019t let the tutorials on YouTube convince you otherwise. I ultimately gave up after so many failed attempts and returned the devise. Additionally, if saving money is at play, the juice isn\u2019t worth the squeeze. In other words, while you might save a buck or two, the headaches from concocting some shots out weights the unnoticeable savings.",

You will need to adjust the grinding levels a couple times to get it set perfectly, however, it's pretty easy to do. The steamer steams the milk perfectly. It's easy to clean and looks great on your counter. For beginners, just be sure to follow the instructions and you will end up with a great latte or cappuccino. Would definitely recommend.

It has already paid for itself as I would spend a lot on drinks and food at the coffee shop each week. It is high quality equipment. Would highly recommended.",

It doesn't take that long to brew either, so whether I'm rushed or have time, I find myself using it a daily. Now I just need to figure out the latte art...if only it were that easy. Lol",

Is it versatile, well its an expresso machine with a bean grinder and milk steamer; it does its stated functions well, but I wouldn't say it is versatile.
