The money I saved I took and bough a used jon boat, I mean how could it get any better? Cons 1) There is light leakage on the ceiling but you should already know that if you've done your research. 2) She gets pretty hot but I'm sure they all do to a degree. Pros 1) 135\" from about 12' away in a 12' by 18' room suits my needs perfectly. Almost went 120\", I'm glad I didn't. 2) Speakers sound pretty good. 3)Great all around little unit.",

If there was 1 complaint about the volume, is that it actually cannot be turned down below a certain level...and sometimes the show/movie is too loud for what we need on the lowest volume setting (while others are trying to sleep).

Installation was super easy and it was ready to go in a few minutes. The picture quality is excellent and it projects a 100 inch picture from hardly 10 feet away. For the price point, it is more than worth your money!",

The only thing I would find unsatisfactory with it is the size. It's not too portable, and reducing size/weight would be great.",
