This thing has been a nightmare, right out the box the sound didn't work. So I had to figure out what was wrong. Got that fixed, then the video drivers weren't installed correctly, given me errors when I tried to launch the control panel. I fixed that. Now I can play my games,so far it's working ok, but I get this annoying screen flicking and dimming. Haven't figure this out yet, but I certainly would buy one of these again.",

I really was jealous, that we in Germany weren't able to buy this tablet. But now everything is okay, Amazon made it possible, thanks again. Now to you guys at Razer, you really did a good job, design this device. I hope there will be another Razer Edge in future, I really love this device. For me and I think many other fans, it is really a pity, that you stopped the Razer Edge and the accessories. For now I am happy, thumbs up!!!!! Sorry for my English. Bye",

I think the drivers or programming could be improved since there are some blinking windows with the start.",

If you have the extra money, hop on board.....if you plan on purchasing all of the accessories (dock, keyboard dock, ext battery, gamepad controller) I'd say purchase the Blade instead unless you want that portability and options.",
