      "text": "After doing weeks of research, I really liked the overall specs of this monitor for my budget range. After setting up,everything went downhill from there. The picture was very crisp and clear but the colors were awful....not even close to what I had hoped for. I tried literally for hours to get a decent color scheme that looked somewhat realistic and close to my IPad Pro display, but nothing worked. The \u201ctouch sensitive\u201d controls are not very user friendly which did not help in trying to attain a decent display. I do not think my expectations were too high, I just wanted a monitor that performed as promised. Will be returning.",

Clarity on HDMI is great and VGA is really good too. I run a security camera system which I share on this 2nd monitor with my laptop and works great for both viewings as I switch between them.",

I thought that may solve my problem, but it didn't. I had to put a space between them so the tilt would not be as niticible. If you are looking for a multi-monitor setup, look elsewhere. They do not line up well. On top of that, they sound like crap. You can return them, but they will charge you to ship them back. The only pro is that they do look nice as standalone monitors. Total let down.",

However, if you elevate the monitor (on a book or similar surface), it seems to alleviate the \"problem\". All in all, I'd buy a second one to have dual monitor capability but my desk isn't big enough. When it is, consider another monitor purchased.",

Cons: - The settings buttons in the bottom are really complicated to use specially in the beginning and comes with some unnecessary options that I hate. - I didn't come with a HDMI cable. Wtf? - Don't expect a super good sound. But it's decent. Bottomline: I really recommend this display, specially for design or developing tasks.",

Within a couple of days the aluminum strip at the bottom of the monitor started lifting up (seems only double sided tape holds this on). The touch sensor menu buttons seem kind of cool in concept, but the reality is, it is easy too easy to touch the wrong sensor bringing you into the wrong menu, which you then have to then navigate out of. The menu layout is not terribly intuitive either.",
