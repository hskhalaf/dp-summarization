I have no idea how anyone could workout with these. I am sticking with my tried but true Spirit X by Anker. They have a cord that sits on the back of your neck that I thought was bothersome until I tried these. Why doesn't one of the wireless head phone companies make the wireless with the wrap around for the ears but without the cord tying them together?",

Less-expensive IEDs either sounded wrong or kept falling out of my big ear canals or got stuck in the charging position when I used XL ear canal inserts on the IEDs.

They are there but lack the sparkle found in very expensive wireless earbuds. I am fond of Sennheiser headphones and own the HD600 and HD598. These sound similar. Bass is strong but not overpowering.

They are fairly comfortable and secure in the ear. They have basic phone and playback functions but do not have volume controls, so one must use the controls on the source, but that\u2019s not really a problem. The only negative: I needed very bright light and a magnifying glass to read the manual.",

Sound canceling not great. But over all sound quality is excellent. And they are stylish and look great. This is my 3rd pair. I started with a cheap pair around 20 dollars then bought a 50 dollar pair then these at 100 dollars. The old adage is true every time .. you get what you pay for. Am happy with price and product. I would recommend these if you can afford a great pair of buds for the price.",

They also stuck out of my ears and that wasn't great. The headphones I chose were fit better and have bone conduction technology so I can hear my surroundings while exercising and fit more snug.",

      "text": "I've had these for 5 months now and really thought they were a great deal until recently. I think the sound quality is excellent for the price and the jazz that I listen to most sounds clean and clear on them. I don't have a need for a heavy bass and glad they don't have that. Unfortunately I updated the firmware using the 1MORE Music App and while that gave me volume controls (nice feature), I'm now getting sound distortions about every 20 seconds, little blurps that interrupt the flow of the talk or music. It's really distracting. I would discourage you from using that app until they fix that bug (it's version 0.40.00 that's causing the trouble).",
