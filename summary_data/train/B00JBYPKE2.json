It cuddles her so well. She loves it. She's our 3rd baby. We have tons of carseats at home, but still decided to buy Maxi Cosi products new for her. They are so beautiful. We got lots of compliments everywhere we go. The air cushion help the baby not to get too hot in the car seat. Our baby survived 100+ degree temperature in this carseat! It is rather large though - we had to buy a combi for our Ford CMAX Energi, because this one won't fit.",
