The PureCadence 7 has corrected the issues they introduced with version 5 by making the upper and tongue softer and seemed to widen the toe box a bit. The sole is firm and provides good support. Version 7 seems to run about 1/4 size smaller than before--not enough for me to change size, but if you were snug before, it may be tight.",
