That is a bit of an annoyance as the images for the device show a Unifying receiver and they use the term Unifying in the description. BEWARE. I've included an image of the 2 K360s side by side.",

I was lucky if 75% of the keystrokes registered and it was completely useless in any game where movement is achieved from holding a keyboard key. I tried several times to eliminate any signal interference and even tried being just a foot from the receiver and results were always the same so either its very sensitive to any interference or just a really terrible keyboard in its own rite.",
