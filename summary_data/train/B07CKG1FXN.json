A bit slow when connects to the laptop, takes a few seconds to kick on screens or may not kick on at all. Then i have to disconnect laptop and connect again. 250 quit and this is not a perfect product. I do not mention charging over USB, may work or may not.",

      "text": "An expensive little unit but it is very well made and proving very reliable, contrary to some of the negative reviews here. We have 35+ units connecting multiple devices from Macbooks to Ultrabooks and have found that aby problens are either down to drivers or the USB-C port of the connecting device. The docking stations will allow you to do the following via ONE USB-C cable Charge your Phone, laptop or tablet Display your device to 2x screens Hook up 2x USB 2, 3x USB 3 (one charging) and 1x USB-C 3 device. This has been the most universal and reliable docking station I have ever used and would highly recommend.",

However there have been occasions when the connection to my monitor and external drives was lost - and I don't yet understand why. I also cannot understand what the button on the device is meant to do. However I have one monitor and three hard drives running from it and it charges my laptop at the same time, so all of my objectives for it have been met.",
