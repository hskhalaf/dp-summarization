The plastic outdoor post and the smaller plastic indoor post with mat are just not strong enough to stay in place when thrown from proper distance. I loved the idea of playing indoors without risk of causing damage but I'm not in love. If you want a lightweight set of horseshoes for the beach or lawn play, as I said, buy metal stakes and these are truly a great alternative. Please click YES if you think my review helped you decide whether or not to purchase this product.",

The pins stay in the base well. The only con I can think of is they had a pretty strong rubber smell when we first got them, but they stay in the garage when not in use, so it really isn't a problem.",

The horseshoes are heavier than most plastic shoes I have seen, so they work well without being heavy enough to do damage if they hit the wrong thing. The only reason I didn't give this set 5-stars is that the pegs that are meant to go in the ground don't seem very strong. I'm not sure they would withstand being pushed into the ground.",
