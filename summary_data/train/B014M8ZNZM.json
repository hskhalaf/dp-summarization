It's really, really annoying - The volume control is totally bust. The range between the various volume grades is enormous. What I mean by this is that if the volume is a little low and you crank it up one notch (whether it's on the Boom or on your Bluetooth device), the volume goes from low to holy freaking @#$@# it's loud in here. No in-between. This issue almost breaks this product Not recommended. Get yourself a Bluetooth speaker with actual volume controls.",

The app stopped working for us pretty quickly (couldn't 'see' the speaker anymore) which is fine, we still connect and play music just fine anyway. I use this while working on the house and the battery life lasts about a full work day. The charger is hot garbage though. The flip out prong design, while a cute idea, is very very bad. One prong because loose almost immediately, but still functioned. The plastic eventually just disintegrated and the prong fell off. The second one fell out literally after taking the attached photo. Very poor design and quality charger, but excellent speaker with great range.",

I did manage to print in 3D a base that solves this problem. Also you can get them now at a lower price.. This is my go to speaker for my beach vacations this year!",

      "text": "Powerful little sound machine! Easy to pair with devices too. I am a professional speaker and I use it to project sound from my laptop presentation throughout my venue. It does the job whether I use it wirelessly or directly hooked up to the laptop, though I recommend using it hooked up to laptop to minimize interference from other wireless Bluetooth devices. Small size allows me to pack it in checked or carry-on luggage. It's a little tricky to insert the charging device into the unit because it is so small. I'd like to see this changed for the next model release.",

      "text": "This was a gift for my husband and he loves it. Everyone in the family uses it. Connecting the first device is super easy, when we connected it to our computer I just had to read the online instructions on how to add an additional Bluetooth device. Both pair easily now. Being able to pair up to 10 devices is a great feature. The sound is very good, much better then our last Bluetooth speaker! I have been very happy with the range we have been able to play music from the computer upstairs to the far end of the basement. We have not really tested the battery life but it has no difficulty playing for several hours straight.",

      "text": "PEOPLE - Please note that you CANNOT get loud, deep bass from a small speaker cone. It's against the laws of physics. Therefore, I am being reasonable when I review small speakers. Overall, this very cool-looking speaker sounded pretty darn good. Of course, it sounds better indoors, where is does not \"work\" as hard. The battery lasts a pretty long time. It's an object of beauty (in my opinion). The only down side is - $179 is a tad pricey. The UE Boom 2 would sell out of it was $149. Overall, I'm pretty happy with it.",
