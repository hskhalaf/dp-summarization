I let them graze on the recommended portions throughout the day, and then crush it up and dust it over what is usually brazed chicken breast with carrots and green beans for their dinner. As a result, I happen to eat a lot of sandwiches...but I wouldn't have it any other way. If you're willing to pay the higher price, I'd highly recommend it.",
