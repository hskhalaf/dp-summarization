Also, it doesn't conflict with TruSkin's moisturizer--some eye products really sting when combined with the \"wrong\" moisturizer.

I have slowly switched to them exclusively for skincare and use these products day and night: Eye gel, Vit C serum, retinol moisturizer and eye cream. My skin is softer, brighter and much more clear. This is probably my favorite product, as I use a thin layer all over my face and 1) my eyes look refreshed 2) my wrinkles are filling in and 2) my lips are full and so so moisturized!",
