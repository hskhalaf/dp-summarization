Highly recommend now and would really recommend over the similar one by 3M that costs more.",

The Rubber eraser along with a blow dryer made quick work of the stripes, eliminating the stripes entirely in under 90 minutes. Best $10.00 investment ever! The rubber eraser wheel removed the glue that the blow dryer left behind. I had previously received a quote from a detailer to have the stripes removed and replaced with another for $1200.00 Granted, it did include installing a new set of stripes, but I prefer not having a stripe anyway. Checkout the before and after images for more inspiration.",

Whether the surface is steel or fiberglass this takes the vinyl off with no damage to the paint underneath. I found that a plug in drill worked the best to remove the material, more consistent than a battery drill.",

I was originally using a plastic chisel, then a wood chisel, goo gone, heat etc. This did the trick in the end and saved me a TON of headache. The only major downside is the amount of rubber eraser scraps you get after having a go at it. It will get everywhere and require cleanup. The eraser takes a little getting used to, but once you get the technique down it is hands down worth the purchase!",

I was able to take off all the decal adhesive WITHOUT taking off the paint! It took some time but worked great. Make sure your drill is up to the task. I used a Milwaukee and it was fine on the lower speeds. Dont use a high RPM or you might burn the paint. This wheel also works great on removing the actual decals aswell.",

If you buy this thinking you can hit the vinyl a lone with this and be fine then you will be disappointed.

      "text": "I purchased this ABN eraser wheel as an economical alternative to 3M and it worked great! I used it to remove leftover adhesive residue from 6 yr old vinyl racing stripes on my Dodge Challenger. I spent half a day removing the residue the old fashion way of bug and tar remover, goo gone, alcohol, and plastic scraper and quit. I needed a more efficient way and the eraser wheel arrived fast and removed the residue with ease only using a household corded drill with max 1500 rpms. I found using the drill at lower speeds helps with control. I would definitely recommend this item and save the elbow grease.",

The truck is a crew cab short bed. Deducted one star because both wheels became lopsided during use, not sure why, happened on two different drills. The first side took 4 hours to complete (including removing the kick panels with a heat gun), the second took just over two. Absolutely no damage to the paint. A little wax and Good to go.",

      "text": "Here are pics of before and after using the whizzy wheel on my 34' RV with fiberglass sides. I used a standard 3/8\" drill to accomplish the job...again, works amazing, but to avoid fatigue I recommend using a buffer to do the job. Also, try to play with the rotation speed. I found that a lower speed with a little more pressure was more affective. The higher the speed the more likely the \"smear\" of the decal. Either way, there was no damage to the surface of the vehicle. Hope this info helps you finish your job....",
