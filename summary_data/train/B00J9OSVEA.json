I did have to wire up 2 relays for the door locks to reverse polarity but other then that it was very easy. I do wish the manual gave better instruction on how to program the remote. Overall very happy, this was my first time installing one of these so I suggest you do some research if it's yours as well for wiring, don't assume any diagram is correct and test the wires with a multimeter first.",
