The hammer feature is based on a pitted surface riding ball bearings. The ball bearings are no bigger than 1/8\". They wear out, then come free internal, interfering with mode operation. It is a consumer tool. I got 2 years for $60 tool only. Not bad but I'm having a hard time buying another. Meanwhile I'm cutting holes in hammer mode.",

The bigger batteries are available if I ever need longer single use. I debated getting the smaller subcompact LXT model line with the lower torque. After getting this and using it I'm happy with this model. The size isn't much bigger than the subcompact and there is a lot more torque when I need it.",

      "text": "Pretty powerful and it has a lot of features. I use Makita exclusively in my line of work and they get a lot of abuse. However after the first use this one locked up on me so that I couldn't change it from the Drill to Hammer To Screw feature. I didn't want to break the damn thing all the way since I could still use it but my coworker used a large amount of force to move it away from the Hammer setting and it has freely moved between the three settings ever since. So it doe the job but that still makes me a bit wary of what may happen next.",
