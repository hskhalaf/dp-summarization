Big, big mistake, bought it about a month earlier than use because I had Amazon ship it to another site where I had some work to do, so couldn't return the item I definitely would not recommend this product.

When driving screws, there\u2019s not enough torque at low speed, so you end up pushing harder to keep the driver from bouncing out of the screw. Best to just push hard, use full power and let the clutch decide when to stop.",

It will drill holes in sheet metal and 2X4 easily but not all day long. Have not had any trouble with chuck as some reviews say and the battery life is good for light duty jobs. For an inexpensive drill/driver it is good. My only complaint is after assembling several plastic patio chairs requiring about 10 screws each the torque clutch is becoming loose and you have to move to the next tighter setting to drive the same screw. This may become an issue after extended use. All in all a typical B&D homeowner utility tool.",

The light is a good idea that is not well designed: it doesn't throws light where the drilling occurs, but I didn't know it had a light when I bought it so that's not a major factor for me.

      "text": "Great little drill for installing screws in different types of projects, got here in good order and took about 3 hours to charge it up. I bought it to use as a screw gun and for a lightweight drill for my wife. For that Arena this little screw gun is perfect, I built a shed with it also from amazon it had a couple hundred screws in it and it never failed or slowed down so I'm going to rate it a 5 in that aspect... After using it for a couple of hours it only took about 30 minutes to fully charge it!",

You can easily cause it to slip by just just holding the end with your hand all the way up to 10. Only the lock position will stop the slip. Also, I am used to a 1 - 2 speed which this doesn't have.

      "text": "I bought this for my son\u2019s Christmas present since he said he needed a cordless drill. I did so because I have had one for a few years and it works pretty good for a light weight drill. It\u2019s perfect for homeowners for jobs around the house. I really would not call it a driver. It has settings for different torques or full drill mode. You can drive in stud size screws or unscrew a wall switch from its electric box. It size sometimes makes it easy to get into tight spots were as a full size heavy cordless drill will not fit.",

I used it off-and-on all day yesterday when repairing a deck, and it had no problem driving 3-inch screws. It is very compact and is a good complement to my heavy duty (but much larger and heavier) DeWalt cordless hammer drill. I like the LED light which was not expected on such an inexpensive drill. Also, there is a new charger design which takes up very little space. Highly recommended.",

Well, it's 1.5 pounds lighter, has a bright light, and easy to use features. Yes, it is only one speed, but the trigger button is so big, with a long-throw, controlling slower speeds is not too difficult. If you need 2 speeds, you'll pay more and get a heavier drill. For the average household, this drill is ideal. Plenty of power, long-lasting battery with no memory issues. In fact, this battery likes being left plugged-in. It won't use much current at all, and it will actually extend the battery life!",
