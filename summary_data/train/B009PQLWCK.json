In addition, the plastic holes where the screws go in were not large enough. This made the installation a nightmare. Once I got it up (by using my own screws and drilling through the plastic), it turned out well enough to do the job. So, it's up to you prospective buyer. Do you take a chance, roll the dice, and hope to get lucky? Or, do you pass on this one and find another with more consistent, positive reviews? Good luck!",
