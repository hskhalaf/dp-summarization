I have gotten older and I just want small competent camera I can it in a fanny pack or pocket. I carry a very small tripod as well in the fannypack with small batteries and SD cards.

I've had Sony for my last 3 point and shoots, and was considering upgrading to switchable lenses until i saw that there are now 20x zoom point-and-shoots available. I researched and compared reviews for this and other brand cameras. As a whale watch enthusiast, zoom is very important, as is response time. I'm still getting the hang of this camera, more zoom= more shake and harder to catch the whales. but i love all the adjustable settings and modes. The review may go to 5 stars, once I've gotten the camera controls down better.",

No view finder but the 3 inch display is high resolution and very good outdoors - although I recommend an anti-glare screen protector for better visibility in the bright sun.

We stood well back and zoomed in on the stage, at night, and took pictures of the performers that make it look like we were in the 10th row...very cool.

Also if your lens is extended fully, it can block the flash a little bit on certain applications. Still a decent purchase.",

Additionally, it has a 20X zoom lens that is great for a camera this size. Only thing I don't like about it is the location of the flash. This is a small camera so sometimes my fingers cover the popup flash. I would recommend this to anyone that wants a quality point and shoot.",

The delay between the bracket shots is too short on the HX20 (i.e. even the longest delay option is much too short). A longer delay allows capture of a sequence of \"action shots\" providing the opportunity to choose the \"best\" shot, or shots of the sequence. The HX20 delay between bracket shots is so short that there is virtually no difference in the \"action\" between the sequence shots. Also, the camera is not as \"quick on\" as the T100 camera. There is a definite setup delay when the camera starts up.",

I have always been a Cannon fan, but this Sony has changed my opinion. The only thing I don't like about the camera is the placement of the pop up flash. It comes out right where you would normally hold the camera. But I am getting used to it and this is a very minor complaint. The camera takes amazing pictures for a camera in this price range. It has several cool easy to figure out settings, and holds a charge for a long time. I highly reccomend this camera.",
