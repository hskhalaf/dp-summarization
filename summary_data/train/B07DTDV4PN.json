These were just a few reasons why outdoor enthusiasts find it to be a sensible purchase. Despite these favorable points, more than a couple of setbacks were raised.All things considered, it seems that future owners of the KEEN Targhee Vent Mid are those who do not mind replacing the insole and sizing up. With these interventions, one may genuinely be able to enjoy its features.",

      "title": "Great Light Weight Boot",
      "text": "The material and stitching is classic high quality Keen. By eliminating the traditional heavy material used on most hiking boots, these boots breath easier (and are much lighter). My feet never overheated while wearing them for 8+ hours a day, on trails, roads and fields. The ankle support is a plus for uneven and moderately rugged terrain. If you are debating between low rise versus over the ankle based on weight, yet need the additional support, buy these boots. You will get everything you want and need. I like these boots, and would recommend them to a friend.",

I\u2019ve found that the work models last longer. Others the heel designs start to separate. Still would only want to wear Keen\u2019s everyday.",

I used it several time for biking in Feb and Mar in Utah and my feet got cold pretty cold. Ankle support is a weak point, i think it's minimal but better than none. I notice that they are a bit slippery on wet _coated_ concrete, so i would assume that they will be also slippery on wet rocks. They fit as expected with a comfortable toe box. The quality seems to be good, i hope they will hold up like the other Keens shoes i have.",

I haven't done a long downhill yet, I am not sure how they would perform there. The insole is stout and the arch support is good. The material looks a bit cheap but they are fairly stoutly built. The toecap looks very sturdy, which is important because having the toecap separate is a fairly common way boots wear out. The tread is patterned well and the traction is solid. My size 13's weigh 2.6 pounds so they are fairly light. I like. They may just grow on me.",
