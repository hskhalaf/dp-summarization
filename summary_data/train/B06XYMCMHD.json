Beautiful screen, great cameras, fast Bio logins, a joy to use, and while people moan over Bixby it's not that bad, but hey Google Assistant is baked into a long press of the Home Button without needing to change anything.

No fault at all by the sellers. As a few of my friends have already damaged their S8s/S9s, I made it a compulsory action to buy a case as well as a tempered glass case. The screen is slightly curved on the sides, proving to be slightly more prone to damage upon heavy contact. If you find that, like myself, you're a little bit clumsy, you're better off to invest an extra \u00a320 in a good case and screen protector rather than being sorry. Hope this helps anyone speculating :)",

Only downside is that whilst the curved screen looks great it means that screen protectors won\u2019t stay on, even when I bought one designed for this phone it lasted not even 2 days which is apparently because of the shape of the screen.",

I've read online that many users have had this problem. I usually have to shake the phone for the bluriness to go away. This is a bit annoying as you can miss the chance to take a photo.

      "text": "I have waited a while before writing a review of this product. Because, rightly or wrongly, one must give each purchase a chance before recommending it (or not) to other potential purchasers. This phone doesn't last for more than 4 or 5 hours, even when it's charged 100%. It runs down by at least 20% per hour until it switches itself off - even if you don't use it. For this reason alone, do not buy this phone from this supplier.",
