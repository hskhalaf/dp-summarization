It ran a bit large--the idea is it should be tight and go under other layers (though sometimes I put a small tank top under it). It's quite see-through and breeze-through, so its insulating power doesn't work unless something is worn over it. It's great for travel, weighs almost nothing and packs small. It kept me warm without bulkiness on a week long walking tour in February. If it got too hot it was easy to take off and store in a purse (especially with the small tank underneath it in case I had to remove it in public).",

      "text": "Love this. I bought one last year and got more this year. If you live in a cool area, this light weight silk undie will keep you a bit warmer if you wear it as an undershirt. You can use any silk blouse to keep you warm under clothing, but his is so light that you forget you are wearing it. Remember silk keeps you cool when it is hot out and warm when it is cold out. Better then wool.",

Keep in mind, it's VERY thin...not exactly the best on it's own for a PJ top (especially if you get it in white, like I did) unless you're very comfortable around anyone who might be seeing you. My only complaints is that the neck is high enough that you can see the trim over basically any non-turtleneck sweater, and sometimes the cuffs too (but these can easily be rolled up).",
