Just rinse in the sink and squeeze them out after each feeding. Or maybe you're not like me and you got it right the first time. Either way - for feeding, this is the bib you need. The cloth ones might be better for teething drool, but for messy high chair feedings, nothing beats this.",

      "text": "My 6 month old son started solids so I wanted an easy bib to clean. This bib is just the right size- covers most of this upper body and is a thin plastic material that you can just wash off with a dish sponge and soap. The little pouch catches any spills or pieces that fall down. The design is super cute and a bonus for taking pictures of all the funny faces your baby will make when trying new foods. For now I definitely prefer these to the bulkier rubber bibs.",

Pros: Child tolerates it Captures about 85% of dropped food Easy to rinse off when finished Rolls up into a small bundle for travel Machine washes with no issue, very stain resistant Dries quickly Takes up little space (we hang from back of high chair using a command hook) Cons: The other 15% of the food she drops in her lap Doesn't have sleeves - which means it's tolerated for longer, but does expose arms to mess",

The pocket is perfect at catching the food he drops and reducing the mess I need to clean up later. The price is great too! Highly recommend!",

When the kid is done making a mess you can just rinse it off and hang it to dry. 15 minutes later it's ready to go again. Also the pocket really does catch 90% of the dropped food, which keeps it off his lap! For the price, these are by far the best. I buy them for all my expecting friends!",
