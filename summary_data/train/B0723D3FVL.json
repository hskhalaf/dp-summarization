Like virtually all mics, when you mount it on a camera four feet or more from the talent, you will not get very good sound. But that's just the way of mics. Caleb Pike reviewed this and stated that it has a noticeably hotter signal than the Rode Videomicro. I am pretty picky with audio, and I often will EQ to get things the way I like with various mics, but this one gives me quite good audio without EQ-ing. For being small and cheap, it has surprisingly good bass. And the upper end is crispy without being shrill. For the money, this is very nice.",

The gain is strong. Metal build is good. Compares well with Rode small video mics and Boya M1 lapel. One star taken off for the poor \"shock\" mount. It snapped when I checked flex with my finger (see photo) because it is stiff, cheap plastic. Looks like a shock, but almost no flex. So far, not able to find replacement. Maker should change to compare with Rycote shock mount used by Rode. I would recommend for value even with poor shock.",

Loader and deeper sounding than my Rode Videomicro. I might like the Rode better in terms of sound but that preference is very slight. Also the cable on the Rode is better as both ends are angled. This makes a difference in mounting. That said the Movo/BOYA includes a cellphone cable which the Rode didn't. The dead cat is also just as effective as the Rode. The below photo has the Movo/BOYA mounted on an AS20 action cam. The Rode is mounted on my AX53.",

One of them is to create a YouTube channel with my hair tips and tricks... hopefully to help people AND generate interest in my online store. The first several videos were done with just my ipad....then I purchased this mic and had my neighbor use her camera with it. WOW.. a huge difference!!!! I'm so very impressed!! I'm hoping it lasts!!!",

Used an AuxLink Hi-Fi Pro 384KHz/32Bit adapter cable to connect it to the phone's USB-C port. The shock mount was about what you would expect for this price. Phone sensed the MOVO mic and automagically used it as input. The windscreen worked very well - cut out the wind noise and did not appreciably muffle my voice when using it outdoors on a windy day. Nice that it came with both TRS and TRRS cables. Saved me buying a TRRS cable",

Sound quality overall, is a bit louder than the Rode and slightly tinny, but with minimal adjustment in post, it sounds pretty good. This is a solid compact and budget-friendly mic for a beginner.

The plastic is weak. So I purchased a 3rd one and what will be my last one. I did leave a review on the MOVO site. I gave the shock mount a 1 star review but MOVO didn't like it so they deleted it leaving only 5 star reviews.",

I dont have too much to compare to, but I can say its ALOT better than a phone or gorpo mic. Seems pretty durable to. If you are on a tight budget and need a good modular microphone for your phone and camcorder, than I really dont see how you can go wrong with this one. Its really nice so far.",

But if you're gonna need something better than either of these two mics, just look for a dedicated recorder and boom microphone. Also, the wind screen is really good at filtering out wind noise, but it's super huge. Would be nice to have something that doesn't defeat the purpose of the mic's low profile design.",
