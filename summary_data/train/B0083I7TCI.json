      "text": "After using this grill, I am not completely happy with the product. First, the positive elements: heats quickly to desired temp., two plates system is great, reversible plate features helpful, non-stick aspect makes cleanup easier. The negative features: grill plate release system borders on dangerous because the grill plate attachments are shape-edged, stiff and can cut fingers when attaching or detaching plates. I recommend that the manufacturer make rubber or plastic covers for those pieces, and send them to purchasers ASAP. This system of attaching and releasing grill plates is too ackward and dangerous.",

Update 12/02/2018 WARNING-FIRE HAZARD!!!!!! The poor design of oil/grease drip collection almost led to a fire! The oil/grease when stir frying can easily collect under the heating elements and catch fire! Very poor design. These things need to be pulled from the stores and reviewed for safety!!!",

The left burner no longer works, and we are currently looking to replace this unit. Not very happy with it at all, as it should have lasted more than 20-30 uses. When it worked, it was decent.",

      "text": "I bought this for my son. I have one that is a year old. Cooking oil removes the temperature numbers from the dials quickly. You then have to guess what the setting it is on. It also allows grease to get on top of the heating elements and inside the unit. The good thing about it is the removeable grill plates that you can soak in the sink. I don't expect it to last another year. I'll probably buy another brand as a replacement. Most of these portable grills seem to turn into junk in a year or so.",

Just a bad design. It looks like a premium griddle and we should have just stuck with the tried and tru basic griddle as they are easy to clean and last about the same for a lot less $'s.",
