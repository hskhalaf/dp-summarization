The setup on some of them were a little tricky but overall went well and once the setup was completed everything works flawlessly with Alexa and with the app. I have purchased some additional outlets and switches that will be installed once i get an electrician out here again. I have multiple scenes setup that work great as well. We love giving one command to Aalexa each night and the whole downstairs shuts down :)",

Their other devices (switches, plugs...etc.) have lasted with no issues. Oh and forget customer service, they flat don\u2019t care. This is the last Insteon purchase I will make. I will now begin a phaseout of Insteon products with Alexa products. If you are considering purchasing this product don\u2019t. Save yourself some frustration, Insteon sucks.",

My guess is that underlying server APIs are totally broken so the UI is unable to provide anything resembling a modern user experience.

There is no configuration backup, so when a unit fails, you have to call Smarthome to delete the account, then you have to reprogram it all over again. If you have several Insteon modules it takes quite a bit of time. The power supplies on all Insteon units are a weak design point.",

It's a lot of fun to be able to have Alexa turn lights on and off (our house has an extensive Insteon installation) on command. And a lot more convenient when your hands are full. Highly recommended if you already have the necessary infrastructure for a smart home. The only issue I've found is that in rooms with a great many three-way circuits (our Rec Room has three), Alexa has trouble distinguishing which device to control. The hub could be better integrated if the Amazon Echo was also able to activate Insteon scenes, which can be scripted to control multiple devices.",

I did not realize that I had to d/l an \"app\" for the thing and I had no idea how to do that or where to go in order to get the app. Even though the Hub works okay, it is of little use to me as the HD Camera that I really needed, won't work in a Windows desktop environment. The factory knew this in advance. I only found it out thru technical support (2 hours on the phone to Calif.). So, the Hub is just sitting there doing nothing. I cannot recommend either of these devices.",
