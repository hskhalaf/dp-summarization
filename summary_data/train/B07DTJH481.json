I've had it tug a few times, even with boots electric pre-shave and it always misses hairs from 3 days stubble and onward. (have to go back over with the 7 series) No way is it worth \u00a3449 so I'm glad I didn't pay that much. If you shave with it everyday then it's easier to live with, even on 2 day stubble it catches and pulls (usually twice per shave) I struggle to justify the \u00a3224 that I payed compared to \u00a3124 for the 7 series.",

A lot of the reviews have been written by people that have received the product for free in exchange for a review. I purchased mine and I am pleased with it but no way would I have paid high street prices for it. In summary, if like me you use an electric shaver all the time then this is possibly one of the best out there but don't be fooled into thinking this is as good as a wet shave.",

I also have to go over the same area several times to remove the hair missed originally. This causes irritation under my neck. I wouldn't recommend this shaver. Save your money and get a cheaper one.

Lots of useful little features, such as battery indicator, head/foil life indicator, cleaning requirement indicator. You can lock the head in various positions or have it swivel. I've never used a swivel shaver before (always bought rigid ones) but this does seem to help with the shaving. Looks and feels very good quality.

There is almost no vibration and it gives a fast, perfect shave with no need to go over any missed hairs because there are none.

If I had to replace this in the future I think I would go back to a 3 head philips.",

There is absolutely no snagging of the skin or even the most stubborn of hairs. The cleaning system is a lot better than previous versions and with the fan drying feature, leaves the razor in a lovely clean and ready to use state.
