Cons: 1 - Bogs down at the end of shredding cheese because the last end of the cheese binds the blade a bit. 2 - Food particles (from the aforementioned cheese) get stuck in the enclosed housing of the safety spring and cannot be cleaned out. Moist foods get packed into the interior channel of the lid and must be removed with a small, makeshift implement.",

It doesn't have the biggest mouth for larger food items, so chopping/dicing is typically needed before food can go down the shute. The other small downside I've noticed is that tiny particles of food somehow made its way into the handle, and you would have to dismantle it (potentially not be able to reassemble) in order to clean out properly. I've worried that the food can get stuck and start to mold. (Yuck)",

It is powerful and my hummus is so much smoother than with what I was using before. It has a very short cord though, so you need to have it unplugged before you start the processing. The only issue I have with the short cord is that, if you are adding liquid while processing, it just barely clears the wall cabinet above it.",
