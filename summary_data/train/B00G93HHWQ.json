So glad I did, it gives a very close and comfortable shave. The cleaning system is also very easy to use. After using for a month, I would highly recommend this shaver.",

He used to be a fan of Braun shavers but doesn\u2019t like the current integrated blade mechanism within the foil. Having meticulously researched the topic, he came to the conclusion that Panasonic now make the best shavers. I therefore bought him this shaver as an 80th birthday present. He is delighted with it. No razor burn, no irritation at all whilst shaving and he was able to achieve a perfect result far quicker than his older Panasonic model.",

Got the Panasonic Arc 5 and was shocked how close the shave was with foam , it was even better than the razor blade shave which i most often use. Its amazing how good this shaver is even when using under my chin and neck area, it was almost impossible to shave with my previous Braun series 3 under the neck/chin but this Arc 5 makes it possible.",

      "text": "This shaver is brilliant, gives the closest shave ever with no drag. It's quick and leaves no rash. After decades of using opposition shavers this one is fabulous and half the price of other premium products. The big head shaves large areas efficiently and fast and makes shaving as much of a pleasure as it can possibly be. I've now used it for over a month without shaving problems. The cleaning process is also super-efficient and costs much less than opposition systems. I hope it last for many years.",
