      "text": "I ordered this to replace the original bluetooth keyboard that came with my iMac about 4 years ago. This keyboard would be a 5-star IF it didn't lay perfectly flat. It has no flip-up legs to give an angle more comfortable and less strain on the carpal tunnel. I have attacked a 1/4\" diameter wood dowel to the bottom to give it a small lift (see photo). It now is almost level with my existing 4 year old trackpad. I suggest this simple fix to solve the only shortcoming that I see. Perhaps Apple will see this review and update the keyboard!",

It will often drop connection without warning, sometimes permanently so I'll have to re-connect the Lightning cable and try pair it again to my MBP over and over (or wait 10 minutes). The worst is when it freaks out and dies while typing, sending a stuck loop of characters over and over to the computer resulting in lines of text everywhere, cascading window-closing, and/or repeated menu commands. I wish I could say this was unusual for Apple, but with their myopic approach to quality it's unlikely anything other than the iPhone / iPad will every be \"Pro\" again. (Maybe that's why they switched to \"Magic?\")",

      "text": "This keyboard may seem expensive but I love the typing experience. The bluetooth pairing was super easy, too. Just plug in the USB/lightning cable and it's immediately paired. No need to go in to settings, etc. The space grey looks real sleek and is a nice fit depending on your room tone. The keyboard is high quality (Apple luxury, of course) and I'm a huge fan of how smooth the typing is. I don't have any regrets with this purchase. I'm also coming from the Apple keyboard from 2010... so the upgrade is nice.",

Of course some people can't adopt to this, but I was surely able to. I must admit though the original non numeric keyboard that came with my 2017 iMac has an issue with the up/down arrow which this fixes, plus the numeric keys comes very handy.",

The back edge is 1/4 inch higher than the front edge. Not comfortable on your wrists for typing. 2. The keys are very low and soft, mushy which causes a lot of accidentally clicked keys and frequent misspelling. The slightest touch causes a keystroke and theres very little tactile feedback to let you know that you pressed a key. This is by far the worst and most annoying feature. A deal breaker in my opinion. PRO: 1. Number pad. I love all Apple products but this one is terrible.",
