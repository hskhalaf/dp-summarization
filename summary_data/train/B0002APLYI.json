Not only is she able to jump over our fence, she is able to plow through our pickets! If she smells a bunny, all bets are off. This stake has done a fantastic job holding her in our yard. The only thing I can possibly grasp at to complain about is that the color is fading and chipping, but it has been outside for a year, what would you expect.",

Once you begin to twist the stake in the ground, it simply augers a hole the size of the stake and then slips right out of the dirt. If you poured concrete around the stakes they would be nice, but we need them to be mobile.",

The stake was also very easy to screw in to clay. i will say that using a rod or something to run through the eyelight improves installation as there is not a great deal to hold onto to get leverage.",

I used a fiberglass rake handle thru the hole on top to screw it into the ground so I wouldn't chip the paint. The paint is very florescent and will be easy to see when the grass gets green. Also bought the Beast cable and I don't think big boy will get getting off of this any time soon.",

      "text": "We bought this for a beach trip to tether our two Belgian Tervurens. I took a tip from a review and used a sawed off broom handle to screw it into the sand. It takes a while but it could not be pulled out when pulling from the sides. If you pull straight up from the stand it can come out but that is not how a dog would be pulling. I can imagine this being very sturdy and secure in dirt but perhaps something you'd want to leave in once set.",

It is now in about 3 inches deep and covered by some rocks. It has stayed in for a month but I don't think it's lasting much longer. The bottom piece is really just a flat circle. It needs to be more slanted so it can turn/cut into the ground. It's impossible to pound a flat circle into the ground..",
