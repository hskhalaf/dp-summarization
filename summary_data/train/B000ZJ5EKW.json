One thing to keep an eye out for is to always check all the nuts and bolts every time you wear them. It says this in the paperwork, but you really need to do it. The one time I didn't, a bolt came loose and I ended up falling. I wasn't hurt, but it was hugely inconvenient. They are also super useful for putting up/taking down holiday lights. None of this is what they are intended for.",

Thus it can easily(and it does) fall out. Again-when its secured to your leg, its very secure. The issue is when its NOT secured, such as when you're carrying them to a jobsite.
