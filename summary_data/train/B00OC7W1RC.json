So it does work. If you only need it for a couple minutes you'll never know. But if it's a week long project several hours a day you won't be happy.",

So, it was a natural thing to purchase them for my weed eater as well. I gotta' say that these work MUCH better than the stock Black & Decker batteries. They will easily last another 30% longer than the stock batteries especially in the blower (which was always a battery hog). The batteries do fit tight in the trimmer, but not too bad (other reviews stated this). Great deal for the price.",
