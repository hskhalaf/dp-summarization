We use them for out at our cabin on a lake so they typically last 1-2 seasons before someone drags it over the ground and it gets a hole, but we keep buying them because they DO last if taken care of properly and they are a good lake float. They keep you dry enough and not too high so you can paddle out and drift w/o trouble. Also the cup holder is decent and the leg opening makes cooling off easy with actually getting IN the water.",

If I want to lay down, I can let a bit of air out and turn it upside down and it gives you a gentle slope for sunbathing. So comfortable I regularly fall asleep on it in the pool. Looks really nice too. People think I paid $30 for it.",

One was fine and the other one had a leak. They replaced it with no problem, didn't even ask me to send it back. In about 3 months the other one had the same issue. And now the last one is gone. This is a very nice and comfortable float, but only if you are lucky enough. For me it was 3 out of 3.",

Good headrest too if you want to lay down and dangle your feet in the water. A great buy!",

My only complaint is the cup holder - needs to be larger to fit a larger diameter bottle (think Nalgene size or Crowler) and place it closer to the armrest. :D Not a big nitpick but those details would have made this lounger amazing.",

But for easy use they are comfy and reliable.",
