Since car manufacturers seem to think we all want to sit in a deep pit with our knees higher than our behinds, a cushion like this to flatten the seat is vital. Makes my long commute comfortable....and I won't have to trade the car in after all! The cushion is soft, but is firm enough to keep its shape. I've had mine over 3 months now and it has not compressed at all. The strap holding it in place is very helpful too. I definitely recommend this. I'm not planning to ever drive without it again.",

I also like the breathable cover, and the fact that the coccyx cutout doesn\u2019t go all the way through. That keeps it from becoming too wide an opening when you sit on it. Because of of the shape of my car seat, I did have to insert an extra layer of foam right in the middle so it would lay flat, but every car seat is different. I would like a handle, though. Will be buying another for the house.",

The cushion was not firm enough, seem to not recover its shape quick enough, and didn't provide a big enough wedge. Maybe it's just not right for me. I am hoping to return and get a refund on this product, having contacted the seller directly, but I have not received a response so far.",
