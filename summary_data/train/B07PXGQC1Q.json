      "text": "Everyone is posting that there isn\u2019t a difference between these and the 1st gen. This is misleading and inaccurate. Is the improvement drastic, no, but it is still an improvement. The improvement is that Apple has upgraded the on-board chip to the H1, which leads to faster and more stable pairing. This isn\u2019t anecdotal. It\u2019s been tested and proven to be faster. Also, if you opt for wireless charging, buy the case with the gen 2 AirPods and you\u2019ll save a few dollars. If you already have the 1st gen, then it\u2019s probably not worth the upgrade. If you are looking to buy your first pair of AirPods, then go for these.",

      "text": "Great deal. Very simple set up, it\u2019s done automatically for you as soon as you turn on Bluetooth. Small footprint to carry and store. Just received yesterday so I\u2019m looking at battery life today and will come back to update. Comfortable to wear and feels secure in my ears which I ALWAYS have a problem with earphones staying in place just staying still. It\u2019s quite nice to not worry about that anymore. I also bought a great pouch with a silicone case, ear fitters, lanyard that attaches to to pods, wristband pod holder with a nice zip case with a clip to house it all. So I\u2019m set and very happy with my purchases!!!",

I didn't pay $200 for headphones that are going to quit working after 10 uses. No one would pay $20/use no matter how much they like the experience when it actually works.",

I didn't do anything out of the norm with them to drain the battery. If this is the way all of them are, I would not recommend getting these to anyone. I wouldn't want anyone to have to go through what I am having to deal with with my own.",
