Colors are true to their pictures. A bit pricey for these items, but for a person with nails that are otherwise paper thin, who gave up wearing nail polish due to continual splitting with the use of both acetone remover and non 'free' polishes, the change to these newer 'free' products and a non-acetone remover have made a great deal of difference in my ability to wear polish.",

The polish was good for a week. Even 7 days later when i did not use gloves and washed a lot of dishes on the weekend, the polish is still ok.",
