      "text": "This set seems to have enough different types of files to handle most needs that would come up for general home repair. Not sure how long they will last, but they work fine for occasional usage, which is what I bought them for. \"Wooden handle\" refers to the file card brush, not the files themselves which have plastic handles that work fine. It can be a little difficult to get the files back into the tight elastic holders in the case, but not big deal. As a bonus, the English used in the description is hilarious. My two favorite phrases are \"small files shouldn't lick soft metal\" and \"inevitable that there will be a backlog of collision during transportation\".",

The rubber handles make them comfortable and easy to grip. The files themselves are strong and durable with some weight to them but not enough to effect the performance of the tools The carrying case is a perfect way to keep them protected and nothing gets lost. The zipper on the case is a little hard to get started once it is opened all of the way but other than that this is a great set of files.",
