I had this trainer for a little over a week now and only put on a few miles because I still ride outdoors. But I'm looking forward to doing more indoor riding once the weather starts getting colder. What's also nice about the trainer is you can make your bike fit adjustments and video your riding position.",

For the price, this is great. It did shred a tire, but if you get the yellow training tires, no more issues. (Harder compound.) My only issue is that it takes about 5-10 minutes for the fluid to warm up and provide good resistance - hence, inaccurate (easy) watts at the beginning if you have to just dive in. Additionally, there isn't a way to crank up resistance for a hill climb or really hard power, like say, a Kaiser magnetic spin bike.",
