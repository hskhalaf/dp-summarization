I bought used, but I immediately noticed the material quality in the metal barrel, manual zoom is very smooth for videography, and even in lowlight situation this lens delivered. Produces wonderful bokeh for close up shots of items, slight focus hunting mid-range but I think that's more of my composing fault, and AMAZING for video. The details were so crisp that when viewed 4K, I actually gasped haha. While it is a expensive glass, you get what you pay for. A hi-quality lens that will be with me for a long time.",

Actually, this one is pretty good, there are betters out there but you should have an eye on the primes. Need a great overall lens? This is a very strong candidate!

That's important for getting good pictures in low light. this is the 12-35 lens, so the zoom is not really a normal zoom lens.

The shallower depth of field for portraits has produced much higher quality photos than either of my first 2 MFT lenses which I have traded in.

I use 25mm for head to toe shots and 35mm for three quarter. 12mm works well if I need to distort or to add some drama to an environmental shot.

Some vignetting in the corners at f/2.8, gone by f/4. The image stabilization works very well. I prefer the convenience of zoom lenses, and this is the best standard zoom for this system.

The image quality is top notch and the obvious size/weight advantage over larger rival's lenses makes this lens ideal for taking everywhere! This price is high, but my apprehension quickly dissipated after I attached it to the OM-D and began snapping pics/videos. The smooth and steady focus ring as well as the constant 2.8 make it ideal for videos. I couldn't be more pleased.",

I mean I was able to get pictures of the Statue Of Liberty from the ferry. This is a great piece of glass. If you can get a good copy used then go for it...hell, buy it new!",

Happens when tracking a subject on the field and even more evident when you zoom the lens either in or out. I know the lens is not parfocal but I would expect it to remain static (no focus breathing our hunting) while just panning left our right and while just zooming. Could it be firmware? Poor connection between lens and the GH4 body? Not sure... in manual mode I expect the lens to stay at the focal position regardless of camera movement or zoom movement. I've tried the various AF modes (AF-S, AF-C, and Manual) - the behavior is consistent. Very annoying.",

A first for the LUMIX G Series, the G VARIO constant with F2.8 zoom is suitable for professionals and enthusiasts alike. You can focus on a wide range of scenes from dynamic landscapes to studio lit portraits. Panasonic\u2019s long time collaboration with LEICA inspired an exclusive X Series design. With the X Series Lenses, LUMIX blends its own unique mix of broadcast video and advanced mirrorless camera technologies into a premium lens line. Featuring professional grade aperture in a compact body, use it in your professional studio photography.\n\nPROFESSIONAL GRADE GLASS FOR GREAT IMAGES IN VARIOUS SHOOTING CONDITIONS\nThe H-HS12035 is comprised of 14 elements featuring high contrast resolution across the entire range (View Larger) The LUMIX G X VARIO interchangeable lens system is comprised of 14 elements in 9 groups. The UED (Ultra Extra-Low Dispersion) glass minimizes chromatic aberration while the UHR (Ultra High Refractive) lens realizes high descriptive performance from corner to corner. Featuring high contrast and resolution within the entire zoom range - the X VARIO lens highlights intricate details that command your attention lending a true-to-life portrait perspective in almost any scene. Advanced Focusing happens because seven blades give the aperture a rounded shape that produces an attractive smooth defocus effect for those out-of-focus areas. Mount it on any LUMIX G body and delight in high-speed Contrast Auto Focus.\n\nPOWER O.I.S. MINIMIZES BLUR AND ENHANCES IMAGES\nPower O.I.S. strengthens the correction of low-frequency hand-shake vibration (View Larger) By integrating POWER O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer), movement, whether slow or fast, is accounted for making your job easier to shoot in those low-lit situations at night or even indoors at a get-together. By adopting an inner focus system, driven by a stepping-in-motion motor, the lens\u2019 superior design provides smooth and near-silent focusing action that is ideal for both picture and video recording.\n\nCONSTRUCTED TO BE LIGHT AND DURABLE FOR YOUR PHOTO EXPEDITIONS\nOutstanding compact and light-weight design offers the same level of performance as larger zoom lenses (View Larger) This interchangeable lens boasts about how light and compact it really is. As you travel, this zoom lens results in extreme mobility for your busy, on-the-go tour days and travel expeditions. It also protects against nature\u2019s elements, countering moisture and dust with its rubber ring around the lens mount. It is ideal for outdoor photography enthusiasts. And a highly reliable metal mount assures long periods of use. Have fun and travel light.\n\nNANO SURFACE COATING REDUCES REFLECTION\nThe Panasonic H-HS12035 Lens features Nano Surface Coating technology to reduce reflection (View Larger) With Panasonic\u2019s unique Nano Surface Coating technology, reflections in the entire visual range (380nm-780nm) are minimized giving you a dramatic reduction in glares, flares and ghosting. The result? Unbelievably clear, professional pictures whose superior clarity tells more than a thousand words.\n\nLENS COMPATIBLE WITH ALL PANASONIC LUMIX G SERIES AND MICRO 4/3 CAMERAS\nDMC-GH3K Body\nPanasonic LUMIX DMC-GH3 16.05 MP Digital Single Lens Mirrorless Camera with 3-Inch OLED DMC-G5K Body Only\nPanasonic LUMIX DMC-G5 16 MP Digital Single Lens Mirrorless Camera with 3-Inch LCD DMC-GH2K Body Only\nPanasonic LUMIX DMC-GH2 16.05 MP Live MOS Interchangeable Lens Camera DMC-GX1KK\nPanasonic LUMIX DMC-GX1 16 MP Micro 4/3 Compact System Camera with 3-Inch LCD Touch Screen; Black, 14-42mm Kit \nDMC-G3KW, DMC-G3KBODY, DMC-G3KK, DMC-GH2HK, DMC-GX1KBODY,DMC-GX1SBODY, DMC-GX1XK, DMC-GX1KS, DMC-GX1XS, DMC-GF5XR, DMC-GF5XK, DMC-GF5XW, DMC-GF5KW, PDMC-GF5KK,DMC-GF5KR, DMC-GF3CT, DMC-GF3KR, DMC-GF3KBODY, DMC-GF3XK, DMC-GF3CR, DMC-GF3KW, DMC-GF3KT, DMC-GF3CW,DMC-GF3CK, DMC-GF3KK, DMC-GF2CS, DMC-GF2KK, DMC-GF2CK,DMC-GF2CW, DMC-GF2KS, DMC-GF2CR\n\n\nLENS COMPARISON CHART\nLUMIX G X VARIO H-HS35100 LUMIX G X VARIO H-HS12035 LEICA D VARIO-ELMAR L-RS014150 LUMIX G VARIO HD H-VS014140 LUMIX G H-H020 Lens Construction 18 elements in 13 groups (2 ED lenses,1 UED lens) 14 elements in 9 groups (4 aspherical lenses, 1 UED lens, 1 UHR lens) 15 elements in 11 groups (4 aspherical Lenses, 1 ED Lens) 17 elements in 13 groups (4 aspherical lenses, 2 ED lenses) 7 elements in 5 groups (2 aspherical lenses) Nano Surface Coating Yes Yes n/a No (Multi-coated) No (Multi-coated) Mount Micro Four Thirds Mount Micro Four Thirds Mount Full Four Thirds Mount Micro Four Thirds Mount Micro Four Thirds Mount Optical Image Stabilizer POWER O.I.S.
