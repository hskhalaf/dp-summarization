Sure it's not as soft as cushy as a couch, but I wasn't expecting it to be. I'm very happy with this purchase and would buy it again! Tip - when unboxing it, the arm rests are zipped under the seats!! Read the directions!!",

It\u2019s nice because it\u2019s not too soft and still has some structure, but isn\u2019t so stiff you feel like you have to sit upright constantly. The sleeper is a nice feature, but the bar going underneath definitely makes it something you wouldn\u2019t want to sleep on too frequently. The ONLY thing I don\u2019t like, is if someone doesn\u2019t sit back far enough on the couch, the whole couch tips forward. It\u2019s a light design, so pros and cons.

You have to put them in without the washers, then back them out, and put them back in with the washers. I'm giving it 4 stars because it really was a pain, but now that it is together, it's nice. No 6'5\" guy is going to sleep on it. Bit still it's nice particularly for the price.",

I can see the black material exposed, damaged. The material feels like a thin sheet with designed patches of faux leather. If that is true, I'm not even opening this up, I need to ship it back. Less than 24 hours and I'm disappointed. A thin material sheet would not last in my household it looks like it could rip at any moment if someone sat on it.",
