My only issue with this shoe is instability. I sometimes need a little more support in a shoe (not necessarily a stability shoe, but just a neutral shoe with more structure and stability in cushion and midsole/outsole), and the Ride 7 can get a little wobbly, particularly late in runs when I'm tired and fatigued. Those issues are my own though, and if you have a nice solidly neutral gait cycle be sure to give these a shot.",

On my second pair of these, hopefully they will take me to 180 or 170. I run on asphalt running trail and cement sidewalks. They aren't the most cushioned, but they are very lightweight, and yet my knees have no paid from running in them. The insoles and the tread wear at a pretty solid even rate. Sneakers are like tires, they only last so many hundreds of miles. But I pushed these shoes far past their usage point and they kept going strong.",
