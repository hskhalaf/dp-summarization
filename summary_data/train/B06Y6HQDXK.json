      "text": "Great beginner system! I bought in order to stream on Twitch and so far the computer handles like a pro. CPU only running at 50 to 70% while playing fortnite and streaming... that's pretty good. GPU on the other hand could be better but honestly for the price it gives you game quality and meets twitch's min requirements. If you don't know anything about computers, most of the time people upgrade the GPU after they buy it anyway... I would definitely recommend this to my friends",

Meaning, if you do not have an Ethernet connection, you wont be able to install the drivers for the WiFi adapter. But beyond that, I was ready to go after about an hour of downloading some games:) Great first gaming computer. Looking inside the case, there is room to grow too :)",
