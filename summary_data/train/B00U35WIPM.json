The sound it plays is not very loud on its own. I cannot believe for the price the manufacturer failed to include this one tiny detail. We showed pictures of all the hook-ups to a tech guy and there is nothing compatible without purchasing expensive conversion pieces or more expensive sound system. I wonder if a speaker out there would plug into the mini USB?",

We purchased this over a significantly cheaper projector purely based on the fact that we thought it was half the weight of the other, but it's actually heavier. It also has no port for USB or memory card slot, so it must be connected to a computer, tv, etc. which is not the kind of portability we were looking for. That was our fault though for not seeing that it didn't come with one of those ports.",
