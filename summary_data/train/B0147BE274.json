      "text": "My husband and I installed our first sliding barn door this past Saturday. The instructions were in the box and ALL the hardware, bolts, nuts, stoppers were included. It takes a couple of hours to hang when it's your first-ever! We used our existing bedroom door as it is the original to our circa 1950 farmhouse - we took the knobs off and will cover the holes with brass rounds (looking for them now). Hanging the door this way opens up our very small bedroom and gives more clearing to the walkway area. WE LOVE IT!",
