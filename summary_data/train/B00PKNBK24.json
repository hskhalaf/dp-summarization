Poured in a quarter cup of the powder on each side of sink- in the low standing water. Prepared to wait 15-20 minutes as suggested, I turned to do something else and was shocked that within 2 minutes I heard the sink garggle and break loose. I treated sink a second time for good measure. Sink works wonderfully!!! Will buy again. Great price, Fabulous product!!",

I have used everything..from Drano to sulfuric acid (brand Hot Shot which I highly discourage as it burnt a hole in my metal drain) and nothing worked on my slow kitchen drain. I have an older house, built in 1963, and was at the point of using boiling water every other day. I used a cup of this other per the directions and at first nothing. Then I used a sauce pan of boiling water to flush and BAM...I heard the reaction coming back the pipe! Quickly I turned on both hot and cold and away she went! Works great now",

I really think that with a normally clogged drain that this lye would have ate thru it like sh*t through a goose.
