I'd also like to note that I also received samples for other products by Jivi as well as a very kind hand written note with it. Very pleasing transaction all around and would certainly recommend anyone give it a try.",

I'm not a fan of the texture, it's very tacky and dries quick which might work nicely for someone with oily skin but was not enough for my thirsty face.

The reason I believe this to be true is because I've never used a product that actually does all three of these things. 1) moisturizes (like, actually) 2) doesn't burn 3) leaves your skin feeling clean The formula is pristine. It doesn't burn at all, it soothes beyond all belief. And it leaves my skin feeling refresh. 10/10. Buy it!",

    "description": "Scent:LavenderScent Name: Lavender Jivi started with a problem. Most of the skin care around us is full of crap: petrochemicals, synthetics, and active ingredients extracted and isolated from their plants. We were constantly turning to the back of supposedly natural products to find ingredients that were clearly produced in a lab, not in nature. Or we\u2019d look online and find companies highlighting the few natural ingredients they use, while hiding or not listing the remaining unnatural ingredients (not a good sign). And the products that were natural were too expensive for us to use daily. So, we started Jivi to create a truly natural and affordable skin care option with ingredients we're happy to show off. All of our products are made by us, in the USA, out of 100% natural ingredients. They are both highly effective and safe enough to eat. Yep, you read that right. Skin is the largest organ of our bodies, and a lot of what we put on it gets absorbed into our bloodstream. So we decided that if we can\u2019t eat it, we shouldn\u2019t feed it to our skin. That means no chemicals, no parabens, and nothing synthetic. We\u2019re rethinking skin care: from how we source our ingredients and formulate our products to how we bottle them (to avoid harsh preservatives) and get them to your doorstep. We are always looking for ways to create options for better health. We recognize that skin care is a luxury, and that there are people around us who are more concerned with what they can put in their bodies than on them. In almost every community across our country, people we interact with on a daily basis, co-workers and classmates, may be forced to make difficult choices: do I eat or pay rent? do I feed my family or get my insulin? As members of those communities, we want to be part of the solution. We partner with food banks across the country so that for every bottle you buy, we donate a meal, where you live, to a person in need. That way you get great skin and get to help improve the lives of people around you.",
