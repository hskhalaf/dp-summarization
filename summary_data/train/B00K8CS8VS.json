You can easily compare this phone to others in the $250-600 range. I mean who wouldn't want a quad core processor, a gig of ram and 4g speeds for under $75? Five stars; hands down.",

Quickmemo is a nice feature and easy to operate at any moment. Excellent battery life. The only cons I have found is that the LG keyboard doesn't always work but the Android keyboard works fine. Also when changing from game to game youll find some stray pixels that shouldn't be there. Doesn't last long though. Overall I would recommend this phone to anyone who doesn't want to spend $200+ for a decent smartphone.",
