Pro it's not light, it's heavy, you don't want light if you are trying to till, I actually wish it was heavier, but I ratchet strapped a cinder block to the handle rails.. that worked. Pro it's very torqy, no lag, it made a job that used to take me a day by hand take 15min.. we have hard clay soil.. no problem for this thing.. Con The design for the handle is weird, it isn't a natural way to control it.. It doesn't easily fold. There's no wheels to roll it when you're done. Verdict Works perfectly for what I need and made my life easier.. I'd buy another..",

This little tiller ate right through it. It did a better job than my gas operated tiller did. It broke the ground into fine particles of dirt and didn't leave any clods. Once you get the technique down, you can really accomplish a big job in a short amount of time. This is definately worth buying.",

Borrowed our neighbor's gas version (about a $700 tiller) before we got this in and he used the garden Joe immediately. Was instantly sold on this tiller and already planning many projects with it. Thanks to all of you who took the time to write reviews! That was the selling point for me ordering this particular tiller vs. other models. Will update my review at the end of the season! Happy gardening!",

This makes the job so much easier, and we started a garden of our own and this helped blend all of our dirt and additives together. So far so good!",

Also it is not heavy at all.",
