I can't find this camera anymore but if you can find one it is a great little camera with big camera quality pictures. I only put 4 stars on the battery life because I never noticed it was going down so I always found it dead when I needed it the most...or so it seemed to me. Actually the battery life is rather good but off brand replacement batteries do not seem to hold a charge as long as the ones that come with the camera.",

I don't know if I like the rechargeable batteries as much as the AAs for electronic devises I used on the other camera. The video also picks up a lot of sounds so the person taking the video will have to watch how loud they talk. We do not own a SLR. If we did this might get less use but because it is small it is still a great choice. Also does HD videos. Seller was great; shipped very fast. I would buy this camera again and plan to use it as our main camera.",

This camera comes with a very weak battery that has a short life. If there was a battery rating for this specific one, I would give 0 stars. I love this camera, great buy, highly recommended.",

    "title": "Canon PowerShot ELPH 510 HS 12.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with Full HD Video and Ultra Wide Angle Lens (Black)",
    "description": "Color:BlackWorld\u2019s thinnest camera with 28mm Wide-Angle lens, 12x Optical Zoom, and Optical Image Stabilizer. 12.1 Megapixel CMOS image sensor combined with Canon\u2019s DIGIC 4 Image Processor creates the Canon HS SYSTEM for outstanding low-light performance up to ISO 3200. Capture stunning Full HD 1080p video in stereo sound with a dedicated movie button, zoom while shooting and play back videos on an HDTV via the HDMI output. A 3.2-inch wide touch panel LCD offers easy and intuitive operation, and Touch-shutter makes shooting easy and interactive. High-Speed Burst Mode allows continuous shooting and Super Slow Motion Movie records video at high speeds to allow playback in slow motion. Intelligent IS automatically chooses from six different modes to optimize image stabilization for the shooting condition. Improved Smart AUTO intelligently selects the proper settings for the camera based on 32 predefined shooting situations. Movie Digest Mode records a short video clip right before shooting a photo and then combines one day\u2019s worth of clips into one video. There is no SD card included.\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n The Leading Edge of Design and Technology\n\nBeautifully and Astonishingly Thin\nAt a slim 0.86 inches, the PowerShot ELPH 510 HS is the world\u2019s thinnest camera with a 28mm Wide-Angle lens, 12x Optical Zoom, and Optical Image Stabilizer.* Its stylish form is enhanced by its lustrous finish, which gives you a choice of three refined colors: Red, Black and Silver. But real beauty goes beyond skin deep with the PowerShot ELPH 510 HS. Amazingly, Canon did not sacrifice performance for style. \n\n*As of August 23, 2011\n\n12x Optical Zoom with 28mm Wide-Angle Lens\nThe PowerShot ELPH 510 HS features a powerful Genuine Canon 12x Zoom Lens that delivers outstanding optical performance and versatility. Fitting such a high-performance lens with such wide zoom range into a camera so thin would normally be considered an impossible feat. Canon\u2019s expert optical engineering met the challenge by developing a light-folding retractable-prism lens barrel, which achieves outstanding compactness with high zoom power and superb performance. The zoom starts at 28mm wide-angle and extends to 336mm telephoto (35mm equivalent), covering an exceptionally wide range. The telephoto reach gives you the freedom to capture subjects from a considerable distance, while the 28mm wide-angle makes it easy to shoot sweeping landscapes, large groups of people and tall buildings. \n\nOptical Image Stabilizer\nHandheld shooting can often lead to camera shake, making photos and videos blurry. Canon\u2019s Optical Image Stabilizer is a sophisticated system that uses lens-shift technology to correct for unwanted camera movement. It makes handheld photography more practical, providing excellent image quality in many difficult shooting situations: outdoors at dusk, inside without a flash, and even at the telephoto end of the zoom range without a tripod. For photos, it enables shooting at slower shutter speeds, accommodating more low-light shooting situations than ever before without having to boost ISO sensitivity. With camera shake and vibration reduced, you get a sharper, steadier image. And because it is an optical system, there is none of the image degradation typical with electronic image stabilizers.\n\nExperience the Power\n\nCanon HS SYSTEM\nThe Canon HS SYSTEM lets you take bright, clear photos in an even wider range of shooting situations. Beautiful low-light shots are possible with minimal noise and maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas. The system is the result of two technologies brought together in PowerShot cameras: a high-sensitivity imaging sensor, which is able to capture more light; and the DIGIC Image Processor, which actively reduces noise with high-speed image processing. The 12.1 Megapixel CMOS sensor in the PowerShot ELPH 510 HS incorporates advanced light reception technology that enhances sensitivity. The DIGIC 4 Image Processor provides a major boost in noise reduction, expanding the usable ISO range to an amazing high of 3200. The Canon HS SYSTEM takes the frustration out of low-light shooting, delivering clear, blur-free images.\n\nCanon DIGIC 4 Image Processor\nCanon DIGIC Image Processors have set the standard for functionality and performance since their groundbreaking introduction in 1999. With each successive generation, DIGIC processors have brought elevated performance and powerful new features to PowerShot digital cameras. The DIGIC 4 processor has ushered in a new level of picture quality and accelerated processing, making possible features such as high-speed continuous shooting, Full HD video and Face Detection Self-timer. New, more powerful noise reduction algorithms also provide improved low-light capture.\n\nMemorable Moments in Spectacular Full HD\n\nCanon Full HD Video Advantage\nIn addition to the Canon HS SYSTEM, the combination of the advanced CMOS sensor and DIGIC 4 Image Processor in the PowerShot ELPH 510 HS makes it possible to shoot crisp, clear high definition video. Imagine the fun and excitement of being able to shoot spectacular 1080p Full HD video with stereo sound that you can later watch on your HDTV or download to your computer to share with family and friends. In addition to being able to shoot Full HD 1080p video at 24* frames per second, the PowerShot ELPH 510 HS can also shoot 720p HD video at 30** frames per second.\n\n*Actual frame rate is 23.976 fps.\n** Actual frame rate is 29.97 fps.\n\nHDTV playback via HDMI output and CEC\nIt\u2019s easy to enjoy and share the videos you shoot with the PowerShot ELPH 510 HS. Simply connect its HDMI terminal to your HDTV using an HDMI cable. And because the PowerShot ELPH 510 HS supports HDMI-CEC technology, you\u2019ll be able to control the playback of your images and videos on any CEC-enabled HDTV using the TV\u2019s remote control. (CEC \u2013 Consumer Electronic Control \u2013 is part of the HDMI specification, enabling components in a system to communicate with one another.)\n\niFrame\nWith the PowerShot ELPH 510 HS, you can also shoot video in the Apple iFrame format, which is a computer-friendly standard that speeds up importing and editing of videos. It keeps file sizes small, making it more convenient to upload or e-mail high-quality videos. The iFrame format enjoys native support in compatible Mac and Windows video applications, making it unnecessary to perform time-consuming and often quality-degrading conversions.\n\n\nGet the Shot You Want with Just a Touch\n\nPureColor LCD System\nThe PowerShot ELPH 510 HS digital camera\u2019s large and bright 3.2-inch PureColor LCD wide screen makes it easy to view and frame your shots in high resolution (461,000 dots). PureColor technology delivers excellent contrast with rich, true-to-life color. Moreover, you can view the LCD screen over a surprisingly wide angle \u2013 above, below or to either side \u2013 without color shifts and with minimal reflections. A scratch-proof hard coating and a dust-repellent fluorine coating ensure a durable screen that dependably displays clear, vibrant images. The wide aspect ratio (16:9) provides ample room for information icons and touch buttons, preventing them from getting in the way of the image, and you can enjoy a brilliant full-screen image when shooting or playing back your Full HD videos.\n\nTouch Panel LCD with Touch Shutter\nThe PowerShot ELPH 510 HS features touch panel technology that makes using the camera more intuitive and fun. Simply touch the screen to choose and track an AF point, change camera settings, record and play videos and much, much more! It also has an innovative Touch Shutter function that allows you to release the shutter right from the screen. Just touch the desired subject with your finger. An AF box will appear and track the subject as it moves. Then just lift your finger to release the shutter. It\u2019s that simple.\n\nA PowerShot that Keeps Up with the Action\n\nHigh-Speed Burst Mode\nCapture amazing action shots like the pros with the PowerShot ELPH 510 HS camera. Using High-Speed Burst mode,* you can shoot at exceptionally high speeds \u2013 7.8 frames per second. It\u2019s a great feature for those who enjoy taking pictures at sporting events. High-Speed Burst is also an excellent way to make sure you capture that perfect instant in time when shooting any moving subject.\n\n*Image resolution is 1984 x 1488 pixels when shooting in High-Speed Burst mode.\n\nSuper Slow Motion\nThe Super Slow Motion Movie mode* on the PowerShot ELPH 510 HS gives you a fun and useful option when shooting videos. It records video clips at a very high speed \u2013 up to approximately 240 frames per second. When the clips are played at normal speed (30 fps), the action is dramatically slower. This video shooting mode can be used to capture memorable plays at sporting events or to analyze and study motion. \n\n*Records 640 x 480 pixels at 120 fps and 320 x 420 pixels at 240 fps.\n\nA Steady Image Is a Beautiful Image\n\nIntelligent IS\nThe latest advance in Canon Optical Image Stabilization technology, Intelligent IS analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation. For stills, the system automatically selects among Normal, Panning, Macro (Hybrid) and Tripod IS modes. When shooting video, the system automatically selects among Dynamic, Powered, Macro and Tripod IS modes. With Intelligent IS, you can concentrate on image capture, letting the camera make the most effective IS settings to assure the steadiest possible image. \n\n\n\nNormal\nCorrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills. Panning\nPanning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement. Hybrid\nCorrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting. Dynamic\nEffective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking. Powered\nCompensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified. Tripod\nWhen tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed. \nA Smarter Camera Means Better Photos and Videos\n\nSmart AUTO\nPhotographers of all levels appreciate a camera \u2013 especially a go-anywhere compact digital \u2013 that takes the hassle out of capturing beautiful images. The PowerShot ELPH 510 HS gives you Smart AUTO \u2013 sophisticated Canon technology that makes getting that great shot as simple as pressing the shutter button. Smart AUTO automatically detects scenes by assessing various factors in both the background and the subject. Detected scenes are analyzed using 32 predefined shooting situations. The camera then makes optimal settings to ensure the best possible image capture, whether you\u2019re shooting stills or video. Smart AUTO also includes Advanced Subject Detection, which allows the camera to detect and track non-human moving subjects like animals and vehicles. With Smart AUTO, all you have to do is frame your shot and capture away.\n\nShooting Modes/Special Scene Modes\nSmart AUTO\nThe camera automatically selects the best shooting settings for optimal quality based on subjects and environmental factors to provide point-and-shoot simplicity.\nKids & Pets Reduced focusing time freezes fast-moving subjects, so you won't miss those special shots.
