It has been a month and most mornings his belly band is dry. Yay for cranberry. I am ordering my second one now for the maintenance.",

I also had to force them down her throat. These treats, however, my dogs absolutely love! And they work just as good as the Proin did. No vet visits to get it is a bonus too! It's all natural, no chemicals, which is very important to me. I gave them two a day at first, for a few months, then went down to one a day and I have no issues with them peeing in the house.",

Why?? Of all the possible ingredients, I'm so surprised NaturVet chose milk. Typical adult cats don't really process cows' milk, the lactose upsets their stomachs. My cat threw up about 5 minutes after I gave this to her mixed with her normal cat food. Poor thing. At least I got my money back with Amazon's return policy. Your experience may vary, but this didn't work for my cat.",

My dog drinks a ton of water, but I still have a hard time cleaning up an accident if I do not give these to him each day.",

I figured the stress on both of us was not helping her infection.",
