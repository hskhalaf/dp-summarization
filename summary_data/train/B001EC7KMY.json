I believe the Vortex is superior to the Leupold and it costs less. My wife, son and myself harvested several deer using this scope this year. I even had a sling break causing the rifle to fall off my shoulder and onto the gravel road I was walking on. The scope hit hard enough it suffered some scratches but was still dead on!

I love that the zoom has a thumb-friendly throw... no need to add weird zip-tie configurations to make it cold-weather and glove friendly. Adjusting the sights is a breeze, with assertive clicks as you adjust the crosshairs, with each click equalling about 1/4 MOA. Clicks are not soft or mushy feeling, at all.

This scope performed beyond my expectations. Good clarity, good zoom, great price, and Vortex's warranty, it was a no brainer. With my handloads and experimenting with different powder, this scope enabled me to put 8 shots inside a quarter out of a 10 shot string. I've owned different scopes over the years but, none compare to the quality of this one. The only thing I can note is, there is some blurring at the outer edges at higher magnification. Other than that, great product.",
