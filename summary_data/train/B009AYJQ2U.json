Video looks great and i like the idea of charging the battery from within the camera. That way you don't end up forgetting the charger dock (which i always seem to do). Great Camera Great Price.",

I bought it as a backup for my OM-D EM10, but my wife took one look, and decided it would make a nice upgrade for her old Canon pos. Fine with me. The set-up can take some menu-digging (I like that sort of fiddly stuff), but then it's plain sailing. I set it on iAuto or P, and my wife is off to the races. Very nice build - solid and feels nice in the hand. Good stuff!",

But after a while It feels nice to use this camera and I can operate it fast enough. Pros: -manual focus -screen is tiltable -charge with USB -good built quality Cons: -touchscreen isn't configurable (you can just turn the touchscreen feature on or off. Would be nice to be able to select some functions) -touchscreen is useless for anything but scrolling through pictures",
