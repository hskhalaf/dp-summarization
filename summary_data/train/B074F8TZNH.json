      "text": "I bought this to replace my older Brother SE400. This new model embroiders really nicely and is easy to use. I love that it has a port for a memory stick so you can easily load any pattern or name. I use Amazing Designs lettering software because I mostly embroider names. I can easily use the Amazing Designs software to create a name then just transfer it via the memory stick to the new Brother Embroidery machine. The older models have a similar feature but you have to use a cord to transfer the designs, which was difficult since my computer was in a different room.",

      "text": "I purchased this model specifically to replace my beloved CS6000i as I am an avid quilter. Unfortunately, after just a few test stitches were tried, the machine began providing an error message that the needle is bent or there is a thread tangle. Regardless of attempts to service (tried every provided needle and no thread tangle) the machine stopped sewing. This seems like a systemic Brother issue as this is why I replaced my previous machine. I have returned this model and ordered a Singer Quantum instead with an extended warranty and a ton more for the money in means of stitch options and speed.",

It is a fun little machine, I've never machined embroidered and this will walk you right through that (and youtube is very helpful for those of us that are visual learners) I got mine on sale about $50 less than is listed now, so I would recommend waiting on a sale on Amazon, use the extra saved to get thread and stabilizer.",
