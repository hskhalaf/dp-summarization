The sole is much too soft, which sounds counter-intuitive (wouldn't you want a softer sole?) but it feels like walking on spongy yoga mats instead of a proper shoe. The actual tread is very soft, which I'm sure gives great grip but it wears out fast. I only wore this shoe for 1 day and I count my lucky stars that I was able to return it. Sperry didn't do the proper research on this one.",

I wore them with standard quarter length socks and they just weren't comfortable after a couple hours of light walking around a wedding and reception. If they added a bit of padding to the heel, I think I would've been fine. Unfortunately I had to return them. If you don't experience the heel rubbing, then I think you'll enjoy these just fine!",

I kept them though and have been wearing them, but they have been wearing out like cray recently. There are multiple holes that have worn into it, the sperrys logo on the back of the right food is tearing off, and the siding is starting to separate from the shoes. Unless I can get these replaced for super fast wear and tear then this was kind of a bust purchase. Shoes are made to be worn and if they fall apart because you wear them as your normal shoes then they aren't worth buying.",
