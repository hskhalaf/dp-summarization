      "text": "Excellent-love the built in alarm. The only thing I don't like is that the diagonal slide inside stops some of the envelopes from sliding all the way through and they get stuck at the bottom where it touches the inner wall of the safe and the slot to put the envelopes or money is a bit too wide, allowing someone with a long stick object to retrieve the envelopes or money that did not go through all the way. Therefore I suggest mounting it somewhere above eye level where they can still feel for the slot and deposit, but making it hard for someone to see and reach inside.",
