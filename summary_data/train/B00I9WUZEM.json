It is one of the best RPGs I have played in years, the story is immersive and the action well balanced within it. I haven't played too much of the additional content yet, concentrating more on the main story however I feel the longevity will keep me coming back for a while, this is only compounded by the fact it has free DLC added regularly which is adding considerably to the available content. Definitely one of the contenders for game of the year.",

That's not meant to discredit this game, the story is very compelling and you do get a feel for the game and the world behind Geralt (The main man). Hunting monsters and doing bidding for kings and queens is the bread and butter of this game. The quests vary in content and requirements and the game constantly has a fresh feel. I started over once because I upgraded in a skill class which I thought later on in the game may not have been so useful, all part of the learning :)",

It has an embedded card game called 'Gwent' (I have never been in to cards but have become addicted). I love this game it is just plain superb and the best out there in my opinion. This and GTA V have kept me totally engrossed for many days/weeks. It has the same long update downloads that all games seem to have these days. Well worth putting up with that. Delivery and packaging was fine.",

It has a totally immersive world with a wonderfully complex story line. Witcher is more adult than Skyrim so be warned. It is also more complex in terms of interface and also the shear magnitude of interactive items and characters. It is HUGE!! Be prepared to loose many, many hours playing this game.",
