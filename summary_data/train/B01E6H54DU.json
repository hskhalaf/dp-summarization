      "text": "\"Better than an air horn\" was how a fellow cyclist described it. I have never felt more safe. This jacket is better than several flashing lights on your bike combined. Easily the most reflective thing on the road. My only complains are that even with the vents open it is stuffy and does not breathe well, leaving the rider pretty sweaty even on cool days, especially if one is carrying a back pack, and it is a little tight around the shoulders (get a larger size if in doubt). If it had a little more give around the shoulders and better cooling, either through a material change or more vent zips, it would be the perfect night time cycling jacket.",

      "text": "To be fair, I've not taken the jacket out for a ride in the rain yet, and that might influence my review, i.e. if it leaks, that's going to knock off a star or two. I first ordered a 'Small' according to the measurements, but it was too tight around my arms, so I returned it for a 'Medium'. The front zipper and main pocket zippers are rubberized - very nice ! - , but there are zippers beneath the arms you can open for more ventilation, and those don't have rubberization. Overall this Jacket feels comfortable, the back vent provides some airflow despite the seemingly non-breathable material. The reflexivity is quite astounding. I hope it hold up !",

      "text": "Bad: I wore it less than two weeks (1 hour running and 1 hour biking each day) and had not even washed yet and the jacket developed multiple small tears under the armpits and on the sleeves where the fabric bends. In other spots the reflective material fell off of the outside of the jacket. Good: It was very reflective. I felt very sure that cars were able to see me in the dark.",

    "title": "Proviz Reflect360 Mens Cycling Jacket",
    "description": "New for Fall 2014....The REFLECT360 cycling jacket is the world's first to be designed using a 100% reflective outer-shell. The jacket's high quality material is designed to look and feel great while keeping the weather out. The reflective ability of the material helps other road users to identify a cyclist's position on the road at night giving them an extra few seconds of time to react and manoeuvre appropriately. The REFLECT360 jacket incorporates multiple vents - front, shoulder/back and under arm. This allows the user to regulate body temperature. By opening the front zipper vents a 'through-flow' is achieved. The air enters the front vents, cools the body and exits via the shoulder/back vents. During the winter, the vents can be closed and are designed to also be used as extra pockets if required. These features enable the jacket to be used all year round. The jacket also has an inside chest pocket and large lower back pocket to store an extra layers or a map.",
