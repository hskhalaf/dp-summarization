Also Petdom reached out to me he same day to resolve the issue. Sorry Petdom for the bad review, I take it back so far so good",

I don't understand how they could even sell this. I complained to them and they sent me a new one. The same thing happened. So so so poorly made and cheap. SOO cheaply made.
