I had two different reps call me and take over my computer. After after the second one talked to me about my compromised IP address he tried to sell me a 5 year subscription for $329.00. I declined and ask that he get off of my computer remotely and now my computer has been stuck on this screen for over 30 minutes. Do not buy!!!",
