That being said, I don't plan on using this for loud parties, so it does what is expected (being used in kitchen while cooking). however, if someone wants a speaker like this for louder occasions, I'd suggest finding another speaker.",

The sound is what you'd expect from a speak of this price range. There isn't any deep bass that will blow you away, but it does the job. I mostly use mine in the bathroom or outdoors for quiet background music. If you are looking for a bluetooth speaker to bring music to a party, you would be better off going with something much more robust.",

      "text": "The Spracht AURA BluNote Bluetooth speaker originally sold for $130 which is an absurd price considering its cheap build quality and barely acceptable sound quality. I purchased mine for about 60% less than that and still feel this speaker is an inferior value. The sound is simply too poor to make this suitable for any sort of serious music listening. No dynamic range or anything resembling bass. And forget about playing it loud. When a company releases a product this poor it makes me question it as a whole. Pass on Spracht and spend your money on brand that shows concern for product quality.",

I bought this as a Lightning Deal for an amazing price.I was skeptical at first, but when my husband started playing music on it, I was shocked. The bluetooth recognized & paired with his phone fairly quickly, and the sound is just amazing! We haven't tested the connection from far away just yet, but we don't ever plan on using it when the phone is too far. Also interesting is that since its BlueTooth you can project your phone calls through it too. We found that out by accident.",

I can come home, play pandora on my tablet in the office and take the speaker pretty much all over the house with me. The only con is that my HTC Evo has been unable to connect via blue-tooth to it which would earn this speaker 5 stars from me.",

This is no Creative D200 that I also have but the sound is good enough. I took a star off for the bass and the plastic smell. As expected the bass is lacking from a speaker this size. That probably counts for 1/4 of a star but that smell of cheap plastic deserves the other 3/4 star. overall this speaker is pretty good as long as you stay a few feet away(smell).",

I bought this to use as a speakerphone and in that regard, it falls a bit short. The speaker volume is WAY down and not as clear as it should be - I have a Motorola speaker/speakerphone that's about a third the size of this and it works much better. I do like the fact that it uses 4 AA batteries instead of a built-in rechargeable battery that inevitably is dead when you want to use the speaker.",
