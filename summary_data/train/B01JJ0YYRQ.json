We worked with the warranty department and it acknowledged the product was faulty. We received a replacement but it behaved similarly to the first kevo. We called the warranty department again. Their response was that they will only work with us to test the product but there was no way they would refund the purchase price. To save your frustration, do not buy this product. Our battery cost has exceeded the kevo lock price on top of the kevo purchase",

It is recommended to calibrate the lock do it can tell when your phone is inside versus outside. That way it can never be used to unlock the door while your phone is already inside.",
