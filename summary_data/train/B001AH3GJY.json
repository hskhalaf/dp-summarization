I like the beveled edge and that it comes with proper mounting hardware. Was packaged nicely. No damage upon arrival.",

It looks great, but now I have a HUGE amount of patching and touch up that I'll have to do.",

After visiting two big name home improvement stores and not seeing anything in stock that I thought would work I started searching sites and after a couple of days of searching and measuring and visualizing I decided to give this a try. Others had given it a great review. My husband and our contractor were both very impressed. It couldn't be more perfect.",

After seeing the same type and style of mirror for at least $150.00 in catalogues, then finding it here on Amazon under $100.00 was truly a welcomed bargain. The package was shipped with care, and arrived quickly. If you want a great value at an equally tremendous price, then this mirror should be your first choice!",
