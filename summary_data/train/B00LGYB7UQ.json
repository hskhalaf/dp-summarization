She refuses to wear them anymore. One of them was broken after about 10 uses. Did we do something wrong? Shouldn't they last longer? *edit - Amazon was kind enough to send another. And guess what? After a month of use (maybe 10 times?) - broke in the same spot again",

The liner is two separate pieces so the toe portion slides over the heel portion as you adjust it. The laces are easy to snug up and there is a loop at the end to attach to an elastic band, so the ends don't dangle and get caught in the wheels. The ankle strap adjusts easily.",
