      "text": "When I opened the box and found something that appeared to be a square of plastic with a wire coming out, I had my doubts. But this antenna is great! It picks up all my local stations except one, even in the worst weather. The previous antenna was a stand-up model, and it would lose reception if the wind blew too hard! Apart from its reception ability, it is almost completely invisible. It is taped to the wall behind a picture (which doesn't bother it at all), and all that can be seen is a thin white wire going down the wall. I would highly recommend this antenna.",

After getting a thorough runaround from the cable company following the switch to HD, we'd had enough and decided to just get rid of it altogether. The antenna is very easy to install and we get more channels than we did with basic cable. We did lose access to the Discovery Channel, but gained a few extra Public Broadcasting and \"oldies\" channels. It's worth noting that we do lose reception if it's storming heavily outside. However, I am overall very pleased. We even bought a mini antenna for the kitchen television.",

For my area it even beat out the clearstream2 for VHF reception (UHF was slightly better on the clearstream than the winegard). I receive 62 channels right now with this antenna, all for free of course.",
