I recommend that you manually mark the signal traces onto a 4-pole 2.5mm sub-mini plug to USB cable in the event you lose the original charging cord.",

The drawback is that I don't think the noise-canceling (NC) feature is very effective - I use them on trains in Eastern Europe, and the roar of the train is diminished only slightly, once the NC function is switched on. I was hoping to avoid having to listen to audio-books at almost full volume, but alas. Expensive lesson.",
