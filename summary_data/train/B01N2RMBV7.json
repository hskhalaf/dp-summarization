We will have to see how long it will remain good, but I have the impression already that it will be much longer than white boards which fail usually after a short time.

Only thing I will say is that the blackboard is actually like contact paper chalkboard. It is not actually a chalkboard like a heavy made one. It works well so I am happy with that and is nice and big to teach kiddos.",
