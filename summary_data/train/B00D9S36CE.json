One user connection is in a house (60' away). Yea this modem is an \"older\" model but I would buy it again as long as it performs as it has...period",

When I called tech support I spoke to a rude and impatient girl who was able to improve the range slightly but it still doesn't reach over 30 feet and I'm being generous with that estimate. And when I called I was also told that the warranty was up. I had only had it for a few days so I'm not sure what that's about. I wish I had returned it.",
