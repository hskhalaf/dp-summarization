My daughter is extremely happy with her beautiful new bed and I'm thrilled that we have that storage space but I do with it was a few inches deeper.",

      "text": "We assembled it over a couple days to give ourselves some time. We made a mistake in the beginning by putting the sides in wrong position. So reversing that cost us time halfway through. Putting in the lift bracket was tricky, needing an extra pair of hands. Having a socket wrench with an Allen bit did help overall & to tighten fittings. The two boxes delivered were well packed and all the parts clearly labeled. The frame is well built and sturdy. The storage capacity seems good. It is easy to lift with the hydraulics. A little hard to push it back down. We plan to put some lightweight bulky items in the storage and free up closet space.",

You do need 2 people to assembly toward the end. But so far so good. Will update in about a year unless something goes wrong by then. Thanks for the product.",

I also love that the bedding doesn\u2019t mess up when you lift the bed. Even though we were tired after we assembled it (started late in the evening), she couldn\u2019t wait to organize her storage space. One of the floorboards had a slight tear in the \u201cleather,\u201d but you can\u2019t see it when the bed is made. Great purchase!",
