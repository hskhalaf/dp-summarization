What I did not notice in the ad for this one is that the arms lay flat against the wall when empty - there is no offset or accommodation for thick towels, and will stick out from the wall if you use more than one of the arms. also, unless you fan out the arms so there is space between each towel, wet towels do not air dry. That said, it is built well, is hefty, and the chrome appears to be of good quality. But because it sticks out so far from the wall when loaded with towels, I am seriously considering removing this and using standard hooks, instead.",

If I tried to force it, I may have damaged something, so I had to leave it off. Fortunately, that is not the side most seen. But still aggravating to have a bare screw on one side because of a small tolerance that didn't work.",

I used them in a remodel project for my daughter, and liked them so well that I'ordered them again to use in a new project as well. I found them to be sturdy, easy to install, and sharp looking.",
