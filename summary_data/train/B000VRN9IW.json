    "description": "Now need never contend with a burned-out otoscope bulb again! Prepare to be amazed at the clear, bright, unobstructed view it provides, using an LED Fiberoptic light source. Why LED? The energy efficiency and durability of this otoscope is unmatched especially when compare to Halogen light sources. The LED light source has no filament to break like a conventional incandescent powered otoscope. The LED bulb is shock resistant unlike halogen which is incandescent and contains a fragile filament. You will be amazed by the amount of light created by the LED bulb. The light produced by this otoscope is full spectrum white light and not the yellow light typically created by incandescent light bulbs on other otoscopes. With a light emitting diode there is no fragile filament to break so it can withstand repeated dropping or rough handling. The halogen bulbs found on other otoscopes burn very hot and eat battery power, they are also somewhat fragile, and can be broken when the otoscope is dropped or handled in any rough manner. The special halogen bulbs in some premier otoscopes cost up to forty dollars each, and aside from failing when dropped, they burn out after a time, just from ordinary usage. ***This Otoscope is also available with an Ophthalmoscope from our RA Bock website *** Before you purchase an otoscope visit the site www.Fakespot.com to to check for fake positive reviews. It definitely will be worth your while to know which companies are being honest and who is gaming the review system on Amazon.",
