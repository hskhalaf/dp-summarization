This little camera have traveled all over...Europe, the Caribbean Central and South America. It traveled so easy as it fits in a pocket and any sized purse. I don't use it as much now, because of all the high tech cellphones, it has kind of become obsolete. But I still love it and use it occasionally",

The bad side: The rocker/toggle switch used to zooming in and out the lens is fragile! After one year of use the rocker/toggle switch broke. I can zoom in to focus images but to zoom out I have to turn off and on the camera to reset the lens. Be very careful in using the rocker/toggle switch for the lens.",

I replaced a Canon SD1400IS with this one, because I have two little kids, and needed a super fast focusing camera to keep from missing shots. The only negative I could even say about this is that some of the pictures turn out a little on the cool side. It's an easy fix with any editing software, but most people probably won't even notice it. I'm just a little picky. :)",

Face Detection technology detects up to eight individual faces and adjusts focus, exposure, and white balance to help deliver crisp, properly lit images of family and friends. \n\nMotion Detection\nMotion Detection, along with Face Motion Detection adjusts ISO sensitivity and increases the shutter speed when movement is detected, reducing blur in moving subjects and faces \n\nPet Mode\nPet-mode minimizes blur when shooting moving pets utilizing Motion Detection technology and automatically turns off the flash to reduce glowing pet eyes. AF illumination is also disabled so you can take more natural expressions avoiding startling your pets. \n\nDynamic Range Optimizer Standard and Plus\nDynamic Range Optimizer (DRO) Standard and Plus uses a sophisticated algorithm to help recover shadows and highlights. The result is more natural images with clearer details that more closely match what your naked eye sees. DRO is particularly effective when shooting backlit portraits or any scene with a dramatic contrast between background and foreground lighting. DRO Plus allows for even greater optimization by analyzing each region of an image and performing additional image processing. \n\nEasy Shooting Mode\nWith Easy Shooting Mode, even beginners can take great photos.
