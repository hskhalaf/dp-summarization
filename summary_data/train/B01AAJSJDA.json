I bought two packs and had this issue with both silver markers. Overall, a classy way to notate glassware.",

To others point, though it writes very well on a wine glass, if you write on the glass after putting ice and letting your drink sit for a bit, not so much. It doesn't dry and it smears off. It does have a metallic shimmer to it and it's fun having the different colors for your guests to choose from. I'd still recommend however I'm not sure it's worth the money. A cheaper option would work just as well. Cheers!",

Anyway, I probably would buy again for the red, green, and silver pens. *Update* I got in touch with the Wine Glass Markers team and notified them of what happened. Next thing I knew, I found a new pack at home waiting for. This time all the pens worked perfectly!!",
