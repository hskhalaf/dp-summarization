Maybe I've just been lucky since some other reviewers seem to have had problems. I'd buy this pepper grinder again in a heart beat.",

Keep in mind - when going from coarse grind to fine, you need to twist a few times to clear out the big chunks remaining in the works, before you get a fine grind. Fine is really fine, coarse is really chunky. Easy to keep clean, easy to reload, easy to use.",

      "text": "Finally!!!! Not just another overpriced pepper grinder! Grind quality across the full adjustment range from course to fine is perfect! Grind uniformity at all levels, course to fine, is perfect and predictable every time! Volume even at finest setting is very high saving a lot of wasted time and effort required by all most all other grinders I've owned. (I've owned at least 30 other grinders) Cheaper would be better of course but this is the best hand driven pepper grinder I've found to date. Congrats to Cole & Mason!",

It allows you to adjust the grind size, it's easy to refill, and it provides a consistent grind. Since I use it several times a day it's a pleasure to have something so well made. Highly recommend.",

They come filled with salt and pepper which is a nice touch. While the grinders look the same there is a slight difference in them as the pepper grinder has 6 size settings and the salt has 3.
