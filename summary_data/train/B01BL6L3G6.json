To unlock its full potential, I did buy 2 full frame (Pentax-FA K-mount) lenses. Its image quality is stunning especially in low light conditions. Since it was released in April 2016, it is pricey but totally worth it. I would recommend it ONLY to serious photographers. If you're considering buy it, I say go for it you won't be disappointed.",

With my old lenses from film working, I tried 2 aps-c lenses the da 40mm and da 70 mm and they both work on full frame flawlessly.

It clearly doesn't work well with some lenses and to combine your star shot with stationary objects will require 2 shots because the astrotracer moves the sensor, so anything not moving at the speed of the sky will be blurred. PixelShift and the built in HDR are both amazing and fun. The camera does a lot so it's not really so much an \"on the move\" camera to me as a \"set up the shot\" camera.

    "title": "Pentax K-1 Full Frame DSLR Camera (Body Only)",
    "description": "Configuration:BaseThe K-1\u2019s new full frame 36.4 MP effective CMOS sensor isn\u2019t just another full frame sensor. The K-1 is engineered to incorporate all of the performance requirements of high resolution full frame 35mm digital photography, adding PENTAX unique performance features and characteristics. An improved noise processing algorithm provides unprecedented performance in shadows or low light shooting where high ISO settings are critical for good performance. With the highest ISO in it\u2019s class, the K-1 has achieved a staggering sensitivity range of up to ISO 204,800. This is attributable to a combination of the new large pixel, full frame sensor that has high noise resistance, and the new PRIME IV processor. Newly developed 5-axis SR II system covers the shake of yaw, pitch, roll, vertical, and horizontal motion of the camera. Shake reduction performance is improved to 5 shutter steps of compensation effect. Since SR is built-in to the K-1 body, it\u2019s operation works with every K-mount lens. Combining both the K-1\u2019s SR mechanism and the GPS feature, Astro Tracer easily tracks and photographs astronomical objects. By using movement of the image sensor during image exposure, the K-1 sensor generates the same level of moir\u00e9-reduction effect as optical AA (anti-aliasing) filter, without the softening effect. Unlike fixed optical AA filters, this allows the user to adjust the level of the moir\u00e9-reduction effect from OFF, Type1 and Type2. Bracketing of these settings is also available. For quick and easy operation in dark situations, the K-1 has new operation assist lighting placed in strategic locations on the body of the camera. The K-1 is carefully sealed in 87 different places for durable usage under harsh weather conditions. Get the shot anywhere, from any position, using the extremely nimble and flexible Cross-Tilt display. Shoot from the ground up, over the crowd, and around the corner, with extreme agility not found in other full frame offerings.",
