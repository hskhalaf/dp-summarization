Checked all connections. Rinsed and repeated. Taped all hose connections, disconnected and reconnected all hoses. Checked the connection at the faucet adapter. Rinsed, repeated. Doesn't matter what I do, it runs for a couple of minutes then errors out with E4. I don't think it's strong enough to pump out the water and/or there's something already wrong with it. Either that, or I'll have to elevate it 4 feet above the sink to get gravity's help. This thing is a piece of crap. Avoid like the plague.",

The only real noise are the few times it lets water out. It does not dry the dishes which is fine but it gets them squeaky clean. I was nervous with some of the reviews but it totally surprised me how awesome this little machine is. Fits enough in there for what I need. Highly recommend.",
