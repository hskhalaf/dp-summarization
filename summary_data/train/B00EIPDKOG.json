It worked great and was easy to install. The only downside is the little logo on the bottom right corner. Don't love it, but worth it to pay half the price of sinks in stores like home depot. We were worried about scratching so we just got a metal grate for the bottom and so far we have had no issues. We have had it installed for about 9 months now.",

The only thing I will mention is that you have to get an EXTENDED flange for this sink as a standard one won't be deep enough. They get one less star because they weren't super helpful in helping me find a suitable flange for it... I also ended up needing to get a flange that didn't match the faucet because it's not a standard size flange. Otherwise, it's a nice sink,",

But Amazon really was so convenient and easy and cost effective! I ordered the sink and it was delivered to my door within a week or so. I never had one worry about getting it home, lifting or carrying. The contractor carried from the garage to the kitchen. Order the facet and the pendulum light as well from Amazon. The only problem and not convenient was neither the facet or the sink provided a phangle for the sink so a quick trip to Lowes was needed to purchase the flange.",
