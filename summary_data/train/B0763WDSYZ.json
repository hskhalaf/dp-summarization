      "text": "Brother HL-L2350DW model. Great product. Set up in minutes. Just pressed the WiFI button on the printer and the WPS button on my modem - and the printer recognized it instantly. Looking forward to saving $$$ by not having to buy inkjet cartridges for my old Epson NX415 - which was constantly telling me that I needed to replace the color cartridges even though I had NEVER printed anything but BLACK. What a sham. No more inkjet scam for me. This Brother laser printer prints in black only (which is what I need), seems to be well made, and fits nicely on my desk (smaller than the old Epson). So far I am a happy customer.",

      "text": "The HL-L2350dw wrinkles envelopes unless you open the back door and press down on two green tabs. This must be done each time you wish to print envelopes, as soon as you close the back door the green tabs return to their up position. For my use, this downgrades the printers usability as that is way to much trouble to do every other letter I print. I'm currently print envelopes on another printer to get by. May decide to see this one back.",

Just unbelievable trying to print envelope. You have to manually feed them one at a time. Directions say insert envelope into slot paper guides until the front edge touches the paper feed roller. You can't tell when envelope touches feed roller so envelope is inserted to far. That causes a \"inside paper jam\". You then have to open front and clear the jam.",

      "text": "*I haven\u2019t used tech support yet so I left it blank* I LOVE LOVE THIS PRINTER!!! For basic printing, which is what I bought it for, it\u2019s amazing. Crisp, clear lettering and images. Black and white but that\u2019s ok. Also it prints incredibly fast but quietly. It makes noise but by the time u expect to be \u201cprinting\u201d u realize it had already printed haha. Soooo fantastic. I use this for school since I\u2019m online and all books are online. Sometimes I like to have hard copy of chapter to read or whatnot. This printer makes that easy and the crispness of the printing makes for less headaches when reading. 10/10 would recommend/buy again.",

This took over 30 minutes of frustration and not knowing wtf was running, downloading, installing, or otherwise going on as there is a royal mess of popup windows that are hard to follow. I work in IT and am used to being patient with low-usability software, otherwise I'd probably have given up and just connected a cable. I took two stars off for the experience, because in addition to the crappy setup wizard, the printed instructions don't reflect what happens on this printer when I followed them, and were essentially useless. Thank the demigods for Windows in all it's reliable glory.",

This model runs faster and quieter than the previous one, and shuts down automatically after use, saving electricity.",
