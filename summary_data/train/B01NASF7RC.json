Thus far, I will say this: the drag appears to be good. I was actually impressed. For the price, this is a no brainer. I bought two 4wt reels and they hold 50 yards of 20lb backing, with 100 foot of weight forward taper perfectly. It is unlikely a 4wt reel will end up in the backing, unless you are fishing water you shouldn't, but... if perchance you hook into a toad, the drag should hold just fine.",

There is some slop between the spool and spindle, and the spool isn\u2019t balanced so when retrieving line the handle wobbles. The drag is quite poor, without much usable range. Also, it only barely fits a standard, WF5F line and 50 yards of #20 backing. But what can you expect for a $16 dollar reel. If all you plan to use it for is hold line, and not fight fish into your backing than it should get the job done.",

My comment at this time (as I have not fished with it yet) is that when loading WF 4F line, it only needed 20 feet of 20 lb backing, just enough to cover the arbor a couple of times and so that I would have some backing to tie the fly line onto. The arbor of the reel is large in diameter, a nice design item for a 3/4 weight reel. Converting it from right to left hand was super easy, watch the video. The clip in the printed instructions is not the correct clip. The clip is retained within the arbor.",

It just isn't worth even the small amount that it cost. I ended up replacing with a better reel. Don't bother!",
