The game itself is classic Poke\u0301mon gameplay. If you\u2019re thinking about purchasing any of the classic Poke\u0301mon games on 3DS, get this one. It\u2019s a bang for your buck, and it even includes content from Red and Blue. Only thing that it doesn\u2019t have is a Pikachu following you around, like in Yellow, but that\u2019s okay. Enjoy it! It even has online capabilities, as far as I\u2019m concerned. You can also trade with anyone else who owns Crystal, Gold, Silver, Red, and Blue on their 3DS.",

The graphics are extremely nostalgic, the Poke\u0301mon sprites are nostalgic, & in general it's a rememberable game. If you haven't played Pokemon Crystal I highly recommend it.",

If you want to start a new adventure in the game you must save over (hence deleting) the previous save file.

One can buy two 2ds systems for the price of one 3ds, which is worth it if you want to trade.",
