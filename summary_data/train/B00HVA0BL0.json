      "text": "The first lamp quit holding a charge after a couple of months of infrequent use. Hisgadget sent me a replacement, but the second lamp was worse than the first - it quit working completely after only using a few times. I returned this and asked for another replacement, since my original purchase was still under warranty. Instead they issued me a refund and have asked me multiple times to change my rating since \"a low rating review really sets us back by a lot.\" If you make a product that doesn't quit working after a few months, and don't harass customers to change reviews, you would likely get better product ratings.",

The other two would actually turn on with out the chord, however, the light output was so weak that it's not even practical to use. Other than that, they work great when plugged in. Surprisingly!!!",

The vendor has been wonderful. The best customer service I have received from any Amazon partner.

However, he was always trying to move it around to light up different areas around his desk. He was knocking everything over! That's when I saw this - pretty much the same light he uses now - but CORDLESS! Granted, this lamp goes out far less light than the T100. The on/off button is a little trickier for him to use as it's not an overly obvious button to push. But it works perfectly for what he wants - freedom to decide where to have the light for him.",
