I called the number in the manual and the woman said there is no cost to register the TV and that the first number must have been a scam.",

For example, one of the buttons is pre-programmed for \"Sling\" which would be great if I subscribed to Sling, but I don't. I would like to have the ability to re-program that button for PBS. I checked with TCL support and nope, nada, no can do. It would seem like such a little thing for a \"Smart TV\" to do.",

The remote loudness and mute controls are on the right side area of the remote, which is awkward if you are right handed.

But It hasn't the range of controls that the Samsung possessed, such as sound equalization or fine-tuning of various picture qualities. And it has really bad speakers. They sound like they're under water. I'm sure they saved two, maybe three dollars by using cheap speakers. I bought a Dell AC511 USB Wired SoundBar from Amazon to compensate, cost just under $23.",

      "text": "The television looked fine coming out of the box, but once I plugged it in and hooked up my set-top box and other devices, I noticed some weird \"hot spots\" on the screen -- places where it looked liked the screen wasn't fully flat. After turning the TV off and studying the reflection, I noticed that the screen was horribly warped in the top left corner, as well as in the top middle and bottom right of the screen. When the television is on, you can't see these warps until the screen goes completely black, and when it does, it looks like you're looking in a fun house mirror. Buyer beware!",

Seems backwards and is actually decently bright. Overall it\u2019s a good tv for the price we pay. It\u2019s great for a tv you only use every once and awhile.
