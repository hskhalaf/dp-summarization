Chain stops rotating pretty quickly. Balance in OK, considering I have that heavy duty extension cord on it. Only ding off 5 stars is the chain does not bite from time-to-time. I'd guess the depth gauges / guides need to be ground down a little and perhaps that's by design to prevent overbite. Do check the chain tension frequently in the beginning, as with all new chains, it will stretch, and any unevenness on the bar will grind down, resulting in slop.",

It cuts plenty fast, with hardly any pressure, and high RPMs are needed to keep the motor cool. After a recent storm, a thick 14 inch diameter limb from a pine tree came crashing down. No problem at all. This saw cut through it like butter. I highly recommend this saw. I also have the B+D 20V Max Battery chain saw which has a 10 inch bar. What can you cut with that? You would be astonished! Both are great performers.",

Well-built, easy to use, and plenty of power for cutting down trees and logs near the house. Take a generator with you and you can cut in the woods all day while your buddies are filling up with gas and mathematically calculating fuel/oil ratios.",

With a brand new sharp chain, I was able to cut rounds quite easily for next year's firewood! Well balanced, an easily handled weight, good power. As with any new chain, it required frequent retightening as it stretched. That is where I discovered the neatest design feature -- the chain can be adjusted in seconds without any tools and without taking your gloves off!
