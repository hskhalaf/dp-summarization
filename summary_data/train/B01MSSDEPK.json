I use this one at night and their foaming cleanser in the morning. This one does take getting used too at first because it feels like you are applying moisturizer, but it is actually deep cleaning and leaving your skin nice and soft for the night. This will definitely remain a part of my arsenal!",

It is also great for sensitive skin like mine. It has not caused any irritation. It is also fragrant free, or at least I couldn't smell really anything. I would highly recommend this Face Wash. Remember though this is not a makeup remover. I would remove your makeup first then go back in and wash your face with this.",
