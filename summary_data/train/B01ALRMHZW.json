      "verdict": "Many of the wearers love these low-top hoop shoe from the midfoot to the forefoot, taking particular note of the beastly traction and the materials that the shoe is made of. However, the downfall of the shoe is the frequency of heel slippage experienced both by expert reviewers and ordinary wearers. Consequently, they think that the Curry 2 Low works well for light balling but not for high-performance games.",
      "pros": [
        "Majority of the reviewers agree that the traction of the Curry Two Low is the highlight of the shoe",
        "remarking that regardless of what direction you come from, the shoe stops on a dime when you need it",
        "A few users say that the cushioning is decent especially on the forefoot",
        "Some reviewers like the fit in the toe box, adding that it can accommodate players with wide feet",
        "Many testers commend the shoe for the premium materials used on its upper",
        "At $120, most buyers think the price is just right for the shoe",
        "Almost all users say that the shoe feels more comfortable and breathable than the Curry 1",
        "A lot of wearers appreciate the thicker padding on the shoe\u2019s tongue",
        "Several mention that this is what the sixth Under Armour Stephen Curry shoe is missing",
        "Some say that the color of the shoe stays, and doesn\u2019t get dirty easily like other shoes"

      "cons": [
        "Because the upper is made of textile, majority of the users feel that the shoe does not provide much support",
        "One reviewer complains that when he moves laterally or makes a quick cut, his foot slides over the edge of the shoe",
        "The shoe still needs some breaking in due to the areas with fuse, say some wearers",
        "A few testers advice not to get the Curry 2 Low with the transparent outsole because it attracts dust easily, which can affect the quality of the shoe\u2019s grip",
        "Go for the solid rubber, instead",
        "Several users complain that the craftsmanship is not very good as there were glue stains on the midsole",
        "Many buyers recommend the positively reviewed third Paul George Nike shoe when it comes to aesthetics and the same price",
        "Some users do not recommend the Curry Two Low for competitive basketball"
