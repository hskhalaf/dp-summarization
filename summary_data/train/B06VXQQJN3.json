The NFC Bluetooth pairing worked like a charm. The Bluetooth play of my music and podcasts is very nice with Android. I especially like the customizable color settings. It really blends in with the rest of the car. What surprised me is it correctly dims when the rest of the I instrument gauges dim. That is the first aftermarket stereo I've seen that really does it.",
