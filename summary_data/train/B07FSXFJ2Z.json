The only con about this float is the deflation. Should have more nozzles to release air. Takes time to get the air out.",

We had hard time carrying it because there is no handels all around (only two on one side) and no rope all around, so we had nothing to grab to. Also it didn\u2019t stay inflated properly not even 24 hours. The inside of the cooler part is not insulated at all so water of the cold river just melted our ice in 10 minutes. The cup holders do not hold bottles, only cans which is veird and everyone on the raft had bottles. We did like having mash floor and we did like all the space and back support.",
