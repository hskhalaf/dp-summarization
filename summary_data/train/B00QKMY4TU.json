I was a little worried because it was a canned item, and they were used to eating lots of home cooking. But they just love this savory beef stew, and they can't wait for me to serve it up! I'm very happy with the way the cans are packaged, and they are delivered in a timely manner too. I will continue to purchase this product.",

We use all 3 caned flavors, dry and dog treats. After less than a year, the newest blood work shows normal! This flavor is the wettest of the 3 available. We really cut down on table scraps, but he still gets a tiny amount each day. Love this stuff. Likely adding years to his life expectancy.",
