Well, my cats don't care one bit, BUT it is thick enough that I know nothing is going to make it through and damage the table. It is fitted, if that makes any sense. Some cheaper ones, like the one we had at first, was just a drop cloth, but this one has a seam that covers over the edges. Very happy investment.",

You might have to put a super giant throw to cover the rest, for color reasons, but this is the best and least expensive slipcover for a couch I have ever seen. Looks classy, expensive, is thick and easy to clean! It smells at first, so is good to air it out before use.",
