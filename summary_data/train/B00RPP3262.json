The price was great. I can't think of a better deal than this. Very satisfied.",

It might not fit your decor for a livingroom if you are particular about style but if you are looking for something sturdy to hold a large TV, this is it.

You'd think with the price of this mount, Kanto could provide FOUR screws that fits properly. So now I have to go to a hardware store and buy the correct screws myself. An excellent mount nonetheless, but Kanto are a bunch of cheapskates that can't provide just a little bit more of range for proper screws.",
