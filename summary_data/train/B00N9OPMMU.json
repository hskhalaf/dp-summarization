This small section (underneath the blue credit card that is pictured in their advertisement) began to tear apart from the rest of the wallet. It made it difficult to remove my credit cards. I finally had to tear it completely off, which was very easy, since it is a VERY thin piece of leather (possibly) or a piece of fake leather (much more likely). I am disappointed, since I did liked the look and feel of this wallet.",

After really liking this a lot for being very thin and easy to use, and using it all the time, it came apart at the seams after 7 months. I didn't overstuff it at all. One card per slot. And not that the whole wallet is now not functional, BUT the two main slots that I used the most are a no go. So inexpensive maybe I should just buy another one. But I'm guessing the same thing would happen again. Short version: works great, but doesn't last very long at all.",

One thing different on this one is that they sewed a tag in one of the center pocket. This tag gets in the way when you try to store cash in that pocket. I wound up cutting this tag out. I hope to get another 5 years from this wallet. By the way I carry 10 cards and 20 bills.",

This was has a nice slot which appears to comfortably hold quite a few folded bills. Overall, I'd say this wallet is a bit wider than other small wallets I owned.

I have no idea about the RFID blocking, so I cannot comment on the effectiveness of that feature. One thing I noticed though, is that I can't comfortably fit as many bills as others claim. If I try, the wallet is way too tight and it's a struggle to remove anything. I don't really carry much cash anyway, but if I needed to for whatever reason, this is not the wallet I'd use. However, for general purpose, it's great!",

I would have sent it back, but I had destroyed my previous wallet in the laundry and needed a wallet immediately. The top edges of the credit card pockets are folded, but not sewn. After 6 months, the leather ripped at the top of one of the pockets. Then the nylon lining came undone. I recommend spending a little more for a better constructed and more durable wallet.",

I'm not talking about sticking two credit cards, more a credit card and a business card. In any event, good quality product, just be advised that sticking anything more than one card in each slot will stretch the slot out more than I think you'd like.",

I gave a metal plate wallet a chance, 3 plates held together with glorified rubber bands, a lot thinner at the start but pretty much the same result (also tore up my credit cards). This wallet is nice and light, not a ton of slots for cards but doubling up doesn't seem to stretch it or stress my cards out. Really unnoticeable compared to my old wallets in my pocket, still check every now and then just to make sure it's there.",

Each card has its own slot, and the middle section holds a few bills. My search is over.",

Very disappointed... really liked this wallet in the beginning.",

This is sewn shut at both ends and you have to slide your folded up money into the very tight center pocket, which severely limits the amount of money that it can carry. Perhaps the leather will stretch over time but as it is now it is very difficult to fit paper money into it. You should not call it a money clip because it gives the buyer the wrong expectation.",
