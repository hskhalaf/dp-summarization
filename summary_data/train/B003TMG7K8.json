The sellers are great people they phoned me to tell me it was shipped, and said if I had any questions to please give them a call. As for the chair the turning radius is awsome and it sets me at bar heitht so I can eat without trying to move from the chair to a stool. Love the machine would recommend it to anyone.",

When going up the ramp my front wheels came off the ground about 4 or 5 inches and that was scary! So needless to say I won't be using that ramp anymore.",
