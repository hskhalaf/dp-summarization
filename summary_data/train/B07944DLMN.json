Its simple yet elegant style easily fits in any boardroom meeting, but because of its light construction, it can also be used on boats or beaches. However, the bottom structure of this walking shoe may be something you need to get used to. But in the end, it still comes highly recommended for its design and performance.",
      "pros": [
        "A majority of the owners find the OluKai Kulana comfy to wear in the office or on the beach",
        "The flexible construction of this slip-on walking shoe makes it easy to traverse uneven surfaces, says many reviewers",
        "According to a bunch of people, this model fits well",
        "Multiple buyers commend the arch support on this model as their feet don\u2019t quickly get tired",
        "The sophisticated aesthetics of this product appeals to a lot of gentlemen"

      "cons": [
        "Some consumers have ranted about the durability of the Kulana because the seams unraveled, and the top material quickly got scuffed",

These Olukai Kulanas look to be the solution. Incredibly well-built and supremely comfortable, couldn't be happier. Particularly grateful for perfectly shaped toe area. No constriction! Only worn them a month, but anticipate no durability issues. Clearly made by people that care.",

I second the other reviewer who pointed out the critical design flaw of these shoes. The rubber does not extend to the toe or the heel so after my husband wore these for literally 1 day indoors the edges of the toe and the heel were already scuffed and leather wearing down. That is completely ridiculous. The arch support and look and fit were great bc he\u2019s a 14 wide and very hard to buy for but at the end of one day they already looked like he had had them for years... not ok. Returned.",
