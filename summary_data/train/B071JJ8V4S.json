I bought these to update my older 21.4\" displays for surround gaming. The VESA mounting standoffs were included in all 3 monitors thankfully. This is because the monitor stand attachment protrudes out the back and without it, you won't be able to use the VESA mounting points on the back. Will update this review after a few months of use.

According to Sceptre's limited warranty, clusters of up to 5 dead non-contiguous, or 3 contiguous pixels is acceptable. I would tend to disagree.

Was very gentle with it during the car ride home, but it cracked and developed a large black stripe down the center of the screen, I am assuming from its own weight due to the curved nature of the screen... If you buy definitely keep the box for any transport.",

Power cable too short. It's seriously only 3ft. I had to plug it into an extension just to reach the outlet under my desk.",
