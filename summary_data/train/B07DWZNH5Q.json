      "title": "good skeleton model",
      "text": "I bought this skeleton model for my anatomy class. And it arrived in a good condition. When i assembled every part of bones, i found it easy to put all together. It is not very heavy , but still carried some weight. In addition, it is good for decorating on Halloween holidays. And it also came with posters showing the names of every parts. I mean it is definitely an excellent teaching aid for tactile learners like to touch the bones and learn all of the names by heart.",

I was using for a honor anatomy course, so it is not as detailed on the bones as I was hoping, but it works for basic anatomy purposes. Also the appendages are only attached with a little piece of metal that hook on both sides, so they fall off almost every time my students move the skeleton. We will end up taking both of them apart and just using them as loose bones.",

The legs and arms connect with a wire and may not exactly align with a real skeleton so you might have to work with the metal wire and adjust it. If you want a skeleton with finger articulation instead of just a piece of molded plastic, you will have to spend more. Assembly is rather obvious and I think easy.",

If you are looking for a skeleton model to use as a reference for accurate anatomical positioning, this is not the skeleton for you.",
