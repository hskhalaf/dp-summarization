Pros The building is excellent, the 3 colors options are so good, the display is so fine with that super amoled tech, beautiful colors and blacks, the sound system is awesome for a tablet (better than iPad Pro), it's light weight easy to carry on, robust processor and ram, SD expansion, the good answer and function of the S-Pen Cons: the not jack connector, it's so sad, the not premium sensation of the S-Pen and unfortunately, the Android system doesn't optimized to the best experience. Tab S6 is a good choice if you hate Apple, like me.",

Most people should be able to compare specs for the tablets they are shopping for. You may find another tablet that will out performs this tablet, but it's going to cost several hundred dollars more. The additional cost vs additional performance was not worth it for me. Very happy with this tablet.",

So far, I've been able to do just about everything I've needed to and it has such a small footprint and it's super lightweight. It's a bit of an adjustment when it comes to using Dex, but I like it a lot! I love having the ability to use it either as a regular Android tablet AND/OR a pseudo-PC! Unless you need to use software that is totally incompatible with Android, this is definitely a good option instead of buying a laptop or Surface for mobile computing! I hugely recommend this device over a Chromebook!",

I use it to game on and for minor work related tasks. Watching movies is great with its 1440p screen and also youtube videos. The S pen is far better than the Galaxy tab s4 and the proccesor would destroy it. The galaxy tab line has shown more progress than apple's ipad though some would say apple is still ahead. Great buy and I can't wait to see what is next from Samsung!",
