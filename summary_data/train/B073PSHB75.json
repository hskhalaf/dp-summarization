I shave down there and it causes me to get razor burn really bad. Overall though if I didn\u2019t have such sensitive skin this would be a great slim shaper it even pushes up my breasts and looks great under clothing. I just wish maybe I should\u2019ve gotten a bigger size. Due to other reviews I bought a small. Mind you I am 140lbs @ 5\u20193 other reviewers seemed to say this size was good for them at that weight I suggest going to what your true size is instead of one smaller.",

Item must be made for individuals with longer torsos: I had fabric bunching at my underbust, and in the small of my back (even after adjusting shoulder straps) and there is a seam where the torso cincher stops and the underwear starts, that cuts into your lower belly and makes it look puckered under tight dresses. Plus the seam is very tight, so there is a noticeable indentation on the sides of the hips. Not attractive. I will be returning this week.",
