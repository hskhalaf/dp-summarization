If you have one of the current generation 1895s like me, you need the #10801. You'll have to drill a new bottom screw hole in the plastic spacer but the pad itself fits pretty much flush on the stock. Luckily for me this #10806 did fit my Mossberg but Limbsaver needs to update their size charts as far as the new Marlins are concerned.",

The Limbsaver doesn't fit perfectly, it rides about 3/32\" higher than the black spacer. You have to be looking for it to notice, because both pieces are black. The material feels like Sorbothane, but it's also hollow and does a very good job cushioning the recoil. The old pad left a light bruise after five rounds in a light tee shirt. The Limbsaver doesn't leave a mark.",

    "title": "LimbSaver AirTech Precision-Fit Recoil Pad for Wood Stocks",
    "description": "Reducing felt recoil by up to 70 percent, the customized LimbSaver AirTech Precision-Fit Recoil Pad for Wood Stocks is designed to specifically fit a variety of rifles, shotguns, and muzzleloaders. LimbSaver's AirTech line features atmospheric chambers that produce a substantial increase in performance through uniform energy dissipation, and it incorporates anti-muzzle jump technology for faster target re-acquisition. The recoil pad enables you to shoot longer without discomfort and bruising, while also helping to increase accuracy of follow-up shots and provide improved control for maximum stability.\n\nIt's made from LimbSaver's proprietary NAVCOM technology (Noise and Vibration Control Material), which effectively absorbs a wide range of frequencies to dissipate energy and vibration. This recoil pad also features a no-slip surface that stays in place even in the rain.
