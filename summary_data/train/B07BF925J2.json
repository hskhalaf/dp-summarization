I am very please with the simple design but high quality of the product and easy to clean plastic side the touches the floor. The resistance bands are great! I use the light resist for arm and thigh exercises slowly gravitating to medium and hard resistance bands but they are all great quality, sturdy rubber and don\u2019t feel like I can easily snap them.

The gray one ripped after the first workout... I know this happens, but on the first day? The greater resistance bands are obviously thicker, but they are still intact. They do roll, but that seems to be a learning curve and common with all bands you buy.",

The heavier bands have gotten slightly better with practice, but the lighter bands are just useless. I have bigger thighs, so maybe that's why. I like the sliders okay, but I think I would prefer the ones that have a lip on them (like a frisbie & like the BeachBody ones they use on 80DO). These sometimes dig into the carpet and I have to shift my weight to get it moving again. The discs are also a little small if you have to have both feet on one disc. I like all the colors though!",

      "text": "My husband and I have started doing High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT). As I was looking for the equipment we would need, I came across these sliders and resistance bands from Borchent. We have been using them for about a month now. They are great quality and are only about half the cost of comparable sliders and bands. I also really like that they come with a bag that they can be stored in. Thanks, Borchent, for making a great product!",

Both of my toes will fit in one slider, but I'm guessing two men's shoes would not fit on just one slider. The lightest band tore after a few days but I accidentally snagged my nail on it. So watch those nails ladies! So that was a bummer. The medium and heavy bands have been great! I love the little carry case. I actually just took the set with me on vacation. It was great!

I have actually pushed them out from under me. Hoping that as I progress I can have more control of the sliders. The loops work great! All in all a fine product.",
