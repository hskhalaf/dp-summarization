It's easy to use, (topical application on the eyelid, around the eye and below the eye) and causes no harm if it gets in your eye. I even found that it helped the healing process more to allow a little into my eye. Cons: A bit expensive. Another thing to note is that this will not help you any or hardly at all when dealing with a bacterial pink eye infection. Skip the use of this product and go immediately to the doctor if you have bacterial pink eye.",
