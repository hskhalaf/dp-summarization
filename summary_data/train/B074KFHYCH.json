I took this pillow with my on a 17 hour flight to Singapore, and it was not comfortable at all. Maybe it was because of the duration of the flight, but the pillow brought very minimal relief. I think the main reason is that the tapered tail cuts down on the element of all around comfort, as that was sacrificed for aesthetics. If you're doing minimal traveling, at around no more than 4 hours, then this pillow would probably be fine. But for anything more, you're probably gonna want to find a better shaped neck pillow.",
