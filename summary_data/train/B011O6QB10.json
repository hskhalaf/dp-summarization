The pockets are really deep. It even has a little cooler pocket for a snack or drink which is pretty cool too. Definitely worth the money and the best part is it\u2019s much less than if purchased in a sports store.",

I give it 4 stars ONLY because it is NOT 14 full length dividers. There are 4 full length dividers, In each \"compartment\" the handles of the clubs still get all tangled and messy, which always bothered me. I don't want to return it and get a more expensive bag that has actual 14 full length individual pockets for each club, so I'll just deal with it. I'll update later after a few rounds and see how it holds up.",

I have mid-size grips on my woods, hybrids, and irons. With a senior grip on the putter it's mandatory to use the outside tube. The slots just barely accommodate the grips and they seem to get tangled up and not let some clubs go all the way to the bottom of the bag. I would think a bag like this would have had a sleeve for the umbrella and not just an adjustable rope loop which does not stay tight.",
