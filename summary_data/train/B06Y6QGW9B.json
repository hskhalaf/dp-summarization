It would have been even better with three or four more clear pockets to accommodate more half hour events but it's not a deal breaker. I just doubled up on the activity card to fit everything in. Love that it hangs over a door instead of nailing or thumb tacking into a wall. Very pleased!",

Altogether a great product for a good price. I highly recommend it.",
