The lan speed is very high, 270-280 Mb out of 300 from Virgin, but this also depends on your pc configuration and all that, BUT the wireless is mindblowing. Gone from 120- 150 Mb on Virgin router to 380-390Mb on D-link.(and i am talking about my phone). 4k streaming on pc is flawless.",

More to follow when it has been set up and running for a few months.",

Approx 40 feet from router. Ridiculous. Returned and purchased Asus RT-N56U, wow, amazing, great software and superlative performance. Best of all? 130quid cheaper, and doesn't resemble something off Battlestar Galactica Summing up, the D-Link is a classic example of style over substance.",
