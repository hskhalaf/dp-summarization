And I was able to make an informed decision by the pictures on AMAZON. I actually save over $300 by buying this Ashley's bench. So happy!",

The faux leather on the seat is tufted in a dark brown matte finish. And the stain on the legs compliments the expresso stain of my bedroom furniture perfectly. Assembly took no time at all - the allen wrench and screws were included in the package to attach the 4 legs to the seat. Easy peasy!",
