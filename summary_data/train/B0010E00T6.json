However, from the dirt in the filter, I conclude the filter has never been changed since original 10 years ago (See the pictures). BTW, I never know there was filter underneath the dash - I found this out from Amazon recommendation (Thank you Amazon! Where has my mechanics being - they never mentioned the filter!?)",

Also the Fram has the airflow arrow on the side of the unit instead of the front. This could confuse some installers since this unit isn\u2019t a square, it\u2019s about 1/3\u201d longer in one direction which is tough to tell until you try to put it in the slot. The direction arrow being on the side of the unit could be confusing to some. I\u2019ll be buying the OEM unit next time.",

It's hard to say for sure that odors are getting filtered out, but I haven't smelled skunks, manure, or the old car up the road since I installed it. Sometimes there is a very mild, neutral odor. I suspect this is the carbon and baking soda filtering out a more putrid odor. This filter has few folds than the genuine Honda filter it replaced, but is thicker, too. I was concerned at first, but it doesn't seem to impact airflow. This is a good buy. Highly recommend.",

The filter is 1/8th inch narrower than OEM so it doesn't fit snug and can rattle and allow some air to go around or make noise while driving. It has almost 40% less total filter area with only 27 pleats compared to OEM which has 44. Less total filter area means filter won't last as long and clog sooner. To be fair, this filter is thicker with carbon particles so can't fit as many pleats as OEM. Overall not a good value with less total filter area if you don't need the carbon.",

      "text": "Fit is perfect on 2015 Honda CR-V. Be advised that this filter - like most other aftermarket cabin air filters - contains far less filtration material than OEM. I pulled the OEM factory filter on the car after 15k miles and replaced it with this FRAM equivalent. The factory filter had a total of 44 pleats across the \"upstream\" face. The FRAM had a total of only 28 pleats. Whether the added filtration capacity is worth double the price is up to you, but I won't be purchasing another one of these - going back to Honda OEM.",

I haven't used it yet to check airflow difference (or likely placebo effect) but at least installation was a breeze and the physical item seems to be as good if not better quality than the original.",
