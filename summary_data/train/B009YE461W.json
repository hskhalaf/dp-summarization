The clip that is supposed to keep the iPad in place against the part of the cover that folds down for keyboard use broke apart when opening it the other day. Also, the entire thing is really just awkward when trying to use it. It does not fold well at all when using it tablet mode - it leaves the keyboard partial exposed and is hard to hold. In hind sight I would pay more and just get a better keyboard/cover combo.",

This item has been sitting on the shelf since it was purchased, and will most likely stay until I pass my ipad mini down to my children. Excellent product for children that use an ipad mini to type and search the Internet for school. In my mind, not worthy of being marked as a business tool - Perfect for intermediate/grammar school application.",

None the less the clip that holds the IPad broke and the plastic clip that is covered with a rubber part has detached for the rubber part and the iPad falls flat when you are using the keyboard. The cover used to be black and after only a month of use it has lost its color and is now gray. Finally you should have a screen cover because when the screen and the keyboard touch when the case is closed the iPad screen gets scratched as well as the keyboard.",

Also, I have pretty large hands and can type on the keyboard pretty well...better than any of keyboards out there of similar size that I tried. The feel and responsiveness of the keys is excellent. The case itself has a sleek, clean look and feel, unlike many of the leather ones out there. As stated in previous reviews, the placement of the apostrophe is kind of baffling, but it doesn't seem to bother me personally.",

I needed a keyboard case to take notes and type quickly when in meetings. This Belkin keyboard/case combo is the nicest available. The case is very sleek and keyboard is well designed. Comparing this to the keyboard/case offerings I have used with my full size iPad, this is the best keyboard/case available today.",

The case does not well support the keyboard on an angle and I needed to adjust and re-adjust many times during a simple email. The mini does not shut off when the case is closed. Over all use was frustrating and had me irritated with the mini. I purchased the Snugg iPad mini cover at the same time to make a comparison. I am glad that I did. The Snugg is a much better product.",
