As advertised, stains on clothing washed out easily, and marks on the wood table wiped away with ease. We noticed right away that the caps fit very tightly, and my strong 3-year old needed assistance fully securing each cap after use. We loved the vibrant color selection of the markers that did work. Despite not all the markers coloring like new, I would buy these again and hope for better luck the second time around. The washability is just hard to beat!",

My kids are experts at \"The Magic Click\" to make sure the caps are on tightly, so I don't attribute uncapped markers to the problem.
