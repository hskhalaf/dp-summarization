Well guess you really need to only use for hot dogs cause anything else it will heat up to much! Worst customer service more shocking than anything! Frustrated consumer!

All of the hardware is low grade and ill fitting. During shipping some of the installed hardware had fallen off. I would gladly pay a little more for a grill like this with better craftsmanship.",

Just make sure you know this before you too order. We are not displeased at all but it would be nice if they adapted this, so it was removable. That would make it extra handy. Love it either way. Does take two sets of hands to install onto gas/charcoal grill. Be prepared for that. Love it!!",

It doesn't have to be added to the grill as it can be used as a standalone smoker. He is excited to try it out. So far very happy with our purchase.",

It took some time to develop the right technique for keeping the smoke fire going while cooking on the gas grill, but after a bit it was easy. The only design flaw is in the bottom of the unit. Since the grill is cast iron, it is important to keep it ash free and dry or it will rust. The ash drawer on the right hand side opens up to the sky, so water will tend to accumulate in the bottom of the unit when it rains. A simple drain hole will fix this problem.",
