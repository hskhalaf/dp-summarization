      "text": "Awesome laptop. Needed a second one for my business. One in the field, one for home but needed portability in case of field failures. Fast, beautiful screen and sound system is superior to my HP laptop which I still use. Touch screen is OK but because it doesn't swivel around, the usefulness is limited. The monitor only bends back so far, so I use a Bluetooth keyboard and elevated platform at home for more ergonomic use. Price is HALF of retail when I bought it and it runs lightning quick on tougher applications like VISIO. No real complaints, and won't be replacing this for some time. Very pleased overall and would recommend.",

It has a chronic problem with the browsers crashing and reimaging the laptop doesn't help. Aside from this, every Java IDE that I have used on it has had problems. Each one crashes or never loads up for me while they work fine on another device. I think I might have received a faulty laptop but I regret buying it.",

If you use it without charging frequently, however, the battery may be problematic. Although there is a way to extend the battery life to 5 to 6 hours, you should lose the process speed which is one of the most attractive features (2.5Mhz) all the way down to 1.0. This is still great (comparing to others), and you will hardly ever perceive the difference if you use basic functions (web browsing, documenting, etc.), rather than games.",
