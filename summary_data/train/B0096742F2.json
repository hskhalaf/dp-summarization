I do not pulse just have it on and shake. The only slight drawback is the top can get a little hard to close after a while because of very fine coffee grinds in the top cap track. I simply use a brush to clean it and it's great for weeks. I would buy this again.",

There isn't a removable grinding cup, but the smooth metal inside makes it easy to wipe clean. ( I wash it with water, making sure not to immerse, nor let water get into the motor). The lid is easy to clean too. So very happy with this powerful, easy clean grinder.",

You can't remove the little cup part where things are grinder so you just have to wipe it with a wet rag. I'm not OCD...but it bothers me a little. The fact that I only use it for flax seeds is the saving grace (regarding cleanliness).",

It worked awesome, even though my cuisinart mini prep was not able to accomplish this task. It is a great deal for your money and I would highly recommend this product. The canister is smaller than 1 cup, so you can use it for a bulk amount, but it works great for what I need it for!",

Following directions not to grind for more than 30 seconds yields the perfect amount of fresh coffee beans. I wish it had a built-in cord storage-- but it doesn't. Still, knowing about Amazin's no hassle return policy---I wouldn't return. This is a cool little unit that serves its purpose. 'Nuff said.",
