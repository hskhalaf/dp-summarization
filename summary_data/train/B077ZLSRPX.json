None of them are even close. They all miss the punch plate by 50-90%. The tool is heavily made and appears to be quite substantial. It says on the package \"Made In China\". I am asking this company to send me another tool but only after they inspect it to ensure that all the hole punches strike the punch plate completely. I hope to update this review after I see how this company's customer service works.",
