This wasn't my first \"hurricane rodeo\" and when everything is shut down, there ARE no \"I'll just go grab some batteries\" option. The flashlight is simple to operate, works with a few spins of the wrist. This is NOT going to compete with those \"survival, spots jets at 20K feet\" type flashlights, but it's sure sufficient for finding your way down a dark hallway or getting into a closet to root around for something in complete darkness (and we DID get to test out those features LOL). Bought two - may buy more in teh future!",

We leave it in a window sill so it just collects light all the time. It loses a star for brightness. Even fully charged it just isn't very bright. I will say it is a nice sized beam compared to other kinetic flashlights but as all of them suffer from the issue of lumens. Great for emergency flashlight though that you know you will never have to change the batteries in to use.",

It holds a charge MUCH longer than the oder crank models. I take being prepared for outages and emergencies very seriously and these are a great value and a great investment.

It does make a buzzing noise when you crank it, but the 60 secs of disturbance that the cranking makes in the nighttime woods is nothing compared to the disturbance in the environment from , discarded corroded batteries, cheapo plastic flashlight casings, etc. etc.",
