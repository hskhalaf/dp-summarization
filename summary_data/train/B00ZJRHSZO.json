So, I repurchased this model, and either I had a lemon the first time around, or they've made improvements! So far, this one is working fantastically and is still my favorite model of remote to use with my PS4 when watching DVDs, Blu Rays, or Streaming!",

The volume punch-through and universal remote features resolve all of my issues with the PS3 media remote. Unfortunately, many other apps such as Hulu Plus are not fully supported (play/pause doesn't work, and there's no way that I've found to go back to the main menu from a video without restarting the app), and the battery life is incredibly poor. In the 3 months I've owned this, I've changed the batteries about 3 to 4 times. If more apps support the remote, I'd upgrade to a 4 star rating, but the battery life is a major issue.",
