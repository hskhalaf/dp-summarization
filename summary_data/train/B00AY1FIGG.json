      "text": "Very different from a normal laptop, works great, but not having some type of protection for the screen is a slight draw back. I used a 3.0 usb external hard drive to install most of my heavy ended programs and it works great. This allows me to not fill up the 128 gig digital memory. I also use an Anker 3.o USB docking station. The entire system runs fast and smooth with two extra monitors (one being a flat screen TV). Had no problems. When going portable (unhooked from docking station) it is like having a very large tablet. This is nice for watching movies, or browsing internet while watching TV. The back-lit keyboard is really nice. I recommend it.",

I don't like the way that the computer screen rotates landscape-portrait in the same way your cell phone does; when it goes from landscape to portrait, I have to fold the screen down to have it reset back to landscape. Simply holding the computer in a landscape orientation doesn't flip the screen back.",

This is a real computer that runs excel, word, powerpoint and every other windows program just like a desktop. The solid state HDD is not big but you can slip in a 128GB SD card to hold files. This is my second one of these, the first one is still in service after a year of hard use. My guess is that they don't make the model anymore which is too bad - really great travel computer.",

Called Toshiba & they initially told me almost $400 to replace! We finally got it resolved via hard reset. Now still under a year the unit touch screen just went out and wont switch landscape ect And finally wont turn on Very very displeased we saved to get this $800 laptop for college and its been a nightmare I also spent $40 on a very nice hard case padded carrier to protect the uniti -- so Its in pristine condition just a BAD piece of equipment",

Windows 8 took a little getting used to, but after a couple of weeks, it's easily navigable. Starts up very quickly! Excellent compatibility with MS Office 2010. Love the keyboard. Every program I have installed has worked well. Added an ethernet adapter, and an external cd/dvd player. There are only two USB ports, but I'm ordering a hub today! Light-weight; easily carried in my work bag. Excellent display. Would highly recommend this to someone seeking a pad/laptop combination!!",
