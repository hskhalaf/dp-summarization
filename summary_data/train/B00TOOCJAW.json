I have now added a custom dual rod holder set up and a trolling motor set up and this thing is awesome. For the price I don\u2019t think you will find something better. Seems super durable and it would be almost impossible to tip this thing. Definitely recommend this product to anyone that was looking for a personal pontoon boat!",
