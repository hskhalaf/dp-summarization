Tap water measures 480 ppm, and the RO water measures 22 ppm (my RO system adds mineral back). See attached pictures. 3) There are no leaks or drips whatsoever - everything seems well built. 4) This has fairly high pressure coming out. Not as fast as the tap, but much faster than most RO systems I have used at friend's houses. 5) Water tastes amazing.",

I can't tell the difference in the water flavor from my bottle service water. My neighbors RO water is bland so I am very pleased with my system. I do recommend this system!",

It reminds me of expensive water from the health food store that would cost $2 per bottle, and I have an unlimited free supply now :) I cannot recommend this product highly enough.",

I called the phone number in the manual and could not have had a better experience. Excellent all the way around.",

I've never liked the \"sharp\" taste of pure RO water. They've got the right idea by blending the calcium back into the effluent. You'll like the taste better, I assure you. Next time you go to the grocery store, notice the different methods bottlers use when bottling their water. Some are pure RO water, others are purified mineral water (or water with minerals added). Either way, pure RO will not be near as palatable as blended water IMHO.",

I can't believe I did not purchase this filter sooner. The pH of water as tested by my Hanna pH meter is 8.5, which indicates that 're-mineralization' works very well. I get a great tasting, non-acidic (as pure RO water is) water. Highly recommend.",

      "text": "We were tired of paying for bottled water, but wanted an excellent tasting water. This is it! The installation was easy. Dealing with customer service was fantastic when we had an issue we didn't understand. We purchased a water quality meter to test it and the difference was amazing. The ppm went from 274 down to 19. Everyone is drinking more water and the cost savings from paying for delivery water will pay for this many, many, many times over. We did a lot of research prior to making this purchase and I think we made the best decision.",

I can't speak to installation because I had it done professionally during a kitchen remodel....but I can say with confidence that the water it produces and the company are wonderful. The water has a really wonderful taste. I should include that I added a fourth cartridge to mine from another source that puts minerals back into the water after it's purified. The company has been very helpful and nice to work with too. I had a problem with one replacement cartridge leaking and when I called they immediately sent me a new one, no hassle, no returning the defective one to them. I strongly recommend this system.",

    "title": "Home Master TMAFC Artesian Full Contact Undersink Reverse Osmosis Water Filter System,White",
    "description": "Home Master Artesian Full Contact Reverse Osmosis System solves many of the problems associated with traditional RO systems. Home Master RO systems use larger fittings and tubing than Traditional RO systems to double the flow rate. Traditional RO systems produce demineralized water that is highly pure but slightly acidic. This acidic water attacks the rubber bladder in the storage tank, entering the water stream and affecting the taste. The patented Home Master Artesian Full Contact remineralizes the water twice. Our patented remineralization system pH balances the water once on the way to the storage tank, and once again on the way to the faucet adding a small amount of calcium and magnesium minerals (30-60 mg/l), just enough to make the water slightly alkaline and improve the taste. The Home Master Artesian Full Contact delivers Mineral Water on Tap by first stripping the water clean, removing up to 98-percent of chlorine, chemicals, heavy metals, dissolved solids, pharmaceuticals and other contaminants using reverse osmosis, sediment and carbon filtration, then channels the water through the patented remineralization system twice to add calcium and magnesium minerals from a fresh new source. With 7 stages of filtration, purification and enhancement The Home Master Artesian Full Contact produces exceptionally pure, Mineral Water on Tap. In designing the Home Master RO a sophisticated combination of flow restriction components were integrated into the system architecture to regulate pressure in the 50 gpd membrane chamber for optimized purification and minimized wastewater production. The most sophisticated components certified to NSF standards are included in the design and construction of our product. In the Box: Fully assembled purification unit, storage tank, 1 year of filters, 3/8-Inch feed water adapter with shut off, chrome faucet, faucet adapter, tfc RO membrane, drain saddle and instructions. 5 year limited warranty.",
