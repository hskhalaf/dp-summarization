      "text": "I like and have worn Asics running shoes for casual and walking purposes for over 20 years. Fit is never a problem, and that is also the case with these shoes. The one oddity (or proviso) with these shoes is that they offer no arch support whatsoever. My arches are rather high, and one of the things that I've always enjoyed about Asics running shoes is that I always feel well supported. I do intend to keep these shoes, as they are otherwise comfortable, and look really great. But, if you, like me, have higher arches, make sure to get yourself some insoles that will do the job that the stock insoles that come with the shoe do not.",

At the time I was deciding between two shoes, and I wish I had gone with the other pair, but again these are not terrible.",
