Pairs super easy with the iPhone, and I would recommend playing with the internal EQ of the phone if you're tying them together. However, once tweaked, the sound is big and cosy. I have Jaybirds for running, which are fabulous, but these do feel more all-encompassing. I wouldn't say I'm an audiophile, but I can't stand wearing tinny headphones with poor range in them. If it handles my three genres fine, then I'm more than happy. Recommended!",

The leather starts peeling away from the plastic and the foam underneath is exposed. I have highlighted this with Apple under their one-year warranty and they have agreed to fix them at no charge. If you search on the Internet this appears to be a common design fault with these headphones. I am very worried whether these will last one year, let alone 15 years.",

I bought these to replace an earlier model (which I also loved) which broke, but sadly these ones have also stopped working after get knocked about slightly.",

When you're paying this amount for what I'm certain used to be a respected brand, you expect a certain level of quality, which sadly these are lacking.

They can get a bit painful after that, but I can only wear buds for 5 minutes without pain. For what I need the sound quality is good, they sync perfectly to my iPhone and make calls when out and about simple.",
