I have many nail guns and they can all be finicky, but this was nearly impossible to control. I wound up using a Harbor Freight gun to do the job. It worked fine.",

Dropped it a couple times from 5'+, no issues. 100% satisfied with the product",

At too low, and too high of pressures it does have tendency to double shoot. Getting the pressure right at 90 psi seemed to take care of that problem. It feels solid in your hands, and performs well. My only complaint on the construction is the nail coil holder is lightweight plastic. A good drop, and that holder is likely toast.",

I did have a few double-strikes and a jamb, but I have to be honest and call it operator error. Jamb was very easy to clear. It's a quality tool and well worth the price for the time and effort savings over hand-nailing.",

    "description": "Size:Black CaseRemember when you could re-roof your roof? Nail shingles, insulation boards, waterproof tar paper, fiber cement roofing, siding, vinyl and more with the WEN Pneumatic Coil Roofing Nailer. The versatile magazine holds up to 120 nails at a time, allowing for sizes of 11-gauge (.12 inches) nails ranging from 3/4 of an inch all the way up to 1-3/4 of an inch. Adjust the depth of the fired nails by turning the depth-setting wheel found on the head of the nailer. Clear jammed nails with the quick-release compartment on the side of the magazine. The adjustable shingle guide easily slides up and down the bottom of the magazine to help with quick and easy spacing for shingles of any size. This powerful nailer provides up to 430-inch-pounds of force at a 100 PSI operating pressure, making sure your siding stays in place. The rubber grip handle helps limit fatigue and maximize comfort during long jobs while the turnable exhaust valve on top of the nailer lets users aim the direction of the output air. With a 1/4-inch NPT air inlet, drive fasteners using pneumatic pressure anywhere from 70 to 120 PSI. This package also includes a bottle of oil, three assorted hex wrenches and a convenient blow-mold carrying case for easily transporting your nailer. And, because its a WEN product, your coil roofing nailer comes backed by a one-year warranty and a friendly customer phone line all to make sure you remember WEN.",
