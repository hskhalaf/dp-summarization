I now realize that Amazon's health foods are very expensive. I would suggest that before any customer buy anything at Amazon, please do some comparison shopping-- you will be surprised. I wish I had done that before I bought the PRO BAR Meal from them. I blame myself for not being an educated consumer when it comes to Amazon. Amazon, you have opened my eyes. Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

These bars came in a box covered in Christmas wrapping paper, which is concerning considering its October. I checked the expiration date which is fine, but they are still stale. The bars feel like they've around the world and back. They are hard and greasy, almost inedible. Don't get ripped off. I threw them all away because the seller does not except returns. $40 down the drain. Criminal.",

They recently revised their packaging and it now comes with 6 food bars in a solid cardboard box. Before the bars came packaged in a paper box. The concern is the size of the box is immensely wasteful. The box that came with 6 food bars is able to hold 16!!! It's a nice way to consolidate, but in this day there's no reason to have excess packaging.....especially when ordering from Amazon. They need to seriously rethink their bulk packaging. I want to pay for the food bars, not excess packaging.",

The peanut butter Probars taste almost identical to the berry pro bars. I would like these better if they were a little less sweet, but they pack down small and if they get smashed in your bag they're still easy to eat. If you're going camping maybe only bring a couple of these along, you won't want to eat them every day.",

These bars have chunks of fruit, nuts, and grains so you can tell they are actually real food and not processed bars. Flavor of the fruit bars are great. I would have rated these a 5 star but I have only tried a couple different flavors so far. Buy the variety pack so you can decide the best for you. 12 bars for less than $2 a piece. You wont be disappointed. I am reordering when this sample pack is done. Clean product, well balanced nutrition, good price, great flavor.",
