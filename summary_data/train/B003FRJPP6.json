These socks solve the problem. While he does not wear these on game days, they are great for every day practice. They're more comfortable for him to put on, easy to put on, and easy to wash. You just slip out the shin guard and wash the socks as normal! Once dry, slip the guards back in. They are true to size and really solved a problem that we had. Good purchase.",

If you struggle to get the shin guard in...try putting it in the sock before putting the sock on the child. The socks wash in the washer with no shrinking. Each time i remove the shin guards i spray thwm quick with lysol and let the dry. No foot odor....no bending cracking or breaking. These will last me a couple more years before all my kids grow out of them.",

He wears shoe size 12/13 and they fit him well with some room for growth. They are not easy to put on but no tall socks are easy to put on a kid. The pads remove for washing and are relatively easy to put back in. After one washing they are a little pilled so I doubt they'll last forever but they should work perfectly for his soccer league.",
