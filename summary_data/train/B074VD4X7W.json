      "text": "Aging is a weird collection of body changes\u2014so one day you notice you have almost no eyebrows but lots of funny little hairs on your chin. Fortunately, someone\u2019s figured out some solutions and this is one of them. This is the easiest and most effective way to add some life to fading eyebrows I\u2019ve tried (and I\u2019ve experimented with a lot of them). Once I\u2019ve filled in sparse areas, using the little brush on the end can smooth and blend the color in to get a pretty natural-looking result, one that will last all day. This is my second purchase\u2014the highest recommendation I can give.",

When I was done using this pencil, I felt that my brows looked drawn on. Too bad they don't make this color and formulation in a thin pencil.",

As you use the pencil and it becomes rounded you can create this unique shape again by twisting a tad bit of pencil through and cut it straight across with a razor blade or sharp knife.

However, if you, like me, just need to fill in your existing blonde, not-very-thick brows, this this is just right. This brow pencil has a nice ash-blonde color. Others I\u2019ve tried are always too reddish. I also like the brush on the end. It blends the color in while also smoothing/directing my natural brows. I will buy this product again.",

It your looking for a product that will actually last and has quit a bit of product. This is not it you pay for the plastic if the pen! Don't get me wrong it fills and blends nicely.

It\u2019s not 100% smudge proof (which is why i expected the eyebrow gel) however it is rather long lasting than i expected. I do love that the color matched my skin tone. Price is reasonable but will not be buying again all because i am used to having a dual product that comes with the eyebrow gel.",

The angled tip also helps with application. It does wipe off easily, but I\u2019m generally not rubbing my face or brows so that hasn\u2019t been a problem.
