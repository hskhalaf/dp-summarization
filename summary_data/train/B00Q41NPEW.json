It\u2019s a thick, cottony type of spandex, rather than the shiny, satiny kind. I first found this brand at TJ MAXX and I\u2019ve been hooked ever since. I love that I can get them on Amazon!

So if you are between sizes I personally would recommend that you go up a size. I have worked out in both pairs and they worked perfectly. I've gotten hella compliments on the pink (\"watermelon\") pair, and a lot of people ask me where I got them. They're super bright tho.",

Nice fabric, medium thickness, not overly shiny, and lots of compression. They do have a small pocket inside the waistband, but I really would have loved an outer-thigh pocket for my phone/keys.

These are good leggings, but the reason I bought them originally was because they used a more restrictive fabric. Since they no longer use that, they are, well, just another pair of leggings.",

      "text": "First, I would like to say these are my favorite leggings. They fit well, are comfortable, breathable, and they do not fall or roll down when running, squatting, or anything else. The only advice is to watch the color. I had a dark purple pair and got the two pack with black and what I thought would be a kind of \"pepto bismal pink\" to get a better deal per legging. The pink is a lot lighter / less vibrant than the image. When I wear them it makes it look like I am not wearing anything on the bottom. They are still great leggings, so that color has just become my indoor workout set.",

I was hopeful that the sizing would be comparable to the SPANX XS sizing, but this is not so. If you are XS/XXS & are expecting a super form-fitting situation, these will not deliver. I would call these more of a US size 2 as opposed to a 0/00. I wish they made a smaller size! That said, if you are a 2 or greater in size, I would recommend these leggings without hesitation because they are very soft, thick and cute too!",
