I deflated the tire to attempt to seat the bead on the rim again before the whole tire popped off and the inner tube exploded like a balloon. I had only inflated the tire to 30PSI before it blew up... I have requested a refund and will purchase a better quality tire, I would not want to be stranded miles away from home with these tires. Again, please be careful when installing this tire and inspect the bead before mounting.",

I have a 3-wheeled cargo trike with two 20' tires in the front as a daily rider and I go through about three pairs of 30$ schwalbes a year. I ordered these in the heat of a flat tire emergency and I'm so glad I did. The white ones shipped 1 day and were easy to install. As BMX tires they are WAY stickier/grippier/gummy than what I had on before. I think this adds some drag but they do well in rain and have taken lot of pothole beating in the last month with no signs of wear or puncture.",
