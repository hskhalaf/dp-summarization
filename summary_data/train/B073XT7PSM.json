It's simply not an efficient way to acquire ~500 cards, I was assured. Well, I can tell you that the feeling of opening 36 packs is the reason I like magic. It was incredible, and I recommend the experience to anybody who feels that an hour or two rush of excitement (It takes a while to open them all) is well worth $80. It may not be the most cost effective way to acquire ~30 rares and ~5 mythics, but nothing about MTG is cost effective, so just do it.",

I got $68 of value in rares back from the $80 box which was more than the box from my card shop got me. But there were lands in there from Ixalan (see the the photos from above- actually got 2 of Zacama). So you be the judge of what you want to do I guess.",
