All you have to do is plug in the little usb and the charger will charge the controller that you set on it. My boyfriend loves it and we no longer have to play with the controller plugged in because we forgot to charge. We keep ours plugged into the ps4 and it works great! Highly recommended for any ps4 gamer, especially for the low price!",

We have 4 controllers and we\u2019ve gone through 4 different sets of charging stations from other brands/sellers. I was always yelling at my kids to be careful when they charge but that is a thing of the past. This charging station has brought peace and harmony back into our household as I no longer worry about my a$$hole kids breaking the micro usb when charging. The dongle usb plug is a game changer.

I\u2019ve also used another variation of this charger, but the connectors were too large and were falling out (so I had to tape them in). So when I bought this charging dock, I found it to be exactly what I needed. The charging connectors are very small and stay in the controller ports securely. I can also tell more easily when controllers are charging vs when they aren\u2019t. And the price is great for this. So I\u2019m completely happy with this purchase.",
