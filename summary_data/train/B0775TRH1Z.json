My only complaint is that it smells I followed all the directions and let it air once opened and it was fine after a few days but a month in it had a rotten egg smell. The company said that is normal it will go away. Its September 8th and I can faintly smell it. My sibling bought the same mattress around this time and does the exact same thing. For a great mattress this is Its downfall. Can someone please recommend something to help with the smell at this point I'm ready to toss it.",

I was SUPER skeptical about buying this bed online. With that being said I trusted the reviews and went for it. The box says to let it sit for 48 hours but we couldn\u2019t wait. We slept on it after opening for 3 hours and it was great. We have had it for about 2 weeks and have never had better nights sleep! Perfect mix for comfort and support. Highly recommend!",
