The midsole unit\u2019s reactive yet robust construction and the upper\u2019s breathable and form-fitting design are the highlighted elements.

My feet tend to touch when I walk, so I get wear on the cushioning near the toes. On these shoes, the cushioning is a soft material, so it\u2019s been scraped away by the hard sole, but it\u2019s not as bad as some shoes I\u2019ve had.",
