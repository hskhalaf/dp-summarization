Over time, it may not look that great (our holding bracket is too tight and lightly scratches the unit every time we put it up). Also, the hose is longer than it needs to be (for us) so it coils on the floor next to the toilet--not great looking, but only a minor issue. Five plus stars.",

Granted, it is a little cold in the winter, but like most people, I don't have a hot water line to my commode.
