I've even tried wearing my Sorel boots around the clock while in the house. Nothing worked. Until the Merino wool socks. I still occasionally have to use a heating pad to get my feet warm after being in the cold for extended period, but for normal days, these socks have eliminated my cold foot problems.

The secret to their warmth-enhancing qualities has to do with very tightly knitted pile--this lofty weave holds more air near the skin, which in turn insulates your feet very effectively when they need it most. And the fact that these socks are essentially made from soft wool is a definite improvement over the many synthetics available from other manufacturers. Canadians know how to protect themselves from the cold. Buying these excellent J.B. Field Icelandic socks is the logical purchase equivalent to acquiring an English umbrella!",
