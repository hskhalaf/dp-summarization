I found that you have to perfectly situate the cherry to get the most success from the device. And even then, it only gets about 4 of the 6. So then you\u2019re left having to move around a cherry that\u2019s been punctured and messy to try and find the pit. A single-pitter seems like it would take longer but it really doesn\u2019t.",

Luckily, I live in Washington State so cherries are readily available and reasonable. This year I froze at least 20 lbs of cherries. We'll be having pies, crisps, scones, and anything else I can think of during the cold winter. Hope I have enough to last till next season. I took away one star because the locking device that keeps this closed when not in use broke. I now use a heavy duty rubber band to keep it closed. The metal pitters are VERY sharp!",

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars across the board is that it seems a little flimsy and will probably break with a lot of use. Still, for the money it is well worth it for me.",

I typically do the six cherries at a time, then empty the tray after EACH load of 6 cherries so I don't miss any pits. I hope this makes sense.

When it works perfectly, all 6 cherry pits are removed from the cherries and end up in the catch basin below the cherries, but for larger cherries, the pit is broken free from the cherry, but remains inside the cherry. So be careful to make sure each cherry pit is completely removed. Also, the catch basin at the bottom is a little smaller than I would like. It's not horrible, but my mom has the 4-cherry pitter and hers has a larger basin and seems to handle the larger cherries better.",

I check the tray after pitting and count how many pits are there. Empty the tray and do it again. It's best if you put the cherry in stem side up. Now I can buy cherries on sale and not just eat them. I have a bunch in the freezer for later use.",
