Don't overload it, carefully brush out each strand and section off using clips and you shouldn't have any problems. If you have strays hairs that are causing the section to spread out, you're going to have problems. Less is more!",

Takes getting used to using small sections of hair and learning to use the tool properly without tangling, its different than regular curling irons or rollers in the perpendicular angle to the scalp. Otherwise, the curls take under a minute for healthy hair. Overall, it does take longer than a traditional iron but the results are worth it. Healthy lasting bouncy curls which no curling iron has ever produced.",
