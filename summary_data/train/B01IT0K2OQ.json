Anyways, we both LOOOOOVE it! You can set it on one color or do multiple where it continues to change. It has a sensor and turns on when it's dark. It lights up the toilet bowl but also the whole bathroom & really is the perfect nightlight. If it broke, I would seriously buy another one that day. Plus, my fiance\u0301e enjoys peeing on the ever-changing colors because he is a man-child.",

I had to inquire online both here and another forum in order to make that happen. Is it that hard to have a power button and a hold button?",

It isn't complicated, you put in batteries, hang it on the toilet and press the button to select your desired color and dim the light.",

He opened the present in front of our two young adult sons and they all LOVED it. The boys, who live on their own in the same house want one of their own! The really cool points of this gadget are that the color of the light can rotate, and if a light in the bathroom is turned on, it turns off. So it's not only motion activated, but also light activated. This was a huge hit as a gift!!",
