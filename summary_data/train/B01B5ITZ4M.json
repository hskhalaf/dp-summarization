Husband hates it but he was happy to see me sleep comfortably. I weighed this pillow against other options like Snoogle n Boppy wedge. But I wanted support no matter which side I slept on. I couldn\u2019t imagine waking up to adjust the boppy wedge every time I had to turn to the other side. It seemed pointless. Same for the snoogle or any other C- shaped body pillow. With a U-shaped pillow I don\u2019t even notice when I shift sides at night.",

It's not a rigid pillow at all in any areas so it kind of flops all over and only offers frontal support. You can sort of wedge it into your back and scoot backward into it to get more support, but it doesn't last. The moment you move in your sleep the pillow splays out behind you and your support is gone. The pillows are also VERY narrow, so even in terms of front support it's minimal. It -barely- supports your leg when you try to drape a leg over it. Better off getting another brand.",

The model in the pictures must have a very small head and be very petite. The filling feels like bad poly stuffing from a craft store. It\u2019s lumpy and missing filling in spots. When you\u2019re pregnant you need support between your knees which is what I was expecting from this pillow instead it squishes flat and gives no support. I will be returning. Really surprised that the reviews are as high as they are.",
