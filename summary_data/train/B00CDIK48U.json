I recently dropped my previous one--boo hoo--but for now decided to replace it with another (used) one of the same model Love it--small enough to fit in pocket, clear images, wonderful 30x zoom, good image stabilization, does well in low light. It generally does very well on \"intelligent auto\" but has many other features once you take the time to learn them. May upgrade one of these days, but for now am happy with this one. Only downside--no view finder, so it is hard to see the screen on bright days.",

In fact, we won 2! The only con is the flash. You have to manually pop it up to use it and it's pretty weak. It only pops up 5 mm, why is this even necessary? Wish they would correct this small con",

I informally compared shots between the RX100 and HX50 and didn't see a great deal of difference, except in low light situations where the RX100 was clearly better. On the high zoom, it's a bit tricky to find the subject and get the camera to focus correctly. It's helpful to back off a bit on the zoom, get the image in sight and focused and then zoom in again.",

The camera itself is pretty good, for being relatively small it has great zoom and takes good quality pictures. It doesn't do very well with night/darker light conditions and is generally a little slower than I'd like in-between shots. I initially thought the wifi was an unnecessary and stupid option, but considering you can connect to your camera with your phone and zoom/take pictures from it, that could be handy. From my research, you can't do much better for the class, even though this is a 2013 model.",

      "text": "It is a tad bigger (mostly thicker) but worth the extra bulk. The HX50 is very similar to the HX20 with the caveat of longer lens (30X optical vs. 20X), improved stabilization (in my mind), and noticeably better video (more stabile mainly). The awesome after-effects (illustration mode is so cool) are all there, the handheld twilight works well, and the panoramas are still intact. Some 3D still there. Its all good and a fun package to carry around. I don't use the GPS, nor the wifi local server function since the battery life is still the cybershot's weak spot. That being said, if you haven't had a recent Cybershot HX camera, the HX20V is still a classic!",
