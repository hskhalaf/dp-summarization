So far, early indications on the heel point to the fact that they're a cheap shoe, and as such they aren't made to last. No complaints really, just not that impressed with them. They are light and very flexible. The grip is better then other Pumas, mostly because the sole is softer plastic then others. They stay clean better then the full suede Puma's I've had. I guess my biggest gripe is that I've over time liked less and less the way they look.",
