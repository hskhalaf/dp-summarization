A small rug made a world of difference and suddenly it stayed in place and he was able to focus on his school work. It was easy to assemble. Time will tell if once the novelty wears off if it will continue to help, but so far it has been worth the money and an asset to the classroom.",

We brought in 4 and the kids went wild they love them so much. The teachers say they help keep the wiggly kids focused and in their seats, and that engaging your body while learning helps the learning process. We ordered a green one for home too - unfortunately I didn't realize they came in so many colors until after I bought the 4 school ones or I would have branched out beyond blue!",

Kids learn better and are more productive. The kid who may be considered \"un-teachable\" is now able to learn!\"\n\nFeatures:\n\n * FUN - homework, drawing, eating and playing video/board games are no longer sedentary activities\n * SAFE - can't tip over\n * Colorful choices make it a good fit for any room\n * Ideal for children with ADD or ADHD; provides an outlet for restlessness and extra energy\n * 275 lb. weight limit\n\nAwards:\n\n\n\n * Academics' Choice Award 2013\n * Family Choice Award 2014\n * GEI Special product search and review award 2015\n\nYoungsters have never liked to sit still, but until now there hasn't been a place for them to sit that allows them to be their energetic selves. The ingenious Kore Wobble Stool design gently rolls with your child's natural movements, so he or she stays supported and comfortable while they wiggle around on their stool. Ordinary chairs and stools force growing bodies into unnatural, static positions that are uncomfortable and don't help your child's posture. Kids can sit, wiggle, and fidget on this nifty chair while intuitively exercising their back muscles and working out their restless energy in comfort and support.",
