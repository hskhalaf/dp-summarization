I literally unfolded them and they broke. $25 is overpriced for 2 opportunities to wear a pair of sunglasses.",

I was surprised by this, since all other glasses and sunglasses that I have ever bought have hinges (I think with springs?) that enable the arms to bend outward past perpendicular to the frame. This is important for taking them off and putting them on. You have to precisely put them on and take them off from dead-center on your face, so as not to force the arms into an obtuse angle, as they'll snap right off. This is the only weak point in the construction, but the product would be much better if the hinges were improved",

It blocks not only bright light but reduces vision considerably. I would easily pay $50+ more for these exact glasses with a high quality lens. It's a shame that they are price pointed so low that this would be an impossibility at their price. I would take my list of clients get quality lenses and resell every one on this only negative about the frame etc.",
