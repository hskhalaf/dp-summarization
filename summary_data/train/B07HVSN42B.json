I understand it is supposed to warm up to the cat's body temperature but I tried it placing my hands across it for a length of time and it never achieved any kind of heat, even when temp set to maximum. I even tried bringing it in and laying my own leg across it for over half an hour but nothing happened. I'm going to have to find an alternative product, this was a disappointment and waste of money.",
