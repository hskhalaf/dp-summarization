No leather anywhere on this shoe at all. I bought a pair of these about 10 years ago and they lasted a long time and actually had some leather in them. No more leather now. Not as good a shoe anymore. Just cheap fake PU. Not worth the price they are asking for this cheap fabric shoe. To bad everything is getting SO cheap and tacky.",

Highly recommend.",

Perhaps a wider shoe would solve that but I have never had that problem with any shoe I've purchased. The biggest problem is that the \"leather\" tore on the side of the shoe from the shoe string near the toe to the sole. Both pair I purchased experienced the same tear in the same spot. Poor design and poor quality of material. I hope Fila improves these flaws because they make a good looking shoe!",

    "description": "This lightweight, retro-inspired sneaker from Fila is perfect for every day and then some. Made with a durable nubuck upper with a smooth, soft finish, this shoe features a removable cushioned insole and an extra-thick rubber sole for excellent shock absorption. A padded tongue and collar and soft lining keep feet feeling fresh and comfortable throughout the day.\n\nFila began in 1911 in the small alpine town of Biella, Italy, a place renowned for manufacturing the world's finest textiles and weaving fabrics with impeccable quality, true innovation, and extraordinary beauty. Born of the city and its traditions, Fila is inspired by Biella's dedication to artistry, luxury, and elegance. It's Fila's birthright, it's in their soul, and it defines their future. They continue to enrich the athletic experience by improving comfort and performance with Italian design, quality craftsmanship, and refined materials. There is no feeling quite as luxurious as that of playing in Fila, and that is the reason for Fila's existence. We create what is desired, not just what is necessary.",

      "Leather-Synthetic Blend - The blending of both real and synthetic leather with this Fila shoe has created a lighter shoe that's a lot more durable, yet still retains that full-grain leather look.",
      "Molded Rubber Outsole - As an athletic sneaker, Fila ups and ante and strength and durability, particularly with this strong, flexible, durable rubber outsole.",
      "Embroidered Logo - While a minor detail to some, having the logo embroidered onto the shoe means that it's there permanently, so it's not going to leave a spot on the shoe where it falls off.",
      "Removable Cushioned Insole - Not only does this insole provide plenty of comfort for men who like to remain active, but it's also removable and washable, so you can keep your shoes fresh.",
      "Lightweight EVA Midsole - The midsole of a shoe provides stability and a barrier between the upper and outsole, and this light EVA molded midsole gives you strength and stability without added weight."
