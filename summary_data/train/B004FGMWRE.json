The neck comes up high enough to provide some protection, the torso is long enough that it doesn't expose my son's back when he bends over, and the arms are long enough to stay down and also allow unrestricted movement no matter what he's doing. The logo seems durable enough. We have not washed very many times, but it isn't peeling or cracking even after going through the dryer. I ordered the navy blue and am very happy with the color. I was afraid it may be too hot, but my very hot-natured son is not bothered even in our 100+ SC heat. I'll be ordering at least one more.",

The Large Size in this swim shirt was ok, but fitted (tighter and shorter fit) and won't fit him next year--it's more like a Size 8-10. The XL (which I would never typically buy him) fit well--was roomy, but still fit well in length and sleeves (not as big as an XL would be in another type of shirt). He's slim, but 5'1\" and weighs around 87 lbs.",

I bought this shirt because I was desperate to find something to protect him. It fit perfectly, matched his swim trunks, and covers him from his neck down to the palms of his hands. He hasn't had a sunburn since I got the shirt in the mail. He enjoys wearing it because he doesn't have to wear as much sunscreen and he feels more comfortable in it. I'm so happy I bought this shirt, and when he no longer fits it I will buy another one.",

Sunscreen can be streaky and not always fool-proof. Also, he has very sensitive skin, and so this helps protect him from pool chemicals, etc. It's stayed very bright, and even though it's been accidentally thrown in the dryer a time or two it hasn't melted or shrunk. Very good quality product, and he loves wearing it. Also, it's lighter weight/silkier than a lot of rash guard, which I like because it seems to allow him to move around easier, and he's comfortable wearing it.",
