      "title": "Small but Durable",
      "text": "The spoon is small, narrow, has a thick silicone covering and lacks a significant bowl. These qualities have their pros and cons. Functionally the shape is easy to navigate into baby's mouth (almost despite being so thick/tall). However, runny liquids will readily spill off the sides. The spoon is ideal with yogurts or thicker foods, but proved almost unusable with thinner early stage foods (you have to administer very small spoonfuls). From a maintenance perspective, however, these are almost ideal. The design appears capable of withstanding whatever the dishwasher can throw at it. If you accept that there is no one perfect spoon, this is a great choice for foods with a thicker consistency.",

I don't know that these are worth the cost. The other spoons in the picture are Boon and Munchkin.",

Otherwise, I love the covered tips, the size and width of the spoon, and the length of the spoon. When he chomps down with his gums, not once has he been in pain due to covered tips. He even uses the spoon as a chewie sometimes to rub his gums on the spoon. Only reason I give 4 stars is that already a month into using them, I am looking for bigger spoons.",
