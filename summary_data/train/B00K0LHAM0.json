It is not a permanent solution, only temporary, because it only kills adult fleas. However, it starts working immediately. Therefore, if you pair this with a regular topical flea medication, you'll be flea-free! Use the Capguard first, then put the monthly flea medicine on. The Capguard will kill the adult fleas immediately and the flea medication should take care of any leftover fleas, plus any eggs that the Capguard did not get, and keep them flea-free. Good luck!",

I crushed it up and pour tuna fish water and she gulped it down 30 minutes later she was scratching and looked miserable scratching but I could tell they were dying. For about an hour she did this and I could see the fleas coming to the surface and were slowly falling off dying so I used that time to spray everything down with Raid flea spray to kill anything in the house and out on rugs outside. I\u2019m so happy to say they have not returned yet and my kitty had not scratched any! \ud83d\ude01",

This is a fantastic product to immediately eliminate fleas. But you should also treat your home, yard and dogs with a monthly flea prevention at the same time to ensure the fleas stay gone. This is great for if you foster dogs or have dogs over to visit that may have brought fleas to your residence. Safe for dogs to give everyday if needed - although I don't do that. It fixed our 4 fur babies right up when they all got real itchy from those nasty little fleas.",

This alarmed me. She was really tired for the next couple of days, still had diarrhea (didn't notice blood). She got back to herself after 3 days but I will not use this treatment again. Not worth the alarm and heartbreak. I honestly felt like this little baby trusted me with everything in the world and I nearly poisoned her.",
