So, 2 stars for good while it lasted. So....as it turns out, this baby is still going!! A little electrical trouble that was remedied & we are BACK IN BUSINESS!! So happy! While others said it didn't get hot enough, mine consistently reached 400-500 when required. Maybe because I live in the South & it's just hot outside! :) I've cooked everything from vegetables, shrimp, pork chops, steak & of course the obligatory chicken breast. It cooks evenly & succulently. Highly recommend.",
