Compared to Welch's Fruit Snacks, these are better tasting, unless you like the tartness of Welch's. I'm not into sour or tart, and the Mott's are a very smooth fruit flavor. And the best part is this is a 40 pack box instead of the average 8-12 snacks from others. All around, these are the best tasting and the best value. The 10 pack Motts in Prime Pantry are 3.63. This 40 pack is only 5.88 as of today. Go for the family size to get the best bang for your buck.",

      "text": "Overall, good product. I was afraid the gummies would taste weird considering this product was coming from a warehouse, but they taste delicious just as fresh as over the counter at the grocery store. The box did come in ripped on the corner, no big deal. We were after the gummies and not the box. Great value for the price! Usually a 10pk from the store is $2.50.",
