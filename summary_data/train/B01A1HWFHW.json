The last pair like these that she grew out of lasted over a year and passed on to a friend to use so I\u2019m very disappointed in this loss of quality. I\u2019ve contacted Oaki seller to see if they will exchange or refund and await their response. I will update this review if/when I hear back. Willing to try another pair but based on other reviews I think these might be a lost cause and I will be purchasing another brand for my kids from now on :(",

I was looking for a brand that was durable but reasonably priced. We bought them for Christmas and honestly, within 30 days, I'm noticing a lot of wear on the sole. We are losing the grips in some spots and by that, I mean they are wearing off. I think I'm going to have to bite the bullet, as they say, and pay for some Muck Boot Company boots because these are NOT going to last until spring.",

My daughter is a size 7 toddler in Plae and needed a 6 in these and my son is a 1 and the 1s in these were falling off. We double up in socks and he can sort of get away with it but knowing what I know now I always buy a full-size smaller.",

It has withstood 2 solid years (Springs, Summers, Falls and Winters) of nearly every day use, in mud, muck, water and snow. With barely a wear or tear on them. I'm now back a couple years later and have purchased another larger pair, as shes now grown out of the other ones. GREAT quality, nice grip on the soles, definetly waterproof and durable, as well as comfortable. I will most definetly continue to buy boots from this company in the future years.",

My son loves these, and I love that I don't have to deal with wet socks, wet feet, or dirty pants bottoms that take a while to scrub clean.
