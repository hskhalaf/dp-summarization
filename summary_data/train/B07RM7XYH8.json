      "verdict": "Durable, lightweight, and supportive are the top takeaways of the New Balance 796v2. Whether propelling towards the net or making those defensive shots along the baseline, this trainer won\u2019t drag you down. Its well-cushioned REVlite midsole cradles your foot during landings and grants you the needed responsiveness on subsequent push-offs. You can snag all these winning points without hurting your budget.",
      "pros": [
        "Most of the satisfied buyers revel about how ultra-lightweight the New Balance 796 v2 is",
        "Cushioning hasn't been an issue for many pleased users",
        "A majority of the reviews reveal that this trainer requires no break-in time",
        "Many of the playtesters claim that this hardcourt footgear offers excellent mobility",
        "A considerable number of those who find it durable say that it can withstand long hours of play",
        "Lots of wearers assert that it\u2019s backed up with a superb support structure",
        "It\u2019s one of the most affordable tennis shoes from New Balance"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "Few wearers affirm that the tongue of this trainer is partly long that it rubs against the collar",
        "Some say that the wide-width option of the New Balance 796v2 is deceiving as it feels rather narrow"

      "text": "Shoes seem to be OK. Good fit, good traction and reasonably comfortable. I\u2019ve worn them for about 6hrs of Pickleball now and they seem to be wearing pretty well (holding up well). Typical however, there isn\u2019t much cushion so I have replaced the insoles with aftermarket gel inserts that are much better (I highly recommend this if using on hard court surfaces, which these are designed for. I do this for most all athletic shoes actually). Gave 4 stars since the color of the left shoe is slightly darker than the right. Can\u2019t figure that out, but it\u2019s a bit annoying, but not so much that I cared to return them. Otherwise a decent shoe, not stellar though.",

All we're either too rigid, too loose, heavy, etc. Thank goodness for amazons return policy. Not mentioned, they look good too!",
