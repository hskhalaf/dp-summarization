I absolutely stopped using this brush on days when I use light colored sheets and clothes. The leaking is not as deep but still very visible. And it is permanent even after you bleach.",

You'll need to go on the mian page and looks for the one for super curly hair. I got that one years ago and wanted to replace it. The one I got years ago is amazing it take less then 20 minutes to get my hair detailed. This one here ripped hair from my scalp and took a good hour to do my hair.",

      "text": "I bought this brush for my 6 yo daughter, who hates getting her hair brushed (she has a tender head) and has trouble brushing her own hair. This brush is very easy for her to hold and use herself, and she says it doesn't pull her hair as much as other brushes do. The bristles are also fairly soft, but it is made of a sturdy plastic and I feel like it will last for a long time. Overall, I am very happy with this brush and would definitely buy it again!",

This brush is amazing! The bristles feel like they are too thin or weak, but they are not! When I first ran it through my dry hair, it felt like it wasn't doing anything and that the bristles were just too short and thin, BUT it was working! It completely smoothed my hair. I use it mostly in the shower to detangle and have noticed I'm a lot less hair than before.",
