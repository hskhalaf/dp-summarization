I think the difficulties folks are running into is due to the incorrect 1/3 cup serving size - when you go by weight (24 g), the actual serving size is about 3.5 level tbsp. I hope this information helps future buyers, although it would be nice if the product label could just be corrected too! All in all, I'm satisfied and will be purchasing this product again.",
