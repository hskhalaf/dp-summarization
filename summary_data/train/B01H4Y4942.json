I love the fact that these are class and not plastic which leeches into your dressing especially the acidic vinaigrettes. You can mix it right in the bottle and none of it leaks out. We have three right now and I think we might order more. It keeps everything in the refrigerator neat and organized looking. My husband made a Greek dressing with feta cheese on it and it actually came out because the hole is big enough for the cheese chunks to fit through yet it pours daintily if need be.",

I found the screw off and pop off pieces difficult to place in the dish washer. But, otherwise, I'm happy enough with this shaker.",

It doesn't leak into the lid, and it also doesn't leak from the screw-on cap. My only criticism is that fluid ounces are shown as their ml equivalents - that is, 4.4 oz (130 ml), 2.4 oz (70 ml), etc. I wish the jar markings would show the ounces in full ounces (1 oz, 2 oz, 3 oz, etc.) so I could use the jar to measure from U.S. recipes. I can eyeball the measurements but this could be a design upgrade to accommodate those of us who still measure in ounces.",

      "text": "Do not buy this item. the glass is not properly tempered. I've had this less than a month. Today when I took it out of the refrigerator, the salad dressing was congealed, so I placed the cruet in a bowl of warm, not hot water. The bottom blew out of it, dumping almost a whole batch of salad dressing. we keep our hot water heater set to less than 140\u00b0, so the water was comfortable to the touch. No excuse for this. Thankfully Amazon is granting us a refund. I'll order a different cruet.",
