      "text": "Purchased 3 of these projectors in June and all have been working with picture quality better than expected. the reason I rated so low was because of warranty period. One projector just died for no reason. Wasn't overheated bulb is fine, yet projector just won't power up. Tried different outlets and replacing cords still with no success. Because return period is so short I have to take a loss on this product.",

When considering its application for a golf simulator, I would guess less than maybe 100 hours of use. Called epson, of course it's out of order. Considering other reviews this failure isn't uncommon. This unit has been replaced with the EX7260. However no changes with the exception of lumens. Buyer beware..",

After a fair amount of research and thinking through the various trade-offs I picked this one and am very happy with it thus far. Exceptionally clear and bright, and awesome color rendering. Dead-simple plug-n-play setup when using a cable to my laptop. Have not tried the wireless setup, so can't speak to that. Feels solid and well-made. However, if you will be travelling with it I do recommend you get a proper case for it as the case it ships with is a 'courtesy case' that provides you something out-of-the-box to carry it in but that does not offer any real protection. Other than that, all good so far!",
