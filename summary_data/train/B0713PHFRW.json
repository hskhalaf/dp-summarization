I did not have my systems coolboost on so the heat dispersion here is all thanks to the cooling pad. Sturdy material, stout little legs and a small lip that keeps the laptop from sliding, although, if you're on a flat surface it's not going to slide anyway. It fits my 15.6 laptop perfectly and could hold a slightly bigger machine with ease. If you're looking for a pad to cool your gaming system then this is the one you want.",

My laptop is usually on the couch or on the bed so this helps provide air flow on those soft surfaces, even without the fans on this things helps. I only plug in the fans when I am gaming and boy does it help bring those temperatures down. Not loud at all and the red lights I barely notice since my laptop pretty much covers the entire thing. Highly recommend to anybody that has a laptop, especially a gaming laptop.",

It also didn't drain my laptop battery down any faster. I actually felt like the battery lasted longer. and tge cool LED lights on fan makes it more better.",

The fans ARE quiet; however, they do not really produce enough cool air to really cool down your laptop - they lower the temp by maybe 2 degrees - so they do function - minimally.",

It's extremely straightforward and easy to use since you just plug in the fan in to the laptop (with the provided cord) and use the circle switch to adjust the fan speed and to turn it on or off. Everything down to the cord was well thought out. HAVIT did a really good job on this product. I am really pleased and I look forward into buying more of their products!",

The pad seems to be made well and it's seems sturdy. I was concerned about the feet, but they have exceeded my expectation. Not 5 star due to noise, but it's still quieter than my old cooling pad (it was over 5 years old and only had 2 fans, this has 5 and it is quieter). I like you can adjust the speed of the fans with the dial. Simple and easy to use and it does the job. No slipping of my laptop even without the holder flipped open.",

This detracts from the fans' effectiveness in blowing air directly to my SSD and hot section of my Hp Pavilion - thus I normally shift my laptop about 1-2\" to the left, so it sits dirrectly overlop the upper left fan.",

I once owned a cooling pad that was built on a slant and had no tabs to hold it in place. My laptop slid off several times because of it. This pad moves a decent amount of air and keeps my laptop about 10 to 20 degrees cooler when on maxium setting. The only con I can think of at the moment is that I wish there was an option to turn off the red led lights when the cooling pad is in use. The lights are unnecessary and can be annoying, especially at night.",

Expectations aside, I could have given it 4 stars if one of the fans didn't die after <2 months of use making the ~1-3 degrees go out the window because it was the fan directly under the GPU which is producing most of the heat.
