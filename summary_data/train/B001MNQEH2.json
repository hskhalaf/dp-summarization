Over all quality is that of a halloween prop but what do you expect from $12. The liner comes out very easily so I will be super gluing it together. All in all I give it about a 5-6 out of 10",

In addition to not fitting well and looking rather silly perched so high on my head, the suspension slips out of the fittings when I remove the hat. I guess that is the chance you take when you can't try something on before buying.",

The suspension bands came away from the buckles a few times as well, and I had a suspension band hanging in my eye for a while. It was really bad timing, because we could not stop what we were doing for over an hour. If you want to make adjustments to your hard hat ALL day long, this one is a great buy.",
