      "text": "My son is 9 and just starting catching. He needed a good glove that wouldn't take too long to break in. He loves this glove. It fits well, and was broken in enough to use in a game after one good practice. It's a youth glove, but it fits my hand as well so I was also able to catch with it to help him break it in (I'm 5'3\" so my hand is smaller). I think it'll work for him for at least 2 seasons. I had bought a 33\" glove too and can't believe how much bigger it was even though it was only a 1/2\" bigger. Highly recommend for young catchers!",

We looked at 33\" adult gloves, and they are about 50% heavier to start, moving up quickly. That much weight could be detrimental to development, and will certainly cause faster fatigue in a young person's arm.
