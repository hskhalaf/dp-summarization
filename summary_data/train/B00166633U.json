Of course Amazon was cheaper than the pharmacy so I went with the spray for convenience. My experience wasn\u2019t good. Even with a small amount of spray it didn\u2019t absorb quick enough on my arm thus the run down occurred. I gave this several attempts but had no success. It also left a residue on my bathroom counter. For me this product didn\u2019t work for my poison ivy.",
