This behavior was very reproducible and happened 1/3rd to 1/2 of the time I tried it. This of course causes the mouse to move all over the screen. Other than this, the quality of the trackball seemed good, and I did not have any problems installing it.",

WIN10 'Enhance point precision' should be turned on. The DPI setting does not seem to make a difference. Because it is RF, and not IR, it works through pillows.",

Using the rollerball was difficult for any fine adjustments of the cursor, it had a tendency to keep jumping around which made it very frustrating. Selecting something as you would do with the left button on your mouse was awkward, you had to hold your hand very still or the mouse would jump around, again frustrating. The product I received was used not new as the batteries were already installed and the protective wrapping was from something else. Not only was this disappointing but I\u2019m sure there are consumer laws against that.",

The trigger button requires more of a 'click and hold' than just a click to work - and it is so mushy that you can't really tell if you've actually clicked it. The trackball is so fast that it leaps across the screen and seems to be very nervous when trying to hit buttons or small action links on the screen. Plus, because the ball is loosely fitting, when you lift your thumb off of the ball - it tends to jump a little - which causes it to be off whatever you are trying to click on by the time you try to click.",

I will say that it's important to let go of the trackball when clicking, otherwise you'll end up inadvertently moving the trackball as you click. No noticeable lag which is important.
