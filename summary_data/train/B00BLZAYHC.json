      "text": "Every other review was spot on. This is a great monitor. What stands out is the stand/mounting ability. If you're looking to mount this to a VESA mount, this is by far the coolest most versatile setup I've ever seen. The base is removable, and you're left with an articulating \"control center\" that houses the vesa mount and all the power/video connections. It's really fantastic. Most of the IPS monitors we tried didn't even have the VESA holes. This not only had them, but provided an extra range of motion in addition to that of the mounting arm.",

Not a big problem but a little annoying. It should have come with 2 HDMI inputs, it didn't. I had to adapt a cable to another input to be able to plug in another hd device. Again annoying but not a deal killer. The image quality is very good! Menu is simple enough. I would recommend it but I might get the more expensive name brand model if I did it again. I hope this company does another one with a bit more connectivity.",

If it makes Skyrim look this good, I have no doubt it'll look just as awesome on my other games.",

I have 260 icons on my desktop (don't counsel me on my desktop - i like it that way), and this allows me to have them all on there with decent sized icons and font size.

At the price point paid for this monitor I would have expected a more durable feeling frame around the monitor surface itself, but that would be my only ding. The color pallet is very vivid and the resolution excellent.",

I tried to contact the manufacturer and they never contacted me back. I waited for 3 days to hear from them. Nothing. I returned it to Amazon and purchased the Dell UltraSharp U2913WM. I would not recommend the AOC unless you like obstructions in the viewing area.",
