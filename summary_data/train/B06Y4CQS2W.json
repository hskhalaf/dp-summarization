It did not take long after purchase for the back to begin flexing further and further back when the user leans against the back rest. I purchased this less than 1 year ago. Today the back broke clean off. Picture attached shows the broken join where the back was attached to the seat. Awful, I would discourage anyone from even considering purchasing this.",

Although it's not a big deal as I place a pillow under my lumber as I have back pains and I can work relatively pain free. Overall, if you're looking for a decent budget chair I'd reccomend it.",
