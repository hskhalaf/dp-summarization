I initially thought it was the signal to the wireless dongle, and it may be, but I've tried it in different USB slots, on a separate external hub, and on a different PC. All have the same issues. The keys are obnoxiously loud, too, for not being a mechanical keyboard, and there is the sound of the keys being depressed, but no output. It is frustrating. Would not recommend.",

Additionally, I'm a large man (6' 2\" 220 Lbs.) so (at 19\" wide) I found the keyboard a little hard to get used to particularly since I'm used to the 20\" MS Natural Ergonomic keyboard.

Definitely a product issue. When I tried to file a claim under the Microsoft product warranty (which covers 2 years from date of purchase), Microsoft support gave me the runaround, said this has to be dealt with via Amazon (not true, only within the return period of Amazon), and made me call back 5 times as my call was repeatedly dropped when transferring me between departments. Finally, they said unless this is damaged upon receipt, they will not provide a replacement.",
