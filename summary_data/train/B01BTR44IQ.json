Though it's very well built and can go straight into the dishwasher/sanitizer, the hole that the batter passes through is so small that it takes 5-15 seconds, depending upon how full the hopper is, to dispense each pancake. When your need 12 pancakes at a time on the griddle, this is the last piece of equipment you'd want. If you're looking to make a few perfect pancakes at home, this thing is what you're looking for. There are also many other potential applications for this 100% leakproof dispenser.",

No drips, not too tiring to hold, doesn't clog if you don't let the wax harden too much and holds a nice amount of liquid. Con: Cleaning: the stopper mechanism doesn't detach which makes it difficult, but not impossible, to wipe the inside. When I was wiping it once, the stopper detached and it took some time to get it back on so the pressure on it was enough to seal the opening completely. One star removed for this, but I'd still recommend this no problem.",
