      "title": "Most of Toolkit fine, okay value. Measuring tape broken upon opening",
      "text": "The majority of the toolkit has been great. The measuring tape, however, was not staying 'straight' or flat, even at 2 feet length. Right around the 4-inch mark it kept collapsing which made it frustrating to work with. When I called to complain with Amazon, Amazon offered to pay for a similar-length replacement measuring tape. It's usually easier to call into Amazon for an issue-resolve, but I don't know if Hi-Spec would have offered a similar seamless issue resolution. 3/5 stars for the product, and 5/5 stars for Amazon customer service, who always stands by products that are FBA or that they sell themselves.",

We tend to have a lot of house projects and been using one tool for it, it was annoying, but this was PERFECT. It came with just everything we need, the screwdriver is easy to use. The box cutter was kind of cheap though as it broke easily but other than that everything is awesome as pictured and the price for this was worth it!",
