      "text": "I was a little disappointed as the lids can be quite hard to put on the dish. The dish has to be relatively close fit for the lid to work well - i.e. not as stretchy as the description would make you believe. If the lid needs to be stretched some, the dish has to have some kind of a lip for the lid to stay on. If you get anything greasy on the lid while trying to put it on, just forget it. Even if you stretch it, it will slide right off. You need to wash with soap first to even try again.",

It was tight as a drum, and I was feeling pretty good about the purchase when I put it in the refrigerator. The next morning, however, the lid had completely slipped off. Very, very disappointed.

      "text": "My wife and i use these for leftovers, espeically when we just want to throw a whole pot/pan into the fridge. We slap one of these on top and it is easy to apply, seals tight, and keeps food fresh. We no longer use foil or beeswax, so we're saving on disposable items. Highly recommend, wish i had found these sooner!",

Very nice product and no wrestling with plastic wrap! Maybe square shaped ones next?",

I finally had to use aluminum foil. The bowls that I use in the travel trailer are plastic, so maybe that has something to do with it. Perhaps they would work better on glass containers, I'm not sure. A little disappointed in my purchase.",
