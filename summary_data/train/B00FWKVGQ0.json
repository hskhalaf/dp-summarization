This definitely kept us warmer at night and will attract all the other campers within a 100 foot radius...which is great because they'll share their whiskey with you. I wouldn't go for the smaller version because we were huddled pretty close when it was in the upper 40s. A standard 20 lb tank of propane will likely give you around 12 hours of warmth at full strength. Within 10 minutes of opening the box, we had heat. In short, I had whiskey and have new friends thanks to the Outland Firebowl Mega 850.",

My husband who loves our wood burning fire pit was skeptical to switch to gas and had our wood burning one ready as back up, but he did not have to use it as this one worked great.

I bought fire glass for a little fancy look. As others mentioned, I used aluminum window screening to cover the holes so that the fire glass does not fall through. I did read that the propane will turn the glass black unless you add propane air filter valve, or switch to natural gas. So far my glass has not turned black. The heat output is perfect.

My husband and I take it camping and it is so easy to enjoy a fire without having to carry wood, smell like smoke or to worry about embers flying out somewhere. We have it on a 5 pound propane tank and onnour last trip we enjoyed 2 fires (1 about 1 hour and 2nd about 3 hours) and only used half of the tank. Another great thing is that a lot of camping sites do not allow fires but this is harmless! Portable enough to use in the back yard too. The picture I posted shows the firepit with a standard camping pit. The 24\u201d size is what we got! Enjoy\ud83d\ude0a",

      "text": "If you want a heat source, this is not the item to get. Stick to wood. Otherwise, if you're looking for ambiance, a nice setting & not ending up smelling like a smokey fire, this is a very nice replacement for a wood fire pit. A couple of other plus features would be the ease of moving it around & if you're camping in an area that does not allow open fire pits, many times this can be a replacement. Definitely need to check if this is allowable in the campground you are visiting.",

We recently moved to a different state and hooked it back up, only to discover that it wasn't working properly. I reached out to customer service, and within 24 hours, I had an email with 2 possible fixes, each with detailed step-by-step instructions with pictures. Within minutes my fire pit was working as normal, and I was very pleased. The fire pit is a bit heavy when you move it with the lava rocks in it, but otherwise it's perfect for our needs. I will be purchasing another for our camper.",
