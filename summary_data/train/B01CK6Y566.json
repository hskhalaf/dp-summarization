Adding two shiny silver colored wires along the bottom stops this from happening.",

      "text": "Was looking for a magazine holder to complement my newly remodeled master bathroom and came across this little jewel. It was well reviewed, nicely priced and came in finish to match my bathroom hardware - all pluses! And it's worked perfectly to hold all my reading material, and look sharp while doing so. I love that the bottom is open so that the inevitable hair and dust bunnies that plagued my older holder can fall right though to be vacuumed away. As you can see from the photo, i have several magazines and catalogs in the holder. It holds a lot of materials. I'm very satisfied. It works as intended.",

This was pretty inexpensive (I probably could have checked Ross, Marshalls, etc). And it's so perfect! It's the right size, surprisingly nice quality, and the perfect finish. I chose satin, and it looks like a brushed nickel to me. It's very lightweight, modern... It's sturdy (to a point... I'm sure you could bend it if you really tried). You won't have a problem with magazines slouching down if you use books. I think it's versatile, could go in a large or a small space. Totally worth it!",
