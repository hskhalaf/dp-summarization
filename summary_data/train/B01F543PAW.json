The app has only been useful for tuning thus far (I'm about a month in). For me, the video's in the app don't show a good enough angle, and the person playing doesn't say a word. No explanation of finger position or anything and I needed a lot more hand holding. Cynthia Lin is the way to go! I didn't even know how the strum! The Kala Ukulele designers should get with her!",

I spent the extra 20 on a padded gig bag, two straps, and strap buttons. The web site lessons are nice. After two days I'm good with 6 chords and some strumming. I wasn't even getting it for me! As other reviews say, the strings have needed tuning each day (minor tweaking), but less and less each day.",

      "text": "I really enjoyed the Kala App and learning Uke. The issue came about when in the middle of the night I heard a loud snap and woke up to find that bridge of the Uke had broken off from the Uke body. Whatever cheap glue they had used wasn't strong enough so the strings literally pulled the bridge entirely off using just their tension (see photo)! Ridiculous. I did not over tighten the strings (I always used the Kala App tuner to adjust the tension) and also if I had over tightened, then the string itself should have snapped, the bridge should never bust off the body! Absolutely poor craftsmanship, I would not recommend at all.",

Very cheaply made. I've gotten a ukelele for less money than this and it was still better. I wouldn't get this for someone who is trying to learn because they would never play it in tune, especially if they had no ear for it. You shouldn't have to worry about that so often. It will just make learning harder because it wont even sound like the song you are trying to learn. Just spend more money and get a better ukelele. \ud83d\ude05",

I use the PanoTuner app instead of the Kala app, because it is easier to use and more explanatory. Also, the app does not explain chords very well. I learned everything I know from Youtube. Overall, this ukulele sounds great, and the price is good friends with my wallet.",

The chord book is useful for beginners, who don't want to constantly google chords. The bag is what you would expect, it isn't anything special but the strap on it is good.",

If you're new to the uke, this really isn't that expensive and produces decent quality sound for your purposes. Keep in mind though what type of Ukelele you'll need and that you'll need to tune the Ukelele a little more in the beginning then once in a while if you keep it for 2+ years.",

My daughter really likes it, just has to practice to get familiar with chords and strumming style, etc...only drawback I\u2019ve encountered after a couple of days is the strings have to be returned after each session. I use the Kala tuner on my iPhone and it\u2019s easy to use - it\u2019s just kind of a drag to have to tune all four strings every time my daughter wants to practice.",

      "text": "Despite the title stating that it comes with a \"tuner, and app\" it does not come with a tuner. This is misleading. The box came exactly as pictured...unsecured with the top easily separated from the bottom, I am surprised it made it to my house in good condition, and because it is clearly marked on the outside what is inside, there was no way this is going to be a surprise for my Daughter as intended. The Ukulele itself seems well made and is very decent for the price.",

It came packaged with all the accessories promised, though I prefer a clip-on tuner to an app. The tote bag for storing and carrying is very handy with adjustable strings allowing it to be carried easily on your back. The little booklet has enough information to get you started. Since I play guitar, I found it took me about an hour to learn how to play it and I have been having loads of fun with it ever since.",

When I have the C string tuned to C and I press on the second fret to create a D, the D pitch is very flat. The only reason I can think of why this is happening is, that the frets are placed incorrectly. The spacing between the frets are off and it creates dissonant pitches. Very disappointed.",
