After reading, I was able to set it up and have it running in less than 15 minutes. Camera is small and discreet, unless you\u2019re looking in directly under direct sunlight, you won\u2019t be able to see the camera. The reflective lens over the camera makes it difficult to for unsuspecting to see. I love that once set up, I\u2019m able to watch the feed live from anywhere.",

The app on the other hand needs serious work. After checking the SD card video and reinserting it, the app doesn't recognize the camera. Even after resetting the camera, installing and reinstalling the app. Haven't contacted product customer service yet, still a little frustrated.",

If you are someone that generally struggles with technology, this product may prove challenging to set-up as there are a lot of settings to work through. Also the application for your phone, you are pretty much on your own as far as figuring it out. That said, the product does seem to work as advertised. One suggestion I would make is to make it such that you can plug the clock directly into a computer in order to pull the video off, rather than having to remove the sd card each time.",

      "text": "This little clock is ideal for keeping an eye on things when you are away. It is discreet and small enough to fit in the corner of any night stand, end table, dresser, book shelf, or anywhere you might normally keep a small click / alarm clock. The tech support is very responsive if you have any issues. Highly recommend !",
