That said, these things are a bear to get on. If you have back issues and can't bend over very far, don't bother, you'll never get them on. The sock liner makes it a struggle even under normal circumstances. Once on tho they shine. I was surprised how lightweight and durable they are and they look nice with almost any outfit. This is my second pair, but I bought them reluctantly given how difficult they are to put on - that's why they only got 3 stars.",
