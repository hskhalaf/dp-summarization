Would be nice if the pieces were labeled with a letter or number. The main complaint is that in the propane side lid there is a small hole (pictured). Also, the top panel is bent, preventing either lid from resting flush both sides. My advice would be to pay an additional $50 and get a better product.",

It took about 2.5 hours to put together following the 27 steps in the instruction booklet. With that said, it was actually pretty easy. It also comes with tools, a phillips screwdriver and wrenches. Cooked food using both sides at the same time, and the food came out delicious! As shown in the pictures, I also bought the 72 inch cover for it to protect it from the elements. I am very happy with this purchase.",

    "description": "Enjoy the best of both! Are you a grilling aficionado that appreciates the taste that some say can only be achieved cooking over charcoal, or do you prefer the convenience and flavors of grilling with gas? The discussion about which is better has been going on for many years and likely will continue for many more.

This spacious grill has a total of 557 square inches of cooking space that can accommodate 32 burgers (16 per side) at once and an additional 188 square inches of warming space. As an added convenience, the grill includes a gas-powered side burner that can be used to prepare your favorite sauces or a whole host of other dishes. Dual Fuel Combination Charcoal/Gas Grill: 557 sq in total cooking space (262 charcoal, 295 gas) 188 sq in total warming rack space (89 charcoal, 99 gas) Cast iron cooking grids Chrome-plated warming racks Gas side has 3 stainless steel tube burners offering a total of 24,000 BTUs Stainless steel 12,000-BTU side burner with cover Includes integrated ignition for all burners with rubber grip control knobs Porcelain-coated heat plates reduce flare-ups Charcoal side has height-adjustable charcoal tray Front access door to maintain charcoal Removable ash tray for cleanup Black baked enamel lids with stainless steel trim Baked enamel bottom bowls Painted steel control panel with stainless steel trim Features 2 spacious side shelves 2 round temperature gauges Integrated tool holders and bottle opener 2 wheels for mobility This grill uses a 70\" grill cover (sold separately) LP tank not included Measures approximately 64\"L x 28\"W x 49.75\"H Weighs approximately 90 lbs (103 lbs in the box) Model# GBC1793W",
