      "text": "The casing on the headphones gives the impression of really cheap plastic and noise comes through really bad as soon as anything touches them. Especially noticeable while running because the power button rattles every time you move. IT'S SO FRUSTRATING because if the design was better with the housing for the headphones these would be a easy 5 stars. The design of them really lets down how good the quality is of the actual speakers next to your ears. Snug fit but looks great. Every thing is here in principle just let down in execution. Sad to say that I have to return these but really over priced for the quality you get from them.",

Yes the design is great, yes the quality is amazing, they're even able to cancel out a lot of noise. BUT it all doesn't matter if they can't connect properly! My boyfriend has the 650BT - same issues, so it's not really a faulty item.",

The noise cancellation and sound quality is far superior in these headsets. One thing to note, especially, is the much longer battery power in these - and you could easily do long-haul flights and trips away and not need to worry. I would definitely go for this brand in the future.",
