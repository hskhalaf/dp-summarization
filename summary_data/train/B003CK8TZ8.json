      "text": "The mini-displayport connector plugged into the mini-displayport jack on my Macbook so loosely it could fall out under its own weight. As it wiggled around -- or even if left alone -- it didn't make a reliable connection. It was easy to see by the Macbook repeatedly detecting this adapter and changing its display that the connection was coming and going. Even when connected, this adapter didn't work with the HDTV I tried it with. I swapped it out for a friend's Belkin branded (and much cheaper) adapter and that worked great. Maybe it only works at some resolutions? Definitely a 1-star product -- it fails to do even the most basic job that it's for.",

      "text": "The reason for this purchase was to route audio from a MacBook Pro to an HDTV. I had previously bought a $7.52 Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter. Although the Mac saw the TV, the TV was silent. Under \"Comments\" for the other adapter, a poster said it was a Mac setting under sound properties that enabled the audio. After doing a little troubleshooting, I decided it wasn't the MacBook that was the problem, but the adapter instead. After reading some of the customer reviews here, I decided that the Griffin was the solution. After plugging in this adapter, my TV had sound. 5 stars for functionality and a good price.",

So the great news is the it DOES WORK! and it is cheaper than the apple brand one that only gives you DV connectivity. With this adapter you get DV and HDMI for a lower price.
