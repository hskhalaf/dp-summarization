And overall, there's a much higher proportion of smaller pieces than in other sets. Yes, the box is bigger than other 100-piece sets -- there's a lot of air inside. The magnets are a bit weaker than in other sets, but adequate. On the plus side, it has some different shapes: 2 vehicle bases, large hexagons and half-hexagons, four domes. I would start with another set, then if you want to expand, add this. The several brands I've found have small size differences, but can be used together.",

      "text": "We've had a set of these Stick N Stack magnets for over 2 years now. They have held up perfectly (absolutely no damage, and the kids are not usually gentle with them). They have provided so many hours of creative fun we just ordered our kids this expansion pack. The magnets are great for all my kids - Age 2 to 7, both sexes. When we first got them I was afraid they were too easily knocked apart, but the kids rarely have an issue with it. Literally HOURS of fun for our family! These are a top toy in our house, and I just love the level of creativity the kids have with them! A must buy.",

Most popular with this set for both of my kids (2 and 4 year old) have been using car bases to build cars, trains and other crazy looking vehicles. To my surprise, both of my kids also loved little people. The only negative about this set is that smaller parts: L- shaped and rectangles do not stick to each other as well as regular parts such as squares and triangles. Overall great set, awesome for kids and for adults.",
