However, I can use my cell charger for the mp3 player so it isn't a huge deal.",

Pros: Storage is decent. You can assign files to folders. Cons: Battery life is horrible. Left it fully charged and next day it was dead. User interface seems like its from the early 2000's. Hard to navigate and confusing. Goodluck getting bluetooth to initially connect to your device properly. When changing volume you have to wait for about 10 seconds before you can do anything else on screen. Pretty heavy .",

I needed something other than my phone for riding my bike and listening to music on the trails and this device fits the job perfectly, and without leaving much of a dent in the old wallet. Music sounds better than on my phone, love the built in radio with easy presets, has video playing functions, and even supports a wide range of audio files. I have to admit, I use to have an old Sansa mp3 player years ago and this device does everything and more, so yeah, I'm enamored with it for sure.",

You can disable the screen saver so I can see the lists when I want with out activating the screen every time I want to change a song. Oh, BTW the audio quality is excellent... It feels better built then my iPod and well made for outdoors. This was a good purchase and I'm very happy with it.",

      "text": "After buying and returning multiple other mp3 players I finally landed on this gem. It has a solid feel to it and a clean look. 16Gb of memory is plenty for me, I use it to listen to audio books constantly but I also put some music on it to get a better idea of sound quality and it's pretty good. Finally, the Bluetooth capability and ease of use on that score (unlike the ones I returned) make this a perfect player for me. I would recommend this to my friends if they were in the market.",

Unfortunately, it would always manage to stop playing the music within 10-12 seconds, the reason was the touch sensitivity was such that it immediately went into pause. I tried it numerous times became frustrated and threw it away and went back to my aging iPod Shuffle.",

      "text": "I was very excited to order and receive this player. Unlike 90% of the other players it could hold a LOT of music on a 128gB micro card. What I didn't expect is that the internal software is not powerful enough to run the system efficiently. There is a large delay in responses to button pushes and when turning on screen light. After running about 30 minutes of songs it finally catches up with power and 'next\" buttons. Also the \"next,\" \"up/down,\" \"pause/play\" buttons do not light up and this is not a good thing when listening in low or no lights. It does have excellent battery life!",
