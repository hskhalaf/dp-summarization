I bought 24 of these acoustic wedges (only needed 16 in the end) and attached them to the door to create a sound barrier. They do a great job! I would say that the noise level on both sides of the house has been cut 75%. I do not know how they might compare to the competition, but I would definitely recommend them to renters looking for an inexpensive sound muffler.",
