Easy to control and comfortable fit in my hand. I plan to engrave several items with my driver's license or phone number, as the police recommend doing that in case valuable items are stolen. (Caution: If you plan to do this, do not engrave your Social Security number. Police cannot trace the item back to you. But they can find you if you engrave your phone number or driver's license number.)",

The one weak point is the tip...you use an allen wrench to tighten it into the socket. I didn't get it tight enough with the first use and the tip SHOT out of the engraver!! Luckily I was doing it on my kitchen counter and the tip hit the wall and stayed on the counter. If it had landed on my carpet, I would never have found it (until my vacuum did). I like the adjustable speed, that's a nice feature.",

I ordered it to replace my glass etcher, which was a tiny lightweight light-duty thing that I burned up in a couple of months. This engraver is very heavy duty, and though it is a little bigger and heavier than my previous one, it is in no way cumbersome. I ordered some DREMEL diamond-tip bits and they work perfectly. I am quite excited about using this, it is well-built and I believe it will last. Will update in a couple of months when I've done a million more glass etchings....",
