I bought this to drill through the thick steel frame of my older travel trailer and I couldn't be more satisfied with how well it powered through it. I don't even bother using my cordless drill for anything bigger than a pilot hole anymore; I go straight to my tool cabinet and pull this bad-boy out for all of my other handheld drilling needs. Plenty of power and the side handle provides plenty of control. The keyed chuck works really well, holds all bits nice and tight.",

Rigid battery drill didn\u2019t have the power even with my 9 mah battery. Paid extra for Dewalt brand thinking it was built better quality, not the case with this DWD210G drill. Not recommended.",

This one is a half inch bit size and the detachable handle and 10 amps will assure you of it's ability to plow through anything. It IS however, not necessarily a one- handed drill. It is heavier than most and built with industrial durability in mind. That is my only negative comment about it and I should have given more thought to the WEIGHT of the drill. That's not DeWalt's fault. I love the power of the drill. The detachable handle makes it applicable to almost any job you need a drill for. I am pretty sure this will last the rest of my life.",

It's got power so you have to make sure it doesn't twist on you because it will come back hard on you.

We'll see how much 1/4\" steel plate this thing can punch through over the next few decades.
