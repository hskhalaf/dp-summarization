      "text": "This is the best AA battery camera around. Unfortunately the new SX170 edition of this series switched to proprietary rechargeable batteries, so this one pretty much remains the king of AA battery cameras. The picture quality if excellent. Not as great as an SLR, but you have plenty of options to play with. Many other AA cameras do not include manual controls for focus and aperture. This one does, and it's a fun device to play with. It's very easy to use and controls are very intuitive. I like how the enabling the flash requires a manual raise. This creates a helpful visual cue. Overall I absolutely love this thing.",

Along with auto focus, it also has a macro mode and manual focus. The only thing I don't like about this camera is that it goes through batteries fairly quickly. I highly recommend getting some rechargeable AA batteries along with this. Also, the use of AA batteries makes this camera a little bulkier than most compact cameras.",

Sometimes a bit slow writing to SD card when maximally zoomed in - even a faster SD card did not help in that regard. Good all-around camera.

I didn't need it for action shots so I took a chance on this, half the price and does what I need perfectly, I haven't really tried it much for anything else but I'm very happy with it.",

VERY happy with this; easy to use; great colors; great zoom and small enough to put in your pocket.",

    "title": "Canon PowerShot SX160 IS 16.0 MP Digital Camera (Old Model) with 16x Wide-Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom with 3.0-Inch LCD",
    "description": "Color:BlackThe Canon 6354B001 PowerShot SX160 IS 16MP Compact Digital Camera, in black, offers a powerful 16x optical zoom lens enabling you to shoot photos and videos that cover the full spectrum of focal lengths. From wide-angle 28mm shots of friends gathered 'round the dinner table to standard length shots of landscapes and even telephoto shots of animals, sporting events and close-up portraits, the SX160 has you covered. The Intelligent Optical Image Stabilization system recognizes the different conditions that can cause a shaky, blurry image and corrects them so your long zoom, fast action and low light shots are delivered sharp and stunning. It houses a 16MP CCD sensor and DIGIC 4 Image Processor. The SX160 also captures video in 720p HD and with the HDMI output, you can connect your camera to your HDTV and screen your videos in gorgeous HD moments after you shoot them. If you don't carry your HDTV around with you, use the camera's large 3.0-inch LCD screen to compose and display your images. It come along with the \nPowerShot SX160 IS Body, 2 AA-size Alkaline Batteries, Wrist Strap WS-800, USB Interface Cable IFC-400PCU, Digital Camera Solution CD-ROM.\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nTurn Memories Into Memorable Images You'll want to carry this compact, versatile camera everywhere, because it gives every shooting opportunity the potential to become a beautiful image. The spectacular 16x Optical Zoom with 28mm Wide-Angle Lens and Optical Image Stabilizer captures clear, vivid images whether your subject is up close or far away. And with the 16.0 Megapixel sensor and Canon DIGIC 4 Image Processor, every detail is precisely rendered for truly impressive image quality. The PowerShot SX160 IS captures breathtakingly realistic 720p HD video in stereo sound with the\n\nPRECISION CANON OPTICS\n\n\nPOWERFUL 16X OPTICAL ZOOM WITH 28MM WIDE-ANGLE LENS\nThe PowerShot SX160 IS features a powerful Genuine Canon 16x Optical Zoom Lens that delivers outstanding optical performance and versatility. With precision engineering and decades of leadership in optical technologies, Canon has created a bright, wide-angle lens that provides an extraordinary 16x zoom range. The lens starts at 28mm wide-angle and extends to 448mm telephoto (35mm equivalent), giving you tremendous coverage and reach. The telephoto end lets you capture subjects from a considerable distance, while the 28mm wide-angle makes it easy to shoot sweeping landscapes, large groups of people and tall buildings. Moreover, this superb lens incorporates innovative designs that enable it to fit the compact profile of the PowerShot SX160 IS.\n\n\n\nOPTICAL IMAGE STABILIZER\nHandheld shooting can often lead to camera shake, making photos and videos blurry. Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer is a sophisticated system that uses lens-shift technology to correct for unwanted camera movement. It makes handheld photography more practical in more shooting situations, providing excellent image quality in many difficult situations: outdoors at dusk, inside without a flash, and even at the telephoto end of the zoom range without a tripod. For still photos, it enables shooting at slower shutter speeds, accommodating more low-light shooting situations than ever before without having to boost ISO sensitivity. With camera shake and vibration reduced, you get a sharper, steadier image. And because it is an optical system, there is none of the image degradation typical with electronic image stabilizers.\n\n\n\n\nPOWERFUL CORE SPECS DELIVER BEAUTIFUL IMAGES\n16.0 MEGAPIXEL IMAGE SENSOR\nThe PowerShot SX160 IS's 16.0 Megapixel CCD sensor delivers impressive photos with fine detail and brilliant color. The high resolution ensures superb image quality even when cropping or making very large prints.\n\nCanon DIGIC 4 Image Processor Canon DIGIC Image Processors have set the standard for functionality and performance since their groundbreaking introduction in 1999. With each successive generation, DIGIC Image Processors have brought elevated performance and powerful new features to PowerShot digital cameras. The DIGIC 4 Image Processor has ushered in a new level of picture quality and accelerated processing, making possible features such as high-speed continuous shooting, HD video and Face Detection Self-timer. New, more powerful noise reduction algorithms also provide improved low-light capture.\n\n\nPRESERVE AND SHARE YOUR MEMORIES IN SPECTACULAR HD\nCANON HD VIDEO ADVANTAGE\nThe PowerShot SX160 IS lets you record highly detailed 720p HD video at 25 frames per second with clear stereo sound. Imagine the fun and excitement of being able to shoot high definition video whenever you want, right from your compact digital camera. Watching your videos and sharing them with family and friends is especially easy with the camera's HDMI output: you can connect the camera directly to your HDTV with an optional HDMI cable, and see your videos on the big screen right away.\n\nDEDICATED MOVIE BUTTON, WIND FILTER AND OPTICAL ZOOM WHILE SHOOTING\nIt's never been easier to shoot videos with a PowerShot digital camera. The PowerShot SX160 IS has a dedicated movie button that lets you start and stop recording instantly. The camera is always ready to shoot stills or video whenever you want. The camera also incorporates an electronic wind filter, which suppresses wind noise that can muffle or distort the sound. The PowerShot SX160 IS lets you use the full range of optical zoom when you're shooting a video without sacrificing HD video resolution.\n\nIFRAME MOVIE SUPPORT\nWith the PowerShot SX160 IS, you can also shoot video in the Apple iFrame format, which is a computer-friendly standard that speeds up importing and editing of videos. It keeps file sizes small, making it more convenient to upload or e-mail high-quality videos. The iFrame format enjoys native support in compatible Mac and Windows video applications, making it unnecessary to perform time-consuming and often quality-degrading conversions.\n\nSEE WHAT YOU'RE SHOOTING ON A CLEAR, BIG SCREEN\nLARGE 3.0-INCH LCD\nEasy to see from a wide angle, the camera's 3.0-inch LCD with a great resolution of approximately 230,000 dots gives you the big picture, whether you're shooting, reviewing or showing off your images. This high-resolution screen offers a crisp, clear picture to make shooting, playback and using the camera's menu functions especially convenient; it also features Night Display for easy viewing in low light.\n\nA SMARTER CAMERA MEANS BETTER PHOTOS AND VIDEOS\nSMART AUTO\nThe PowerShot SX160 IS features Smart AUTO: sophisticated Canon technology that makes getting that great shot as simple as pressing the shutter button. Smart AUTO automatically detects scenes by assessing various factors in both the background and the subject. Detected scenes are analyzed using 32 predefined shooting situations. The camera then makes optimal settings to ensure the best possible image capture, whether you're shooting stills or video. Smart AUTO also includes Advanced Subject Detection, which allows the camera to detect and track non-human moving subjects like animals and vehicles. With Smart AUTO, all you have to do is frame your shot and capture away.\n\nA STEADY IMAGE IS A BEAUTIFUL IMAGE\nINTELLIGENT IS\nThe latest advance in Canon Optical Image Stabilization technology, Intelligent IS, analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation. For stills, the system automatically selects among Normal, Panning, Macro (Hybrid) and Tripod IS modes. When shooting video, the system automatically selects among Dynamic, Powered, Macro and Tripod IS modes. With Intelligent IS, you can concentrate on image capture, letting the camera make the most effective IS settings to assure the steadiest possible image.\n\nNormal Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills. Panning Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement. Macro (Hybrid) Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting. Dynamic Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking. Powered Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified. Tripod When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed. FASTER FOCUS HELPS YOU CAPTURE EVERY SHOT\nHIGH SPEED AF\nThe PowerShot SX160 IS is equipped with Canon's latest advancements in Autofocus (AF) technology. Working on multiple fronts, Canon has developed AF that is significantly faster than on previous models, for a shooting experience that's spontaneous and natural. The extremely responsive High Speed AF lets you capture great shots as they happen, with reduced lag time.\n\nSeveral engineering breakthroughs contributed to this major enhancement to speed. In addition to improved AF algorithms, the camera can process multiple sequences simultaneously, and takes advantage of reworked controls between AF and the start of shooting.\n\nPOWER WHEREVER YOU ARE\nAA BATTERY POWERED\nRecharging batteries can often be an inconvenience, especially when traveling in foreign countries. With the PowerShot SX160 IS, you'll never need special power adapters or chargers because it's powered by two AA batteries that are widely available around the world.\n\nA COLOR JUST RIGHT FOR YOU\nAVAILABLE IN BLACK AND RED\nWhile the classic black camera will always be right for a lot of photographers, Canon recognizes that others will long for colors that express their individuality. Accordingly, the PowerShot SX160 IS digital camera is offered in both black and red.\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\nFACE DETECTION TECHNOLOGY\nFace Detection technology makes it easy for you to take great photos of people. The camera will automatically detect the face(s) in a frame to give it optimal focus, exposure, flash (if needed) and white balance. Face self-timer adds convenience to Face Detection because you can set the camera to release the shutter when someone enters the frame.\n\nSHOOTING MODES\nPowerShot cameras offer shooting modes that make it easy to take perfect photos in a wide range of shooting situations by providing intelligent presets with optimized settings.\n\nSHOOTING MODES/SPECIAL SCENE MODES\nManual You have complete control of exposure, selecting both aperture and shutter speed manually. Aperture-Priority You set the aperture, controlling depth-of-field. The camera automatically selects the shutter speed. Shutter-priority You select the shutter speed to stop or blur action, and the camera finds the appropriate aperture. With slow exposure times, Canon's noise reduction system activates to ensure low image noise. Program Access advanced exposure compensation features while shooting mostly automatically. Smart AUTO The camera automatically selects the best shooting settings for optimal quality based on subjects and environmental factors to provide point-and-shoot simplicity. Portrait The camera sets a large aperture, focusing the subject and artistically blurring the background to make your subject \u201cpop.\u201d Low Light For high quality image capture in an amazing range of dimly-lit situations. Snow Shoot clear snow scenes without darkened subjects or an unnatural bluish tint. Fireworks Grab brilliant images of skyrocketing fireworks. Creative Filters This setting provides easy access to special filter effects and scene modes, such as Toy Camera Effect, Poster Effect, Monochrome and more. Movie Record video in stereo sound. Unwanted scenes can be deleted in playback mode. iFrame Movie The Apple\u00ae movie format, iFrame, makes it easier and quicker to import and upload videos while retaining high image quality. Discreet Mode Disables flash, AF assist beam, and all camera sounds with one mode dial setting\u2014so you can capture images in quiet areas. Live View Control Enables Brightness, Color, and Tone adjustments to your images using easy-to-understand controls. Face Self-timer The camera waits for a face to enter the frame before releasing the shutter. \nSPECIAL SCENE MODES WITH CREATIVE FILTERS\nSpecial Scene Modes have fun and creative filters you can add to your photos without having to use a computer. You can make a quirky portrait using a Fisheye Lens Effect or add a beautiful single-tone effect with Monochrome. Toy Camera Effect simulates a vintage look as if capturing the photo using a \"toy\" or pinhole camera. Make a scene appear like a small-scale model with Miniature Effect, when shooting from a high vantage point. Super Vivid enhances an image for bright, intense colors while Poster Effect alters the contrast of an image for poster-like presentation.\n\nAVAILABLE IN 30 LANGUAGES\nThere are now a total of 30 display languages from which you can choose: English, German, French, Dutch, Danish, Finnish, Italian, Norwegian, Swedish, Spanish, Simplified/Traditional Chinese, Japanese, Russian, Portuguese, Korean, Greek, Polish, Czech, Hungarian, Turkish, Thai, Arabic, Romanian, Ukrainian, Farsi, Hindi, Malay, Indonesian and Vietnamese.",
