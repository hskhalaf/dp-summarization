Even though we live in a mid-seized city (Grand Rapids), there are no service centers that perform warranty work on outdoor Hitachi products within 50 miles. Now I understand how Hitachi can offer a 7 year warranty. It's impossible to utilize.",

The air intake of the blower is on the left side of the blower so if you are wearing relatively loose fitting clothes, it has a tendency to pull your clothing towards the intake. There is a guard keeping the clothing from going into the intake, but your clothing can still block the air flow.",

Make sure the start button is in the right position and it fired right up! Read other reviews. For the money, you can't go wrong!",

I always read the critical reviews and noted several complaints about the cord breaking. The cord seems lighter than other tools. I can imagine how someone could possibly break it but I have started it many times and I'm confident with it. Of course, I hedged my bets by additional warranty which I found to be ridiculously inexpensive. So I have no qualms about the durability.",

      "text": "So far so good. Two months of use 1-3 times per week. Starts on second pull full choke every time when cold (after priming about 7-10 times). Drop the choke immediately and you're off and running. Running Stihl premix exclusively to see if that helps the long term durability of the carb and lines that others have complained about. Will update review if the experience changes. Great performance for the price point. Only negative is this thing vibrates to beat the bandit so plan on your hands being numb or tingly after only a couple minutes of operation. But again, some trade offs for the price point.",
