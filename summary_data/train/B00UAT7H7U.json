      "text": "My Asus G750JS died after 3 years 10 months - extremely disappointed given the almost \u00a31200 price tag. I notice that this model has since been replaced by the G750JZ (same configuration as the JS), but I don't advise buying it, or any of the Asus gaming laptops. In conclusion, you're better off buying a PC gaming tower - gaming laptops suffer the potential fate of the motherboard burning out due to overheating - air cooling is very much better in a tower (there are more fans), thereby reducing this risk. Also you get more for your money with a PC tower: it's half-the-price and all parts are upgradable ...",

Great tec support I have had some software problems where the track-pad stopped working two weeks after buying the laptop but the tec support has offered me a free fix. Speaker are so amazing for a laptop, screen is perfect the laptop looks so much nicer than the pictures make it out. Keyboard is awesome. All in all well built, nice finishes and does everything you would need it to, it's a safe choice and a great machine.",
