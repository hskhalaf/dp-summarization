      "title": "Finally a Tablet that Works!",
      "text": "I had kept buying Kindle Tablets as they were cheap and I couldnt afford them, but started having more issues with them. I finally had enough, saved up, researched and bought this one. My only regret is not doing it sooner! It works incredibly fast, had Mircosoft Works/Excel/PowerPoint, plus I can still access everything I bought on Amazon. I haven't had any issues at all. If need be, I could always get microSD cards to add on to the storage. The sound and picture is phenomenal, better than Kindle and the camera works better as well. It is easier to find things, ,of a things around, and with additional buttons, I'm less confused.",

From a full charge, after just reading a number of web pages, it goes down dramatically, unlike other tablets I have had. Also, it has become progressively more unresponsive, even after rebooting numerous times, and it constantly freezes. It is very hard just to read a few news articles and has become extremely frustrating. Not sure if a factory reset will help but may try.",

Several calls to Samsung provided no relief and the tablet could neither be turned on or off. I received a replacement which worked for about 6 weeks before this happened again.

If I rest the tablet on my chest or stomach, which I always do, the speaker, which is on the bottom, is against my chest or stomach and I can't hear it. Therefore, I have to turn the tablet upside to do that and sometimes it doesn't work as well because the touch screen bottoms are on the top, which sometimes get unknowingly touch. Just put the speak on the top front... Isn't that common sense? Never understood why the speakers on tablets and phones are in such odd, unusable places.",

However, when I went to install the microsd card, the slot would not open. After following the directions, looking online and a call to Samsung, we found a trick. Firstly, use a large paper clip and firmly press in the tiny hole until it clicks. The slot may have released BUT it's almost impossible to grasp it to open. Take a length of thread and slip in under the outside edge of the slot and work it back towards the hole. At that point, it should be possible to lever it open. Worked for us.",

Perfect for net surfing and the fingerprint sensor is incrredibly convenient for logging into sites. Chrome doesn't integrate with fingeprint readers, so I basically never use chrome on this tablet.

At first I wasn't a fan of briefing, the app present when you swipe right on the home screen, but that is changing. Do notice that when I have a lot of apps open it gets a little warm, but not uncomfortably. I'll post back her if I have problems. Enjoy!",
