I used to shove everything in the seat pocket in front of me and have been thinking about getting something like this for some time. Look at my picture, I can't believe this is what would have been on the floor or in the seat pocket in front of me. It holds baby's bottle of milk, my dunkin donuts coffee, 2 year old's orange juice cup, apple sauce packets, water bottle, baby's sippy cup. What you can't see are the puzzles, notepad, wristlet, snack bars, and so many other things for the car ride!",

She is not kind to it- she shoves crayons and markers and papers in every pocket, she kicks it, and through all of that it is simply a little bit dirty from all the colored pencil shavings and crayons. I am purchasing another for my boyfriend's new truck to protect his seat backs from her merciless dirty shoes! :)",

The straps fit the seat well and do not leave the organizer looking droopy, it sits snugly against the back of the seat even with a fair amount of baby items inside. I also liked that you couldn't see the straps from the front of the seat when it's on.I was concerned it would be a bother while I was driving, having a plastic clip poking me or catching my hair. But they tuck neatly into the cracks of the seat.",

So regular DVD holders wouldn't work. Seems to work so far but if I had another 2 inches on top strap it would be perfect! I do like it and would recommend.",

I also used the spot between the organizer and the seat as a large pocket. This saved our life. The dual DVD play fit right above it too!

However, it still helps to get her stuff off of the floor, to keep the car neat, and she enjoys watching a movie or show on the iPad on a long car ride. We look forward to her being able to reach the organizer herself when she gets bigger and is using a booster.",
