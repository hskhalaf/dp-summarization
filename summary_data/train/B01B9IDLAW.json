I shopped around and returned a Samsung to get this one which is much better.

It was also relatively easy to set this monitor up to act as two independent monitors which was necessary so that I could also work on one side while having a full screen preview on the other (the reason for two monitors to begin with.) The video quality of this monitor is excellent and it came set up correctly as determined by color bars. The resolution is quite good. Overall, I am very pleased.",

I had to use a combination of \"Display Menu\" for $2 and SwitchRes X for $15.00. I set it up in SwitchResX and then suddenly 2560x1080 @ 50 hz was available in Display Menu. Once set up it's sharp and really good.",

I thought it was a software bug or maybe the video card was dying on my Mac mini as it is five years old. I would have to repeatedly turn the LG monitor off and on, and eventually it would all work properly. But, then after about six weeks of acting up, the LG just refused to ever start up again. Very sad story. So, when you amortize the cost, this monitor was about 3x more expensive than my previous monitor, for which I paid $1,000.",

I use it with a keyboard drawer. It might move a bit too much if used with a keyboard directly on the desk.Hope this helps.",
