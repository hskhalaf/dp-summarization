Just be mindful of the weight when loading and unloading as the bike can become unsteady while using the kickstand. Bottom line, they make my trip to the grocery much easier, and more productive.

I have resolved to make Grocery trips on bike this Spring and these are a big help. Great construction. The only bad thing I have to say about these is that I wish the clips were more rounded so they would hang more securely on the rack.",
