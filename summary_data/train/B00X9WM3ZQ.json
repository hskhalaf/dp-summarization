While searching on Amazon we found this one. It was perfect. Came with everything she needed. The bag is flimsy. I fully expect that to wear out fast. Since the guitar is so cheap expect to have to tune it regularly if not every time you play. I don\u2019t mind. It\u2019s good practice for her. We are very pleased with the guitar.

Still, after all was said and done the guitar managed to be playable. In retrospect, dishing out 30-40$ more would get you a better guitar.",

First, nylon strings are easier for a child/beginner as the metal is a bit \"sharp\" on the fingers. And second, it's so cheaper than any other. Third better for to go with a guitar that is too small than too large .No question these were good calls, he's doing very well with this guitar and I enjoy playing it as well.",

The saddle is also flat and straight, resulting in too much space between the high strings and the fretboard. My 10-year-old daughter has been super frustrated learning on this high action. I supposed this is what you get for mass-produced budget guitars from the factory. To address this, when I replaced the strings, I sanded the saddle down 2mm on the bass strings and 3mm on the treble strings. Now the action is where it should be, and my daughter is enjoying learning more.",
