I am a veterinarian and was able to remove the obstruction but seeing her in a state of panic, not able to breathe, furiously pawing at her mouth, and turning purple was absolutely traumatizing. I thought the first time was because she tried to eat the bone whole, but the second time I realized that the bone starts disintegrating and becoming gummy, which then got stuck of the back of her mouth and she couldn\u2019t swallow it. I will never give these treats again and hope no one else does either!",

I would normally only give half if I were unsure about a treat, but they're too hard to snap so she ends up getting the whole thing. There haven't been any tummy issues so I guess it's all good. The chihuahua is usually hesitant to go for it, but as soon as he sees my girl start in on hers, he'll start in on his. Again, no tummy issues from these so all seems well. They seem a little big for a 20lb chihuahua, but they're the perfect size for a 35lb terrier.",
