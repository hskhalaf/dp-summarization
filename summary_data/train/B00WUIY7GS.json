Seems like it will rip extremely easily but for the price compared to most other ones that are really expensive it doesn't really matter. Opening is only on one side so more of a mosquito net than a 4 corners canopy- just like the pics. I added a set of battery operated LED Star lights (just set them on top) for the perfect princess bed. :)",

You get romance and privacy, and if you happen to run out of toilet paper, you have something to use instead of your shirt or sock. Overall great product.",
