Over 150 homes flooded in our subdivision, so we felt we really had to go all out this spring in an effort to bring normalcy back. Seed Needs had the bulk seeds we needed, and they arrived in just a few days, perfect for our usual planting day. We will definitely use this supplier from now on. PEK from Texas",

The tops of these flowers are often times white to pale yellow. Texas Bluebonnet, as well as other Lupinus flowers are known to attract an array of beneficial insects, such as butterflies, bumblebees, ladybugs & hummingbirds as well. Texas Bluebonnets are best sown in masses for an amazing sea of colorful, deep blue blooms that last through the summer months.
