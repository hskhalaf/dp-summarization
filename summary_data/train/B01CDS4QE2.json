I'm not sure how long the stencils will retain their stickiness once they have been used, but I think they could be used at least a few times over and the kit came with quite a few of them anyway. The kit also came with fine gold and silver glitter which she loved. I'm ordering a second kit for my other granddaughter.",

The stencils are great, the quality of paint is excellent (just a drop or two of water gets it activated). I think we ended up painting both cheeks, arms, forearms, and I painted my own arm for practice. It didn't crack, it didn't rub off easily, nor did it irritate the skin (I have very sensitive skin). I would definitely order again.",

There are even 2 tubs of glitter that she can use for pixie dust. In addition to variety, this paint is smooth and goes on easily. It also lasts all evening and doesn\u2019t easily rub off.

Students loved it because the results turned out well and the colors were vibrant. Parents loved it because it washed off easily.

I have recommended it to my fellow face painters and will continue to buy from you because of the following reasons, 1) it stayed on the childrens faces for the duration of both festivals even with them sweating 2) when it came time to remove the face paint it came off very easily 3) the paint was not sticky nor did it clump up. Thank you very much for such a great product!",
