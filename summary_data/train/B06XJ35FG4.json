This works perfect. You just have to put it on your forehead for a second and it grabs the temperature so quickly! I do like that you can also take the top off and able to use the tempature in the ear, however I think my go to method is going to be the forehead. Thanks for making taking care of a sick kid a little less painless!",

Company is a total scam!! Don't waste your money! Ear and forehead temperatures are always way off. Took my forehead temperature swiping from one temple to the other and it said 98.4, took temperature in my ear and it was 101.4. Hasn't been accurate since we've bought it.. complete waste of money. Only good thing is the LED screen is easy to read.",

I can check myself and get anything from 97.3 to 101.4 depending on the angle. Wish I could trust it because it is hard to take the temperature of a wiggly, sick baby.",

Also, my whole house got the flu and it was very efficient and worked well as I had to take 6 peoples temperature multiple times a day.
