It did that for the first couple sessions, then one good wave and I'm swimming back to shore to get my board. And of course it broke a few days after the return window. Total waste of money.",

UPDATE: the leash has now snapped at the cord (fastest I've ever broken a leash), and the lifetime warranty apparently no longer exists. BOTTOM LINE: probably a good buy if you aren't a serious surfer. Otherwise, spend the extra money to get a better product from a company like Dakine or FCS.",
