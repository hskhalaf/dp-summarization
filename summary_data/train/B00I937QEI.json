I just swab it out and toss it in the dishwasher and it's all good. It comes in a fancy box too, I don't care about that personally but it would make for a cute gift. Overall a good product that I would recommend.",

Surprisingly, this device squirts back far more garlic than any other press I\u2019ve seen in 40 years. Big gaps between the crusher plate and the walls of the chamber.

After purchasing this, I came across a different design in Macy's, where it includes a small device with multiple prongs to clean the holes. I wish this one has it too. Also, I wish the levers were longer so that people with weaker arms can use it too. The garlic peeler does work pretty well.",

The press is different from the usual designs in that the press area where you load the garlic actually swings freely from both the upper and lower handles which makes cleaning easier. It is just large enough (still small enough to conveniently store) to give you good leverage to apply to the press which makes fast work of getting your pressed garlic. All the fittings and joints look very sturdy. I expect it to last many years though I can't say for sure because I've only been using it (frequently) for a few months.",

In addition, the seller was wonderful and sent an introductory letter that contained directions for use of both products. Highly professional service and outstanding products.

I must mention, that when pressing the clove(s) some crushed garlic does stick to the sides, but again what sticks is already crushed and can be emptied straight into the bowl as is - no need to recrush - so I don't see a problem there. All-in-all this is a great quality product and I highly recommend it.",

More even than most cookware, it's important to clean it before left-over elements dry onto it, due to small holes and corners. The peeler doesn't solve things as well as I'd like, though it's much better than trying to peel without it. Plus, it is usually superfluous if you're using the press. Now I use much more garlic!",

This leaves the garlic cloves squirting up the sides a bit.

We didn't like the press. Too many swinging parts. It was hard to clean out all of the small places where the garlic was pressed into. There are other options with cleaners built into the handle which have tines on them to fit into all of the little holes and push the unpressed garlic out. It makes it way easier. Running the press under water as you are cleaning out the peels helps.",
