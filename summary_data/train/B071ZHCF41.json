Not much of a gamer or overclocker, but all the tools are there when you're ready. The LED lighting has unlimited flexibility with the AURA software and is bound to be a case modder's best friend. Onboard audio is very listenable. Maybe not audiophile quality but more than good enough for movies and TV. If you're wanting a $200 board for your AMD Ryzen, this one deserves a look.
