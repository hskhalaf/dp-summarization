But I'm making an exception with this because I am extremely pleased with this item! It arrived practically overnight, superb packaging and instructions, It was easy to quick start, too! Extra batteries, extra pads.....and it absolutely does the trick. I am confident it will expedite the healing of the back strain I experienced when I lifted something that was much too heavy. I will also use this routinely for other aches and soreness that I've begun to feel now that I am entering my \"golden\" years.",

I put the unit in my jeans pocket and place the pads in the appropriate spots so I can get relief from shoulder, neck or back pain throughout the day. Catching the pain early and perhaps running up to three/15 minute sessions will often eliminate the pain completely. I still like to go to a chiropractor occasionally but I don't often pay for him to use his tens unit. I can save money over time that way. I recommend this unit.",

You can adjust the strength of the pulses; however, the higher levels feel more like painful shocks to me. I'm also not a fan of the pulse settings - one is like little zaps of electricity.

The only issue is that my wife tried it out on a problem area she is having with her thigh and I hardly can get it from her. Two separate packs of the 4 electrodes come with the unit so she has a set of her own. I would recommend this tens unit to all.",
