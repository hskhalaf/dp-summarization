Second, this is well made (double walled, strong, dent and scratch resistant. Third- I got no end of compliments. (I saw it at a friend's place, thought it was fancy, Looked for cheaper ones. Then splurged.) This really brings durabilty, and a clean look, to any bathroom, kitchen, etc and - satinelss steel. My friend's hasn't rusted etc, and is dent free after years of use. Still shiny and bright, and easy to clean and sanitize. Worth the small splurge.",
