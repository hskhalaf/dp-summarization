      "text": "Just set up the egg chair to put inside my house. It is larger than I expected and quite comfortable. The egg is supported by metal bars with rattan/fake wood weavings, which is a relief since I wasn't sure how sturdy the chair would be. I'm 5'5\" and 130lbs, I feel like I could tuck my legs in and still be comfortable. The chain can rotate pretty much 360 degrees although the back pole will block you if you swing all the way around. The chair came in two boxes, one for the swing and one for the chair. It was very easy to set up, took my brother and I maybe 15 minutes total.",

I also ordered a swivel drink holder and added it so I am super thrilled.",
