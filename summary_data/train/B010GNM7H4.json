What I really want to find is old Rieke hand pump, but I have not seen any on Amazon. Perhaps, this is a good product, and I just got a bad one, but VirVentures should consider whether or not they want to continuing selling this product.",

With the way today's gas cans are made, trying to even fill the lawnmower is a hassle, and gas ends up spilling everywhere, which kind of negates the point to the \"safety\" gas cans. This device makes it all super easy. I typically keep about 20 gallons of gas on hand for the mower, generator, etc., and even to fill up the car in a pinch. Having this pump makes it all super easy, and the auto shutoff makes it even better...just put in the nozzle, turn it on, and it shuts off when the tank is full. Love it!

I personally live off the grid and I've had three major heart attacks so I can't lift a lot and this thing is awesome and works just as it's advertised in fact it works fantastic. Also as advertised it's 100 percent waterproof and moisture proof. Why this is I live on the coast of Oregon where it rains pretty much all the time and very damp. This device is holding up great inside the dog house with the generator which is outside. I personally recommend this device for anybody who has trouble lifting heavy gas cans.",

I suspect it is a quality control issue with the microprocessor board but not certain. Anyhow it not that expensive of pump but they should be more reliable. Buyer beware.",
