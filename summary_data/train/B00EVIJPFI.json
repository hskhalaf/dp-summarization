Sprayed it on let it soak for 4 minutes not letting it dry then rinsed with water only one application and the aluminum looks like new. I tried it on the corner of the large Lowe boat decal and had no discoloration so did entire boat with NO damage to decals just a bright aluminum finish. Delivered on time very well packaged. Great product recommend it to everybody. I also used it on a set of 10\" wide old school slotted rims for my hotrod and they look like new. Incredible product.",

      "text": "Got a new pontoon boat and wanted to clean and polish the pontoons. This product seemed like the perfect product made for pontoons. It Cleaned the pontoons but etches the aluminum. When I went to polish the pontoons they were covered in oxidation!!! To polish the pontoons it takes approximately 50 towels and is very hard to penetrate the oxidation and polish. The towels turn black immediately, making the job extremely tedious and time consuming. After 3 hours I only got a two ft. section top to bottom Polished. I called a boat detailing co to finish the job. This may be OK for old boats but it will take a weekend to polish!!!",

Some elbow grease required, for sure, but not nearly as much as I thought I was going to have to put into the job. After spraying on the aluminum and giving it a once-over with a, I let the section sit for about 4 minutes before hosing it down and scrubbing once more.

If you choose to use this product I would recommend goggles or a face shield, chaps to protect your legs, full arm- length gloves and a breathing apparatus designed for corrosive substances.
