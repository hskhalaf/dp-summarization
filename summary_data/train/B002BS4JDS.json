I have been playing video games since I was young, and this game was something I thought would interest her (since it's Harry Potter), but also be able to play together on the local co-op. We are about halfway through this game, and are looking forward to years 5-7. The only drawback I see is that the characters don't speak real words (more like just sounds), but yet that makes it more fun. I think people any age could enjoy this game if they enjoy the Lego world or the Harry Potter world.",

But Lego HP is by far my favorite video game (aside from Super Mario Brothers 3). We now own this for Wii, Xbox, and PS3 for reasons I'm not entirely sure, but we're set!",

The game took us about a week or so to beat so it has a decent amount of gameplay. It has some replay value as there are secrets you can only find if you have done almost everything.",

It's a really fun game. I do have to say the next game which is years 5-7 is much better. But I suggest buying both and playing them for family game night.",

Only con was that the game was a little glitchy. It froze on us 10+ times throughout which was really annoying. But overall, a great game!

The only reason i gave it 4 stars overall is because it can get a little glitchy. All my problems seemed to work out by turning off the xbox and starting it up again.

The 2 player mode is better then the Lego Star Wars because it splits the screen if the other player is behind or trying to figure something out, instead of it forcing you both to be on the same screen.
