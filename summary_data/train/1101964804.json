I bought the Zero Sugar diet book at the same time (that book I like) The recipes are NOT bad ones, just they require A LOT of different ingredients. I think its because so many different people contributed their recipes, there is a wide variety. I love the variety, but I don't want to have to buy a paste or 3 different spices that are only used in 1 recipe in the book. If your on a budget it gets very costly.",

I didn't get it for the commentary or other instructions, just the recipes. Every recipe we have tried has been really good, and it does not feel like we are being deprived. We use it mostly for dinners but carb cravings have all but stopped! A few of the recipes I have made multiple times are vegetable lasagna, chicken tacos, vegetable tartlets, marinated shrimp on oats, plus the salad dressing, pesto and mayo. Looking forward to getting the other Zero Belly recipe books.",
