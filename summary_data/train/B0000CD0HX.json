As some have complained, there is a bit too much space between the hopper sides and the perforated plate, so some larger bits of garlic squeeze out the sides. I don't know why the tolerances cannot be made closer by the manufacturer, given the overall quality of the unit. I put mine in a bench vise and squeezed the hopper sides in a bit until there is no space to the sides of the perforated plate, and it works better, now. The leverage of the handles and pressure plate is really wonderful, and makes squeezing garlic a breeze compared to standard units.",

I'll chalk it up to familiarization issues on my part for now, but will wait to see if I can learn the \"proper\" way to use it.

Many times, they're terrible to clean out and thus end up messier and messier until they're abandoned. This one is different - the press flips out easily and can be cleaned with a single swipe of the finger. The metal hinge is extremely durable, and the whole device fits perfectly in the hand. There's a small risk for people with very large hands of pinching one's hand but after some use it's easily to avoid this with safe hand positioning. If you need to produce larger amounts of garlic, this is your tool.",

Very please with the quality of workmanship! Solid state, stainless, will provide (hopefully) years of use. I'm learning... to just buy a much better kitchen tool, whether an egg slicer or cheese slicer, just read reviews and invest a bit more, it saves in the long run.",

I have spent $10-$15 on many presses before that did a terrible job so I figured I would never have to buy another one with this one! I love it! I always hand wash and dry it to make sure it stays new looking. What little leftover garlic remains can be easily lifted out for washing.",

I have not yet tried it with ginger root, but am sure I will soon as it is advertized to work well pressing ginger. The only small quibble is that the basket sometines pops up when loading garlic, but this is the feature that also makes for easy cleaning.",

For many recipes, I prefer the pressed garlic to garlic that is chopped by hand or in a food processor. This press makes that much easier to do. It is not as quite as easy to clean as my last one, but it is not all that hard. Over all, it makes for less work in the kitchen.",
