I believe both have played equal roles in GREATLY declining the redness from my KP, and helping to get my pores smoothing. Bumps are still able to be felt, but are much less visible and overall this soap improved my skin health. Will be buying the lotion when it\u2019s back in stock. I love Touch! I can\u2019t believe I paid for 60$ wipes from my dermatologist that didn\u2019t even work, when these two products work so well!! Great light scent too.",

If you have extremely sensitive skin, this might be too strong for you. However, nothing seems to work on my hearty skin so this was a breakthrough for me. Sometimes I will leave it on about 30 seconds and then gently scrub. Highly recommend for stubborn KP",
