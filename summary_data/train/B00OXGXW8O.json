It's sleekness, easy to use total customize able control is what separates this from its competitors. I started grinding my own coffee recently and wow the uniformity of the cut truly makes all the difference! Love the product and brand! :)",

      "text": "Had it for almost a year now and it's been a great grinder. It can be a bit finicky getting it dialed in but once we got it dialed in we just don't touch it and it's good to go. But for the price it's got a ton of features - everything we need. The noise level seems about average for a grinder - maybe even on the quieter side - but we still installed it inside a cupboard so that it's even quieter when making early morning espresso. We're using it with the Breville Bambino and a non-pressurized portafilter. For the price, it seemed to be the best deal around when I was looked a year ago.",
