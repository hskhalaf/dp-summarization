I would say a 3 year up to maybe 12 years old for this",

The screw on the battery compartment doesn't fit properly, causing the batteries to fall out on the ground while riding. We've duct taped the battery compartment cover closed, used a liquid threader to try to keep the screw in, then used a longer screw. Now that the screw is staying in, the lights still shut off. So with the compartment closed, there is still an issue with the battery connectivity. Also, the front wheel shifts and turns on its own, which is a safety issue. It's a cool-looking scooter that would be fun to use otherwise.",
