First thing you will notice is the build quality is solid and feels welll made, the touch screen responds flawlessly and is nice and bright, front screen is not touchscreen but it\u2019s very useful, battery life is very good and there are many accessories you can buy like filters and mounts. Image quality is fantastic and smooth, HDR works very well in low lit conditions, I can\u2019t think of any cons about this so if your looking for the best action camera on the market 2019 this is it.

The video recordings were pretty good although not on par with the Osmo Pocket. I was also not that impressed with the \u2018Rock Steady\u2019 feature... again it\u2019s not as good as the mechanical gimbal on the Osmo Pocket.",
