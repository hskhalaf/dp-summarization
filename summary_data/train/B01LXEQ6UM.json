Glad I'm not much taller, otherwise I would have to bend over anyways to use this shovel while holding both D-handles. Seems well built for the most part (made in China if that matters) and does make it easier on my back. Time will tell how tough the aluminum metal edge will stay on plastic shovel edge though, being there's no sturdy rivets attaching that. It's just pressed on with 5 small dimples into metal, only on one side, to hold it onto the plastic shovel edge. Hmmm....",

The aluminum edge is sharp enough to cut through crusty snow, but it's not dangerously sharp like a sword or anything. It seems to glide well over ice and concrete without being too snaggy or clingy. The bolt and wingnut on the main handle allow for disassembly, but not length adjustment. My digital bath scale says it weighs about 3.6 lbs. This is a well-designed and well-built product made of premium materials. I believe it will last for many seasons.",

I owned it through one very mild, little-snow winter, and then started to use when it snowed this winter. Very quickly, the metal edge detached itself, and won't stay attached. Not very useful with just a plastic edge. Sorry for this late review, but when the shovel fell apart a few months ago, reviews were disabled for this product! (That's one way to avoid poor reviews...

But if it were me, I would probably order a different one with a better blade at the bottom. The extra handle is nice for when you are flinging the snow somewhere but it doesn't really help on the shoveling piece.",

The forward handle gives you better leverage. After several heavy Colorado snowfalls, it has shown to be sturdy enough to not only use in a traditional manner, but also to invert it and use as a scraper for compacted snow.",

The scoop is also just as flimsy and makes shoveling up broken ice damned near impossible (talking 1/2 and inch or so thick here). The handle is just as weak and after seeing other reviews I wish I had dug into them a little more before purchasing. Save your money and buy a much better one pretty much anywhere else.",
