Had to use a small tool to pull it out. I like the flip-up extender, but it should snap in place once you flip it down for use. I have to keep holding it with one hand because it moves up and down instead of remaining locked in place.",

Then after about one year the 110 volt wall charger quit working. I then replaced it with another charger. The vac lasted about another 6 months and finally died.

The new Dirt Devil did come with one attachment that my old model did not have. My take away is that the manufacturer was trying to save money on production costs.",

      "text": "I bought this on may the 11th. In the handful of times I have used it I have been disappointed to say the least. This thing loses suction after about 5 passes on ANY kind of dirt. Spent more time taking it apart(spilling half what I just picked up)to get whatever is clogging the TINY holes around the filter. When I FINALLY am about 80% finished with my tiny job the battery runs out for a total of about 7-10min of actual run time(sustained run time of about 4 min). I'm not 3 days past my \"Return\" date so I'm S.O.L.. All I can do it try to warn u all not to waste ur money",
