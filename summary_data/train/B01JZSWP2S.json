      "text": "Loved this chair at first. Comfortable and large enough for a person 6' 3\" and 225 lbs. The problem I have is in the construction. The frame at the top-middle of the backrest is double-jointed. There is a piece of plastic that covers the joint, and only bends one one. The piece snagged on the fabric during bagging and snapped. With back frame without the plastic to firm the joint the frame basically folds during use. Which is to say the chair is unusable. Bought it because of the number of recommendations, so I must be one of the few that had this happen. Regardless, it happened and exposed what I believe to be a design flaw that is unfixable.",
