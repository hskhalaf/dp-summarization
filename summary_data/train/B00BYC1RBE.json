It was a hot day.. she went in the water and had a good time and even though I forgot to reapply I must say this sunscreen gave her amazing coverage for the rest of the evening. I forgot to put my badger sunscreen in my bag and when I came back it wasn\u2019t there anymore! Someone liked it so much, they took it haha. It\u2019s a good thing but not so good for me because I have to buy another one lol. But, It\u2019s worth it because it\u2019s organic, safe, and most importantly, EFFECTIVE!

I look like a pasty ghost after I put this on, even if I work hard at rubbing it in. If I ever tried to put this on without a mirror at hand, I think I would really look like I was trying to put on some kind of costume face paint. But, I'm giving it 5 stars anyway because I've come to the conclusion after trying over 17 different sunscreen brands that this just comes with the territory of being a non-nano mineral sunscreen.",

Pros: This sunscreen smells absolutely amazing! Orange-vanilla scent. I was a tad bit worried about the scent and attracting pest but so far it has not attracted any pest, including bees. No chemical scent. A tiny pea size amount will allow me to cover my babies expose skin. No \"holding\" of the breath. Cons: A little on the thick side. Expensive in mine opinion for the size of the tube. Must be reapplied every 40 minutes and must be applied 20 minutes before going outside.",

In fact we prefer the scent-free cream as it is more versatile-- the scent, though pleasant, can limit its applications. Pros: - Ingredients are simple and presumably safe. - Did not irritate kids' skin as some other sun-blocks have. - The unscented version can also double as a rash-cream, as it is a zinc-oxide paste. Cons: - Requires more liberal application to be effective. One family member developed a blistering sunburn on tips of ears before we realized this. - Costly. I expect we will use this product again next summer, mindful of the need to apply more of it, more frequently, to vulnerable areas.",

The one positivie I can think of is that I feel the greasiness lends to it being more durable and water resistant while i'm in the pool. I will say it's not the worst of the \"safe\" sunscreens i've tried. To date, Trukid takes that honor, ever seen the movie \"Powder\"?",

With allergies to most major brands in the box stores, I did some research on the ewg website and ordered a tube of badger and think baby sunscreens. This was the winner! I don't hate the smell, but it does make them smell like orange cream push up pops and can be overwhelming on your 6th application of the day. But nobody has had a rash and we are on tube three this summer. Win!",
