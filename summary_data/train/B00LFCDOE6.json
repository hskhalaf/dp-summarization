I wear 7.5 size shoes, and I own many pairs of regular Birkenstock sandals that are 38 medium/wide (the outlined footprint on the cork). However, I buy size 39 Birkenstock hiking boots. For Crocs I purchase size 8. After searching a bit, I realized that there are no WIDE size 38 or 39 for these sandals, and one reviewer incorrectly said that these are not adjustable. I purchased size 38, and though these are called narrow, they are very comfortable for my wide feet. I did not need to adjust the buckles, but I could if desired. I'm very happy with my purchase!",

I've had them for 3 or 4 weeks and worked outside, use inside house as my lounge shoes and use them for my walks around beach and countryside.

      "text": "My husband needs something in the house that is comfortable on this feet and used to wear the leather regular Birkenstocks. He is so hard on shoes because of the way he walks that we are always buying Birks and specially made sneakers. So when I saw these at around $25 we decided to try them. As long as one thinks of them as slippers or beach or gardening sandals, you will be very happy. I have many, many pairs of Birkenstocks. It is a brand I trust and here in AZ we must have sandals! The Arizona model just happens to be the most versatile, so I have lots of them.",

They are almost as comfortable as my regular Birks but have held up amazingly and don't absorb my embarrassing foot odor (that have ruined countless pair of classic birks). The only slight negative is that because of the material, the footbed is more flexible and if you catch the toe wrong the shoe will bend like a flip flop. But I wear these daily, indoor and out and really REALLY like them.",

The inside sole has it's own molding, not like leather Birks which will mold to you, when I first put them on in the morning it can be a little off, but over the course of the day it improves.

For all the noise around about Birkenstock\u2019s- I believe these are probably not the most comfortable- (my first pair of birks) but I think the cork based pairs must be more comfortable. These rubbed blisters on the top of my foot and with little flexibility as you walk you have zero arch support and actual restriction.. unless you make them so lose they don\u2019t touch the top of the foot at all- but then what\u2019s the point in that? If they\u2019re for the beach or short time periods they are ok. But better than using plastic & I\u2019d choose eco friendly over anything",
