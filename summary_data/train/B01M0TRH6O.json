My only complaint, which I've seen mentioned in other reviews, is that the bottom of the wedge seems like it would be uncomfortable to sleep on as baby wiggles down throughout the night (which mine seem to do a lot) and their head ends up on this part of the wedge by morning. Regardless, using this along with the Baby Merlin Magic Sleep Suits has been nothing short of amazing for the crib transition and my twins are sleeping 10-12 hours at night without waking up once. The gift of uninterrupted sleep for babies and parents is priceless!",
