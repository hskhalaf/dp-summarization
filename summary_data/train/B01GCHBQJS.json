They're very similar and I give them both 5 stars. As you can see from the pictures the Nioposi tends to have a more rounded top, but both are flexible and shape can conform to the contents. If I need some more I might get the DerBlue ones because I like the way they naturally take on a more square shape. I highly recommend using bags like this for storing and charging your batteries.",
