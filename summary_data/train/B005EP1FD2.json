Have done two twenty mile hikes in the Pisgah National forest and one 30 mile backpacking trip on the Mountain to sea Trail. They felt amazing! Only one hot spot on my heel formed that I contribute to choice of thinner socks. Wish they breath a little better. Feet got fairly warm a few times. Soles of the boots still look brand new and havehdld very well this far. I'm 6', weight 300 and distribute most of my weight tho the outside heel area of my feet so I go through shoes fairly fast but feel these will last me for a few years.",

This is why I like Vasque shoes. They were comfortable from the first wearing. The only drawback is that this particular style is warm. It is all leather and waterproof. My foot heats up.",

He wears these shoes from morning to night. He doesn't take his shoes off until he is getting ready for bed. He's had them for 3 months now and they are still in perfect condition. They are very durable, and provide him with great traction. He works in construction, so he is not easy on them.",

They asked that I ship them the boots. About 10 days later we received a free pair even though our one year warranty had expired. Love the customer service!
