Handle is polymer and head is metal(less than 1/8\" thick. ) it isnt too heavy and should not be a problem for carrying it on foot. I made a case for mine so i can just lash it to my belt. So far very happy.",

I bought it for him, but I've found it more useful than I imagined. When you're down on your knees in a flower bed and need something more than a trowel, you'd be surprised how many times a shovel like this will get the job done and save you from having to stand up to go get a full-sized shovel. Surprisingly sturdy and well-made given the price.",

Great for the large container gardener as well as the raised bed gardener. Love my little shovel",
