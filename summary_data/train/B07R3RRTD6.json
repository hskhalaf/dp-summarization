I really loved that it came with hand wraps and most importantly, a step by step guide on how to wrap your hands. The varying weights and material of the balls keeps things interesting. The only critique I have it that the string connecting the ball to the headband is pretty long and while it was still usable, I wish it was adjustable.",

Just need to make sure you tie the knots on properly or else the objects can fly off and the whiplash of the elastic can sting quite a bit. As long as you know that the elastic or ball can and will hit your eye/face to time to time. Then this is perfect! It\u2019s fun and challenging.

Kind of fun once you get going and get several hits in a row but it's tricky. I think wearing some type of light boxing glove would make it easier because if you go bare knuckle like me, your bones and such send the ball in all sorts of different directions. I'll keep trying it some more and maybe wrap my hands next time.",
