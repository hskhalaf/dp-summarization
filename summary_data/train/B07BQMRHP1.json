This one also burns through batteries rather quickly. Regardless of whether they are being used, they kill batteries in about 1 day if the switch is left in the on postion.....even in standby. Maybe the fact that the unicorn horn lights up impacts battery life as well. My daughter is 4, and she really likes this silly thing. However, there is only so much she can do with it, so she will probably lose interest soon.",

So isn't that all we want? Kids to have fun and run around in groups to play? For me, that is what I wanted! This was a donation to a foster home and it was a hit. SO even though I don't \"get\" this toy, even if you don't \"get it\" either, just buy it! It's fun for the right age group, just comply with the guidelines and watch the kids have fun :)",
