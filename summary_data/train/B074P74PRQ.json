I have played over 20 rounds with it and tonight went back to my Callaway; from the first hole noticeably more distance and as I played on more consistency.",

I have a nasty slice that I have to over correct for with an exaggerated strong grip to get it to go straight, but my distance suffers because the grip prevents a free-flowing swing. With this club, my first four hits I just went to a neutral grip and let rip. I have never hit it so straight and so far four times in a row. Went on to hit a bucket of balls and only about one in ten still had my slice, but it was a much tamer slice slightly right, not the wicked bow curve I usually have. MAGIC DRIVER !",

The new HiBore Crown promotes higher ball speed through the crown flexing at impact and a desirable high-launch, low-spin trajectory from a lower center-of-gravity. Unique Flex-Fins compress at impact transferring more energy back to the ball for longer distances, especially on heel and toe impacts. New Launcher Cup-Face creates higher COR across the entire face for unmatched balls speed and distance. Ultra-lightweight hosel design redistributes weight low and deep for a higher launch and more forgiveness.",
