The two best features of the chair are that it reclines in 3 different positions and 1 flat position for easy storage/travel and that you can flip the grey fabric part around to convert it into a toddler chair- that makes both my kids over the moon happy!! I opted not to purchase the Baby Bjorn activity bar but bought the Tiny Love Take-Along Arch, My Nature Pals Stroll activity bar for $25 instead.",

Kitchen, laundry room, dining room, bathroom. We have one upstairs and one downstairs. Initially I balked at the price but I would definitely buy it again. It washes up very easily and is well made.

My 4month old loves it. I take it everywhere restaurants family trips. Ive been through 4 bouncers in 3 yrs and finally ive found the best useful one of all. The 3 levels of height is the best my son sleeps lower level and chills watching tv on 2nd level and i even feed him on the highest level. He sits up. Highly recommended. Price is high but its worth it.",

Just knocked one star off for the weight limit! I guess I expected it to hold a heavier child since it\u2019s marketed to toddlerhood in the toddler mode. 20 pounds to toddler is a huge jump.",

Cons - my major dislike is the mesh part that goes in between child\u2019s legs. The mesh is really rough and seems to rub child\u2019s (newborn) legs more than a softer fabric or canvas would. I would suggest they consider covering just this part of bouncer with another fabric or adding soft boarders as the mesh seems unnecessary on that part of bouncer.",

Super easy to remove and throw in the wash for cleaning.",

It ended up being a soy intolerance that caused his gas but regardless he LOVES spending time in this chair and I would buy it again.

Sometimes twins get hungry at the same time while mommy is alone with them. And then what? I would sit mine in their bouncy chairs and feed them at the same time.
