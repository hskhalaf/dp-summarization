This looked good and solid but after wearing them for almost an hour had to go with ii. And that might also explain the pricing ( ii was more than iii at the time of purchase).",

As far as other features go, the laces are good quality and the boots do appear to be decently waterproof up to about the tongue heel. I haven't tested beyond that point :) However, these will be exactly what I wanted them for - shoveling snow and pushing the snow blower.",

      "text": "Overall these are probably the best winter boots I've owned. I wore them on a winter camping trip last week. They provided good traction while I was dragging a sled, worked well with my snowshoes, and kept my feet warm all day. The width is a bit snug, but that is partially due to me wearing heavy wool socks and liner socks. If in doubt, go up half a size. Definitely recommend. I will buy another pair whenever I wear these out.",

They are comfortable enough to wear throughout the day, but because they are waterproof they don't breath well (as expected). They kept my feet warm without wearing thick socks. I walked through some water covering the toe of this boot and my feet stayed completely dry. I like the styling of these over all the other Columbia boots. Extremely pleased with this purchase!",

They just seem to rub and become unpleasant to wear for some reason and I've never had this issue with other boots.

The snow hasn't come yet, but these paired with some nice wool socks keeps my feet nice and toasty in the cold. The out-sole is super tacky (not bad looking, but sticky) due to the soft rubber compound. Like winter tires, the rubber is softer to allow for better traction in the snow. It's a stiffer boot in the ankle, but doesn't go up high enough that it causes problems with mobility. They don't look too bad either!",
