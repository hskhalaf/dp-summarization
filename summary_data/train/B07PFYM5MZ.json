Marvell-based switch, 88E6190X for the 1G ports, and 2x 88X3310P for the 10G ports. PCB is clean, only 1 electrolytic cap (power supply side), so it's likely to last forever. Why not 5 stars? The heatsink on top of the 10G chipsets was not seated properly, it was merely hovering (kudos to Marvell, their chip didn't turn to ashes despite the lack of proper cooling). Removed the stock thermal paste (was completely dry), replaced it with some Noctua NT-H2, and re-installed the heatsink properly. Disappointing quality control. Included some tech nudes, if that's what you're into.",

But as that gets filled, I may have to take a file to the faceplate. Overall, it's a mild irritation, but something that should be really easy to prevent during manufacturing. Otherwise, the switch works well, doesn't make any noise, and comes with everything needed for rack or desk mount options.",

That said it works like a good switch. You plug in the cables and you get data at the intended speed. If you have a modern cable modem that has just one or two ethernet ports on it, you need this.

      "text": "I needed a Ethernet switch to run internet access for a smart tv, Xbox, smart blu ray player, and AT&T box from one wall jack. Devices like these are better on wired connections than wireless. I like that the construction of the switch is very durable. All metal housing. Super super easy to set up. The switch is powered so you will need an outlet for power. Each port is IN/OUT so the line from the wall can be plugged in to either of the five ports. Netgear is the standard for this kindof equipment. I purchased the five port model but if you have more devices they manufacture an eight port. I highly recommended these switches.",

I put a temperature remote temp gauge inside my enclosure to see how much the air increased over the ambient surrounding temperature (concerned that it would not get enough air inside the enclosure). Only experienced about a 5-8degree increase in air temperature. Great switch, easy to install, and produces minimal heat (so you can place it inside a cabinet or enclosure).",
