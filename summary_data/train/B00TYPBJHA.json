This belt used a different approach. The straps were looped on belt : and can be moved to insure proper placement of the pad. The difference between the more original and this belt is that the original pads are flat on the side next to your body and fit into pockets on the belt. The pads on this belt are curved on both sides and are velvcroed to the belt. I only use one side.",

The support we got from the medical supply store had inserts, they were flimsy and not as helpful. I willl say this does run a bit on the small side. We ordered a medium and dad is like a 34 waist. It's pretty tight but that's the way we want it so it stays in place. Good product and highly recommended.",
