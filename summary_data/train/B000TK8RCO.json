Bubble motor ONLY works if you keep the button pressed at all times. It won't stay on so if you are looking to sit back and enjoy the bubbles on your feet then this is not what you are looking for but a bucket and a long straw for you to make your own bubbles.",

And the pumice stone is pretty nice too and the handles help to hold it. Not sure how to get a replacement for that once its done. By the way, you have to pour in your own hot or warm water and when it gets cold you have to manually change the water out yourself. Not complaining, just explaining. Still five stars for me.",
