This one is satin and that is what I wanted but it is barely even noticeable as a shade of silver or gray. The other gray they sell is much more gray but it is the glossy finish. It is still not dark enough gray to stand out. Be careful in ordering these. Make sure you investigate which colors are satin and which are gloss.",
