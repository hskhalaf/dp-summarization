The only drawback is that the characters on the cover are larger than the ones on my keyboard, so at night, when I have the backlight on, it can make it difficult to make out the characters. Fortunately, I am a touch typist, so I don't have to look at the keyboard too often. But still. It's a great cover for keeping out crumbs (Yes, I am one of those people who eat at my desk), as well as hair and stuff...I'm a shedder and my dog sheds. Easy to install, and it actually comes with two covers.",
