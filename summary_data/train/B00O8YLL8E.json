I've read the sub is not up to snuff with the rest so I'll probably look elsewhere for an upgraded sub when I get there, current (other sony) sub is holding up with these.",

      "text": "Great speakers considering the price and shipping. They look great, sound wonderful and the build quality is top notch. They\u2019re replacing my 16year old KLH towers and they\u2019re a nice needed upgrade. I have them paired with a little 6\u201d subwoofer and the system sounds amazing again. Can\u2019t go wrong with these but mind you they\u2019re $100 speakers. Not $500 speakers. But for my townhome basement they're perfect. Thanks Sony.",

I'm not an audiophile so the others can comment on that but I'm not feeling the urge to get a subwoofer or center speaker. Did however get some small speakers for behind the couch which complimented well.",

Large rooms bass needs to be turned all the way up, treble could also be bumped up a little as it helps bring the vocals out a little more.",
