This trail shoe also receives good marks for its lightness and non-existent break-in period.Although these qualities arewell-received, the footgear\u2019s lack of grip on wet surfaces raises a few red flags. Overall, this model from Merrell can bring satisfaction, granted there won\u2019t be any slippery ground conditions on the trail.",

I purchased my usual size and too small, replacements sent one size up and i have used them on a walk. The soles\\inserts squeak loudly with every step taken. Width fitting is far too tight and the top lace loop closest to your ankle is in the wrong position and is very uncomprtable and painfull. I simply can't believe the poor quality with Merrell logo on them.",

    "title": "Merrell Chameleon 7 Walking Shoes",
    "description": "Merrell Chameleon 7 Walking Shoes As adaptable as the reptile it's inspired by, this athletic-inspired hiker features protection, stability, and ultra-lightweight construction. Synthetic and Textile Upper The moisture wicking Chameleon 7 allows moisture that gathers on the surface of the shoe to be wicked away efficiently and effectively. Despite blocking moisture from passing to the inside of the shoe, air is able to penetrate through the material, for breathable comfort. Warm and muggy air that is building up within the shoe is easily able to escape and is then replaced by cooler air from outside of the shoe. This constant flow of air will keep you feeling fresh and ventilated over a long period of time, maximising comfort. The upper is made from a combination of synthetic and textile materials including a breathable mesh lining, this will mean that whilst it remains extremely lightweight, the material is also extremely tough and durable. This will provide both comfort and protection. Surrounding vulnerable areas of the feet, for example the toes and the heel, the material is thicker and will protect the areas from any bumps or knocks that you might receive. Securing the shoe to fit can be done in a combination of two ways with traditional laces and a hook in loop strap, allowing you to easily find a comfortable fit. After a day on the muddy ground, carrying the shoes around is easy with heel loops to prevent you from getting your hands dirty. A protective rubber toe cap enhances the durability of the Chameleon 7 keeping your forefoot safe from rocks and debris. Firm EVA Midsole The multi-functional midsole is designed to keep your feet healthy and feeling good on the trails. The EVA injected into the midsole will ensure that you won't feel any discomfort from heavy and sharp contacts from below. This is because the EVA is extremely good at absorbing shocks instantly and effectively, preventing it from reaching the sole of the foot and causing any dam",
