The wire is flexible, yet also firm (unlike typical, limp holiday lights), which helps with placing / shaping. The lights and pack stay pretty cool, too. They worked out so well, I bought a second box!",

Beautiful! and classy,adding a bit of sparkle to the room. And equally important,compare the prices,these were about $2.00 each string (batteries included)as opposed to $8.99 a string (batteries NOT included)) with the strings having fewer lights,clunky( big battery pack requiring 3 AA batteries (not included),no beautiful copper wire at Michaels,Hobby Lobby and other hobby type merchants.",
