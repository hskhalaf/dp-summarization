Insulation is great. zippers are high quality, and even protected by a velcro strap (picture posted) fits myself and my wife, perfectly. i posted a few pics to show how big this bag really is. i\u2019m 6\u201d2\u2019 205lbs and i have 0 trouble getting in and out. The bag unzips all the way to the point where you can have two huge flaps to lay on. For storage, it doesn\u2019t take too much room and it\u2019s really easy to put away into its sleeve. Honestly i couldn\u2019t have asked for more. It met my expectations and some. Thank you for making a great product",

It also comes with these 2 little pillows, I plan to keep it in my car, very good for traveling.",

It is very well designed with nice features like Velcro to hold the top area closed throughout the night so the zipper will not be able to move on its own. They even give you two pillows which all fit into the included caring pouch. It is listed to keep you warm down to 32 degrees. It can easy fit two adults or if you just want a lot of room then it will be perfect for that also :-) I hope this review and my included video help with your decision. GrandpaJake",

The description says this bag is rated for 32 F and above, but we used it a few weeks ago when it was in low- to mid-50\u2019s and I kept waking up because my feet were cold (very unusual for me). Also, the pillows that come with this are so thin and flimsy, I would rather use the pillows our kids\u2019 toddler sleeping bags came with. The material inside feels the same as on the outside, which traps heat, but also made it feel humid and muggy. Maybe that\u2019s why I ended up getting cold! Not a fan of this sleeping bag at all.",

On the plus side it is lightweight for being a double sleeping bag I guess, but it's just so cumbersome to pack and too heavy for 1 backpack.

We've slept in 50-60 degrees and it was quite comfortable, especially when you sleep with another person. It's also very roomy (we're small: under 200lbs). Two adults and a young child can all fit in it. The pillows that come with the bag are small, but that's not a big deal. We were buying a sleeping bag for camping, not pillows.",

I found it warm, but not too warm. Very comfortable. Love how roomy it is, I can see how it could definitely accommodate two adults. Overall a great sleeping bag. I wasn\u2019t a fan of the included travel pillows, but hey- they didn\u2019t cost extra and the sleeping bag is an excellent value. I look forward to using this sleeping bag on future camping trips.",

It is roomy, comfortable, and the zippers don't jam up. When using it in temperatures below 45 degrees we add one blanket and stay warm. This bag would be a great value without the pillows, but they are a nice addition . . . the pillows are very small and they work well as knee and elbow pillows . . . you will probably want to add larger pillows. I would buy this bag again or feel good about gifting it. Try it and you won't be disappointed.",

One night we camped, it got down into the low 40s, and this did NOT keep us warm enough. For regular summer camping however, it was fine. My reasoning for 4 stars is the temp issue mentioned above and because washing it is really annoying\u2014 I threw it in the washer after a 10-day camping trip, but that was against the tag\u2019s suggestions. It washed fine, but the recommendations for how not to wash it are numerous.",

The bag will work well for 3 seasons, if the temp is under 40 outside I would recommend something a bit more insulated. Weight wise, it will work great if your driving somewhere and setting up camp, but for backpacking, it\u2019s just a little to big 5 star review",

We were sleeping in 20 degree weather (it was rated for 30) and it was fine no problems. I definitely recommend buying something like this as opposed to a 300 dollar sleeping back this was nice warm cozy and light. All id recommend is a sleeping back matt, i didn't take one and felt the rocks underneath, but that is not the sleeping bag's fault. Good Company too Sleepingo, thank you!",

I think 3 would be a tight fit, but that could just add to the warmth. Works out really great when used as a single sleeping bag also, though not as warm, so I think 40 degrees would be about as low as I'd go when in \"single bag\" mode. And considering that it is just a little bigger than the size of a single sleeping bag, the amount of space and weight you save with this are very much worth it!!",
