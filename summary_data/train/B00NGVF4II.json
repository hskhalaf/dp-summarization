When I moved on to the next rug, the light turned red for no reason so I stopped and checked to see what was stuck but there was nothing..I removed the few hairs in the rollers and continued.. but no green light, no red light no movement in the rollers. I literally just got it today!!! So disappointed. Returning this item.",

Suction was mediocre on carpet, I have to go over the same spots on the floor 4 times. It blows debris/crumbs back towards me on hard floors. Maybe it works well for pet hair, but we dont have pets, we have messy kids. My old Eureka cleans carpets way better with much more suction, and a broom is quicker and WAY more thorough on hard floors. Would not recommend to anyone who is trying to vaccuum up anything other than pet hair.",

But, dragging and repositioning the canister takes time too, which you don't have with this lightweight vac. So maybe the time would be the same.",

      "text": "After 2 month of use. Pros: Light weight, LED lights, swivel head and long cord. Cons: Poor suction, attachment location. Did I mention poor suction? We bought this brand again because we really liked the Shark Navigator. I would say after 3 weeks of using the Shark Rocket we noticed the suction was getting weaker. I've replaced and washed the filters several times to hopefully get better results. I bought this based on reviews and would not buy this again ($203.11)",

The brush/vacuum isn't the greatest for a thick pile carpet especially if you have pets. But I have a dyson I use for the heavy duty stuff. Id only use the vacuum on low pile carpets or when you just need a light vacuum.",

Ran our old vacuum the on the steps the day before this arrived and then tried the shark there as my test. Picked up so much that I was disgusted with the old vacuum and its abilities. This is a good vacuum for a host of situations. Pretty light weight (for a vacuum), attachments are easy to change, good maneuverability, small storage profile, and easy to dump dust collection.",

I'm keeping it only because I'm far too lazy to try and box it all back up again.",

I go outside on the porch to keep any dust that may fly around out of the house. Another feature that I really like is the long cord as I don't have to keep plugging and unplugging the vacuum as I move from room to room.",

No more fighting big, bulky vacuum around the house. More than half of the furniture that I used to move every time I vacuum, I do not have to move anymore. It is light, powerful, easily movable, changing attachments takes less than a second. With big vacuum I did not use attachments at all, it was honestly frustrating, hard and time consuming, it was easier for me to just dust, brush or clean hard to reach places manually. I am trilled. It saved me, thank you!",
