      "text": "Update: I contacted Yeti and a few days later they contacted me and sent me a return label. The reason I only bumped it up to 3 stars is that I have to return the bad cooler before they will ship a replacement. And because this shouldn't have happened in the first place. Original Review: I have been using the cooler 5 days a week for approximately 8 months. As you can see in the photos the zipper failed today. Does it keep things cold, heck yes it does. But for nearly $200 I would expect it to be significantly more durable. It should be noted that I DID apply the zipper lubricant regularly.",
