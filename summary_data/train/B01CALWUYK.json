I didn't use the brushes that come with it though so I can't speak for how they work, I used foam eye shadow applicators and wedges so that I could use a different one in each color. I would definitely buy this brand again. It says it does 100 faces but that must be full face because I did close to that with stencils (because I wasn't sure I could freehand) and it hardly looks used.",

Four hours later and the paint is like a ghost of the original design. So this might be best if you only want a short lived design or something that is super easy to wipe away.

Great coverage, just need to use very little water, the more water you use, the more transparent the color it. **Update, I have tried other colors, the yellow is really pale and more transparent than other colors, which is disappointing, and the brown/tan is very orange-like. Still, a decent set and I will make do.",

Easy to use, great coverage, dries fast, doesn't crack, peel or smudge, lightweight, and extremely easy to remove with just water or baby wipes! I was also pleasantly surprised at how well the included stick-on stencils worked. This set will provide enough paint for 100+ uses. The only thing I didn't like about this set were the included brushes (cheap plastic), but they're perfect for kids to use. I didn't buy this for brushes, so we ended up using our own. I will definitely be buying this product again.",

I haven't had a chance to use the new set of paints but appreciate the great customer service and would buy their products again!
