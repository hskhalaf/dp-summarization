About to order another set for my mother as we are taking her to London, Scotland and Ireland for the holidays. We rarely use the middle size. The small size we carry on and the largest size we check. Very pleased with maneuvering and durability of wheels on various rough surfaces. The retractable handle makes for easy storage on ferries and railway. We\u2019ve had zero issues with locking mechanism. We are a family of 4 with kids age 8 and 12.",

My luggage survived my first trip. I would recommend luggage covers because they can get scratched easily but to me that\u2019s not an issue. My belongings being secure and my luggage not being damnage were my only concerns. And they were not damaged at all. The preset lock code worked fine too and it was easy to reset the (000) password to what I wanted it to be. So yes I would definitely recommend this set. It\u2019s definitely cheap and reliable.",

You can pull the handle up and set your backpack or extra bags on top nothing falls off. This is the best luggage I have owned so far. I will be taking it to London in December.",

When we were packing, we tried assorted combinations of sizes and loved having that flexibility. They held up beautifully during our trip and we love the ability to beat them for storage. They are lightweight - but high quality!",

The largest bag is heavier than I expected. On my last trip I had packed it to almost the 50# limit, the shuttle driver was whipping it around, and both handles came off. Figured out the screws had stripped out of the plastic retainers in the handle. A little filler and super glue fix it right up but still maybe a stronger retainer would work better.",

Easy to manuever and carry, with a surprising amount of space inside (moreso then I initially thought). My only issue (if you can call it that) is that the zipper track looks as if it may be bent a little. There's no issue as of now, but I'm concerned that it may come off track in the years to come. As of now though, for the price that these cost, I would 100% buy again if I needed luggage. I absolutely love these.",

This one does not do that, not that I have used that feature on my current case but it's nice to have that additional zipper as a back up. Fingers crossed this one survives.",
