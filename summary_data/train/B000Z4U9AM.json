Mom has very thin hair that is much shorter. She didn't like it either?",

Only 1 complaint: when it gets to the bottom of the bottle, the shampoo gets a little waxy or something, and it doesn't clean as well.",

But my curiosity got the best of me and I ordered the Seaweed Shampoo and Conditioner from Amazon.com. Boy was I surprised! The shampoo didn't dry out my hair. The conditioner-didn't need a lot, and it didn't grease up my hair. This product is well worth the investment in gorgeous and healthy heair.",
