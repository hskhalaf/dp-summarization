Just sniffing the oils is AWESOME!! They came in such a pretty box and the booklet that came with it is just so informative!! I have told several people about purchasing these oils.

But that's the only good thing about those oil. The smell is weak or not right. I am comparing several different brand, and those oils do not last and they are weak. I think \"you get what you paid for\" certainly apply to this product. Also the dropper doesn't work. The oil came out like water. I am very disappointed.",

These would be more useful for a diffuser rather than being an ingredient in body products, or a wonderful, decently priced starter kit for somebody.

I suggest starting off with 9-12 drops for a 300 ml diffuser and going up if you feel the scent is not strong enough. Keep in mind that this would vary with the room sizes you are trying to cover.

I haven't tried them topically mixed with a carrier oil yet, so I will update this review once I do that.

I personally prefer the citrus/woody scents (lemongrass/lemon/orange, bergamot/ylang ylang, cypress) which give a relaxing, vital and calm mood. Unfortunately Natrogix does not sell cypress and I have to get it from Eden Gardens.",
