So the pink one never worked except for the initial use, 15-20 minutes. *****Update***** This company emailed me and told me they had refunded my money, AND are sending me replacements. They have been prompt in answering my questions and very pleasant and kind.",

It is great for pretend play as firefighters, and police. They also love the walkie talkies, as they feel so important wearing them and calling each other. The only thing I would change about the design, is adding a small screw to secure the battery cover. Batteries are very dangerous for small children, and when the walkie talkie falls, the cover can come off and the batteries can come out. A screw would secure them in place.",
