You get 6 vinyl toy collectibles from the Pikachu Detective Movie. 2 of the figures are of Detective Pikachu. They are presented in a cool and colorful box. Each is only about an inch, plus or minus. My teen girls are Pokemon fans and loved this as a gift! They each grabbed a Pikachu and divided the rest equally. The price is average but worth purchasing via Amazon due to convince. I wasn't even aware these figures existed until I browsed! These are so fun and detailed perfectly! Fantastic gift idea! *Hope my review helps and I'm basing it solely on the figures.",
