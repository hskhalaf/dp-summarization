This case looks very similar and also charges wirelessly on the Mophie chargers. I tested this case with my phone, and it charged my phone the same 40%, but without even going down one bar. I tested it again and it recharged my phone another 40% and only went down one bar the second time. 80% recharge total, and the case only lost one bar of power. I think this one\u2019s a keeper.",

Some of the thinner pieces do wear down and break off but nothing major. I did break one of these cases after almost 2 years of use. I dropped my phone at work and the case broke along the bottom seem, phone is perfectly fine. I\u2019m someone who drops my phone a lot and it took that long to break the case. My only real complaint is the top is sometimes hard to remove and that can lead to some of the wear, causing the thinner parts to break.",

I don't drop it, or even set it down harshly. But both phones have the same broken piece of plastic. The exposed broken piece catches on everything, which makes it break even further. It's a shame that such a silly little design flaw exists on an otherwise nice product.",

I went to a concert and tried to use the case and I got a message ... noting the case is not compatible with my phone. Really disappointed. And, frankly annoyed.",

The case doesn\u2019t take long to fully charge and it lasts a long time. The case is heavy duty and provides great protection. I wish you could use an iPhone charger to charge the case instead of a micro USB. Other than that I highly recommend this case to those who don\u2019t like to carry around chargers.",
