This spice mix is great in a pinch: Very good in curry. Just lentils and sweet potato, this, and you are all set. Of course, you can add other spices to enhance flavor or make more of a lunch curry than a breakfast curry but still works on its own. Also, nice to add to small snacks or sprinkle on things you find yourself eating when you get hungry.",

Just a heads-up- because it is ground spices, it will NOT dissolve, so it really doesn't blend very well, and will leave a ring of spice residue around the inside of your cup. A minor inconvenience, considering the deep. rich flavor.",
