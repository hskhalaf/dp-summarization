Very easy to use, takes great photographs, resolution is amazing, battery lasts for a long time, easy to download the pics. I strongly recommed you invest in a high speed memory card so you can take pics faster. Also, get the screen protector film, the screen is large so it would be easy to scratch if left unprotected. It's a little bulky but once you get used to it you'll see that this is truly a wonderful camera all around. I wish they would include a carrying case with the camera.",

Full manual controls allow the photographer to experiment with the more creative aspects of digital photography, but the automatic settings assist with creating wonderful photos too.

If you want to shoot a lot in low light, then get a large sensor DSLR or the latest Fuji. I use the camera mostly for Underwater pictures, using strobes... and there, the combination of macro on demand, zoom macro (something not available with a dslr) and the 28 mm wide angle, make this the best camera I have ever used. You also now get the same raw image software the high end camera's use...nice add on.",

Pros: Great manual control Very easily accessable controls Built like a tank Hotshoe on top Excellent battery life Cons: As I mentioned, noisy in lower light conditions",

    "description": "Advanced amateur photographers are a discerning group, and they've flocked to Canon's G-Series for its ability to meet and exceed their demands. The third-generation PowerShot G10 is a stunning successor, loaded with uncompromising specs like 14.7 megapixels, a 28mm wide-angle lens, and Canon's new DIGIC 4 Image Processor for notably improved face and motion detection. This is a camera that supports and nurtures creativity, with a full range of shooting and recording modes and compatibility with exciting accessories including Speedlite flashes.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nManufacturer Description \n\n Advanced amateur photographers are a discerning group, and they\u2019ve flocked to Canon\u2019s G-Series for its ability to meet and exceed their demands. The third-generation PowerShot G10 is a stunning successor, loaded with uncompromising specs like 14.7 megapixels, a 28mm wide-angle lens, and Canon\u2019s new DIGIC 4 Image Processor for notably improved face and motion detection. This is a camera that supports and nurtures creativity, with a full range of shooting and recording modes and compatibility with exciting accessories including Speedlite flashes. \n\nPowerShot G10 Highlights \n\n\n\n14.7-megapixel resolution 14.7-megapixel digital camera for the highest image quality\nThe PowerShot G10 is equipped with a 14.7-megapixel CCD. Combined with unsurpassed DIGIC 4 image processing, this impressive pixel count delivers richly detailed photos that resonate with lifelike depth from shadows to highlights. \n\nAn important benefit to the G10\u2019s lofty pixel count is the flexibility it lends to the editing process. With 14.7 megapixels of resolution, any portion of any shot is a great candidate for enlargement. Enlarge and crop as your creative vision demands, confident that the detail you need is there for you. \n\nHigh-powered 5x optical zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer plus a 28mm wide-angle lens\nThe camera is equipped with a long 5x optical zoom, and Canon\u2019s own Optical Image Stabilizer Technology keeps images steady and blur-free all through the zoom range--even in low light--by detecting motion and generating a corrective signal. Because it is an optical system, more corrective movement is allowed and there is no degradation of image quality. \n\nNew DIGIC 4 Image Processor improves Face Detection, adds Servo AF, Face Detection Self-Timer and Intelligent Contrast Correction \n\nDIGIC 4 Image Processor\nCanon\u2019s proprietary DIGIC Image Processors have long set its cameras apart from the competition, and the new DIGIC 4 sets the bar even higher. Faster, more accurate noise reduction delivers better image quality, even at high ISO speeds. \n\niSAPS Technology is an entirely original scene-recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos, iSAPS works with the advanced DIGIC 4 Image Processor to improve focus speed and accuracy, as well as exposure and white balance. \n\nA new Face Self-Timer automatically detects an increase in the number of faces and makes the appropriate adjustments. For instance, to include photographer\u2019s face in a group shot, there\u2019s no need to rush in. Just put the camera on a stand or tripod, and specify Face Self-Timer, and the camera will wait for the photographer\u2019s face to get on-camera before it takes the shot. Motion Detection now tracks moving subjects in a much larger range, and the new Servo AF retains focus on a moving subject after the shutter button is pressed halfway -- allowing you to wait for the perfect shot without refocusing. Also, Face Detection and Motion Detection are markedly improved. \n\nIntelligent Contrast Correction in action Intelligent Contrast Correction\nDIGIC 4 also makes possible the new i-Contrast (Intelligent Contrast Correction) system, which controls the compensation level in pixel units to brighten dark areas while leaving bright areas unchanged for better images where the main subject is dark, and more natural transition. The PowerShot G10 can even use i-Contrast in playback mode to adjust images that were shot without the setting activated. \n\nRed-eye Correction provides three options for removing red-eye from subjects in flash pictures.\n1) The Red-eye Correction during shooting actually identifies and corrects red-eye in human subjects as pictures are taken.\n2) The G10 can be set to automatically detect and correct red-eye during image playback.\n3) You can manually locate any red eyes in a scene during image playback on the LCD screen, and command the camera to remove them. \n\nLife doesn\u2019t give you second chances to capture special times. That\u2019s why the G10 features ISO 1600 and High ISO Auto settings that reduce the effects of camera shake and sharpen subjects in low-light situations, giving you greater shooting flexibility. ISO can be expanded to 3200 when you select ISO 3200 Special Scene mode. \n\nFull range of shooting and recording modes including RAW + JPEG\nThe PowerShot G10\u2019s RAW mode lets you shoot images without JPEG compression. It gives you clearer images and complete creative control in editing. RAW images are transferred directly to the computer where they can then be edited using image adjustment software or a processing application to adjust your images as you please. The camera can also be set to allow the simultaneous recording of both RAW and JPEG images while shooting. \n\nAlso, with 26 Shooting Modes including 17 Special Scene Modes, you\u2019re ready for whatever shot comes your way. \n\nLarge 3.0-inch PureColor LCD II\nThe PowerShot G10 gives you an extra-large 3.0-inch LCD screen for excellent control when framing your shots. But size is only part of the story. Canon\u2019s PureColor LCD II offers more spectacular color, resolution and contrast even at an angle (compared to PureColor LCD). The screen is highly durable and easy to see in any light with a scratch-resistant, anti-reflective coating. It is a perfect feature for gathering friends and family around to see your images. \n\nA wealth of accessories including optional Speedlite flashes\nThe PowerShot G10 is compatible with the Speedlite EX series that is for all EOS series SLR cameras. Attach a Speedlite 580EX II to the hot shoe, then you can set and control the flash on the \"Flash Control\" menu in the camera. With the 580EX II, the G10 is given extra functions such as autoflash metering, FE lock and Flash exposure compensation; continuous shooting with external flash. Also Canon\u2019s Speedlite Transmitter ST-E2 enables you to have multiple slave flashes and wireless control. A Tele Coverter lens designed for the G10 and High-Power Flash designed for all PowerShot cameras are also available. \n\nPrint/Share Button for easy direct printing and downloading\nThe PowerShot G10's Print/Share button makes direct printing easier than ever. Simply connect the G10 to a Canon PIXMA Photo Printer or SELPHY Compact Photo Printer or any PictBridge compatible photo printer, press the lighted Print/Share button and print! Also use the Print/Share button to transfer images to a computer (Windows and Macintosh). \nPrint your own ID photos in up to 28 different sizes or use the Movie Print function to output multiple stills from a recorded movie on a single sheet with a Canon SELPHY Compact Photo Printer. \n\nWhat's in the Box  * PowerShot G10 Camera body \n * Neck Strap NS-DC8 \n * Battery Pack NB-7L \n * Battery Charger CB-2LZ \n * AV Cable AVC-DC300 \n * Interface Cable IFC-400PCU \n * Digital Camera Solution Disk \n\n\n\n\n\nREVIEW FROM DPREVIEW.COM\n\n\n \n\nLearn more about this camera\nat DPReview.com Canon PowerShot G10: Recommended by dpreview.com \n\nThe G10 is the third incarnation of Canon\u2019s flagship 'prosumer' compact since the G series was reinvented with the G7 in 2006. Announced two years after the G6, the G7 caused quite a buzz; partly because everyone had presumed the budget SLR had killed off this sector of the market, partly because it lacked several of what had become G series trademarks (fast lens, tilting screen, raw mode, secondary LCD panel), and it would be fair to say the response was \u2018mixed\u2019. The G9 went some way towards placating the critics, reintroducing raw mode and improving handling, but it still suffered from the fundamental problem that the sensor inside couldn\u2019t deliver on what the fantastic camera promised on the outside. \n\nWhen we reviewed the G9 last year, we praised it for the styling, handling and build and for its excellent output at low ISO settings. The G10 builds on this by adding handling and control refinements, improving the LCD resolution, and, most importantly, adding a wider lens starting at 28mm (equiv.). It also retains the rangefinder styling and solid build quality, and reduces the amount of silver accents on the camera. All the external controls have been carried over, and a new one has been added (a very useful exposure compensation dial). \n\nThe things we criticized the G9 for (the unneeded increase in resolution, and the slow-ish lens) have not been addressed. Instead Canon has increased the resolution for the sensor even more, to 14.7 megapixels. The updated lens, though wider at the wide end, is also shorter at the long end, and has less zoom range overall. The speed of the lens is again almost the same F2.8-4.5, though the wider lens does retain the G9\u2019s relatively compact dimensions. The price remains at around $500. \n\nNote that some sections of this review (feature descriptions where nothing has changed) are reproduced from the G9 review. \n\nHeadline features  * 14.7 Megapixel CCD sensor \n * 5x wide-angle (28mm) optical zoom lens with optical Image Stabilizer \n * RAW image recording plus support for Canon Digital Photo Professional \n * DIGIC 4 for clear, sharp images, high-speed AF (including Servo AF) and fast response times \n * Targets all the main causes of blur with High ISO Auto, optical Image Stabilizer, Motion Detection Technology and Auto ISO shift \n * Improved Face Detection AF/AE/FE/WB plus Face Select & Track and FaceSelf-Timer \n * 3.0-inch PureColor LCD II (461k dots resolution) with wide viewing angle and optical viewfinder \n * i-Contrast boosts brightness and retains detail in dark areas \n * Dedicated Exposure Compensation and ISO dials \n * 26 shooting modes with manual control and custom settings \n * Accessories include tele-converter, Speedlights flashes and waterproof case \n * Smooth, 30fps VGA movies \n\n>Read more at dpreview.com \n\n\n\nSee more",
