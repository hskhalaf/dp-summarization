In the past the hand blenders would not be able to deal with the fibers from the asparagus so instead I would go through the drudgery of blending it in batches in my blender. The Braun effortless grinds the veggies to a smooth cream right in the pot. In addition I really like the chopping attachment, it does a great job with onions, carrots and such and is easy to clean.",

Unfortunately this blender is automatically switching itself from the low setting I have it on to the high setting all on its own. This has caused the hot liquid I'm blending to splash out all over the place, and has burned me. This is very dangerous and has caused me injury from burns.",
