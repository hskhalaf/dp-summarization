Ever since going organic with haircare, I\u2019ve tried several brands that left my hair in \u201cjungle\u201d condition until I discovered Argan oil shampoos. That said, I was originally using Majestic Pure\u2019s Argan oil shampoo/conditioner set, but over time there was too many bottles of leftover conditioner because of how much more saturated it is than the shampoo. Now using Baebody\u2019s shampoo paired with Majestic Pure\u2019s leftover conditioner. Glad that they work well together but Baebody\u2019s pretty pricey compared to Majestic Pure.",

I had asked my hairdresser for products to address my problem. Ended up spending a small fortune for products that made no difference at all. I feel like I got lucky with this purchase. I'd love to order a conditioner if and when it might be available. Thank you so much for your wonderful shampoo!",

My scalp is very sensitive to shampoos & this is the only one I've found that doesn't cause my scalp to break out or become itchy (besides using a dandruff shampoo). I also don't have to use conditioner with it either and it leaves my hair silky & soft. The pump is super convenient, too. Also comes with a flip cap if you prefer that style over the pump. Bottle lasts a long time because it doesn't take much to wash your hair. I have medium length hair & it usually lasts me at least 2+ months.",

After reading the reviews and seeing how cheap this shampoo was I decided to purchase it and I am so happy I did. It hasn't helped my hair and to me it smells like dog shampoo but it made my husband's hair grow back from where it was bald. I'm in such shock! His hair is growing back! I still can't believe it. I'll definitely be buying more when ours runs out.",

I received a watery one from here and emailed them to confirm the consistency and they were able to send me a replacement! The replacement is a great shampoo. It's sulfate free so it does take a little bit more product to distribute throughout long hair. However the smell is amazing and it makes my hair so soft and clean. I love that it comes with the option to use a pump or squeeze it out like other shampoos. I definitely recommend this.",

But once the oilyness subsided, I no longer had the same dry hair, split ends problems. My hair also feels thicker. I've been using this product for about 4 years now.",
