BTW the reviews seem to vary as to the cord length, mine is about 4 feet overall so its adequate for personal filming.",

It picks up clear audio, whether wearing it as a traditional lav, or attaching it to your GoPro housing.

      "text": "Fantastic mic, better than I expected. I have it tucked into the mouth pocket of a dual sport helmet that is quite noisy, and the mic is plugged into my gopro hero 3+ and it picks up my voice perfectly, loud and clear and with little, if any, wind noise, despite often being at freeway speed. I will get another one as a spare in case I lose or damage this one. Great little microphone",

      "text": "The microphone had a very high gain and any voice came through with some popping. This was also due to the attempted use of this mic inside of a motorcycle helmet. I'm sure in an open environment with an appropriate distance of the microphone from the sound source, it would sound fine. I actually purchased it because the combo adapter for the go pro with the microphone was $15, which was cheaper than the adapter alone. If you need the adapter, this is a great purchase. I'll use the microphone in situations where a lapel microphone is warranted.",

Bought the first after watching a video of someone in the review section using it with his iPhone, but then realized I received something that couldn't even plug into my iPhone. The poster then told me he purchased the GM100 (not the GM300), so I re-bought. It connected to my iPhone this time, but didn't work whatsoever. I think the guy just got lucky, maybe? This is most definitely NOT for use with the iPhone, and now I've learned my lesson. Hopefully my review saves you some cash. Peace!",
