I was looking for a set that came with lots of pieces. This set comes with the big Potato Head, the eyes, mouth, ears, and nose do come out, and it is also a storage for all the pieces. It also came with 2 regular size Mr. Potato's and 2 small ones. It has lots of pieces including pieces to make a dog and cat potato. This is great. My son plays with it for hours through the day.",
