      "text": "First couple of days I had this up in the greenhouse I was wondering if it even worked but then perhaps I was expecting a bit much from a solar panel in November so plugged it into an iPhone charge. It turns and moves the air, but I wouldn\u2019t be looking for this to move air in even a half decent sized room. Checked the solar panel on a sunny day (helps right?) and it powers the fan. Suitable for what I want, but don\u2019t expect a strong breeze. I could possibly fart faster, but it will certainly do for my greenhouse..",
