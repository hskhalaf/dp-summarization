Nice aluminum body, light, the ability to change the warmth of the light is amazing even if instead a scheduler to change it it was best to have an additional sensor.

Minor issue is the scratch marks around the charging port - just looks tacky on a brand new, expensive item. If it was a refurb, or a lot cheaper, I wouldn't care! Much worse though is the bright white dot when using the backlight - hard to photograph, but under the first V in VoiceView in the pic. No way would I accept that in a new device - it's really quite distracting. Possibly a scratch on the underside of the glass as it wouldn't clean away and I could feel nothing there.",

It is metal and and somewhat uncomfortable due to the edges that dig into my hand. Still, everything else about this kindle is great. I just wish it had the soft rubber of my old paper white but then again it looks very premium in metal casing. 5* Update I bought Amazon fabric cover, it looks great and feels very comfortable now.",

      "text": "This is my 2nd Kindle and my daughter has had two, but this is by far the best. It is on the expensive side and I'm not sure I can justify the extra \u00a3100 from the next model down. That said, it is lovely to hold, easy to use and comfortable - with a case, you can hold it very much like reading a real book. The range of settings is excellent, option for Audible is good and the large capacity is very handy. Overall I'm very happy with my only slight gripe that the battery is not as long lasting as my previous models. However this one offers a lot more so that is not really surprising",

The adjustable warm light is a big plus for me. The bigger screen is very welcome. As another reviewer has pointed out, the page turn buttons are not 'silent' I have the graphite model which I suspect in time will show signs of wearing. The screen area of the Kindle is quite thin and easy to hold, the 'bulge' allows for a good grip on the 'slippery' metal, I've not attempted change orientation yet. Is it worth the higher cost than other Kindles in the range? Yes",

The right edge with the buttons is quite sharp at the corner, making it uncomfortable if you use this edge to hold it. With the screen being flush with the outer edge it you cannot lay it face down or you may scratch the screen. Apart from the above it is a great bit of kit.",

My main reasons for Kindle reading are ease of obtaining new books, convenience for travel, and the ability to read outside eg in the garden or at the beach. Smartphones and tablets are not so readable in the sunshine! But I have found that my Oasis can play up a little after just a short time in the sun - the page turn ceases to operate (either by button or touchscreen) and a warning about overheating sometimes appears. This is a shame as I have really liked the ability to read in sunshine that worked so well on my earlier Kindle devices.",
