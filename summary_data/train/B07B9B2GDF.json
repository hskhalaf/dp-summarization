The boot\u2019s waterproofness and surface traction also contribute to its stellar trail performance.However, its lack of arch support comes off as a detriment to those who have used it outdoors. All in all, the Merrell Yokota 2 Mid Waterproof may still be a remarkable option for day hikes, granted its footbed is replaced with a more supportive variant.",

      "text": "I bought these shoes because I knew I would be hiking in the mountains, and have need for both comfort and stability. These were recommended, and I am 100% happy with my purchase. They required no breaking in, are lightweight, but tough enough for light hiking. The waterproof feature came in very handy, as I was able to walk through marshy land and even jump into low water without betting even a little damp. I used them hard for 5 days straight, and they still look new. I cannot recommend these enough. I will say, I did not do intensive, all terrain hiking. But for simple, everyday use, with day-hikes and such, these are absolutely perfect.",
