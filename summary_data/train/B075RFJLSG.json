Ya dont buy these..... it won't even make it to your gut to help you poop better.",

Direction states to use 5 drops, but once the consistency changes, we can no longer use the dropper for proper dosage. Will not purchase this again.",

      "text": "Great quality product. I love the fact that it is a combination of probiotics and Vitamin D -- kills 2 birds with one stone. My baby always hates the taste of her Vitamin D. With this Culturelle baby product, I don't need to worry about her spitting up her formula like a Vitamin D because it doesn't really have a taste. Only 5 drops each time and the dropper is very easy to use. My baby gets both the probiotics and the Vitamin D which are critically important to her healthy growth and I am a happy mom.",
