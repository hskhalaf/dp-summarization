A visit to the manufacturer's web site revealed the following. The product description \"Skechers Sport Men's Stamina Nuovo Cutback Lace-Up Sneaker\" is incorrect. Skechers has two models: Stamina - Nuovo (50988) and Stamina - Cutback (51286). The Cutback (51286) is about $10 more and features a memory-foam insole. The Nuovo (50988) does NOT feature a memory-foam insole. One last comment. The \"navy\" is more like gray with just a hint of blue. Unless you saw my navy and gray side by side, you would think that the navy was really gray.",

If you think about it, memory foam has very little bounce back, and almost no cushioning after the initial compression. My legs hurt from the bottom of my feet to above my knees. Somehow, the construction, or tread, or both, must have affected the way I walk and caused strain to the interior meniscus on both of my knees, occasionally causing severe pain.",

The width was matked with a W without E values like E, EE, etc. The sizing seemed to be from China, as the width was off and the writing seemed to be in Chinese. Furthermore, the heel area was loose. The width should have been concentated above the arch area. And if this was not enough, these sneakers were heavy and clunky like Herman Munster shoes. Needless to say, these sneakers got returned.. I am left wondering if these were Chinese knock-offs.",

Good price. All-in-all, a good sneaker and a good purchase.",

They aren\u2019t the most fashionable sneakers I own but are great for around the house. I wear them more than my slippers. I am very happy with them and highly recommend these sneakers. Would be a great athletic sneaker.",
