UPDATE: So, I\u2019ve had to wash the mats already thanks to one of our dogs, and I can share that these mats hold up great! I washed on gentle and dried on delicate and both came out looking great and held up perfectly! I was worried that the non slip backing would be an issue, but it wasn\u2019t at all! Super pleased!",

So far so good. Washes well too.",

If you just want something utilitarian to step on when you get out of the shower, they're ok, but I wanted something that was a pleasure to sink my toes into, and something soft and cushioning when standing in front of the bathroom vanity. I would not recommend or buy again.",

My bathroom is a little small, but it does fit okay if I put it an inch away from the tub to cover the floor between tub and door. I'm going to order a separate little cheap washable rug for the floor between toilet and door. (Everyone sits, so nobody's peeing on anything. Just our bathroom floor feels like stone and not pleasant on the feet.)",

They do make a big deal of not putting them on wet floors, I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s just a liability thing and would be true of any bath rug/mat, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. Again, if\u2014over time\u2014that changes, I will update. TL, DR: super soft, would buy again.",
