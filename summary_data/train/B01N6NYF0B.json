      "text": "I strive to keep my kitchen uncluttered and functional, filled with tools rather than gadgets. This is a gadget, and one that isn't better than a convection oven. In fact, a convection oven is better, because you can cook larger quantities. I wouldn't buy this again, and don't recommend this product for most people. I think it would be best used by single people who don't cook a lot and heat a lot of convenience foods (young college kids living alone, for example). Making fish sticks for one, a small amount of Oreida fries etc is what this product is best for. For all else--either frying or using a regular convection oven is better.",

Same with anything that is light. the air will move the food around in the basket. chicken wings come out blistered-the skin gets so much air that they dry out and blister. Ive tried different temperatures -same problem. I am convinced its due to the high airflow and there is no way to adjust it. Also when you open the basket to check on something, the fan keeps running. My old airfryer cooked much better and paused when you opened the basket. I am returning it.",
