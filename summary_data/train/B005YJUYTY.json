You have to insert the key into two key-holes at the same time, and then use the key to forcefully pry open the box. But guess what, it only comes with one key. That makes it really really hard to open. The box also doesn't stand up to rain very well. There are some drainage holes but they aren't in the right place. When it rains, the box gets filled up with water, which ruins the poison bait, and also gets full of mold.",

I have no plans to look for anything else as they work perfect for my intended use. I would recommend buying them by the case not singly also",

My only gripe is there is no window. In the case of a rat, I can see their tail and rear outside of the box. A mouse you need to open the lid with the key. I bought 18, so yikes!
