I use this along with a sleep elephant that has a good lullaby but turns off after 45 min and it projects stars onto the ceiling which my son looks at every time before falling asleep.",

Some of the things I don\u2019t care for are that the machine itself feels inexpensive. It is lightweight plastic and the buttons make noise when pressed. I know it\u2019s a noise machine but my son loves the white noise sound and if i need to adjust the volume, it sometimes can disturb him. I do agree with other reviewers that the lullaby sounds are a bit repetitive and sound pretty basic. Since I\u2019m using this for a baby that\u2019s pretty much the norm anyways.",

Overall it works well and is just what we were looking for at a very good price. 5 stars.",

No more running out of batteries in the middle of the night. (It can also run on batteries, which will be great for travel.)

The ocean sound is the only one serviceable, so that's all we use. It's definitely over priced, should be like $5. The only other reason we kept it is the option for battery or plug in when traveling.",

My granddaughter is only a month old and this device pleases her...makes her feel contented. I am relieved for my daughter because she is sleep deprived.",

If you want to turn the volume down (or turn it off, set the auto off timer, or press any button) you have to press the button numerous times until you get the volume level you want. So, in an attempt to make it quieter, you first have to hear, \"CLACK, CLACK, CLACK, CLACK, CLACK etc....\" on the volume button. It's pretty irritating and poor execution on the designers part.",
