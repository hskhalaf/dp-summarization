Best brand specifically is currently being used at lake Anna because they have already worked to save numerous lives. Which is why they asked specifically for this brand. If saving a life isn't enough of a review I don't know what is.",

      "text": "The good: This product works well, is easy to use and is portable. It offers protection from electric shock drowning and allows you to check for electric current around your boat which can cause electrical oxidation damage to your running gear. The bad: The battery is not replaceable. The company states that the battery can last 12 to 18 months continuously on and possibly longer if turned off. Turning off means placing a magnet to a piece of velcro on the device. Simple off solution that I never followed. To be fair, the device lasted for about two years constant on.",
