I really love these Vans, because they're extremely comfortable, light and much slouchier than other Vans which can feel quite heavy and restricting due to them being made for skateboarding! I'm sure these would also be great for skateboarding too, as long as you're experienced! The color of these were exactly what I wanted and I love the \"Vans Off The Wall\" logo on these, it looks very sweet!! The sizing on these is perfect also. Will definitely be buying more of these in different colors, an awesome shoe for us Ladies!",

Really?! C'mon! Honestly sometimes I actually think she just wants me to get beaten up at school.
