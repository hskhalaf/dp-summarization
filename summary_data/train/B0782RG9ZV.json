Another plus - pop the cap on the top and you can have a drink too. A plus purchase all the way around.",

It fits in the cup holder and the silicone part stays flat on the ground for the dog to drink from so you don't have to hold on to it. I was able to clip it onto my backpack when we went hiking. It also did not leak at all so I wasn't afraid to put it inside my backpack.",

The \"cap\" for the spout is easily removed and get's knocked off. I've used mine 4 times now and each time water has leaked out onto the contents of the bag. Since most others who purchased are happy with it, It dawned on me that perhaps the one I received is faulty. Hoping I can connect with the manufacturer or seller for more info. Would love to upgrade my star rating on this product.",

The carabiner and handle both fall into the bowl while in use. In the past I used one of the ones with a stiff plastic \"bowl\" that flips open. It lasted for years until a fall on hard ground cracked the connection point between bottle and bowl. I'm now going to try a collapsable silicon bowl. It will take up less room in my pack and I can share my water with my dog rather than needing a separate bottle.",
