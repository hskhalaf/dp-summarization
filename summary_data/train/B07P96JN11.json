I did a 10 day trip shark fishing and have used it several days backpacking. I can charge everything nightly for 7 days before i run out of power. I'm totally amazed by how much power it retains. It charges fast and has ports for everything I need all at once. I've had several 10k chargers in the past. This charger is so much better for me and worth the weight.",

I had primarily bought this based off of reviews of others about it charging there surface pro, or to say the least at least keep it on. It will definitely keep your small laptop or heavier output device on but be mindful it's really for minimal use. I was editing photo and video while keeping it plugged in and it would hold the charge even for a good 30 minutes but would decrease little by little after that. It's about the size of an ipad mini. a little bit smaller but bigger than an iphone X Max or whatever the biggest iphone is out.",

It has a nice weight to it, nice non slippery texture and it holds a charge. I haven't used it much but it held the initial full charge much longer than I thought it would. I have yet to charge more than two devises at a time with it (iPhone, iPad, or blue tooth earbuds), but there are ports to charge up to four devises at once. I don't think anyone would be disappointed with this bank.",

Apparently the cables included with the power bank are REALLY cheap and I just threw them out because I had other cables. One HUGE drawback is there is no pass through charging feature which allows for the charging of the device and battery at the same time. So, all in all, for the price, I guess the product is okay but would be willing to pay a bit more for better cables and pass-through charging.",

I tested the output on my galaxy s8 and it is really quick charge. As you can see in my uploaded screenshot of my phone, it says fast charging on the bottom when using this power bank. It is definitely a big power bank and not very light. But you would expect that of a power bank with huge capacity. However it is slim and the case is useful if you want to take it somewhere.

The cables they provide are CHARGING ONLY, they do not provide any data from what I have tried. Only complaint I can think of is I'd prefer the included charging cords were a tad bit longer but I understand that they're trying to minimize the total bulk of carrying around a portable charger.",

Update: The manufacturer sent me a new one upon learning of this issue, and I just now got around to provide an update. So far the new unit is working flawlessly. I just hope this will last a few years before I run into another issue. Now that's customer service!",

Small thing I don\u2019t like about the product is the texture of the outside that doesn\u2019t seem to last long overtime, but other that it does it\u2019s job and is worth it for the price of a long and durable battery.",
