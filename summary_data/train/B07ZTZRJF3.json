But the last three packages that came in were horrible... the drapers are now bunching up right at the critical area, allowing urine to escape easily. I have come home to find the diaper dry and the floor wet where the dog peed. I suspect the design may have been changed, along with cheaper material causing the bunching? There used to be two sticky tabs on the diaper to fix them shut, but now it is one hook and loop / Velcro fastener. While fastening with one Velcro strip is easier to do, its worthless with the drapers not working.",

Be sure the edges are not folded under. Fit snugly. Dogs CAN roll on their backs and try to loosen these, so keep an eye on them. These can also discourage or prevent marking indoors, but should be combined with proper training and opportunities to go outside, along with neuter if that has not already been done. Healthy dogs of any age and size can learn. It may mean hiring a dog walker. There is no reason for any healthy dog to be peeing inside a home.",
