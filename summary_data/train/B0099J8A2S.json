The low light focusing ability is outstanding, the shutter whispers, and it is great for sports and wildlife photography. This is a fully customizable professional level camera. I wouldn't recommend jumping to this level if you are a point and shoot photographer. Try the Pentax k-30, k-50, or k-500 instead. You won't miss having a full frame camera.",

I paired this body with a used Sigma short zoom lens (also purchased through Amazon) and have a very nice walk-around camera system. I also purchased a Pentax 35mm prime lens for low-light and \"street\" photography. A very nice package.",

I have yet to test this one in that fashion, but it seems equally able to survive a 50 yard tumble down the slope, when my grip on it turned out to be somewhat less secure that it felt, with only a cracked lens hood.",

My 15-year old granddaughter demonstrated outstanding artistic and technical ability on that trip so I bought the K-5 II and passed the K-5 on to her to add to her kit. The K-5 has some welcome improvements, but I really wanted an excuse to pass on the K-5 to her, and this was a good opportunity to do that. Both of us are pleased with the K-5 versions - whisper-quiet shutter for nature photography, rapid autofocus for action, plenty of MPs for cropping and extensive enlarging, etc. By the way, we have installed KatzEye OptiBrite precision focusing screens for improved accuracy and tack-sharp manual focusing.",
