After using the new one for 2 weeks, exactly the same portion of plastic cracked near the power button. I returned it and decided to buy a different brand. When I bought another kettle (different brand), I noticed that the plasticky smell that usually accompanied the boiled water disappeared. Turns out that I put up with that smell for 2 years and didn't even know that it was because of the Breville kettle. Will not buy Breville again...",

In our experience the on/off switch has been one of the weak points in its design but our latest kettle feels more positive as you switch it on so maybe, if there was a design flaw, it has been remedied. The soft opening lid is excellent for protecting your hand from scalding steam and the Breville plug design makes plugging it in and out a breeze. I would definitely recommend this product.",

Chose a Fellow, with full stainless construction on the inside to replace, because this one had plastic on the inside, which the steam would always condense on, which would then drip back into the receptacle. Not into having plastic (BPA free or otherwise) in contact with something that I drink.",

He makes himself a large container full almost daily, I use it to heat water for my large teapot for me, preheat water to go into my pressure cooker which saves on propane costs and for any other tasks where I might need boiling water. Nice stainless steel container that has kept right on perking all these years. Cleans up easily and has a fairly small footprint on the counter.",

The only slight niggle is that it doesn't switch off automatically if you lift it off the stand, but will carry on boiling when you replace it. Nevertheless I give it 5 stars as it is a great kettle.",

The boiling cycle is, of course, interrupted when you remove the kettle from its base, but unlike most modern electric kettles, this one does not turn itself off, so it will resume heating the water when it's placed back on the base.

After over a month of use, we are very satisfied. We use it at least 3 times a day, and it is performing very well. Right out of the box it did smell of plastic, but I boiled and dumped several times as suggested in the instructions-- including once with vinegar which sat over night. That seemed to take care of it, and we were getting clean, pure water on the second day. The unit has a sturdy feel to it, and looks good. Completely satisfied.",

In the beginning I was wiping it down inside after use to make sure it didn't rust but I feel like this is a beast and doesn't even need it. It's made so well. I love Breville. They're really great products (I have 4 now) and they're sleek and modern without looking overcomplicated.",

Anyway, hot water will poured through the mesh making contacts to plastic. Also the water level indicator has two rubber holes upper and lower, and the level window looks like plastic too. Please take a look at the photos I noted for your information. I can say it has less plastic than others, but it is not accurate to say it doesn't have plastic.",
