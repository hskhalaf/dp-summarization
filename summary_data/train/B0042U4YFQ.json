We purchased a new traveling trailer and purchased this mat since it matched perfect in color and size. We did not open the mat until our first camping trip (3wks after receiving order). We were happy with the size but HIGHLY disappointed in the quality of the mat. When opened from the package we realized there was a small area where the threading was already coming apart creating a hole. We are going to try and repair it ourselves but would not purchase from this kind of product from Amazon again.",

This is my fourth order and lay them end to end full length of our RV, handles rain very well, does have to have additional stakes as wind moves it very easily.

The material is woven strands of plastic so you don't have to worry about it getting wet or mold. The strands will actually separate enough to put a stake through without damaging the product. The design matches our RV so that is just an added bonus! It is light enough that I put tent stakes in the corners to make sure the wind didn't lift it up. Actually, I put the BBQ on one corner and a potted plan on the other and then staked the remaining two.",

The case is the same here, the packaging was all torn up and the label said it was way smaller than what we ordered. However, once opened the product was exactly what we had ordered and it was in NEW condition. The product itself, although we haven't had it long we have done some \"bad\" things to it (put stuff on it that should have damaged it) and it withstood the abuse and still looks great. Great value, great quality. Overall for us, \"Don't judge a book by it's cover\" certainly applies.",

      "text": "I had purchased one of these several years ago, in different shades of colors to match the Class A that we had then. After we traded it in last fall and got a new motorhome, we needed one with a different color scheme to match our new rig. We love that these mats fold nicely and are lightweight. They're easy to sweep, or hose off and dry quickly. They are also soft enough to walk around barefoot on, even if it's staked down over gravel. The only downside would be...campfire embers that sometimes waift through the air and land on it, leave little burn holes (like cigarette burns).",

The bag has ample room for folding back up. It keeps a good barrier from the ground to the surface. It is a nylon type material so camp fire sparks will blow a hole in them. Haha. Speaking from experience. Quality product and nice design. 4 corners have tent peg loops to secure your Matt. Well made loops. At the moment going on about 10 trips with the Matt in dusty, dirt environment. Still holds up great. Hose it down dry it out looks like new",

There are a couple of small burn holes from my son-in-law cigarette ashes...but no unraveling. It has held up and cleaned up each time remarkably well. I was going to be happy to get one season, but this mat is going to last for years. Very pleased with this purchase!",
