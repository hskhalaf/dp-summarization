I watched a video to make sure it wasn\u2019t operator error, and I found I was not making mistakes. The handle/crank failed to press out enough dough to make a consistent-sized batch of cookies. Frustrated I gave up. Yesterday I decided to try again with a different less-firm dough. This time, the plastic handle popped and cracked and fell off. This is probably because the inside gears were defective and too much pressure was being applied to the handle causing it to fall off. I got close-to no use of this product before deciding it\u2019s going to the trash.",
