Regarding fit, I wear size 11, I got a 10.5 for length to match. Regarding width, it's hard to put them on, but once it's on, it has the tightness of a size 8 in the middle and tightness of size 12 in the toes and ankles, kinda like an hour glass/snow boots. Construction is average. The N sign in the middle/inside distorts the fabric to bend inward when walking so it scrapes against your foot a little with each step.",

This pair is giving me a little more trouble than normal, though, possibly in part because it\u2019s a different model (I usually go with the 574s). Everything else about them is great - the support, the lace-up pattern, the color - so I\u2019m hoping a little more break-in will happen the more I wear them.
