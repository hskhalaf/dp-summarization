The control panel can be easily placed anywhere in the room (ours is five feet from our shower heads so we can turn it on without getting wet). We have a main showerhead and body sprays connected to the two outlet ports. Our shower is always the perfect temperature as soon as we step in (I like 101 degrees and my wife likes 109), and it maintains temperature even if someone is doing dishes, running the laundry or flushes a toilet. Highly recommend!",

This is so easy compared to the old manual valves that were use the other heads all the time, that is the best feature. Temp control is perfect even after flushing toilet. I am so happy and I read a lot of reviews and studied up on all options. I have 4 heads and to berry same moen manual valves would be 560 dollars less. This is very much worth that cost to upgrade. And, I installed it all myself, instructions were helpful. This is a must if you ate going to have multiple heads.",

Not sure what the issue was, but it hasn't happened after the first week. I understand that there is an app to control the water. The unit is installed in my boys' bathroom and they use Alexa to turn on the water-based on their user profile and heat setting. Fantastic product.",

That. loses the high end customer. Instead Moen should make a model that allows different temperatures for different outlets, volume controls, and programming of spa experiences.
