The only way you'd know its 720P is if you came from a 1080P phone. Sound is plenty loud from the speaker and everything on this phone is intuitive. I owned the Optimus G Pro and now the LG G Flex and this is an improvement. I can't believe that Samsung sells more phones than LG. I owned my S4 for a week before I traded it to Gamestop for an iPad. The S4 felt like a plastic toy and junky. Both LG phones have felt luxurious and premium feeling.",

Late for a meeting or missed a call? Take action in an instant directly from the notifications shade.\n\nSmooth Operator. More reactive and uniform touch responses mean you can almost feel the pixels beneath as your finger moves across the screen. .\n\nLive in the Now. With Google Now, you get the right information at just the right time -- before you even ask. It can tell you today's weather before you start your day, or when the next train will arrive as you're standing on the platform. .\n\nSmarter Keyboard with Gesture Typing.
