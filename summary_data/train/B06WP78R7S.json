Not expensive but if you order one check your plumbing and be prepared. Update. The plumbing attachments do NOT require a trip to the hardware store. There is an adapter that hooks to the bottom of the tank that works fine.",

With the Boss Bidet getting very good reviews and the extended 2 year warranty, I decided to give it a try. You never know exactly what you might be getting based on product reviews, but I have to say I am extremely pleased with this purchase. I wasn't sure that I would be able to install this on my own without getting into trouble like past projects. To my amazement, the installation went quickly and smoothly. I love this product. It works as advertised. In fact I liked it so much, I bought 2 more for Christmas presents. Thanks Boss!",
