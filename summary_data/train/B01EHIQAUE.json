They don't fall out - hooray - and are comfy too. It's so nice to run without worrying about a wire, and not to have to run holding my phone. Can't recommend them highly enough.",

First, the foam tips dried up and tore apart, then the earbuds died themselves. They are not holding any charge anymore. Jaybird would not even care to provide support to countries outside of their sales network. (I live in Turkey) In the old days of Jaybird Bluebuds X they would be shipping me a new pair in no time but now under Logitech's ownership Jaybird's support is pretty much deadbeat. Edit: They did accept sending me a replacement but only to a US adress, stating not having an international warranty.",

And I can wear my snow gear tight over my ears. The X-1 and X-2 were phenomenal but the new freedom are definitely next level. My only drawback so it doesn't seem like I work for the company is the piggy back charger could be a little more aerodynamic. But we can save that for a later model. Lol.",

For running, I highly recommend the silicone ear fins rather than the other tips that are provided since they're more secure. All that said, the earbuds are tiny and constantly feel like they're going to fall out. And the sound they provide is only so-so, not nearly what I'd expect for the price ($150 as of this writing).",

Next will be the wings meant to secure the headphones in your ear. Oh and if the headphones aren't clipped onto your shirt, the heavy battery and controls will pull the headphones down the right side. All in all, they are a pain to handle.",

The wireless feature is great in this realm as well .. especially when running both outside and on a treadmill. They sync easily to my bluetooth devices, and the battery life is as promised.

The hydrophobic nano-coating also makes the whole earbud waterproof, preventing sweat, snow, and rain from affecting your sound quality!\n\nA wide variety of customized fit options are already included inside the box. The patented silicone ear fins (S, M, L) securely keep the buds inside your ears or can be used to hang them over the top. Lift the cord off your neck for a comfortable workout experience! Also, the Comply memory foam ear tips are designed to provide maximum noise isolation and comfort. They lock in the earbuds for a super secure fit, whether you\u2019re on a calm jog, riding an MTB trail, or rushing to your next big meeting.\n\nAdditionally, the MySound app allows you to tweak every aspect of your sound: from the rumbling lows to the sweetest highs! Customize every little detail with the easy-to-understand interface. Compatible with iOS 9+ and Android 4.4+, your customized presets are saved directly onto the Freedom buds, carrying over to any music device or streaming service/app you use. Listen the way you want to or discover how your favorite athletes and artists enjoy their music through their custom sound profiles. Also, the Multipoint feature allows you to simultaneously pair and connect the Freedom buds to two different Bluetooth devices. Listen to your music through your laptop while still answering calls on your phone with the bud controller. You can also share your music with your spotter or workout buddy, as two separate buds can connect to the same Bluetooth device, eliminating the need to share earphones. You can even connect to your smartwatch and leave your smartphone at home!\n\nWith the Jaybird Freedom Headphones\u2019 on-the-go clip charger, you\u2019ll be ready for any adventure.
