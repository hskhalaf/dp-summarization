      "text": "My shoe size is a size 8 and when it comes to trainers, the size up could be 8 1/2, 9 , upwards depending. I chanced on size 8 1/2 before i settled on size 9 which was a relief. The size 8 1/2 in asics was just too tight and narrow for me, and i had to exchange them for a 9. The 9 is a perfect fit for me now and i have yet to try them out properly. I like Asics because they are a tougher and more put together runner shoe, especially underneath the shoe. My pair of Airs are collapsing after a few months wear and tear. I am sure that these will outlast them.",
