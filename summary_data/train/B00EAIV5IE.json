I would prefer I slightly larger bottle, to get me through more of the day, but the next size up is too big. A buddy tells me his leaked on a plane due to pressure difference, however this top does prevents leakage provided it is pressed firmly down, under normal conditions.",

It does a great job of keeping cool beverages cold, but beware that it also keeps hot beverages HOT. Whatever the temperature of your beverage, the bottle will conduct it so don't clean it with hot water as you will get a nasty surprise. The Sport cap takes a bit of getting used to. I missed being able to pour water without removing the cap, but you get used to it quickly. I would buy this again.",

Its only this canteen and try as I may to wash it over and over, it wont go away. The canteen's outer blue paint has worn away on half of it and its actually been dented by being dropped once. I am frustrated with the lack of solid canteens and the life of this particular one.",

Anytime I go on some sort of hike, I have this water bottle with me. I haven't had any paint chipping issues. However, it should also be mentioned that these aren't dishware safe, according to the manufacturer. I haven't ran it through the dishwasher. Overall, great water bottle.

This seems to be the case for plastic bottles in general, so it is no reflection on the quality of Nalgene products. Enter the Kleen Kanteen: It has been a dream to keep clean & fresh regardless of the beverage of my choice. Food-grade stainless steel is definitely the way to go in this regard. I have relegated the Tritan to water-only use.",
