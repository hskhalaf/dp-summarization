      "text": "I have to say that I am impressed. I've gone from like bing in a 2,000 sq ft gone to a 31' rv. Space is much different now. This trash can is perfect for an rv, an apartment, or any small space. That's s not to say it's tiny. It's plenty good sized. Assembly was a cinch and operation equally as easy. My big trash compactor cost $700, and many cost much more. This is a value-minded product plus a money saver in trash bags. Without a compactor, I go through 3-4 trash bags a week. This should take me back to one a week.",

The handle (orange things you hang the bag on did not keep the bag from sinking into the trash) amwas not a good design, and fell apart. I tried to put it together but it keeps popping apart. This is an extremely expensive garage trash receptacle now, and I still have the issues I was trying to resolve with this purchase.",
