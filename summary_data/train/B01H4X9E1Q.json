Most of those who have tested it have welcomed its appealing looks, its comfortable underfoot platform, and its secure upper coverage. According to them, it\u2019s a solid option for road running. But for some, it was narrow in the forefoot area.",

        "The color schemes that are available for the Mizuno Wave Prophecy 6 received some praise from many runners",
        "A reviewer commented that the heel section of the upper unit hugged the foot snugly, but it didn\u2019t feel too tight",
        "A lot of testers were able to describe this shoe as \u2018comfortable\u2019 for their feet",
        "According to a purchaser, the toe box was roomy enough to allow natural toe-splay",
        "The raised mid-foot platform was able to support those with flat feet, and they stated that it prevented fatigue during those extended running sessions",
        "A consumer commented on the padding in the upper unit, noting that it provided some cushioning as it hugged the foot",
        "The mid-sole in this shoe gained the favor of several runners because, for them, it was responsive and reliable",
        "Many purchasers noted that the 6th version of the Prophecy was better in quality and construction than its predecessors",
        "The general width and length of the shoe seemed a bit narrow for a few testers",

I also think the cushioning is fantastic. I always wear I 9.5 and that's what I bought. They fit perfect. I think unlike others that they have gotten better. I usually wear wave creations but this is my second wave prophecy. I had the 4s and now the 6s are better. I have to say my 4s deteriorated fast. Way faster than my wave creations ever have. I was not too sure about buying these. But I can tell they are constructed way better than my 4s were.",

The WP 6 seems a bit shorter and therefore loose around the padded collar/ankle. They are holding up as well as my WP 2's that took 3 years of abuse and 1,000 of miles with my 250-270 lbs frame. I run an average of 10 miles a week about 40-50 weeks out of the year. So, longest I have ever owned a shoe was with Mizuno.",

My advice if you purchase this shoe is get it one size larger and if you have a wide foot not to buy it at all. I love Wave Prophecy shoes and own several pairs of older models but each new model year they seem to get smaller and narrower. I have bought my last pair because of this. Wake up Mizuno you are killing a great shoe and running your reputation.",

Ive found out from experience, if my shoe isn't comfortable then ,my back will hurt. This shoe has helped so much. It is worth the price and will buy another pair when these wear out.",
