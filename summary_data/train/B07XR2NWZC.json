Another thing when you click on streaming on google Hub display sometimes it can't connect and you have to do it again and again. However with the Tapo app you can control camera easier.

These alarms are linked to any movement detected by the camera and would frighten off any potential burglar. They are also linked to my smart phone and also Alexa.

I note from other reviews that others had similar problems with the 128gb. I would advise to ignore a 128gb and use a 32gb which gives a massive 4/5 24hour recording.

May purchase some PIR sensors to work along side to help with lighting. Other than that really good quality cameras, easy to use, easy to set up and can be used in conjunction with the Echo Show 8",

This is after the latest update that seems to have fixed a few other issues but without a permanent live view I can't give it more than one star as a baby monitor.

First impressions are good: the unit looks ok, if a bit plasticky, and offers good functionality, especially at this price point. Video in all conditions is good, but capped at 15 fps. If that's ok for you then really there's little to complain about. Sound too is ok. The only reason I've marked it down is because live streaming to Google Nest Hub is limited to 5 minutes, then shuts off. This renders it unsuitable for longer monitoring, which was one of my main requirements. Also, I haven't yet been able to stream live to a Chromecast.",

Set up is simple using the Tapo app, and the control of the cameras is highly intuitive and simple. These cameras record to SD card which must be bought separately. 32GB is good enough with Motion Detection for quite a while, depending on the amount of motion of course. The recorded files can be played back via the app, saved and sent on if required. Look out for these on sale for around \u00a324 each, which is outstanding value. They typically retail on Amazon for \u00a334. These have become my Go To cameras.",

      "text": "The camera is okay the picture is blurred also on night mode it just puts all the images black so your carnt see anything but if you leave it in day mode it works better.. Also I've bought 3 memory cards for the camera and the camera keeps rejecting it saying that it won't accept it so I carnt have it on live video which is very disappointing. I wouldnt recommend as I carnt even use the camera properly due to it rejecting the micro sd card. You'll also find that it gets very hot",

Cheap, easy to set up, easy to use, can access footage and turn it off and on with your phone at any time from anywhere. Great value for money purchase. Only downside is that the motion detection is very sensitive so I get a notification sometimes when the sun goes behind a cloud and the light in the hallway changes, but at least I know it is picking up all movement.",

In the week I\u2019ve had it I\u2019ve only had one offline/technical issue, turning it off and on again resolved this. I suspect I\u2019ll be buying more in the future for other areas of the house.",
