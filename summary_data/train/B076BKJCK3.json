      "text": "Great planner! Ordered it in early June and was happy that it starts out in May so I only missed out on 1 month's use haha. Perfect for planning work projects and taking notes. Am too lazy to fill out those undated planners so I enjoy having it already planned for me in advance. Has a nifty spot on the side that holds and fits most of my pens. Looks very professional but is a little bulky for my small camera bag. Wished it was a little thinner somehow! Would definitely recommend though as a daily planner especially for work, projects, and school!",

I have had this planner for a few weeks, and I have had no problems! It lays flat on my desk so I can write in it easily. Binding is flexible enough to fold completely over, but strong enough not to wear over time. Lots of room for extra notes, large blocks on monthly calendar to fit multiple messages. I will be purchasing this for my husband to use for his business appointments!",

The black exterior and binding is nice and feels more \"mature\" of a choice than other bright, clip art-like covers (but otherwise good options too). I think there are too many lined note pages after the months and weeks for what I would need but it's a good bonus in case I need that space for quick memos. This adds to the overall weight but I don't mind it. I ended up buying this over other planners because the photos showed a lot more space for Mon-Fri. Very useful to have a lot of room for college-level courses.",

You have to buy multiple products to have that option. The layout is simple, and it\u2019s exactly what I wanted. It\u2019s as thick as a daily planner, but that\u2019s due to the notes pages.

A stretchy band keeps the planner closed in my bag. I am a teacher and I divided the M-F pages into thirds for the three courses that I teach.

A cheap cover that won't hold up for one year. --- This planner has none of those problems and is an excellent find. As long as they keep their price reasonable (NOT $30 OMG) I'll buy these forever.

It is nicely constructed and the pages have a nice heavy paper weight to them. They feel like they will hold up and pens will not bleed through. There is plenty of room for notes on the monthly and daily pages for each month of the year as well as plenty of pages for notes. My only hang up is it's too nice to just throw away when done. It cannot be reused or refilled.",

My favorite part is having 2 bookmarks so that I can easily flip between the month layout and the weekly layout if I choose. The stickers are a nice touch! Also, my pen holder never broke this year, so I was able to attach a pen to it at all times. Overall a great planner!",

The layout is very simple with adequate space. It's not overly decorated and they don't bombard you with stickers either.

      "text": "What sold me most on this planner was watching the video describing it. Last year I purchased a larger sized planner (different brand) so it would lay flat. This one is smaller, fits better in my bag & lays flat. Has plenty of blank note pages & love the pocket in the back as well as a pen holder. I purchased one for me and one for my husband & one for my daughter after she saw how great they were. Also, love that there are 2-page marker ribbons. My only change would to be to make the cover smooth not textured-I like to use it as a pad when signing papers or taking quick notes.",

The rest: The paper is fairly thick; ghosting with a juicy rollerball, fountain pen and gel inks, bleed-through with felt tip pens.

Only \"down\" side is the sticker tabs - no instructions, so I did the first month wrong but figured out how they were to be applied quickly afterward.
