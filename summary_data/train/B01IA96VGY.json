I try to keep them at home at all times, and carry them with me to my grandchildren's ballgames. When my 6 year old grandson was stung by a wasp at poolside last summer, a few swabs with one of these gave him enough relief to continue swimming, and stopped his tears. This is something you hope you won't have to use, but well worth every penny when they are needed!",
