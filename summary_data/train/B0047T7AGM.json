Works flawlessly and as a bonus it acts as a docking and charging station for your iPhone/iPod that u can have situated anywhere in your home/office. The awesome thing about Sonos' products is the similarity with Apple's software, interface, and hardware design and look/feel, which as we all know, is no bad thing... These guys make superb, highly-refined and well-thought out products. This one is no exception.",
