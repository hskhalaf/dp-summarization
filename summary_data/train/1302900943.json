      "text": "Big fan of adult coloring books and of Star Wars. The issue with this one is that there really isn't much to color. Imagine a picture of Darth Vadar (\"helpfully\" already printed in full black) and a lot of storm troopers (white). There were a few buttons you could color, but that was about it. This happens a lot in this book. I get it - some of it is just that parts of Star Wars are starkly black and white. It's just a pet peeve of mine to have all the black already colored in for me. Not the end of the world. Just wish I hasn't spent the money.",
