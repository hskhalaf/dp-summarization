Looking in the label I can see they were made in two different countries. Obviously the new slippers were either made with a different kind of leather or they were just cut too small. I waited too long hoping they would wear in but they did not. If you purchase these, I recommend you get one size larger or return them immediately if they don't feel comfortable.",

But I feel like wearing socks with the slippers makes them too tight. But they are wonderful, like a hug for your feet! And I use them every day, its easy to take the dogs out back (I don't leave the porch) and not have to change into sneakers! Will definitely buy again but might opt for the 10?",

I didn't expect there to be a lot of arch support in these, as most slippers don't have a lot. These definitely do not have arch support but they are very cozy due to the plush lining.
