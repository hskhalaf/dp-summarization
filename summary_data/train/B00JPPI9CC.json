They have worked great for that purpose. The stockings are not very thick, but again, they are cheap in price. If you are looking to buy a bunch of stockings and not spend a fortune, these should work well. In one picture, only the red stockings are the Windy City Novelties 15\" Red Felt Stockings. It has been a good, cheap way to help co-workers get in a festive mood. :)",
