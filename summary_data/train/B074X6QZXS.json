Also, pieces F are ever-so slightly angled and must be placed in the proper direction. How do you know which direction? Trial and error. The instructions show arrows pointing to a direction but forget to show the angle on the reinforcement. Another complaint is that some of the shelves are not fully drilled out where the screw nuts go. You won't realize this until it gets stuck and the screws won't go in.",

They were labeled the same letter, but clearly need to go on one side versus the other to make everything line up properly. Once together though, it looks really nice. It is very sturdy and I have no fear of in toppling forward or falling apart. So, if you don't mind a bit of a challenge in the assembly department, then I would recommend this shelf.",

      "text": "I went on Amazon to look for a corner baker's rack for my plants. I wanted a rack that would fit in my corner space, would blend with my dark wood dining room table, and that was not expensive. The VASAGLE Corner Shelf was perfect. It was not expensive, easy to assemble, and blended well with my decor. The rack is not as tall as a baker rack or deep; but it fit perfect in my kitchen. I am so pleased with this product that I intend to order more products for a three-piece group to place in my home office.",

The product is pretty sturdy but if it was put through a lot or bumped into often it may not hold up as well",
