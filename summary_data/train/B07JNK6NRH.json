Pulling the tent over the frame was a challenge and would have been easier with another person helping. I stood on a sturdy step stool and pulled the top over the frame. The last bottom corner would not fit over the frame; but my large shoe horn did the trick, allowing the tent to slip over that last corner. There were no tears, no broken zippers, or other problems. I'm happy and ready to grow 15 medicine plants.",

I love the mesh storage pockets to keep my extra straps and trimmer organized. The day I ordered this tent Amazon just happened to be offering a lightning deal 15% off.

I have a nice looking grow tent set-up the materials are all good quality",

I will try not to shop opulent in the future unless they can make this right someway, somehow? Lets find out...",

I like this one over other because the door to access your plants is situated lower which in turn makes it easier to do your work and not bend over as much as other. Plus this tent is about $25 cheaper than others of the same quality. Will but again",

The only COMPLAINT I have is the top cross bars move alot, but I believe that's so you can move your lights back and forth. still need maybe a peice of rubber or something to steady it up.",
