You have to take a pump or two and rub it into your face DRY, no water at first (think of it like a cleansing balm and cleanser in one). Rub it all around, even on your eye make up. Then, with lukewarm water, wash it all off. All my makeup and greasiness from the day come off, yet my skin still feels supple.",
