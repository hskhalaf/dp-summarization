Revised Feb 2017: Exactly 2 years and a couple of days which is just out of warranty, the battery has ceased to charge to an extent where it will work for more than 1 or 2 minutes. I'm removing 3 of my original stars as there is no way to replace the battery easily, there is no service station near me, and Black and Deckers Help Chat doesn't respond. See attached photo of the battery setup. Evidently designed with planned obsolescence!!",

This little machine replaces an older B&D model that we had for probably 5 or 6 years. It has a more powerful motor and battery life lasts long enough to do basic jobs. It picks up dust, pet hair, spider webs - basically whatever. Very satisfied except for the noise. It's not just that the motor is loud in itself, but also the wind passing through the hose (high pitch whistling) is like fingernails on a chalkboard at times. You'll definitely wake up the whole house when you turn it on.",

Taking a stiff brush to it can help a bit, but what is really required is a redesign that will allow the inner screen assembly to be removed for cleaning.",

The curve of the hose attachment makes it hard to get into small spaces and when the hose is extended you need two hands to vacuum. The long attachment became completely useless after about 6 weeks because the vacuum had not enough suction power to pick up anything.

Of course it didn't work completely and there was hair on the couch that I typically can't get off using a 'pet roller' with tape. The vacuum had no problem with it!
