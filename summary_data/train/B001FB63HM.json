They're certainly better than the hi-hats that came with the drum set, but they still do not sound the greatest. They're great if you need something to practice on if you're a beginner, but if you really care about the tones you're creating while playing drums, you'll probably be dissatisfied with these. You get what you pay for.",

Update 2018/03/08: I eventually got tired of the brassy sound. I came into a pair of Meinl MCS (B8 bronze) hats, and while they sound slightly better, I'm still looking to replace them with some B20 bronze hi-hats now. I still think the HCSs are a good value, but I personally won't add any more brass cymbals to my collection in the future.",
