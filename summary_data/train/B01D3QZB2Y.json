After posting my initial rating, I was promptly and graciously contacted by Symphonized's Customer Service and was informed that they would take care of any issue I was having!

Of course you'd get better headphones for bigger bucks, but I think these are the best in this price range (or even in the next price range).",

      "text": "One of the best earbuds I've ever had, hands down. The sound quality of these earbuds is amazing! The bass is very good as well. They come with several different sizes of silicone earpieces, and they are very comfortable. My ears never get sore when I use these. The remote on the wires always works perfectly, and is easy to get to. You can turn the volume up and down, pause and play, and skip tracks using the remote. The audio jack where the earbuds plug into the phone is very strong and sturdy, and feels like it will hold up to a lot of use. And for the price you can't go wrong with these earbuds!",

Sound overall: 1/5 Tries so hard to be bassy that mids and highs suffer heavily and the base isn't that great to begin with. Sound for $25: 3.5/5 It does its job... Portability: 5/5 they are earbuds, small, portable and low profile. Every earbud would get 5/5. If sound quality and comfort aren't a concern you use earbuds. Looks: 5/5 Love the wood and chrome",

Well.... no... bass is pretty mediocre. For EBooks, light listening, hooking into a Roku remote, these would be good choices. For music, not so much. Spend more on something else.",

Before, with my regular, basic earbuds, I had a hard time hearing my music over all the machines. At the same level of sound with these, I could hear the music nice and clear. No need to go above the recommended loudness level to hear my music with these.",

I will never purchase these earphones again. While the sound quality is great, they were NOT manufactured to last a reasonable period of time, as evidence that the warranty is ONLY 30 days. I should have read between the lines. Seriously?????",

Sent email to Symphonized and was told that it was just cosmetic and their warranty does not cover this. I find this a disturbing policy for something that is just 1.5 months old. I am afraid that the cable will now either rip out or the insulation will be cut but the metal piece. No because of their warranty I cannot recommend their products.",
