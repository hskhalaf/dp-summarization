      "text": "I recently purchased FCS's double soft surfboard rack to take 2 surfboards to the beach (~3hr drive). The straps were very easy to setup and fit great on my 2001 Jetta Sedan. I was able to quickly put the boards on and off the car when we decided to switch to a different beach. They were perfect until it started raining...All 4 locations where the straps came into the car started gushing with water and I ended up with a small lake under my shorts...",

      "text": "These are awesome. got them after i tried another brand but returned those. its a very simple design but you want the d ring instead of the spring leaded clip/claw type. its way more secure, and you want that extra security when you have a $600+ board flying down the road at 70mph. After the first time or 2, you can put this on your car in 2 min or less, and then another 2 min to put your board or boards on. Trust me, get these, dont even get the other fcs ones that have the spring loaded clips, get the d ring!",

I have used it with a single longboard about five times and it was great. It didn't appear to slip and the straps were tight when it came time to unload it. More expensive than many other soft racks but some of the cheaper ones had reviewers indicating the straps were tearing - perhaps you get what you pay more. The nice soft case was a bonus - took it on a long plane flight and just carried it on with me.",

The front strap is pretty close to my head, but that may just be my car (Honda Civic). A little pricey, but you get what you pay for with these straps: a sturdy, secure, easy-to-assemble, well-designed, portable surfboard transportation system.",

I used it to drive 200 miles at 75 mph up 95 to Cocoa and it held good and tight with less wind noise than the last hard rack I had. Take it off when not in use, though, because if it rains the rain soaks the straps and your interior will be completely soaked after an overnight rain. Similarly, if you're driving in the rain for more than a little while it will start leaking too. This sucks but I guess you can't have everything.",

Just be careful not to scratch the roof of your car with the metal loops...and be sure to read the instructions (also there are some YouTube videos posted about the product). Worth every penny. If you're thinking about purchasing this item just do it already. Now I can surf anywhere! Peace, Love, and Rock and Roll!",
