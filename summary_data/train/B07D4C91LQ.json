They're still working on developing their little feet and legs for proper perching and climbing, so I think the flat surface gives them a safe and secure place to rest (that's not on the bottom of the cage). I just ordered a second one to put a little higher up on the other side of the cage. The perch itself is solid and very well-made for the price!",

And cost is definitely a factor here because he takes about 2 days to totally destroy the perch. (That's what it's for, no?) Anyway I was kind of hesitant because it is from China but the wood had no odor and was smooth without any splintered edges. I have paid a whole lot more for comparable perches. They don't last long so to me it is well worth it.",

I moved it inside their cage a few days ago and if they\u2019re inside their cage, one of them is usually on it.

Birds get arthritis when sitting on the same size perch every day and it's important for the health of their feet to have a variety of perches available. My lovebirds prefer sleeping on these over their nest and they all enjoy picking at the wood. I will be buying more of these, as I'm working to have them all the way around my cage.

The shedding will go away in a few days as the birds peck on it. * Bird poop is super easy to clean. Use a wet paper towel or one of those Magic Eraser Sponges and scrub, for tougher poop, squeeze a few drops of water on it and then scrub and dry with a paper towel. I'm going to order more soon.
