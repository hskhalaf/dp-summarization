It is also great to hold a second set of Joy-cons to play with friends. In my case it is particularly helpful since the Switch is not in an easy to access place and I play for extended periods of time so recharging the controllers by connecting to the console is not as practical. If you buy this, take into account that it comes with the USB-C cable to charge the controller but not with a converter to plug into the wall!",

I enjoyed using the grip that came with the switch so even though there are cheaper joycon chargers, I thought this would work better for me since you can charge and play. (I do own a pro controller but I have pretty small hands due to being a girl so the small joycon buttons and placement are pretty perfect for me) Overall I really like this purchase and the only difference I can see from this grip and the one that came with the system is that the handles are slightly see through.",

The grip is exactly like the one in the system except it has a usb connector right at the top, not sure why it's at the top and not the bottom? But anyways, it looks cool, translucent gray or smoked plastic look handles. Your joycons just plug in just like the non charge one. It also comes with a usb cable and i guess you just plug it into one of the usb ports on the system. So basically should cost a few more bucks to put the usb connector and some wires",

It comes with a nice Nintendo-branded USB-C cable which you could also use to charge the Switch itself with USB power. Can't dock it any stars because it came in a nice simple package. If anything though, this should be what comes standard with the Switch so you can charge controllers without needing to dock them into the Switch. You can charge and play so it's a no-brainer if you like using the grip but don't want to stop playing to charge.",

We already have a USB-C cable by the couch so that we can keep phones/tablets charged, so I just use that instead of the included cable. I'm very happy with this purchase, since it saved me about $50 compared to a second controller and still gets the end result of letting her play Zelda for as long as she wants!",
