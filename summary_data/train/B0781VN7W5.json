If they can't get that part right, I have serious reservations about using this product.

It's up to you if you want to take a chance on a product run by a dishonest marketing team.",

      "text": "This modem is really good only when it works. I have owned Netgear CM100 for only three and half months and then it stopped working. Actually it started to be shaky more than one month before it completely off work. I should have taken that as a warning sign but I just thought it was the problem of Xfinity. Anyway, it seems like I have to find another modem that offers fast speed and also can work for a long time. Any recommendations?",
