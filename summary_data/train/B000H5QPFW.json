I sanded the varnish off the entire handle and then fitted it to the head. It fit as it should (after a little work) . I used a conical wedge instead of the metal wedge it came with. I prefer them to the little metal wedges. Afterwards I applied several coats of boiled linseed oil. So far it's holding up and doing it's job.",

I used a carbide burr for the reshaping. When I finished it off I applied a coating of JB Weld epoxy. I don't think it's going anywhere! I recommend if you like saving good old tools...",
