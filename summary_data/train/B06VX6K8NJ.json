I have to say I've saved a decent amount of money since I no longer go to Starbucks for cold brew. EDIT: Minus a couple stars. I went to clean it and it light hit my super delicate scotch glass and IT shattered not my glencairn glass. Impressed but the sturdiness of the glencairn. Really disappointed in the sturdiness of this brewer.",

      "text": "I've had my pot for about 3 weeks now and can say I'm very pleased with the product. The majority of cold brew pots work via the same steeping concept, but this one has the added benefit of being extremely durable. I've whacked this baby against the granite countertops several times now (I'm not as graceful as I used to be) and thankfully the pot has come out unscathed every time. Another nice touch is that the opening is large enough that I can fit my hand inside. Much, much easier to clean it thoroughly this way.",

Yes, I have to think ahead and put the coffee into the fridge the night before but it totally worth it. 1) I save a ton of money per cup 2) it\u2019s been awesome to experiment with different roasts 3) it is so convenient to have this stuff sitting right in my fridge. The product itself is quality. Put it the dishwasher no problem. Looks beautiful. So far this cold brewer has exceeded my expectations!",

I've put it in the dishwasher a few times and have had no issues (plus it cleans very easy) :) I also like how nice it looks in compare to the other models available on Amazon. The shape of the glass pitcher and the little black knob on the lid make it really unique looking. I leave it on my counter top because it looks so sleek. Highly recommended.",

The coffee I brewed came out great! I followed the tips included with the coffee maker and will probably experiment with variations. The filter basket is easy to use and easy to clean after brewing...much nicer than the mason jar method I've used before!

Otherwise you have a lot of coffee that doesn't even get wet and brew, which is a waste. Seems to work well. Doesn't seem to be that much thicker of glass than a regular coffee caraf, but seems to hold up well to use. Lid doesn't seal the brewer, just seals the grounds area.

    "description": "Why Cold Brewed Coffee?\n\nIt\u2019s simple: Cold brewing is one of the easiest, most rewarding, least complicated ways to make great coffee. In a world of drive-thru fast food and instant gratification, cold brew coffee flies in the face of the status quo to say that faster isn\u2019t always better and good things come to those who wait.\n\nThe 5 Steps To Cold Brewed Coffee: \n\nStep 1: Add 1 - 1.25 cups of medium or heavy coarse coffee grounds directly into the filter\n\nStep 2: Pour lukewarm filtered water over the grounds until you reach the 40oz line.\n\nStep 3: Place into the fridge and patiently wait for 16 hours.\n\nStep 4: Once brewing process has been completed, simply remove the filter and wet grounds from the carafe, clean and store for next use.\n\nStep 5: To serve, mix your cold brew concentrate with ice, water, or milk to create your perfect drink. Cold brew can be stored safely in your fridge for up to two weeks.\n\nRoasts Great For Cold Brewing\n\nStarbucks Espresso Roast.This is a multi-region blend that Starbucks uses for espresso in its stores. This is one of the darkest roasts you will encounter and when coarsely ground and cold brewed has smooth, caramelly sweet notes. ~$13/lb.\n\nPeet\u2019s Baridi.This is an East African blend specifically designed by Peet\u2019s Coffee to be served cold. A dark roast with a smooth, bold flavor with a clean finish, it is great for mixing with milk or drinking straight. More aromatic than most cold brews. You\u2019ll love it. ~$16/lb.\n\nBlueBottle Single Origin Columbia Bilbao Los Vascos. A fruity, medium roast with complex citrusy notes. It is too delicious not to mention. Enjoy it over ice and wonder how a single origin produced so many different flavors. ~$23/12oz.",
