      "text": "Like expected from Kohler, this medicine cabinet does not disappoint. Bought this medicine cabinet for a remodel of a small bathroom for my daughter. The construction of the unit is solid and gives you multiple options for installation. I chose to recess the unit to preserve much needed space. Having mirrors on the interior surfaces is also a nice touch. The bronze frame makes it look a lot more expensive than it really is. Being the second Kohler mirror I have installed, I can recommend this as a nice mid level priced unit with high dollar options.",

Originally I was looking for just this type of framed mirror but couldn't find what I wanted at the price I wanted. Then I found these cabinets and they are perfect - plenty of inside room for 'stuff' and when the doors are opened on both (one is over each sink), the inside door mirrors allow me to view side and back views of my head to make sure my hair looks the way I want it to. The third cabinet is over the vanity table. Great quality. We have been using these cabinets for about 8 months and couldn't be happier with them!",

I cut the bar in half to place on studs but overall I don\u2019t believe this unit can be surface mounted with included hardware . My family safety is a priority. This is a return for me .",
