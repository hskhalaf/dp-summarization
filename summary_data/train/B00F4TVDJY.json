There might not be enough resistance. I biked to work for most of my life but I am not a professional. I don't get on the road anymore unless it is a closed circuit. I don't trust the cell phone users. I use this inside to get bike exercise. DON'T USE THIS IF YOU LIVE IN AN APT! You will drive your downstairs neighbors nuts, maybe the upstairs neighbors as well.

I would say that the holding 23mph for 30 min feels a bit more difficult that what in normally does on the road with no wind. 23 on the trainer feels a bit more like doing 23 into a headwind on the road.
