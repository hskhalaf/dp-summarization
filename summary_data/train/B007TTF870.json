I am a beginner, and immediately noticed all the flaws in my game--it is really hard to generate power with this racquet unless your swing is very good. It is really frustrating to have such a great tool and not be able to use it properly. I would not recommend buying it unless you really know what you doing in squash.",

Just recently and for the first time I got a Tecnifibre CarboFlex 125 racquet and I have to say that I am impressed. From the very first time I tried it I could immediately feel more shot power combined with more control. With this racquet I am hitting my targets more accurately and much more often. I've also hit the walls hard a couple of times during my games and the frame is still intact. I have no problem giving this racquet a 5 star.",

There is also minor vibrations upon connecting with the ball more than the Head CT 135 at least but not enough for it to be a major concern in my opinion.",
