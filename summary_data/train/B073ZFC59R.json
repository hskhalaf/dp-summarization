Very happy with this little camera and would recommend to anyone who needs to inspect something that is not immediately accessible.",

Unfortunately, the focus length doesn't allow it to work like this. We bought this to troubleshoot leaky HVAC lines. It didn't work for three reasons. 1) The lights aren't bright enough (it was fully charged) 2) The cable just bunched up on itself after getting about 6' into the duct 3) Anything not at the exact distance and directly in front of the camera is too blurry to be useful, if you can even see because of the dim light.",

I also came to learn after my purchase that while you have the supposed ability to take still photos and short videos with this camera and software bundled, there is no way in which to share these images. That also defeats the purpose of the entire system. When it looks too good to be true...IT IS! I wish I could have given it ZERO stars or LESS because that is all it was worth. I returned the item for a refund.",
