Would definitely recommend the extra $30 or so on the rechargeable battery pack, as in addition to saving money on batteries, it actually improves the performance of the blaster itself. I believe that the Rival Nemesis is 100% worth its (admittedly hefty) pricetag, as I have gotten so much enjoyment out of this blaster, and will continue to do so.",

The auto-fire is pretty cool, but the motor is fairly loud and takes a second to power up (no sneaking up on people). The auto-fire is slightly less powerful than the hand pump Rival guns, but the ability to overwhelm others with multiple shots is pretty awesome. This model seems pretty well made. Clean-up of ammo is always the worst part and these roll everywhere ... buy extra ... a lot of extra ammo.",

I had him shoot me first, so I know it doesn't hurt that bad. Of course he loves this gun and has a ton of fun with it. It is a pain to pick up all the balls, but that's expected and not much you can do about it. I would absolutely recommend buying the rechargable battery for it. It's worth spending a little extra one time rather than buying huge batteries over and over! Great product!",

      "text": "A nerf blaster that in the Rival line; that shoots faster and more accurately- and it holds one hundred rounds? What\u2019s not to love? If this is a blaster you intend to purchase and use frequently, I would suggest picking up the Rival rechargeable battery pack too. It might cost a bit more than the original 6 D batteries, but within two or three changes and those kind of batteries, the rechargeable one would have paid for itself. Besides, the blaster will rev up faster and shot a bit faster with the rechargeable pack than with the D batteries.",

However, if you are considering buying this i would recommend the nerf rival rechargeable battery pack with it. The standard D alkaline batteries get used up fast, are heavy, and are expensive. Overall, I would recommend this very much.",
