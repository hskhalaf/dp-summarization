I built this basement room for the sole purpose of a theater room and insulated the ceiling and walls but this system rumbled right thru it all... shoot every room in the house! Not saying that the sound is as good as my Bose system in my living room but I would definitely not complain as it sounds really good & powerful especially for the cost. CONS: not sue if its the TV or the system but when jumping up or down a level of sound, it seams as if it is to big of a move.",

I'm an audio engineer, so audio quality is a priority for me. Now these don't compare to my studio monitors, but those will cost you $1,000+ each, so I don't expect this set up to keep up. However, for the price, they sound stellar. Highly recommend this system for the budget surround sound system for your entertainment system. Just make sure your TV outputs an actual 5.1 signal from HDMI through, otherwise you'll need to get a receiver to do your audio processing for you.",

Excellent enhancement for second and third televisions in bedrooms or non-primary living areas. I would still go with a more substantial system for the primary entertainment venue in the house, but this is a really great way to upgrade the secondary rooms audio experience!",

Adds enough power and volume so you can hear your movies and other shows, plus the ability to change volume levels of different speakers is VERY NICE! This is a great product! Would buy it again without hesitation. Plenty of inputs instead of just one like most of today's soundbars. The blue tooth works great on our iPhones and other devices. A little hard to read the display for the programming of volume levels, etc. The display could be a little brighter (please and thank you Visio).",

My wife still gets scared and thinks someone is creeping around outside when she hears stuff on the surround speakers. The wireless sub and Bluetooth option were the reason I bought this and I don't regret it at all. Good job Vizio.",

      "text": "This sound bar system has the neat feature of not needing wires to connect the subwoofer to the sound bar itself. The subwoofer is connected by bluetooth to the sound bar. When the sound bar is turned off, the subwoofer apparently powers down to reduce energy consumption. However, when my subwoofer is on the floor and not in line of sight of the sound bar it will not restart the bluetooth connection after it powers down. I have had to relocate my subwoofer to a somewhat less than perfect spot as a result of this. Otherwise I would have rated it with 5 stars.",

There's ways to alter the sound by turning up the front speakers, lowering the rear speakers, pumping up the bass, etc. This also comes with a AUX wire to hook up with phones, ipods, etc. Great system!",

I'm currently re-listening to my favourite albums, I'm well impressed. Looks - It's clean and also no Sony/Vizio logos just plain and simple. I did a lot of research of soundbars/5.1 etc and the worry is how it will sound, which you won't know until you get it in your home. I can confirm this is a steal.",

Now it doesnt keep up with my Pioneer Elite VSX-05 hooked to Boston acoutics. But this thing cost less than my sub. Makes bedroom a nice retreat.

      "text": "I bought this sound bar quite some time ago, and have been using it every day since. When I first purchased it I wanted it mostly for movies, but once I learned how much better everything sounded off it, I use it for everything I watch on TV. Pros -Easy set up, very few cords -Sound quality is great -Bluetooth is great for playing music from phones Cons -Large rooms might need longer cords between rear speakers and sub woofer -Not all sound types are supported for surround (no AC3)",
