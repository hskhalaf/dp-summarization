Others include (1) The integral pressure gauge, which I don't expect to be accurate. But its readings can be calibrated to a known-accurate gauge, and thereafter provide a meaningful readout. (2) Solid construction. (3) Hose-based strain-relieving attachment (which reduces the possibility of stressing the valve). (4) Reasonable compactness and lightness. The expected downside of having to pump a lot to get a tire up to higher pressure is really no problem, since flats are rare compared to regular top-offs using the big floor pump in my garage.",

My only gripe is the mounting, which makes the pump problematic. Instead of mounting wihhin the frame, the mount goes to the side and interferes with your knees or ankles, depending on the placement. And the combination of a loose plastic clip with a thin rubber strap almost guarantee it will fall off and be lost on Rocky Colorado trails. Would also be great to include mounting screws.",

If your valve isn\u2019t extremely tight this will undo the valve stem when you remove it. I have removable valve stems, but don\u2019t need them to be. I solved by using red Loctite. So if you need your valve to be removable, you will have to make sure they are very tight or it will come off.",

Was a nice unit - very compact and solid materials. I had to fidget with the valve stem on the bike a little bit but after I got it dialed in the pump worked great and it stores very nicely - even with a bracket to attach to the bike (I assume) The packaging was nice and easy to open. I'm very happy I now have a way to inflate presta or schrader valves.",

The only downside I've found is that the mount isn't stiff enough, and on fast downhills on bumpy roads (especially dirt roads), the pump slaps the frame rather loudly on every bump. I guess I'll have to epoxy a little bit of rubber to the bottom of the mount...but I shouldn't need to!",
