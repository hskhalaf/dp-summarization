The description indicates a 10\u00b0F to 20\u00b0F temperature increase over ampient can be expected, but it's more powerful than that. With the seed tray sitting directly on the mat, the soil temp went from 61\u00b0F to 92\u00b0F. I ended up raising the tray 3/4\" above the mat, and even with the air gap, the tray is staying at 85\u00b0F. I may raise the tray a bit higher to get the temps down around 75\u00b0F.",

It does not have any temperature adjustment, just on/off switch and I found that after constant use the glass on the bottom of the enclosure was too hot, could cause a burn to the animal. But that was without any air flow under the tank. So I raised the tank a little so there is about 1/4\" gap at edges of the tank. I think that will do it or may have to raise a bit more. Either way, the pad itself seems sturdy and working as described.",

My suggestion is to either put it on a timer (like the ones you use for your lights) and do half an hour on half an hour off or do a solo cup with soil and place it into another solo cup crooked so the cup sits about 1\" above the other cup rather than perfectly fitting into it. If you give it a bit of distance the soil temperature will stay high 70s",
