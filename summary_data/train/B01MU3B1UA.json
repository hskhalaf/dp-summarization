      "text": "With the recent software update, Google forces the status LED to be on at all times. At night this camera stands out in the darkness, actually alerting the potential intruder of its location and field of view. This blatant and intentional flaw makes my house actually less secure because potential intrude is made aware of camera's location and is able to bypass it. I called Nest and requested to return the camera for a refund, since the camera is now useless as a security device, and my request was denied. Google cares more about someone else's \"privacy\" than about the security of its paying customers. Will never purchase Nest or Google again.",

These just connect to the network and you access with the app. I have them on two rental properties. If wifi goes out, I get notification, when wifi is restored, cameras connect without fail.",
