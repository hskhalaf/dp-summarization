So the edges are sharp, clearly not enough to cut you - but you're definitely going to feel it especially in the corners of your mouth. Never thought I'd ever say something is uncomfortable to drink from, but here we are. My friend bought these same type of glasses but a different brand (Tossware, I believe) and they were great, rimmed & all! I didn't experience the melted/defective glasses I see from other Reviewers - so that's good, but otherwise, I wouldn't purchase these again. Pretty though.",
