      "text": "After using this set of 12 cone markers for about a week, I'm relatively satisfied. But I've discovered one flaw: They are very light and flimsy and get blown around during breezy conditions. That problem is fixable if I stack two of them together, but then I only have 6 cones instead of 12. When it isn't breezy, the cones work fine. Still, Im a bit surprised that, given the price, they aren't slightly higher quality -- or at least come with more than 12.",
