I've tried to return this and have gotten HOURS of run around from the Amazon guy who speaks very little English. They connected me to Cuisinart who said there was no reason that Amazon shouldn't just give me a refund, and that they never should have been called, but still no help from Amazon. Don't spend the extra money thinking it will be higher quality...it is actually a low quality machine. I'm disappointed in Cuisinart for this product, and in Amazon for their POOR customer \"service\".",

      "text": "This product is the most efficient and easy to use. I just had to figure out the correct recipe to use for vanilla ice cream to have the taste as close to homemade Blue Bell as possible. 2 eggs, pinch of salt, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, Wisk together. 1 can sweetened condensed milk(cheap brand) half and half to fill. Wisk all ingredients. Set timer for 38 minutes and stop as desired thickness. More minutes than auto setting is required for immediate use. My Husband the Grands love this recipe.",
