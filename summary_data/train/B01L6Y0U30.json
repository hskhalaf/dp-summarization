Then 3 days later found the original. Higher grade quality metal with the Bear Claw. But I'm very pleased with LEMENG less quality to make it possible to receive 4 scratchers. So that's why I gave you 5 Stars...PRICE.. Now, I have a back-scratcher in every room. Can't tell any difference in the effectiveness of getting a great back scratch. Great Value",
