Its 2-megapixel sensor takes 8-megapixel snapshots, and 720p HD video performs well with video-chatting programs like Skype, Google Chat, and Windows Live Messenger. With a handful of extra features like one-click uploads to YouTube or Facebook and fun video effects, the Logitech HD Webcam C510 is a worthwhile buy.",

At best it might be off 0.5-1 sec but hardly noticeable. If you not getting a 1080p webcam but still want something good and in HD, get this webcam.",

Works best when you don't need to fix it in one place, though it's not flimsy at all. Highly adjustable - vertically and horizontally. Works under Linux - I personally got it to work under Raspberry Pi with V4L2 API, though the highest resolution I tried there was only 640x480 and it was already too much for that little board. It may support higher res, I just haven't tried it. The orange light gives a good idea of when the camera is filming and when it's not.",

It also can take still pictures, which for me came in very handy when a monitor used started to go, and it allowed me to take pictures of that monitor to show the problem in order to get a replacement! Overall, a very good cam for the money. Also got the webcam from the supplier with super quick shipping, far beyond the level paid for!",

We use this to Skype while sitting about 7-8 feet away on a sofa and have not had any issues with the other party not being able to hear us while we talk in our normal voices.",

I wanted a webcam that could provide great quality video, and this little thing is just fantastic. There isn't anything I've seen for the price that can produce such great results. My only complaint: while I can use the cam on my Mac, it doesn't work with any of the software available for the cam - thus many features are not available, despite the quality being excellent",
