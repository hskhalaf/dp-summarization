The reason I'm giving it 4 stars (instead of 5) is that switching between the sources is bit cumbersome: you press the toggle button to show the control window, then rock the button to select the Video Source symbol. If you do not switch between computers often, this is fine. But since I use it for a desktop and a laptop, this becomes a bit cumbersome when I switch the computers at least once a day. With my old Acer screen, switching the computers is a lot easier: I just plug in the right video cable.",
