But some online research revealed that taking s. Boulardii during and after antibiotic treatment increased h- pylori cure to 100%. I took s. Boulardii along with regular probiotics during the antibiotic phase and for several months after. The h-pylori was totally cured with no GI side effects.",

    "title": "Saccharomyces Boulardii + MOS, 5 Billion Organisms Per Cap, for Intestinal and Digestive Support, 90 Count (Cool Ship, Pack of 3)",
    "description": "Size:90 Count (Pack of 3)Saccharomyces Boulardii+MOS contains a probiotic yeast that survives passage through stomach acid and delivers its benefits to the intestinal tract. This strain helps protect and maintain a normal intestinal microflora. It also works to restore the normal intestinal microflora when possible disruptions may occur, such as, during the intake of certain medications and during travel. MOS (MannanOligoSaccharides) is an oligosaccharide from the cell walls of S.cerevisiae that can discourage bacteria from adhering to the epithelial cells and reduce their proliferation. Saccharomyces Boulardii+MOS does not require refrigeration and can be stored at room temperature. Refrigeration will, however, extend the shelf life. Avoid temperatures above 77\u00b0F (25\u00b0C). The cool ship process creates a custom fulfillment pathway so that probiotic products are kept refrigerated up until the point they are shipped. The products are packed in a unique cool ship box that utilizes insulation made with sustainable cotton fiber and cooled with reusable ice packs. The products are then fulfilled with either next day or second day shipping. This process delivers probiotics that have been kept cool and, in most cases, not exposed to prolonged extreme heat, supporting the highest levels of product potency.",
