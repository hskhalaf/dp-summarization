The video output has proven extremely useful on numerous occasions -- we have a Canon ZR-10 digital video camera but the S400 satisfies our needs most of the time, plus it's light and pocket-sized. The one slight issue we've noticed is that pictures seem to have more red-eye than our prior (non-digital) cameras. Still, the tools Canon provides, as well as those available on Mac and PC platforms, adequately overcome that limitation. For the price, this is an outstanding, feature-packed, and perfectly-sized buy.",

Previously I had stopped using the S230 to take my rose garden pictures as the resolution and focus just could not compare to the 4040. But I was surprised to see the S400's pictures were slightly BETTER than the 4040. The Olympus' famous jagged diagonals resulted in a softer image than the Canon's.

A few days ago when I called Canon, the rep said he'd never heard of this behavior before. So tonight I did a web search and... WOW! I am clearly not alone. The biggest disappointment is not that the camera is failing, it is that Canon's management is failing its customers.",

You really can keep it in your pocket. It takes great pictures and is easy to use. We have been very happy with it. The only two quibbles are the lack of a battery level indicator and the limited accuracy of the viewfinder. Neither are a great problem. I've taken some nice sunset pictures using the manual mode but for most situations the auto mode does a great job. I'd recommend this to anyone.",

The metal case makes it relatively rugged [good enough to carry in your pocket]. My wife has a Nikon Coolpix 4000 and this camera is very comparable.

Too small, which guarantees less zoom, but 3x is pretty standard.

    "description": "x 6 MB CompactFlash English 1y warranty F/2.8-4.9A whole host of impressive technical features opens up a sea of creative possibilities. And all wrapped up in an extraordinarily beautiful and robust metal case. Advancements\n\nAMAZON.COM\nThe newest Digital Elph in the Canon's PowerShot line, the compact S400--the successor to the popular S200, S230, and S330 models--is both elegant and powerful. It features a 4-megapixel sensor, 3x optical zoom, an improved 3.6x digital zoom, and movie mode for videos of up to three minutes. A stainless steel shell protects the camera, while a new finish--Super Hard Cerabrite--mixes metals and ceramics to produce a tough cool-toned exterior that is visually stunning.\n\nOptics and Resolution\nFeaturing a 4.0-megapixel CCD sensor, the PowerShot S400 delivers a wide range of detail and color (with images up to 2,272 x 1,704 pixels) and prints beyond 11 by 14 inches. Canon's high-quality 3x optical zoom lens (36-108mm, f/2.8-4.9) allows you to close in on the action, while the 3.6x digital zoom allows for a combined 10.8x zoom letting you capture intimate details that might have been missed with another camera.\n\nThe PowerShot S400 also features Canon's nine-point AiAF (Artificial intelligence Auto Focus) system for focusing accuracy, shutter speeds of 15 to 1/2,000 second, and fast sequence shooting at a rate of 2.5 frames per second (fps).\n\nMovie Mode\nShoot up to three minutes of MPEG video at resolutions up to 320 x 240 pixels with sound, editing controls, and VCR-like playback. The movies aren't camcorder quality, but they're fun and convenient, and they're perfect as e-mail attachments. The camera can also attach voice memos or sound files of up to 60 seconds to each image.\n\nMore Features\nYou can select from evaluative, center-weighted, and spot-metering modes depending on the subject matter, and can even choose to set shutter speeds and apertures manually. An ISO range of 50 to 400 ensures practical shutter speeds in a wide variety of lighting situations, while a multifunctional, built-in flash offers a maximum reach of 3.5 meters in Auto ISO mode.\n\nCanon's DIGIC (DIGital Imaging Core) processor ensures excellent color rendition and white balance for every shot, as well as super-fast auto focusing, noise-free imaging, and advanced flash exposure performance.\n\n \n\n * 1.5-inch TFT (transreflective) LCD monitor. \n * Built-in flash with auto, on, off, manual, slow-synch, and red-eye reduction modes. \n * Shot modes include manual, auto, and stitch assist. \n * White balance modes include daylight, cloudy, tungsten, fluorescent, and more. \n * Histogram display for checking exposure and contrast levels in images stored on the memory card. \n * Built-in orientation sensor automatically rotates portrait pictures, and these images remain rotated when downloaded, saving time during in-computer image processing. \n\n Storage and Transfer\nImages and video are stored on CompactFlash memory cards (Type I only) and the included 32 MB card holds approximately 27 images at the Large/Fine setting. Files can be downloaded to either a Mac or PC via USB connectivity, which means it can be connected to any USB-based Windows 98/Me/2000/XP and Mac OS 8.6 or later computer without installing any software.\n\nPrinting\nCanon has introduced a series of printers designed to work directly with its lineup of digital cameras. Using these printers, no computer is required--simply connect the camera to the printer and start printing. Printers include Canon's bubble jet direct printers S830D and S530D, and card photo printer CP-100. Of course, photos from your camera can also be printed on any home computer system with an inkjet printer, sent off for online processing, or simply enjoyed on your computer screen.\n\n Power, Size, and Contents\nThe camera is powered by a rechargeable lithium-ion battery NB-1LH (included). It measures 3.4 by 2.2 by 1.1 inches and weighs 6.5 ounces (without battery). This package includes the PowerShot S400 digital camera, 32 MB CompactFlash card, battery and battery charger (CB-2LS), USB and AV cables, wrist strap, and ArcSoft Camera Suite CD-ROM and USB drivers for Windows and Mac.",
