      "text": "Whoa! These elderberry gummies are intensely sweet and covered in heaps of sugar! I'm kind of stunned, as this massive amount of sugar is counterproductive in an immune-boosting health product (it feels very targeted toward kids). I get that elderberry can be a bit tart on its own, but this is beyond overboard. The gummies are very sticky and the sugar sticks to your fingers and gets everywhere. Chewing the gummies slightly hurts my mouth and my sensitive teeth. I like most of the healthy ingredients, but this sugar overdose is just unnecessary. But I should mention that my mom likes these fine.",
