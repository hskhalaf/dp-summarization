I like that it has a removable multipurpose jack so if you get this it is backwards compatible. it has a micro usb and a usb c jack you choose which you need. A tip for those that love watching movies run them through handbrake (a free video program) to get them to a proper size and codec so the phone doesn't get hot!",
