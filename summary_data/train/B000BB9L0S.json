I use it for about 4 days every day, then remove all the layers and start again. My nails are so long I have to cut them now.

      "text": "This is a no fail product. I have tried cheaper brands, but nothing is as effective as this product. I use as a base coat when I go for a manicure, then every other day after my manicure I put on a top coat. My manicure lasts at least 1 week chip free, and if I am very careful and diligent with applications, 2 weeks. My nails break often if I do not use. The shellac/gel polish absolutely weaken my nails. If I do OCCASSIONALLY get this type of polish (when going on vacation), I use Nailtiques with my normal manicure immediately when I take the shellac/gel polish off.",
