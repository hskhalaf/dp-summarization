      "text": "For the price I think it's hard to beat. Was able to put it together in about 2 hrs myself (needed another pair of hands to flip it though). The action is ok; the men need balancing (plenty of after-market or diy solutions); there are some dead spots which you can avoid with more positive ball handling. The playing surface isn't flat... Which is a bother. I'll probably address that in the near future. In short it's a great economical table if you don't mind tinkering with it a bit to meet your expectations.",

The corner ramps make it a faster paced game. They are plastic inserts but you know what they work real well. The hollow rods and counter balanced men make it a hundred times better than my last table. So for me this table is a 5 star. No complaints",
