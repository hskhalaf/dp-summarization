I'm so glad I purchased this dryer. It's very small and light, but don't let that fool you, this thing packs a punch, it's much more powerful than the \"self-wash\" doggy stations and yet it is quiet and has a high and low setting. I love the heat element as well, as it does not get too hot, but provides a little boost to dry my dog quicker.",

Nevertheless, the seller was very responsive many months later. Not only do I recommend this product on Amazon, but many of my friends have also bought this after I recommended it to them, and they are pleased with it. Many thanks!",

It's quieter then the professional dryer. The motor sounds like it's going to hold out. The heat/power switch is easy to operate and easily accessible on top of the machine. The hose expands when the machine is on giving a great reach and recoils when the machine is turned off saving space. This little beauty is going to be used weekly to dry both my dogs. Will update after a few more uses if its functionality becomes an issue.",
