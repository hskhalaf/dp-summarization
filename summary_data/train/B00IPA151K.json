Turns out that there was nothing wrong with the unit it just shuts down if you push the edger faster than the system is designed for. I just slowed down and it works great. The string trimmer is excellent and it quick to load. Best of all when you tap the head for more string it works flawlessly.",

I'm only 5feet tall and 85lbs, this is light enough for me to us all day. Depending on the thickness of the grass, the battery goes at least an hour before needing to charge.

Overall, I like using the new battery technology, however when it comes to this one, it gets the job done, but your back will hurt and you may not finish the job up based on battery life.

This machine I had to do it manually. That is a design flaw that should be changed.",
