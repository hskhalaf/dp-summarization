      "text": "Either these are counterfeit, or Frye isn't as great as I thought it was. I lean toward the former. The packaging looked legit until I pulled the cardboard from the boots - the printing (pictured) looks SUPER fake. The seams are messy with glue, the label has a bunch of extra thread sewn on, and the craftsmanship is generally poor. The leather does seem real, and the metal rings are, well, metal. But I can't really believe that boots with such poor craftsmanship would really sell for what Frye charges at full price. I'm going to stick to the Frye website from now on since Amazon doesn't seem to be able to control the flow of counterfeit goods.",

I did get a half size smaller, as suggested in reviews and they fit well in my toe and heel. However they are quite tight in the width. These are my 2nd pair of Fryes and I had to wear big thick socks with my first pair to break them in. I will do that for these as well. This version of the Harness has a wider calf than others I've tried on, which is good in my case. A beautiful, classic boot that goes with everything and can be worn anywhere.",

Also the shoe can be easily stretched with shoe stretcher to accommodate wider foot. I always wanted this kind of boots but because the need for the orthothics insert was not able to find one.

      "text": "So I had my eye on these boots for a few years, but never purchased due to the high price point. Finally I thought to myself, I still want them years later, I should just buy them, so I did! I bought them about a year and a half ago, and I just love them. The finish is great, not shiney. The leather is high quality. I can't say I'd want to walk a mile in them...but they're comfortable as far as boots are concerned. I really do get a ton of compliments on these boots. They have a rugged yet feminine look. I recommend them!",

The 7-1/2 felt too narrow (and I have narrow feet, mind you) and was rubbing my ankle slightly. I was bummed because my feet are already so huge I was looking forward to getting a smaller size for once. But I opted for the 8. Excellent construction and they look really cool.",

I tried my daughter, a size 6, and she couldn't get her heel past the back strap either. It needs to give another 1/2\" +/- to make these boots physically possible to even get on a foot. Maybe it's just the pair I received? In any case, I'm bummed they did not work.",

The quality leather complements the look of its timeless shape, while the studded leather strap at the ankle provides a hint of urban style.\n\nThe Frye Company is the oldest continuously operated shoe company in the United States. Founded in 1863 by John A. Frye, a well-to-do shoemaker from England, and family-run until 1945, Frye products have a long and illustrious history. Frye boots were worn by soldiers on both sides of America's Civil War, soldiers in the Spanish-American war, and by Teddy Roosevelt and his Rough Riders. When home-steading drew adventurous New England families to the West during the mid and late 1800's many of the pioneers wore Frye Boots for the long journey. Today Frye remains true to its roots with its line of heritage boots, but continues to innovate as it introduces chic new handbags, pumps, and sandals to its collection.\n\nSee more",
