      "text": "Bought this laptop around October 2017 and is swear to god i have not touched anything so slow. For the first few days it had problems loading simple apps like Google Chrome. Like you know its a bad laptop when it takes 5-10 minutes to get from powering up the laptop to viewing your page. After few weeks i have to say id did speed up by a small bit to a do-able standard. But i haven't touched it over the summer and now the laptop could take 20+ mins to power up and load facebook. DO NOT BUY! SAVE SMALL BIT MORE AND BUY SOMETHING MORE DECENT!!!! If i could I'd give this laptop less than half of star.",

The fan sounds like an airplane taking off - it is obviously not well built or even possibly an old fan put into new casing. The computer drive runs at 100% even with nothing running apart from background programs. It cost me just over \u00a3500 three years ago. It's now time for me to upgrade and needless to say I won't buy from Amazon this time. I will go elsewhere local to me where I can get proper warranty/customer care etc.",

It picked up my high speed broadband straight away. I installed win10 pro and all is now working well. Just loading my photos from a memory stick. Has linked to my Samsung account and downloaded from my iPad. Hoping to use this as a replacement for my aging PC! I may set up a backup to an external disk.",

I didn't like it because it had no CD/DVD player which isn't readily apparent and it certainly does appear to have one on the accompanying video which I made a point of looking at and indeed opted for it in the first place. I ended up purchasing another laptop (from a different manufacturer) from Amazon which does definitely have a CD/DVD player on it and so I am happy with it. This HP one, I switched it on but I never used it so I can't really rate its performance. I'm sure its very good and it does look very nice.",

      "text": "Within a minute of starting up the machine the DVD drive popped out of its own accord. Thinking nothing of it I persisted with the startup process and pushed the drive back in. Soon after it popped out again so I inspected the issue. The button release was forced inwards meaning the drive was constantly trying to eject. The package it arrived in was undamaged so I don't blame amazon for any damage. Indeed the DVD drive was cheaply made and constructed and thus i believe this to be a manufacturing error. As a whole the laptop was akin to the DVD drive in its cheap plasticy feel.",

      "text": "Surprised at how this copes with games considering it has only Intel 620 graphics, runs Wargaming titles, Total War, Civ V on medium/low settings. Fast i7 processor and DDR4 ram compensate very well. Was a little concerned about it not having an SSD for storage but it is good to have 1TB space and everything loads quickly enough. Another compromise compared to more expensive machines is the display resolution but I'm pleased with what I see so far. Windows 10 did not require much updating so must be a recent version. Multi-tasking performance is very good. Wireless is very good and has Ethernet port. I haven't found a use for the DVD drive yet.",
