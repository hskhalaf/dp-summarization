      "text": "I bought this light for long run Kayaking/Camping trips. Size and weight matters on 2 and 3 day trips. This light was a excellent choice! The solar cell recharges the battery very well, and it has unbelievable battery life. The best part is, it is compact enough to fit in a jacket pocket. I was very impressed with how bright the light is. It is a very good value with exceptional quality. I'm 3 trips in and put gear through extreme conditions. I've dropped this light around 20 times now, and it never fails. I've even used it when my power was out at the house for hours on end, and it alone lights up a room very well!",

I have not tried to charge my cell phone, but I can see where it would provide enough power to use your cell phone in case of emergency. I found that the only way to fully charge it is by the USB adapter because solar does not fully charge the battery. As a backpacker and primitive camper, I can see where this would be a great tool to have.",

And now I can't hang it anywhere, which negates it's use in many ways (like hanging it from the tent). It is very bright, though. I love using it as a flashlight/lantern. It is awesome for camping and would be cool for backpacking because the solar charge allows you to charge your phone or kindle. As long as you have a way to attach it to a surface or bag without the handle. I bought another for my daughter's survival pack and will continue ue to use this one. I just miss the handle loop.",

I was hoping the brightness would match purely from solar charging. Maybe I did something wrong?",
