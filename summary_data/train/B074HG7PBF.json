The hooks feel really flimsy and like they wouldn't hold up if my dog really pushed against them. This product is not worth the cost. The directions are difficult to follow.

The only thing I couldn't figure out was how to remove/replace the hooks with the alternates provided. Fortunately the ones that came already assembled were just fine. I've noticed it rattles just a little bit - I may add some felt between the parts to give it a little cushion. Overall, I'm really pleased, and so glad you can customize the shape to meet your needs.",
