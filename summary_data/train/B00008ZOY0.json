It was nice to plug it into an extension cord and started it by sliding the safety switch and holding a trigger. I cut down a dead sapling of about 3 inches. I think if I had a helper I could cut down a 4 or 5 inch tree trunk. Glad I bought it - not worried about getting it to start like we did with a gas powered one. My wood line adjacent to my home should be easier to keep clean",

I bought it so my other half doesn't have to use the gas powered saw when I'm gone (trouble starting it). So far, so good.",
