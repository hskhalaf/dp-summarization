I work outdoors and its survived getting submerged in water, falling about 12 feet onto rock, and some other less exciting mishaps. So far there isn't even a scratch or scuff to show for my clumsiness. The only recommendation I really have is to splurge for a bit more storage than the 8gb. With the new Android you can format an SD card to act as internal storage, but your performance will still be better if the apps are stored in the phone.",

I would have given this a highly rated review, but ever since February 2017, the smartphone became too slow for me. It even has trouble loading the most basic apps like email. Apps are always disappearing every time I turn on the phone. But the apps come back after, say, 10 minutes; but that is still annoying because I have to put back the app shortcuts every time. My next smartphone will definitely NOT be a Motorola brand.",

No regrets at all. The only thing lacking is, it could use more memory. But that's easily solved by by adding an inexpensive mini SD card, which totally solves that problem.

Phone is extremely laggy and gets super hot without me even doing anything on the phone.This is an updated review and I hope Motorola get their s*** together. DO NOT BUY this phone if you consider long term investment... UPDATE This phone is acting up again as it doesn't even recognize the sd card. WOW. I would never in my life buy a Motorola phone ever again...",

She complains about everything but hasn't complained about this phone for the month that she's had it.",

Screen navigation also became difficult as it required odd use of the navigation buttons to switch from the phone to apps and back again.This all may have developed because of it updating to Android 6 but that may just be a coincidence. I thought that paying less than $200 for a Motorola phone would be a great bargain but I've decided to switch to an iPhone to gain back some reliability and predictability. I guess we all get what we pay for.",
