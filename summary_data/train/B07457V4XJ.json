Keep in mind, this won't fit in the dock with the case on. However, it's easy to remove the case. Again, I can't stress enough that this is primarily for people like myself who only use the switch in portable mode.",

The material is rather stiff and not very pliable to take off repeatedly. If you get the dongle style dock replacement, this may be the case for you. Definitely recommend this for anyone using it more frequently out of the dock.",

      "text": "I usually like to review a product only after it has withstood the test of time. I'd give this 6 stars if I could. Bought it for the hubby in November 2017. It makes the switch feel sturdier. It pops off easily and is easy to clean. Although we do keep the switch in a carry case as well for extra protection when not in use. Will definitely repurchase once I get my own switch as well as a replacement for him too!",

It also just barley fits in the case that came with my Mario Odyssey bundle so nice plus. Also does a good job protecting the back of the Switch.",
