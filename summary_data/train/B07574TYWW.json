      "text": "I decided on the PX's due to better sound and build quality than the Bose and Sony equivalent headphones. Unfortunately I had to return them since they clamped too hard around my ears and the head band put too much pressure on the top of my head. I was also having connection issues with my Pixel 3XL using Pandora. These headphones offer great sound and build quality but just aren't comfortable to wear. I hope B&W improves this issue on their just announced PX7's.",

The Bose were to bright in sound and the sonys were muddy comparatively. Materials are great and elegant. Noise cancelling was good enough for the airplane. Don't travel too much so my priority wasn't on the ANC function. Sound took higher priority. Highly recommend if you want better sound and want to stand apart from the plasticky cans out in the wild. If you don't care for sound and want more focus on the ANC I recommend the other two mainstream headsets.",

      "text": "The headphones are a little uncomfortable at first and I will say it's probably a little better if you don't wear glasses. I did notice while on a bus ride that the noise cancellation is almost unnecessary with most outside noise going on around as long as the ear cups seal to your head. The bluetooth connection is nice and the functionality of the pause and sleep mode are great, but the headphones sound about 100 times better when plugged in with a cable to your phone or whatever you're using. I think the bluetooth setting might be more effective for convenience but if you want really high quality audio use the cord that comes with them.",

      "text": "Its sound quailty is really good and ANC definitely does its job. Material quailty is probably one of the best in that price tag. It covers all my big ears and it is comfortable for 1-1.5 hours maybe. Its clamping force is way too much, which is nice and bad at the same time. It is nice because those are super stable on the head. But it gets uncomfortable after some time and this is my only concern with them.",
