      "text": "I am a seasoned runner and overpronator that requires a motion control/stability shoe. I have been a Mizuno loyalist for nearly 20 years, however I found the Horizon shoe to be extremely uncomfortable. Unlike the Paradox, or Alchemy, I endured excruciating pain with the Horizon on the outer edges/regions of both feet. This occurred with stock Mizuno insoles, Sole Dean Karnaze orthotics, and Vionic Active orthotics over a trial of several weeks. The pain felt as though a heated knife were cutting the outer edges of feet. I would not recommend these shoes or would caution prospective buyers to first try them on in person.",

Love the foam wave. Shoes are lighter, cushier, breathe better, and still seem to support me well as I have some pronation issues. Inspiring to run more, oddly.",

      "text": "When I run my knees like a little support-- and my heels like a fairly cushioned pad. This shoe fits the bill, especially for 10K and longer. Looks great, well built, very rugged, should last plenty of miles. And it doesn't feel like it's got too much support-- just enough. My three runs have been very comfortable-- and my feet have been happy. I do wish it were a little bit lighter in weight and cooler. FYI-- I'm usually a men's 8.5 regular in New Balance and Brooks, but in Mizuno I need to go up half a size to a 9. At 9 regular this shoe fits me perfectly.",

It is slightly heavier than the Paradox, and does not seem as well ventilated - my feet feel hotter in this sneaker. It is still a Mizuno, so it fits well, is comfortable, and controls my pronation. Next time I will get the Inspire (and save some money).",

I can tell it was made really well and should last me a while. I was a little concerned about the price prior to purchasing but it\u2019s definitely money well spent! It\u2019s a very comfortable shoe. As lame as it may sound, this shoe will make you want to run once it\u2019s on your feet. Great job Mizuno!",

So if you\u2019re between sizes like me, I would size up 1/2 of a size.",

The grids on this shoe are good - not too thick and clunky and not too thin. The color on this shoe is a deep navy with striking turquoise accents in the mesh. The silver in the Navy Blazer-Silver option is just the logo. Fit is to size.",
