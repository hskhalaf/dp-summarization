I have multiple CD's that I have purchased from Amazon through the years and I cannot enjoy the music because I have no working CD player. I bought the least expensive ones because I really couldn't afford to buy any at all. Listening to music is my biggest pleasure and now I can't have it. I gave it one star since there isn't an option for no stars. I am hopeful that Amazon or whatever other sellers are involved will see fit to correct this problem and provide me with a CD player that will work.",

Way too late to return, but it was broken from the start. It played 3 seconds of music that I hear an audible click and it stopped. I tried wiggling the new batteries I put in..that did not help. A plug did not help either. The CD spins, but tha's it. So, do not be like me, check it out even if it is a gift before you get embarrassed. I had read awful reviews about GPX, but decided to give them a chance..Wrong!",
