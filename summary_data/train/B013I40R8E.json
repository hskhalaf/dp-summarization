      "text": "A wonderful product. This is my first pressure/slow cooker but I fell in love with it. It is well done and looks very nice. All my meals are a hit and it saves a lot of time! Very easy and intuitive to use, has a lot of default settings to help you figure out how long you need to cook specific food. There is even an option of adjusting the pressure depending on the altitude you live at (and ours is significant). So far I have had no complaints about the product. Breville is a brand in itself and has never disappointed us.",

Saves a whole lot of time by cutting down lengthy meal preps by well over half in many cases. 4. Makes meals more enjoyable (i.e. tastier, more tender, etc.). 5. Easy to clean. 6. Excellent display/screen. 7. Handsome look. 8. Apparently good build quality. 9. Comes with basic cook book. CONS: 1. Expensive. 2. Capacity adequate but, not impressive. A bit more volume would be nice.",

The documentation with the Breville Fast Slow Pro is inadequate, although I didn't follow one of their recipes. I am so confused about the cooker reaching the proper temperature, how long I need to cook the roast, the LCD display, when to release the steam, etc. There are so many options that my head is spinning right now. I tried to call them and their office is closed during their advertised office hours. Gr-r-r-r.",

      "text": "I finally figured out my own \"lid not sealed\" problem...it was the pressure relief valve on the top of the lid which was not properly aligned. It needs to be seated and face the lid knob as shown on page 17 of the BPR700 manual (US) which is step 8 of the pressure cooking directions. The pressure relief valve on top is not the same as the \"safety locking pin\" that is aligned when you lock the lid. While this is very obvious in many ways now in retrospect, I think many poor reviews overlooked this step as I did. PS I've only tried a few recipes so far but all have been great so far!",

This is totally unnecessary and awkward, in that the top will be right there when you are trying to saute and sear meat.

I could have purchased two more instant pots and had money left over, for what I paid for your product... just to be faced with this design farce. Will not recommend nor buy anything made by breville ever again.",

I removed the top and cleaned the seal. The internal non-stick pan and the housing itself still smell. There is no visual evidence of any food contamination, but I can't help but wonder if accumulated smells will eventually start affecting the flavor of future dishes. Very disappointed in this device due to this issue.",

Live in Hawaii so shipping cost likely prohibitive for repairs and out of warranty. A little more versatile than instapot but given the price difference and longevity, won\u2019t be repurchasing.",

Wow this pot has amazing features and electric pressure cooking is a new adventure! Set up was fairly easy (husband took care of this) and cooking in the pot was simple. Kitchen smelled so good! Clean up afterwards was also easy. It is rather large and heavy so needs its own place in the kitchen if you become a devoted user (buy a separate cart on wheels). Also the Instant Pot community on facebook is a wonderful source of ways to use the pot, shared by devotees of electric pressure cooking.",

The pressure cooker was critical to us because of special dietary needs that could only be met by pressure cooking the foods. It's a blessing.

The only other downsides are the general downsides of pressure cooking, notably that you can't taste and season while the cooking process is going, and while much faster than stovetop, still takes a while for pressure to build. Still, makes wonderful stews and great for otherwise long-cooking vegetables like artichokes, and so I am using it a lot.",

One pot cooking at its finest. The nice thing is the boar added wonderful flavor to the tomato sauce. And it makes rice cooking a breeze. Best of all, clean up is so fast and easy.
