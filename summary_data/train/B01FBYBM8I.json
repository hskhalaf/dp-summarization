Unfortunately, the lovely bamboo box that is supposed to carry and protect the glasses, came cracked. I immediately turned to the company's customer service, and a super nice customer service representative named Rachel made sure to replace the product quickly, efficiently, and super nicely, and made sure to be in touch until the reception. In conclusion, I bought a wonderful product and got a great service experience!",

A note on the floating advertisement: I tested these in the sink and they did float slightly, however, I don't think they would stay on the surface if there are waves/wind and their dark color would make them extremely hard to find in most lakes.",

The only reason i don't give them 5 stars is because there is a bit of a mean glare when the sun is at your back. Other than that these glasses are super comfortable and look great. Honestly they make perfect beach glasses due to the fact that they float so you won't have to worry about losing them in the surf. Love Cloudfield and will defintiely be ordering another pair in the future! Absolutely can't beat these for the money.",

I love the size and the bold colors in the lens. You can see well through them. Crystal clear. Ive bought some other expensive brands in the past and they put a strain on my eyes after wearing for a while. These look great and I don have to keep removing them to let my eyes rest. I love them!! I want more in other colors. I think I'll try the red next. Im addicted to these fun glasses.",

So I felt really fresh because of the brightness and I can still make eye contact with the sun comfortably so thats really interesting! I love them, I feel they are different from the many others. I also received compliments from my friends for the wooden shades look very unique and stylish!",
