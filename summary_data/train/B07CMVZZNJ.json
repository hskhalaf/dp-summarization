The pads does fit well as length. My only problem was they're slippery. So, this product is best used when relaxed. However, I stored the product in the refrigerator to eliminate the product moving around & to help with bringing the puffiness down around eye area. Great for wrinkles as well.",

I bought these to help too and was so relieved they worked. The puffiness, dryness and discoloration subsided. I\u2019ll be adding these to my evening prep before an event going forward!",

The key to success is to refrigerate the whole box,apply upon awakening,washing your face is not necessary,just be free of oils that would keep the product from staying on. Every morning this is my routine while I make my bed,brush my teeth,and by the time I need to wash my face,the puffiness has decreased.An added benefit is the extra collagen that my skin needs and it moisturizes those fine lines ! Buy this product,if you want a life changer as I did!",

I saw the Gold Eye Mask Anti-Aging Hyaluronic Acid 24k Gold Eye Patches shopping for something else. I read a lot of reviews, saw the almost perfect rating and decided I had to try them. I have no regrets. At first, there was a bit of stinging when I first applied them, but that subsided after a few minutes of use. Here's a tip: leave them in the fridge for about 20-30 minutes before application. It gives a really cooling sensation and really helps with depuffing even more, in my opinion. Cheers!",
