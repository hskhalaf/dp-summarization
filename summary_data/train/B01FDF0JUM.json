But reviews were not good regarding the included mounting tape. So I skipped using the adhesive tape that comes on the back of them which would have made washing them difficult anyway. Instead, I used 3 pairs of neodymium magnets, one screwed to the back of a shelf unit and one inside the stainless steel holder, to hold them in place. I added a few extra small screw underneath to make sure they don\u2019t slip down.",
