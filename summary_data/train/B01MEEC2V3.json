Only thing I don't like is that it defaults to the middle speed setting when you turn it off. Would like it to stay at the last used setting.",

I currently have a corded 300 model (can't remember actual model atm) and this little feel is just as powerful on half the rotations. I am a groomers assistant and I can use this all day or small to large dog's nails. The bright led light is a massive plus and the fact that it auromatically stops if hair gets caught is awesome.

      "text": "I had used the same Micro Dremel for 8 years and then my grooming shop caught fire and burnt to the ground. I bought my second one thinking it would be just as great, but I was left with a bad taste in my mouth.....could it be all the toenails I'd been inhaling? Nope...it was the Dremel. I thought, maybe i just got a lemon, so I ordered a new one and this one is just as bad. The motor sounds like it's going to explode or something which does NOT calm my dog;s nerves when they're about to get their nails trimmed. Please, please figure out what is happening? I want my first dremel micro back!",

The higher setting I haven\u2019t used but I think it would scare dogs too much and is maybe too fast for use on a dog anyway. Great dremel and I love that it has a charger rather than a battery change feature.",

Dogs have to get used to the sound, and you have to drop the rpm's down to keep it from sounding like a jetliner at takeoff, but an mid-speed it still takes nails down smoothly and rapidly. Works great on zombie toenails, too. Older readers will know what I mean. Stub your toe just right, and it alters growth to a thick armor plate.",

Designed to be held between the thumb and forefinger like a pencil, the Dremel Micro allows a grip that is close to the work-piece for superior maneuverability and control. The Dremel Micro is powered by an integrated high capacity 8V lithium-ion battery for longer run time with no memory effect. Optimal speed control on the Dremel Micro is especially user-friendly. The speed is adjusted in five stages from 5,000 to 25,000 rpm by using two buttons on the top of the tool, which enables it to be adapted to each application. A five-stage LED scale makes it quick and easy to see which speed is currently set. To illuminate projects, the Dremel Micro has LED lights built uniquely into the nose cap to aid in vision and accuracy. The brilliantly powerful Dremel Micro features lights that indicate battery level, lithium ion battery technology, and a docking station that automatically stops charging when the batteries have reached capacity.
