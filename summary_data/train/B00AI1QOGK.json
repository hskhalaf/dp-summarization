You have to buy another pump to get the extension hose, which is probably where they make their money. You can't even return this POS, so don't bother wasting you money. Buy the cupping set that has an angled connector on the extension hose instead.",

I just removed the magnets as I don't have any use for them. I am defiantly going to have to get a case for these. Great addition to my collection!",

      "text": "The positive is that the cups work well for temporary relief of localized muscle spasms in the back, when you can get adequate suction. The big negative is that the coupling between the pump and the suction cups is very poorly designed! The hose easily slips off of the cup valve, and so does the pump when you try apply the cup without using the hose. So it's hit and miss trying to get the cups to stick to the target area. When you can't get adequate suction, you won't get the therapeutic effect. This could be a much better product if the manufacturer could solve the issue of getting the pump solidly attached to the cups.",
