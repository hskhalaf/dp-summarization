We stuffed the RackSack full of bags and gear for a three hour trip into Wisconsin. We had heavy rain for half of the trip and fully expected to find everything wet. We were pleasantly surprised to find very little moisture had made it through to the inside. It is easy to attach and the strap holders prevented the loose end from flapping. The included storage bag completes the package. I would recommend this to a friend.",

When purchasing these it is important to consider the space you have on your roof. If you buy one with too much cubicle space it may have extra space that goes under the bar, you may even feel that you need to fill it up more just so it doesn't flop around. Don't buy much larger than you need thinking you're getting your money's worth. Buy the appropriate size. This is the appropriate size for us!",

No need to store a huge hard cased plastic one all season. If rain is expected, I would consider wrapping clothing in plastic bags before putting them in the suitcase next time. Expect to have to pay more in fuel as it cut my gas mileage down by about 3 mph which adds up on a 3000 mile trip.",

      "text": "I purchased this for my SUV for an 8 hour trip at Xmas. The extra space was wonderful. We traveled in 6 degree weather and the bag did not split or crack. It was easy to install. The zippers were smooth to close and the straps held the bag very secure to the roof rack. I decided to purchase this particular carrier based on the reviews from Amazon customers, and the price was a good deal. I do not have the space for a hard sided carrier. This folds up nice and stores in a drawstring bag!This is the first review I have posted on a purchased product, I highly recommend it.",

Drove 7 hours each way, good weather, avg 65mph on the highway and it was fine. Being a flexible carrier, I was able to stick in a couple of odd shaped items at the last minute. This would never have worked on a rigid frame carrier.",

We still put our luggage in garbage bags as a precaution. Otherwise, the straps held down well, and it was fairly easy to attach and detach to our luggage rack. It is nice that it folds up in to a small bag which is provided. I would recommend this product.",
