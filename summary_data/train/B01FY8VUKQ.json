These are pretty good for saving money, yet if you have sensitive skin they may not be the best as they can sometimes make your nipples itch slightly. Not sure why. They do absorb, bit you can sometimes smell the milk if you have worn them for a full day and leak a lot. They are leakproof and somewhat soft material, just can sometimes make you feel wet. Great money saver, just have to be for the right person. For me, they are just so so. I like my breast cups better that catch the leaking milk.",

I washed them following the care instructions and used them as instructed... disappointing for sure!!

They are much softer than the disposable pad options (which to me felt like sandpaper --- ouch!). They fit well inside my nursing bra and make it possible for me to wash those once a week instead of daily. I also find that they have a modest, smooth profile so that they aren't obvious under my t-shirt and I feel comfortable wearing them outside. Overall, no complaints, these are great!",

If I did have minimal leaking (a few drops) my nipples would stick to the fabric. This still occurred after I applied moisturizers such as lanolin to the area. The removal of the pad after it sticks hurts. Unfortunately I can't return the product and I will not continue to use it. I'll just have to return to using disposable pads.",

The dart helped to make them conform and they are less visible than those without darts (although still not invisible) Purchased the bravado pads for nighttime as they have a mesh layer on inside which allows me to forget I'm wearing them. The bravado pads unfortunately are flat and would be visible under some tops. Alternatively Knix makes a pad that truly conforms, similar to the cup liners in swimsuits and would be great option for those situations where it's needed.",

A friend of mine made me some pads that fit perfect! No bunching. I\u2019m a little confused why the reviews are so high. They absorb great and are durable but not comfortable or properly designed.",

I probably change mine out more frequently than the average person but I just can't stand to reapply a wet nursing pad. Disposable nursing pads irritate my skin too much, but these are soft and gentle on my skin and I can easily throw them in the wash with baby clothes. If you're doing everything \"right\" with nipple care and using disposable nursing pads but still feel that your nipples are irritated, just switch to these and you'll see an improvement.",

These were the solution! After I had the baby, my oversupply lead to constant, major leakage. These pads absorb amazingly! They're really soft and comfortable too which makes it even better! They are somewhat noticeable if you're wearing a soft shell bra or braless, but honestly, who cares. Would rather have a pad outline than puddle marks on my shirt. I ended up ordering two packs of these once I had my baby, just to make things easier for myself. Highly, highly recommend!",
