Video shows installing Secure Mount Anchors, and it also shows Secure Mount anchors right on the description page. There are NO secure mount anchors included, only hardware for STUD installation. If you need this item in a location where there is no stud, you will need to buy Moen secure mount anchors sold separately, which are around $20. I would recommend this for stud installation, please do not be deceived by advertising shown on this page.",

I mounted mine vertically next to the toilet - so that it's within easy reach for an elderly relative. The looks are sort of utilitarian, but for the price I'm good with that.

Uses three large screws on either side and seems like it should hold well for my use for sure, hard to really speak if its used for a grab handle in a shower, but if mounted to studs it seems solid enough to bear a fair bit of weight from a person as well. Very aesthetically pleasing.",
