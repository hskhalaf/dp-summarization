They actually hurt my ears so I cant wear them for very long at all, not even half an hour. Wish Urbanears would bring back the Bagis in ear headphones as they were so comfortable and the best. Do not recommend these unless you don't have weird earholes for them to fit in. Such a shame.",

      "text": "I really like these headphones, I listen to a lot of audiobooks and the sound quality is perfect. I like the way the jack can be used to keep the cable tidy. The biggest issue with these is the rubber part that goes into your ear twists round and often gets left behind in my ear when I take them out, I've have now lost one of these rubber bits and have given up with them altogether, they seem to work on with out them.",
