The expiration date was July 2020 so there was no concern with that, so I can't figure out why there were chunks. I'm sure it's safe to drink because the chunks are likely just the protein, BUT just the texture of it made me want to vomit. If you want a similar shake with NO chunks, just get Premier ready to drink shakes. Much better in the long run, even if slightly more expensive.",

I've tried other similar products and find the taste falls short of Slim Fast's deliciousness. And it delivers vitamins without a vitamin-y taste. Plus, as a diabetic, it fits the bill, as it's low-carb and low- sugar. The protein boost is great, too, as sometimes we don't quite get enough over the day.",
