However, I received a scam telephone call, supposedly from Norton, asking if I had downloaded files as my computer was infected. The call was from \"Kelvin\" of Canterbury, London; I knew then that the call was rubbish. On further looking at the set-up of Norton, I have found out how to scan the computer myself. When I did this after the above call, I found that I had in fact a corrupted file on my computer which Norton deleted for me. I would recommend this product.",

Lost 25 days,as I thought they would be added on, and I dont know how to make it right.Any body help ? So I will not do this again. Renew on the day of expiry is my advice. Also, I see that this is a starter addition, and that some windows 8 protection are not included ? Any way its OK, but some how I have the feeling that I may change product next year.",

I too have started buying this product to protect my own devices and I have to say I can see why he doesn't need to change to anyone else. Gives me all the protection I need. I also love that it reminds you when you need to update it which instructions are easy to follow and gives you peace of mind until the next update/upgrade. Would definitely recommend to family and friends x",
