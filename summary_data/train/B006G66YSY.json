I contacted Suncast and they didn't seem too concerned or in a real hurry to help me out. They said they would send me the 2 pieces I'm missing but it would take another 7-10 business days. I guess this happens often just based on their crappy response to me. I'll update once I receive the missing pieces.",

Of all the parts in the assembly, the most critical component (the roof) has the hole in it... how ironic. Now to deal with getting that resolved... UPDATE 8/30/19 - I called Suncast and after 15 minutes of waiting on the phone for an agent, they agreed to ship a replacement part to me. It will take 7-10 days to receive. No questions asked.",

I think I spent longer on site preparation than on the assembly itself. I did have to ream out some of the slots in the bottom to make the pieces slide together properly, which added an hour right there. Once assembled, it sits below the level of my concrete-block wall so it's unaffected by wind and the HOA doesn't see it. It remains to be seen how long the plastic will hold up in the Vegas sun.",
