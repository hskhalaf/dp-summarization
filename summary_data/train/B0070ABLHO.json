I then used 1 black zip tie to ensure the skeleton stayed attached to the shepard hook. I knew this was a hit when parents had kids take pictures in front of our Halloween decorations.",

      "text": "If you would know me, you would know that I love me some Halloween. My collection gets bigger and bigger every year and the one thing missing was this lifesize skeleton, which I have been eyeballing for quite some time. Great value for the money, and it came carefully packed. You cannot move all the joints but after reading the manufacturer's description I did not expect that anyway. It would have been great if it would come with a bag to store it after Halloween, but this way I will just move it through our house and scare my husband :)",

I have her (yes, its a she to me) dressed in size 8 clothes, and I've added bubble wrap to give her some dimension. this is no good for accurate medical purposes, but she has been a great model where a person-sized form is needed.

Maybe my husband can fiddle with it and get it to stick, but that's kind of a deal breaker when it cost so much.",

I performed a little surgery by loosening the pelvic screws, using zip ties to link the two pieces, then tightening the screws up again. He's a little more wobbly than before, but he sits in his porch chair just fine as a Halloween decoration. It would be nice if the spine were reinforced somehow since this seems to be a common problem.",

There is spring in each bone connection, allowing the articulation.......which is the best feature of the skeleton after all............it can be difficult to compress the spring between the bolt and nut. Thus needing 2 people to accomplish a repair. I am amazed at the detail for such a reasonable price. Halloween is coming. .I'm definitely buying a dog skeleton to go with my man skeleton.
