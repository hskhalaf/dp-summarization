    "title": "Leeo Smart Alert Smoke/CO Remote Alarm Monitor for iOS and Android",
    "description": "Leeo Smart Alert is the smart, plug-in safety device that lets you know via smartphone if your home\u2019s smoke or carbon monoxide (CO) alarms go off while you\u2019re away. You can listen, dismiss, or notify local 911 from wherever you are. What\u2019s more, there are no monthly fees and it works with the smoke and CO alarms you already have, giving you connected home security without the cost. With over 16 million soothing colors, peace of mind has never looked better.\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\nAdded security when seconds count In a fire or CO leak, acting fast can make all the difference. Leeo listens for alarms and notifies you the moment it hears one, so you can take action from wherever you are. You can listen to the alarm, dismiss the notification, or contact local 911 \u2014 all right from the app.\n\nNo installation. No monthly fees. Because Leeo works with the alarms you already have, there\u2019s no complicated setup. And with no monthly fees, Leeo makes peace of mind very affordable. Just plug it in, connect to your home\u2019s WiFi, and you\u2019re good to go.\n\n\nTwo-minute setup Leeo works with your existing, up-to-code smoke and CO alarms. Just plug it in and connect to your home\u2019s WiFi for the easiest installation ever.\n\n\nOne per home Because Leeo listens for the frequency of your existing smoke/CO alarms, you only need one \u2014 and not 7 or 8 \u2014 for a typical home. \n\n\nCalls for help Leeo knows your home\u2019s local emergency number and calls friends and family members you choose if you\u2019re away from your phone. \n\n\n\nLeeo blends seamlessly into any home, while the ambient light setting turns on a soft light when it\u2019s dark. Easily change the color right in the app for soothing or dramatic lighting effects. Simply rotate the outer ring to change the brightness. \n\nAbout the Startup \nDescribe your product in 3 words.\n\nComforting, enlightening, beautiful. \n\nWhere did you get the inspiration for your product?\n\nIn our previous company, RoboteX, we designed and manufactured first responder robots for hundreds of federal, state, and local government agencies across the world and saw how our robots quickly became an essential part of first responder strategy and tactics. Everything was becoming interconnected and intelligent. We kept thinking about ways we could translate this technology into the consumer space. That\u2019s why, when Adam\u2019s family friend\u2019s house burned down and they lost everything they owned (including their cats), we were deeply affected. If a home had working smoke alarms and Wi-Fi, and its owner had a smartphone, why couldn\u2019t they be alerted when something went wrong? Our friends eventually rebuilt their home. We put together an amazing team, including our chief designer Robert Brunner (former chief designer of Beats by Dre and head of design at Apple) and chief operating officer Charles Huang (founder of Guitar Hero), to build Leeo with the mission of providing beautiful products and services that provide peace of mind and make you say, \u201cWow.\" \n\nWhat differentiates your product from similar products out there?\n\nLeeo is extremely easy to use. Just plug it in and connect to your home\u2019s WiFi. That\u2019s it! And because it listens for the frequency of your existing smoke/CO alarms, you only need 1 for a typical home \u2013 much cheaper than replacing all of your existing alarms. It has additional features like millions of hues and temperature/humidity monitoring, too. \n\nTell us about the best and most challenging parts of the creation process.\n\nWe knew we wanted the Leeo Smart Alert to be beautiful \u2013 something you'd be proud to display in your home. Even though sensors have become smaller over the years, it was a huge challenge to fit both the sensor technology and power supply into its current form factor. We went through dozens of iterations until we were happy with the size. One of the best parts was working with our chief designer Robert Brunner and chief product strategist Matt Rolandson. Their team brought so much energy and expertise in designing not just a beautiful product, but a striking and enlightening brand. And there\u2019s more to come!",
