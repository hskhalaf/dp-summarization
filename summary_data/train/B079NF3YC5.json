Tuesday morning they put me on hold for 26 minutes...They can do that because i already made my purchase. Their operating manuals leave a lot to be desired - i wanted to know about \"holding\" and it was hard to find information on this. They missed the boat on simple data tracking like tracking the temperature. They could have had a way to put the savings into dollars. They had a hard time answering simple questions like how often does the mobile app refresh? Disappointed.",

      "text": "There are two things I wish I would have know before I bought it. 1) There are functions and settings based on the outdoor temperature. It gets it's outdoor temp from the internet, based on your location. If you currently have temp sensing wires to use the actual outdoor temp you will not be able to use them. 2) There is no manual setting if you want your unit to use Emergency (Auxiliary) Heat. You can only set the outdoor temp that you want it switch over to Emergency heat mode which is not accurate due to comment number one. I hope this helps.",
