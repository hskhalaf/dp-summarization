I have to be careful not to use too much because it can get too dark very easily. I'm in my 60s; if I were younger I might want more shine or a darker color, which would be easy to achieve with this. The Prestige Lip Liner in Mocha works very well with it.",

I took 2 stars off because it's really sticky. If I kept my hair down, inevitably it got stuck to my lips. The other reason is that I had to constantly reapply. If I took more than one sip of coffee, I had to put more on. Not much in the moisture category, either. Hope this helps :)",

I got the red velvet figuring it would be a pretty little pop of color but no. It just drained my color. I gave it to my sister, she likes bold colors. That being said, I do love the feel of it on my lips and will be buying another color. Maybe a deep pink color.",

When first applied I thought it would be sticky and overly shiny, but I was wrong. It literally glides on softly and is not sticky whatsoever. The gloss smells like its name, and for $6, I will be buying more colors to add to my collection. Sephora is going to miss me ;)",

This lipgloss is perfect for casual days, with professional outfits or even a night on the town, I have not had a bad experience with this. It also has a lovely balance between shiny and glossy which is something other products I've got have lacked. For the women worried about how it would blend with your skin because it's a shade of brown, put your worries to rest because this is probably the best natural shade lipgloss out there.",
