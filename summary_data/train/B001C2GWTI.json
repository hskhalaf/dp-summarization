There's a malfunction one day, the cup and the base completely locked together and inseparable. The blade won't turn. Bye bye The grinder really grinds things into powder, but there are better grinder out there. This is not worth the price.",

The \"warranty\" - which I wish I had known before I purchased it - says to, first, ship the product on my own expense to NJ, which will be about $15; then add a check for $10 more for Cuisinart for \"shipping and handling\". This all is for them just to start looking at the broken grinder. So, like, spend $25 more on something that's worth $35 new and that I am not even sure can, or will be, repaired. This is a shame, not a warranty.",

Only used it twice. I could still use it since it does work, but I can't wash it in dishwasher since the blade doesn't want to unlock. Very poor design... going to buy a spice and nut grinder now from a different company.",

Coffee (or whatever) is ground unevenly - after running for 20 seconds which is ample for less than 1/2 cup of beans. I have included a picture that shows that there is fine grinds at the bottom with coarser grinds towards the top. Additionally, underneath the base of the cup there are residual grinds. Forget ever doing anything that has any moisture. Overall, it is disappointing that Cuisinart didn't get it right. If I could return it i would. Will probably go back to the basic KRUPS grinder.",

Probably fine for some uses, but not the texture I'm looking for. So calling it a \"nut grinder\" is not consistent with the results we expect from other nut grinders.",
