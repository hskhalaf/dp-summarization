KitchenAid's instructions online to troubleshoot the unstable head seem to apply to an earlier or later version of the mixer - they refer to a flat screw in the shaft to tighten, but this model does not have a screw following that description, just something that looks like it requires a special key or part.

      "title": "Missing the Splash Guard On A New Model!",
      "text": "I first tried one of the refurbished models with no luck. It had a terrible vibration when it tried to knead bread dough, so I returned it and bought a brand new model. It is beautiful, well packaged, but when I took it out of the box, NO SPLASH GUARD! This model was new and stated on the box that the splash guard was included. I'm disappointed but won't be returning it. I've made some wonderful bread, grated cheese, and coconut, and baked a cake all in the first week! KitchenAid definitely is the Cadillac of mixers!",

The paddle was too far from the bottom of the bowl and it also didn't lock down very well. Fortunately, one adjustment solved both problems. A handy dandy video on the website showed the hidden screw and how to adjust it.",
