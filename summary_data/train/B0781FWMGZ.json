Some of the oldest pictures came a little blurry and the colors and lighting somewhat off, but that was the exception and not the rule.",

No reset, or power down could get it out of a settings mode and the buttons to select options stopped working at that point. Not that user friendly. The return however was easy. Dropped it at Kohl\u2019s. On a side note, bought the Kodak one and it worked fairly well. Just keep in mind that continuous feed means you keep feeding slides.",
