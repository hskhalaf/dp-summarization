      "text": "The book explains the contents pretty clearly, but at least half of the practice questions are undoable. Not only are they much harder than the real test, they are usually phrased in a bad manner or provide too little background for one to answer. Some of them are just pure bias based on one's personal coding preference. Would recommend if you are challenged by the content, but don't count it as a good source of practice.",
