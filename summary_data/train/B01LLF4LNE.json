      "text": "2nd pair purchased. Last year my son, who wears glasses, worked at a ski resort and I purchased the Gonex Oversized Ski Googles because they are over sized and fit over glasses, which are hard to find. Unfortunately his apartment was destroyed in a fire in the fall and the googles were in the apartment. He, again, is working at the ski resort and needed another pair. He wanted the same ones. I went on Amazon to \"my orders\" and luckily these were still in stock! He loves these glasses and I love Amazon!!",

Other brands I've tried say they're designed to wear over glasses, but the foam pressing against the bows makes them uncomfortable. These Gonex goggles also feature good ventilation, which keeps them from fogging up in very cold weather. I love wearing them for snow blowing. The hard case for storage is a welcome addition, too. The only problem I have with the goggles is that where the lens is glued to the frame, it looks a bit messy. Other than that, I'm quite satisfied with these goggles.",

I also really like the hard case for the goggles. Highly recommended for this purpose!",

      "text": "The goggles I received are not as displayed here, but I was only slightly disappointed with this. They are the same goggles but all black with a rainbow lens, not all rainbow-colored. Compared to more expensive goggles, they feel somewhat less solid, but this does not seem to affect their performance. There are cutouts in the foam to fit glasses; I have no trouble fitting mine. Though, if it's windy, the gap leaves room for cold air to sneak in. All in all, I'm satisfied with this purchase, especially because I did not have to pay upwards of $100 for decent goggles. Thanks, Gonex. Gratefully, Devin",
