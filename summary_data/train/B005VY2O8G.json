He also said that the difference between this shield and the Revgear Economy Kick Shield (listed on Amazon as \"Revgear Combat Kick Shield BJJ MMA\" - Manufacturer reference: 829001) is that 829001 is foreign made. However, both the Krav Maga shield and this one are made in the USA. That is why they are more expensive. I'll pay a few dollars more for US made.",
