One other thing (most important)--several pieces have rough places on the lips.I may try to sand them down. I wouldn't buy this set again--would probably go with Amazon's Choice.",

They were both cute, but didn't stand up to the real water and real snacks that my children were using. One of the pretty colored metal sets had some water left in it and rusted in the bottom. The other plastic with princess stickers couldn't stand up to the wear. This set is perfect. It's already been used. The cups and tea pot hold water. All of the pieces are washable (I washed by hand, not dishwasher.) It's a great price point and the colors are terrific for both my son and daughter.

There were several other brands but when he saw the colors on this he wanted it. It's great because it's sturdy, easily held by a toddler and adult and the multiple colors help with learning since he likes to name the colors. It's been fun and I recommend this product, especially if you have a rambunctious toddler like I do!",
