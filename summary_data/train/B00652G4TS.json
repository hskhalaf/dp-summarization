I had to go to my local auto part store and have their scanner tell me it is the left rear wheel sensor. I am not happy with the fact that it was not able to isolate the problem when clearly the fault code that was stored in the vehicle indicates which wheel sensor is faulty. The vehicle is a 2004 Pontiac Montana AWD.",

I had to use professional tool to get the reading on SRS and ABS. False advertisement and too expensive for basic OBDII reading. Just another gadget with bells and whistles but not true value. Would not recommend it to anyone.",

The BlueDriver Scanned my truck and diagnosed the problem. It paid for itself already. I now carry it in the glove compartment of my vehicle... I'll never again be left wondering why my service engine light is on.",

Most of the live data modules were not supported. Maybe 25-30% actually worked. $100 and the thing can\u2019t read both upstream and downstream voltages on an O2 sensor. Most of the good reviews praise the BlueDriver for code reading. FYI, you can get a good code reading OBD2 device for $30 or less.",
