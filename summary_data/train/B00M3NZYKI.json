      "text": "Sound is good, they're fairly comfy but sit quite big on your head (I've got quite a small head though). Main gripe is quality, they seem to be built well but the first pair I was sent started to get the material on the ear bit flaking off within a week. Amazon sent me a new pair, which have been fine for a couple months now until today when one of the padded bits came off and I've lost it. Also, the sound has been crackling the last two months when I move the cable or my phone, which is quite annoying when you're walking with your phone in your pocket or at the gym!",

The sound is quite bassy, not in a bad way like cheap headphones though. A bit like beats headphones I guess, but far better value for money because you aren't paying a premium for the fashion brand",

Very stilish and light, built with strong materials and perfect to travel around with public transports: they have a great isolation, the right size and a detachable cable. Very comfortable also if you wear glasses, after some hours your ears could sweat though. Sometimes, on high sounds, could be not exactly the best, but it happens when music is playing very loudly and just with some kind of music/instrument. I'm very happy with them.",

Never had any issues with them, except the wire which id change every few months. When these arrived it was perfect, I threw away the box expecting it to work but after few days the left side stopped playing music. It would come on and off but mostly off. Thought it was the wire so I ordered one to replace it, needless to say the new wire didn't change anything. Very disappointed with this product and myself for throwing the box away so no refund.",

All in all still great headphones apart from the minors. Wouldnt use another brand, Sennheisers are still the best in build and sound.",
