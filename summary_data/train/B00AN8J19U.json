Found out I couldn't have a gas fireplace insert since my tv was mounted on the front of my fireplace too close to the opening -- and no other place to put the tv in my living room. I ordered the smaller burner (12\" overall width; 8\" opening) since I wanted a small fire mostly for aesthetics. It arrived quickly - and WELL packaged. The set-up involved putting it in my fireplace, adding ethanol fuel, and lighting. It is everything I wanted at a reasonable price! I have ordered ceramic logs from Ignis.com to place around the burner to make it a bit more appealing. Overall a full 5 star rating!!",
