      "text": "These shoes are comfortable, fit just a little on the smaller size, and have a firm sole. They are good for casual weekend wear or for weights/cross training at the gym. However, I bought them for running (recommended by a popular running website) and they are too firm for me. I typically run about 25 miles/week on pavement and these don't provide enough cushion. After a few runs, I felt it in my shins/joints and returned to my Nike Frees. Keeping them for casual wear, but no more running in them.",

They were softer feeling in the midsole and maybe that's where the quicker wear occurred. Not sure, but I'll need to find something else for a speed shoe going forward.",

In contrast to high cusion, highly supportive shoes, the Zantes make your feet do a little more of the work, which is a good thing. They excel at fast running but Ive used it for slow long runs as well. Also important to note, the v4 feels very mich like the v3. They didnt change much.",

It is adequate for running and reasonably comfortable but it feels heavier and less cushioned than v2. also it is the first NB shoe I have bought in a while that did not fit as advertised. I am 11.5 D (medium). This shoe is at least a quarter size smaller. If I wear the thinnest pair of socks I own, it fits ok, but I prefer to wear thicker socks when running. NB: please bring back the Zante v2.",

While I do not think they are my favorite shoes, they are just a good solid fairly minimal shoes for some good 5-10 mile runs. I do not think I'd use these in a 10+ mile run, but I would consider them for a 5k-10k race since they are pretty lightweight and flat. Just good pair of trainers for a good price and if they are like the last couple pairs I hope to get 300-400 miles out of them.",
