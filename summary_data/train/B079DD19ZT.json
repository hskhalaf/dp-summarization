      "text": "I bought this sound bar to complement by Sony Bravia TV. Having read the write ups, I purchased a HDMI cable so that the TV remote would control both units. Having carefully followed the instructions, no matter what I tried I could not get any sound out of the sound bar. After some hours, I discovered an instruction in the TV manual which stated that the Bravia Sync mode should be enabled. The sound bar immediately started working. There is no mention of this in the sound bar's manual! The sound is much improved from the TV speakers with clearer speech and better sound all round. I gave it 4 stars because of the missing instruction.",

Sound is good with better stereo than tv speakers but I now have another remote for my collection. I have a Sky Q box and a PS4 connected to same tv so maybe these affecting HDMI ARC connection.

The soundbar was easy to set up. I put the sound quality onto 'Auto Sound' and left him to switch it on over christmas. He switched the TV on, pressed the volume 'Up' button a couple of times, changed the channel over to a Western movie when I heard 'F****** Hell!! That bullet was loud!' before reducing the volume to a reasonable level. Very Happy with the soundbar. Also paired to Amazon Alexa, so John Denver can now be heard singing in the living room!",

It also has no features on the remote to change the sound to make it better, and no LCD screen or decent app connectivity so you're kind of flying dark and choosing the options like 'film' 'voice' etc to see what sounds better. It also goes high and low during scenes when people are talking / there's some action so you're turning the volume up and down a lot to hear the show. I was using HDMI arc, and that's a nifty feature but overall I wouldn't recommend this at all.",

If you don't have the mounting screws far enough in then the unit droops down. When you do have them in enough then this leaves no room to hide the wires as most people would want to have the wires coming from the middle of the unit and not either end as with this. Very Bad design Sony.",

The remote works pretty well, but sometimes I need to press commands a few times to get a response. Again, I suspect it is possible that the tv is not quite new enough for perfection here. So my real rating is 4-5 stars. Easy to set up. Also has troubleshooting directions available online, which I have used.",

It even connects to Apple products via Bluetooth (not usual in our experience with non Apple products) so it can be used to play music etc from iPads/iPhones. All round well worth the money paid and would highly recommend if you want a basic, good sound bar.",

I have a SONY tv so you would think this would be easy to connect. Even after factory reset it still doesn't work. I have had enough of software not working and complicated set ups. I am very very disappointed .",

There will of course be better sounding & more powerful sound bars around but not at such a good price. If you want great quality & an excellent sound at a reasonable price this is a super buy.",
