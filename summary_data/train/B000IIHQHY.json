The original one I had lasted quite a few years and I didn't have any regular problems with it till it stopped working. Felt I had gotten pretty good value for the original. This replacement was used and it didn't last at all, I am sorry I bought it used. I had to do maintenance and cleaning constantly and it used up all the ink before I could even print any photos, the value for dollar after buying the machine and the ink was very bad. Now i am giving up on it and feel like I was ripped off.",

The previous model, titled PictureMate Deluxe uses a more complex ink system and the prints last longer. The current unit makes decent prints, but sadly, they are inferior to the discontinued line. This is a great product, in all forms, but while Epson has been busy finding ways to cheapen their product, the competition is printing 5x7's. Why has Epson gone backwards?",
