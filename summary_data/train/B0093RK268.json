      "text": "The comfort of the Clark's Orignal is a thing of the past. The crepe to soles do very little to compensate for the shoddy half insoles and odd sizing, which now feels exactly like walking on tight, thin cardboard. The Stinson is the new comfortable Wallabee, minus the crepe sole, which is a plus in my opinion. These shoes are very well made with a better sizing system. These are my second pair, in as many weeks and going down a half size will fit you perfectly. You can keep the newly made Originals which are neither authentic nor worth the high price tag anymore. These are my new go to shoes, at less than half the price.",

The soles on these are harder don\u2019t pick up quite as much color from the street as the crepe soles do. I\u2019m happy to have an alternative to the crepe at a good price.

I've worn these with jeans and tee shirt or with dress pants and a sport coat. They look great, they feel amazing, and they continue to last. What more can I ask for?

I immediately told family and friends, who said that they would try to make a purchase soon. I remember the shoes as a favorite, when I was a child. Clark delivers a great product.",

It\u2019s ok, they still look ok, but the photos are a bit deceptive.",

They were superb when they were \"Made in England\". I used one pair of U.K. Made for 15 years. They steel look great to me. But one day my wife got tired of them and gave them away. Recently, I decided to give them another try. They look fine. How long they will last, to be seen.",
