      "text": "Above all else, this camera is just fun to use because of its manual controls, but there's so much more to it than that. High ISO performance is very impressive. Fujifilm's lens collection is well rounded and they're all sharp with quality second to none. Weather sealing gives you good peace of mind when you're at the campground and everyone's kicking up dust or you want to take photos of puddles in the rain. The big, bright EVF is great for previewing what your shot will actually look like. The camera feels good in your hands, with a grip that's really good but not as deep and sure as a DSLR's but that's ok. Overall, I love this bad boy.",

The first few times I used the camera, it worked well, but then I started to get a major problem - the shutter button started to stick. I couldn't understand why because my XT1 had been used more and in worse conditions than the XT2. This is a major fault with the camera and it seems I'll have to take it back to Fuji to fix. If I were to choose again - I'd purchase the XT1 instead.",

Unfortunately I was horrified to see that the 350 page manual requires all kinds of settings that I was not prepared for.

Learning curve is a bit high but if you like reading the manual and watching YouTube videos for xt2 I guess it would be pretty direct and easy to master it.

Also there are toggle lock buttons in the center of the control knobs. On the xt1 you have to hold the center button to adjust ISO.

I have the 18-55 ois for generalist work and video. OIS is great. I've used ibis on lumix cameras and was affraid about fuji not having it. After a number of walking handled videos I am very impressed. My videos are stable and almost as good as on a ibis system. Buy this camera, it will make you fall in love with photography again! No Sony can do this for me. Not even the new a6500",

It is really silent and snappy. I really like the joystick for focusing. Also the grain feature is awesome. You can make photos look like them came straight outta a 35mm vintage camera, especially the B&W in Acros mode. Really loving the features of this. If you're on the fence, do it, I don't think you'll be disappointed.",

That being said, there is one flaw that I've found with this camera, the max low light ISO for a decent shot is 1600. Of course the camera can shoot at ISO 12 billion something but for a person who is critical of their images, 1600 is the max. Sure, you can take care of the noise in Photoshop, but I rather be shooting than Photoshopping. Regardless of ISO, this camera is still the cat's meow.",

I tried the recommended Raw editing apps but too slow compared to the Lightroom workflow. I don't have the time. I have now shipped my X-T2 back to Amazon and will be repurchasing a D750.
