We have a bunch of old, regular filters we are using up and may or may not purchase the Chemex brand filters But we do double them up, otherwise it seals into the pour spout, which acts as a vent during brewing and would cause hot coffee to shoot out of the top. The Chemex filters are stiffer and don't do this.",

The flavor is superior and worth the extra bit of time it takes to be over a traditional drip coffee maker. I am the only coffee drinker in the house, so this is a good size for making 20 to 30 ounces of brew. Get a bigger carafe is you need to make more than that on the daily.",

I typically make coffee for just one or two people, so I think I could have gotten a slightly smaller model, but 8 cups is definitely plenty.

I thought the glass was supposed to be stronger than that. Our water glasses could endure more. Otherwise, I love the coffee the Chemex produces.",

I grind the beans while waiting for the tea kettle to boil and then slowly pour water over the coffee. The taste difference, compared to an automatic drip machine, is astonishing. Tip! Use a Chemex filter for at least two reasons: they definitely make the coffee taste better than grocery store filters and they work with the Chemex carafe opening much better.",
