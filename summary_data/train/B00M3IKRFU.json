That's why I bought this, but I find that I also use it quite a bit to get the gunk off after I pull off a Band-Aid or whatever. I think it would be worthwhile to have this around even if you only use it very occasionally for that sort of thing--it's very effective. I use it infrequently enough that a box lasts for multiple years, but I've never had a problem with the pads drying out in their individual foil packets.",

Save your skin and have plenty of Uni-Solve on hand to remove the hydrocolloid adhesive from your skin, especially if you are finding yourself having to change out bags or flanges every day or couple of days due to leaks or other challenges. Just be sure to wash off all of the residue from your skin before applying the fresh bag/flange, or you may have trouble adhering. These wipes also do a great job removing hospital tape and heart monitor adhesive, etc. Any adhesive residue on the skin is easily removed using Uni-Solve. It's like an eraser for glue.",
