They said it was grey market meaning that it was originally purchased outside the USA. I bought this off Amazon, not knowing that it was a grey market item or knowing the products origin. This ended up being a total waste of money. Save your money, buy from Nikon direct. There is no way to determine if a camera originates in the US or not. There doesn't seem to be any way to reconcile with the vendor or Amazon either..",

I also shoot with a D810, and find that I rarely need files that large. The 24 MP files of this camera are a great compromise of size and file storage requirements, both in camera and afterward. If Nikon runs that sale again, grab one. The higher priced Nikons aren't worth the huge cost for most pros, let alone for those who just want a great camera. Anyone with good skills will take wonderful images with this camera!",

      "text": "After using a D90 for the last four or five years, the low light capabilities in this camera absolutely blow me away. 6400 iso with little to no grain is amazing in comparison to my old body. This camera shoots very warm in color, though, which is unexpected, and I've had to fiddle with many of the settings to get it just right, but I wouldn't trade this for any other camera out there right now.",

What was apparent about this camera was that the sensor itself was great and fast, also, my husband paired this with his Nikon \"Trinity\" 2.8 lenses and we were great some really great pictures.",
