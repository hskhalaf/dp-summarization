My main issue with this are the attachments and lack of attachment mechanicisms. It uses tension to hold the attachments on, however when the entire thing is vibrating due to the motor AND blowing strong hair, it causes the attachments to easily come off. On top of the attachments coming off, they will SHOOT OUT due to the powerful blower. In other words, keep your hands on the attachments or you risk spearing your computer or whatever you are dusting.",

I knew this was a risk before using it, just make sure you have a good grip on the nozzle part when in use (I only do this when working near sensitive components). I also recommend not using it so close to electronics as it's powerful enough where you don't need to be close in order for the device to be effective",

I use it for the pc's in my house, my AC, my air purifiers, I even use it for my dragon figures. I just hold them tight then blow them off. I use it for all kinds of dusting. It is a bit loud but worth it considering not only the cost of canned air but the waste in materials you throw away with each one of those canned airs... This thing has saved me about $300 so far and it is still going strong.",

Multiple colors to choose from: Green, Blue, Black,... 3. Multiple nozzle attachments: very useful for focused cleaning, with-brush cleaning, wide sweep, etc. Some attachments are difficult to figure out easily. 4. Does not look bad on counter table as it oddly looks like a kettle/ pot 5. Noise can be high: like a vacuum cleaner. Using it regularly now for business. I hope to post an update after some use.",

Sending it back 1 day after purchasing this item also the connectors have holes where more air blows out making matters worse.",

      "text": "I went looking for canned air and then ran across this XPOWER blower. It showed up in two days and I just used it on my extremely dusty custom machine. My machine is now clean as a whistle and my fans are all running a lot slower and quieter again, like they're supposed to. I'm pretty happy because I can now clean my computer the right way without having to lug it down to the shop and use their compressor to blow it out. Would definitely buy it again.",

Be sure not to set it down on a soft surface like a carpet, or resting on your flannel shirt as the air intake is on the bottom. You can actually run the intake side across the vents over your PC fans to suck the dust out if they're screened off and dust gets trapped there, but you'll want to clean the filter shortly thereafter.",
