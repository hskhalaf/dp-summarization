      "text": "I have tried several brands of reusable bags and I really enjoy these the best. I like that there is no separate apparatus to close or seal these bags, they have a sturdy ziploc style closure and their lay flat design is idea for maximizing space. We have used these on camping trips in our cooler and have been pleasantly surprised how waterproof they are. They are perfect for taking snacks for my toddler when we are on the go, and my husband uses them in his lunches. These have been a great buy and make me feel better about using less one time use plastic products.",

I've stored everything from leaky tofu to all sorts of vegetables with no spillage, or more importantly weird plastic baggie smells. They seal like a dream and look great! They also stack very well and keep my fridge super organized. It comes with a bunch of different sizes so you have options for whatever you may need to baggie! Love these!",

They do seem pretty leak resistant if not too full.

I only have one of the six left that is usable. Needless to say, I was looking for a new kind and these delivered. The lock is easy to close, and seems to be durable but thin enough to maintain its easy usage. I\u2019ve only been using these bags for a few weeks, so I can\u2019t confirm overall durability, but they appear to be solid quality. I also love the variety of size with color coded tops. Overall, I definitely recommend these, especially for the price!",
