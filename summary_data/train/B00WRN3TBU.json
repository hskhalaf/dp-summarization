This has replaced all my lotion, moisturizers, and cream, and I am able to use this liberally. It is more liquid than it is gel but still good. Great product.",

For me, it helps better than an antibiotic cream to help that kind of acne heal. You can also use it as a light hair gel for flyaways, a nice alternative to more chemical-laden hair products.",

I have had literally zero breakouts, my skin tone is more even, and my pores have all but disappeared. I also have a pretty bad scalp, and this stuff helps calm that down and clear my flakes. The scent isn't that great, but honestly its very mild and goes away as soon as its dry.",

If I'm not careful, I'll get a sunburn on those first hot days of summer, then it turns into a tan and I'm good for the rest of the season. With this product, my burn does not last nearly as long, is not as painful, and peeling is minimum. It absorbs quickly into your skin and you don't feel icky like you do with other aloe gels. I've noticed a number of the reviews complain of a fishy smell. To me, it's pretty neutral- it's not really good or bad. And, the bottle lasts a long time. Two (tan!) thumbs up!",
