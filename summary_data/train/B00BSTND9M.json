Upon attempting to assemble it, however...the metal pieces supplied to lock the sides and bottom into place were cheap, cheap cheap...several sheared off. It seemed like the metal lock screws (for lack of a better name) didnt line up with the screw heads they were designed for. I've assembled dozens of items before, so can't blame it on inexperience. Ended up returning it. Advice to company: spend a little more on R & D design and quality of fasteners.",

TIPS: Put the hamper together on firm, flat flooring/surface -- not on a carpet/rug. Doing this on a carpet/rug can cause the hamper bottom to be uneven. Do not store hamper near any heating units since this is a wood product and it would become warped over time. Also want to avoid a possible fire hazard! I like the color of the wood. The laundry bag inside is washable. The lid has a notch in it to enable ease in opening it.",
