I had some snipe, but it was easily controlled by angling the board slightly. The wood finished easily with one pass of 120 grit and one pass of 220 grit. I did not have significant tearout issues. I'm still using the original blades, but I'll probably go ahead and pro-actively replace them before my next project. It's a ton of extra work to start with rough cut lumber, but I saved a ton of money doing it myself and I was able to use some really nice local wood.",

Run one plank through with a small knot in it and then you have to open it up and flip the ( two sided ) blade, one more little knot and you're done planing for the day... Yes, you can clean up the rises with a hand planer but that kinda defeats the purpose. Still worth the price I paid here, I guess. Would be much happier with it if they made blades that can take a little abuse.",

It can be picked up and moved here and there if you don't have a big woodshop. The drive that pulls the material thru the saw can struggle here and there so if your planing inconsistent or rough material like rough-sawn it's best to work the material long THEN cut it to length from the most consistent portion.",

Good board stock support, beyond the feed & exit table supports, reduces snipe considerably, especially for long stock. My one star reduction is for the feed and exit table design and adjustments. Could be better. Otherwise a good machice for my shop dust projects. I will keep it.",

    "description": "Model name:2019 ModelRemember when you brought those old jagged boards back to life? The WEN 12.5-inch Benchtop Thickness Planer with Granite Table repurposes rough and worn wood to give it an exceptionally smooth finish. The powerful 15-amp motor combined with our two-blade cutting system provides over 17,000 cuts per minute at a 26 feet per minute feed rate. Plane boards up to 12.5 inches wide and 6 inches thick with ease. The smooth granite table never warps and provides precise support to wood passing through the machine. Combine that with the heavy duty base for a sturdy planer that does not walk or wobble during operation. The handy depth adjustment knob varies each pass to take off anywhere from 0 to 3/32 of an inch. The fan-assisted dust port removes chips and sawdust from the workpiece and blasts them out of the way. This package also includes two high carbon steel double-edged blades (SK5) along with height-adjustable infeed and outfeed tables that limit snipe while providing extra support to your workpiece during planing. Easily mount the planer to a work surface or stand using the predrilled base holes. Repurpose old wood or make a set of boards flush with the WEN 12.5-inch Benchtop Thickness Planer. And because it\u2019s a WEN product, the WEN Thickness Planer comes backed by a nationwide network of skilled service technicians, a helpful customer support line and a two-year warranty. Remember when your planer could handle even the hardest of woods? Remember WEN.",
