I knew in advance that comforters should be dry cleaned, but the tag with Dry Clean only was kind of a dead give away...just sayin'. If your expecting some super high end set then you will be disappointed because this isn't it, but if you have realistic expectations of what you'll receive for a C note you'll be satisfied.t-you get what you pay for..",
