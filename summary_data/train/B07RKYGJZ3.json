It gets high marks for its top-notch comfort, ultra lightness, and sturdy construction. The strapping is a huge plus. Even without the hook and loop, the buckle system perfectly holds the foot in place.While tying it up can be a little challenging for some, this hiking sandal promises comfort and a good fit all the way.",

        "The majority of the Columbia Columbia Sandal reviews say that this stylish hiking sandal is feather-light",

        "It has an effective strapping design that keeps the foot secure, according to a couple of wearers",

I wish the straps were a little thicker as they tend to fold or bunch up where they pass through the side buckles, and they could also be half an inch longer to make putting them on easier. They don\u2019t feel like they\u2019ll last all that long, but long lasting sandals (a year or more) from any brand seem to be a thing of the past.",

Purchased (now returning) pair of these sandals Late in season I know but now I know why they had such a selection. This is a well below average product for any outdoor purpose: ordered 1/2 size larger (always works for my Columbia sandals) and way too small. The binding system is totally inadequate in length and construction. Would appear to have been designed by someone for whom \"outdoors\" is equivalent to a mall. Going to continue to shop Columbia and just hope this is a single item miss and not a new direction for the company.",

I purchased the men blue model and it was very comfortable, however the front is a little short so your toes arent protected if you were to bump into a step or accidentally kick a rock. I understand this is an issue with most open toe sandals, but keens and tevas offer models with a wider and longer open toe rubber that protects your feet. I did really like the extra pieces of cloth under the straps that further protect your feet from friction blisters.",

I'm just so pissed off because I used a $10 promotional credit and now it's lost since I'll have to return these size 10. I tried to swap for size 11 but they can't exchange (so they said). Other than the size the sandals are awesome, great quality, comfortable, the blue ones (I ordered) look beautiful, bright color just as in the pictures.",

I purchased these after owning a pair of Columbia Riptide II\u2019s and they do not compare in my opinion.",
