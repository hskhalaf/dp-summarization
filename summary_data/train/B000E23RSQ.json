They aren't creamy or buttery like my older ones. I'm not sure that these are any better quality than my Crayolas.

I won't do it again. In my experience,\u200b not that much is gained in quality over the Crayolas. I have the sharpener made by Prismacolor as well, and I have as much trouble getting a fine point on these as I did with the Crayolas, and as much or more breakage while working. Maybe I need more instruction on proper usage, but for me, it will be cheap ones from now on.",

It took me several years to master the technique. You must use a quality sharpener (never electric) and hold the pencil close to the barrel. The key is to sharpen SLOWLY.

They are soft enough to use without smearing and all the colors seem to have the same hardness. With other brands I have bought there are always some colors that are too hard to use. They just tear the paper up. They work well on standard weight and heavier paper and the color goes on evenly for all weights that I have tried.",

You have to take out the wobbly trays of colored pencils without spilling them and then lay them out on a table, if you have the room. I ended up having to just dump all the pencils in the box and dig through them (taking longer) to find the right color. It's a really poor design considering they have other larger sets with a superior layout. Why not use the same layout (for ease of access) with this smaller set?",
