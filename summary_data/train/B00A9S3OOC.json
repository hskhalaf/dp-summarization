Be aware the speakers in the projector itself are terrible but it can easily be hooked up to external speakers. We've watched several shows/movies inside projecting on a blank wall in the living room. Even at dusk when there's still decent light outside, this thing projects a bright enough image to watch. Our primary reason for purchasing this projector, however, was for an outdoor movies. It works really well for us.",

The picture is fantastic and clear and easy for most to use.The picture resolution is very good and optimal for a standard 96\" projector screen. I have nothing but good things to review about this projector, as I have used mostly viewsonic and Infocus projectors in the past for their ease of use, dependability, cost and quality. If your needs are simple and need to save money on a projector for a small-medium size meeting area( about 200 people), then this is a good one. This projector also has proven well for portability and is rugged enough for travel.",

It has lasted longer than I thought it would, and has provided \"good enough\" video quality in a dark room with a screen set up on the wall. I set it to 720p mode for movies, TV, and games, which after conversion left a bit of the projected space blank, but still presented pretty well. Overall, even seven years later this is a pretty good projector if you can get it on sale.",

The image quality is pretty good, but don't expect 1080p from this. Don't expect crystal clear pictures because you'll be disappointed. Regardless the quality is good. The picture is very bright even in lit up rooms. One thing I didn't like is that you can see the individual pixels when up close to the screen. We used a large pull down projector screen. If your wanting theatre like picture and resolution spend a couple hundred more on one that produces a 1080p signal",

We have the sound going out to an amplifier and speakers for bigger sound. My husband was super impressed by this projector (despite being a skeptic initially about the whole movie night experience) and now he asks for movie nights and popcorn.

You can hook up the TV, DVD player, computer, flash drive, etc. It is great for presentations as well. The only drawback is the sound. The sound is not loud at all. I knew this from other reviews.

Between this projector and the 12 foot screen, we've become the envy of our neighborhood during movie nights. Many people have stopped and asked about our equipment, which we gladly tell them about.

Hoping that goes down. I'd like to run 2-3 bulbs through it before I need to replace. P.S.

I had the projector some 5 feet away from the screen and it only projected a screen equivalent to a 47\" or 50\" screen. My older projector would be only two feet away to create that big a screen.

The one thing prevents me from giving 5 stars is that it's resolution is really low. 800x600 pixels is okay for movies but for demonstrations it's not quite sufficient. The specifications, unfortunately, kind of hiding this by only mentioning SVGA, instead of the actual picture resolution. Because of the low resolution if the picture is projected to a large screen then you can see each individual pixels. Which is not a huge issue but it makes it not so natural to look.",

      "text": "I tried this unit and the Brookstone. I kept the Brookstone because for my needs, it's better. The view sonic is brighter, so for anything but dark rooms, it wins. It does create a lot of heat. I'm in a small office and that was not acceptable. They both are a little noisy, but if you can sit far away from the units, no problem. The picture on the Brookstone, though darker, looks more like a movie should look.The Veiw sonic, even with it's adjustments still looks less cinematic. I returned the Viewsonic. It's not bad, but I did prefer the Brookstone of rite's small size, lack of heat, and more cinematic picture.",

Picture quality is good not the best but over all for the money you can't beat it. It's super bright so even when the lights are on you still get a good picture. If you sit right in front of the screen you can see the pixels kinda but that's like 2 feet away. 4 ft back it's very clear and really gives you that movie theater at home.",

I'd love to return this defective thing and have a re-do, but time changes everything and electronics are a business of fresh garbage and this projector is no exception - not in prodcution anymore Yours truly, Critically Overheating",

For fast action, the response time is also on the order of 1,000 times faster than similar LCD based projectors. And with no air filters to clean or change, the latest generation of DLP based projectors from ViewSonic offer amongst the lowest TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) in the industry.\n\nBRILLIANTCOLOR TECHNOLOGY\nViewSonic\u2019s PJD5134 projector with BrilliantColor technology features multi-color processing to produce stunning, vibrant colors. Unlike other technologies such as LCD which use just 3 primary colors to produce the image, the PJD5134 uses up to 6 separate colors.

With multi-color processing, colors are richer and more vibrant with exquisite and precise detail. \n\nMAINTENANCE FREE WITH FILTER-LESS DESIGN\nViewSonic\u2019s PJD5134 projector features a filter-less design. Unlike LCD projectors that require the user to clean, sometimes to replace, filters after every 100 to 300 hours of operation, ViewSonic\u2019s PJD5134 projector is filter-less eliminating the need for filter cleaning or filter replacement. This saves you significant maintenance dollars and labor over the projector\u2019s lifespan, and lowers your total cost of ownership (TCO).\n\nLONG-LASTING RELIABLE PICTURE QUALITY & SUPERIOR COLOR PERFORMANCE\nViewSonic DLP projectors provide reliable picture quality you can trust and superior color performance you can count on after thousands of hours of usage. Built on DLP technology, the ViewSonic PJD5134 projector virtually eliminates image degradation known as color decay \u2013 yellow/faded tint that LCD projectors may develop after extended use.
