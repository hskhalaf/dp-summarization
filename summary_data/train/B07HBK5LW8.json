Unlike other Models of KitchenAid Toasters that got mixed reviews over performance and especially the annoying \"Safety Belt Buzzer) that goes off at the end of ever Toasting Cycle (without) a Turn-Off Mode, this Toaster simply does its job and ends the toasting cycle without an annoying alarm clock to remind you to remove your Toast/Bagel and butter it before it turns stone cold. Haven't had it long but so far, I think its a winner. My old KitchenAid Toaster in Empire Red that when through a Plastic Lift Handle that broke off at least once a year was finally retired after over 10 years of daily use.",

Another issue is the toasting function. The \"toast\" function pops up after 10 seconds and does nothing. I have to put it on the \"frozen\" function to cook toast properly.",

No hint of browning at all. Repeated next day with same bread, shade control knob to almost top setting, still had same result. Not impressed: the extra step--the defrost button--doesn't seem to add much except complexity to setup. It's a toaster, it will handle a variety of bread sizes, but despite the pretty red color, not loving it. It's functional, but not a great device.",

The basket is narrow and doesn't pop up high enough to allow you to retrieve the toast unless the slice is the size of Wonder Breadwithout sticking a knife in to get it. Save your money.
