      "text": "My three y/o neutered male cat started urinating behind the litter box about once a month. $$$ spent at the vet. Can't really find anything wrong. Three months on UTI + and not one accident. Cat has had kidney issues since about 12 weeks. Had sub-q fluids for months. No infections. BUN a little high, but on raw diet. Had tried just about everything; medications, CBD, other homeopathic remedies, tweaking diet. He's also happier as he obviously feels better.",

I have used it everyday once a day now and she is herself again. Thank you",

Noticed symptoms on Monday, started medicine Tuesday along with urinary tract specific food and by Wednesday he seemed like he was already feeling a little better.

I was so happy for him and it saved me money not having to take him to the vet. I definitely would have taken him had I not seen a vast improvement right away. I highly recommend this product!
