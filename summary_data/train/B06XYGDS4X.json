Lumipets (this company) is excellent. I bought a bunny from GoLine Tech and it broke and they have yet to respond to my email.",

The colors are nice (a bit bright for a night light though), the color changing effects are cool, and my kid loved tapping it to change modes. But it lasting (or not lasting I should say) is the problem. We already had to order a replacement as the 1st one was defective, so then the 2nd one came and now 3 months later the power button and the charging port are both broken making it inoperable. And of course we're past the return window by 2 weeks. Waste of money, I'll be looking for a new brand for my kid's night light.",

My only other issue is that the battery seems to only last a night or two before it dies, so sometimes we plug it in and use it that way.",

Although they say your child can sleep with it, or that it's movable, I highly recommend keeping it static and plugged in. Also, the plug on our second bear would no longer stick, so we ended up having to glue it so it is always plugged in.",

I ordered the bunny before the bear and my daughter really liked it so I ordered another one for my other daughter. The material is silicone and seems sturdy. The issue is the bulb keeps either falling inside the body cavity or falling out. Which makes it a little tiresome to have to fix it daily multiple times a day. The annoyance of having to fix it is why it does not get 5 stars. Plus not sure how it happen, but the USB plug pulled from the cord. So we just use one of our extra plugs from the Kindle.",

      "text": "This is our second one. First was a bear. Our son (almost 3) loves it! We have had the bear since Christmas 2018. The charging base in the bear went bad and won\u2019t take a charge any longer. We ordered another to give it a shot again (since our little man loves it so much!) We ordered a bear .... received a bunny.... not going to waste the time or companies money sending it back.... just keeping the bunny. I would definitely recommend this item pending the charging system doesn\u2019t fail again on us. \ud83d\udc4c",

We\u2019ve tried the typical night lights that plug into the wall and this weren\u2019t bright enough to make her feel comfortable. We tried this light because she was able to cuddle with it and she LOVES it! The light lasts about 2-3 nights, all night, before needing to be recharged. It\u2019s bright enough to light up the room but has a cool light tone that doesn\u2019t keep her awake, and the fact that it\u2019s soft and cuddly is a huge bonus. Now she has no problems now sleeping in her room all night.",

It holds its charge for two nights straight so far, including a little use during the day. I will likely buy the bunny as well. FYI, if your child happens to step on it and either deflate it or pop the bottom light source out, you can easily pop it back in and blow a quick breath into it to fix it.",
