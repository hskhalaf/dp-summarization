I still liked the watch and would have settled for it to just show time and count steps without getting the text message; however, it doesn't even do that anymore. I would not buy it again.

Other things potential purchasers may want to know, the silver around the face of the watch is not very durable, I wore mine every day and the silver part is all scratched off (less than 2 months), I do a lot of outdoor activities so I am probably harder on it than the average person.",

It does that in a vicious cycle until it dies. All in all, it worked great but not worth it to only last a couple years not wearing it full time.",

The watch can easily come off when brushed up against a belt or if you're doing lifting or something active. I do hear that there is a fix for that though. Besides that, I would recommend this product. The lcd screen started flickering after a year and lost color. Maybe their newer products will last longer.",

It is so much more intuitive than the Charge HR. I know there are a lot of complaints about the accuracy of the heart rate so I tested mine up against a chest-strap monitor and if not worn too tight or too loose it was +/- 2 points so I'm very happy with those results.

I like it, the only thing it you have to tell it when you start sleeping and when you wake up, so there were times where, according to it, I had slept 14 hours, because i forgot to turn off the sleep mode. I used to have a fitbit, and I didn't have to tell it when i was sleeping, somehow it just knew. But overall I like the Gear Fit",

My favorite must have app is the Navigation app, which displays Google Maps on your wrist, a lot safer than looking down at your phone, last about 2-3 day on a charge depending on what you use. The only con is the band can unlatch and you could loose it. 5 stars if they fix the band, purchased after market Clasps. Compared to a Fit bit, way more features for about the same cost.",
