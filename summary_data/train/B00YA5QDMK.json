If it was manufactured before September 2015, like mine was you will run into a lot of problems with the item. The models manufactured before September 2015 were recalled due to having several manufacturers defects. I experienced the split screen, where half of the screen becomes unusable with static like lines that you used to see when a tv station was signed off at the end of the night. It is very frustrating. I am in the process of sorting this situation out with Amazon, as the fault is not mine. They sold a defective phone!",

Now, I use it as a paperweight because LG has taken for frigging ever to respond, and when they do, they give silly suggestions like change the battery, when we all know it's more than that. So initially, a 5/5, now a -50/5, mostly because it's so light that it doesn't do it's secondary function as a paperweight well.",

First review: Great phone, awesome pictures it takes. Sometimes gets too hot eg.: using Skype for video calling on 4G. After installing Marshmellow (android 6.0) it got a good bit faster, but also the battery runs down quicker. This may be in part to the fact that I installed Kapersky Security about the same time, also use LockWatch.",

Just be aware of which unlocked version you're getting.",

It is a manufacturers DEFECT (commonly referred to a BOOT LOOP) Now WHAT? Just loose all my stuff and out hundreds of $$ since no warranty? LG What can you do to help your customers, I would try another phone if LG helped deal with this issue. I had a LG g3 which was great but the wifi died on the phone. How many times until you help your customers LG?",

Everything works well, problems would be typical android problems, eg suddenly nothing downloads, can't update, but seems it's a Microsoft's issue. Very clear photos, although the file size far too large even on smallest setting. Difficulty in the dark, as with most cameras. I don't find the flash strong enough. My laptop has trouble recognizing what's stored in the phone's internal storage or SD chip when cord plugged in, thank goodness the mini SD chip is removable although transferring pictures becomes tedious. Leather very nice on the hand and surprisingly strong, no scratch yet.",

It would not come back on despite all of my attempts at troubleshooting and when I called LG customer support, they could not even verify that this phone was manufactured by them...WHAT!!? Now, I am stuck trying to figure out what amounts to a beautiful brick that may or may not have been manufactured by the company that I believed it to be manufactured by....so....stay away!!!
