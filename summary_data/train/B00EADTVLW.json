You will need to swap out the current battery and battery cover on your remote with the provided ones. It's very easy to place the remotes on the station. Due to the 45 degree angle, sometimes, if you are careless and don't place it right, the remote will slide down and fall so make sure you don't place this somewhere high as the remote may take a big drop. The remotes look really nice while they are charging as well.",

The charger has worked well for over two years, as long as they remember to put the controllers back on the charger. This is actually a great trick since it keeps them from leaving stuff lying around-- you need to put the controller away! It charges quickly, holds a charge plenty adequate for a non-marathon gaming session, and has been almost no trouble at all. It even looks good. My one gripe is that now after two years you often have to jiggle the controller to get a good connection-- otherwise the charge doesn't happen.",

There is no way it would reach a floating TV shelf or something similar. It also collects a lot of dust and is difficult to clean each week.

Holds about 6hrs of gaming charge. Once the controllers are done charging on the station, they turn green, but keep charging until you remove them from the charging station, which if left for a long period of time will damage the battery life.

      "text": "Very elegant design, easy to place remotes and remove them. However, you may have to manipulate placement of remote a little to get the charging LED to activate. Works as described, bargain since it comes with rechargeable battery packs. Does not affect weight on controller. Will comment again once I test battery life, (or maybe not since when I am done playing I will likely place it back in the charger). Update: Been using this product for a while now. Extremely happy with this purchase, likely the best charging system out there. Battery life is comparable to batteries and other charging systems but if you place them in holder when you are done playing, you will never run low.",

The weight of the controllers holds the charge surface where it needs to be and alight indicates that it's properly seated. After that initial setup just slide the controllers into the slots to charge. Very easy. Charges quickly, holds charge for more than 12 continuous hours of play. I'm very pleased with this product. I would highly recommend.",

This has an open spot that allows the batter to make contact with the charger. That way when you can just dock the controller and not have to plug anything in. I gave it 4 stars because they contact points could be designed better. You have to line up the controller to the docking station and sometimes it takes a few tries. A little will turn on when the connection has been made.",
