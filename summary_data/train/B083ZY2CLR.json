Also what I like it that you can take apart a dust bin and emptied and you do not have to lift whole vacuum cleaner to do it. Vacuuming is very easy and smooth especially when you press an extra button and rotate brush starts working Edit: after using that for a week I decided to send it back, I found out it is a bit too heavy",

Our previous vax vac actually came with 2 batteries and was less expensive than this one and I've wondered why the same couldn't be done with this one?",

This is on one hand a nice little safety feature to stop the motor burning out. Overall very good on short pile and wooden floors.
