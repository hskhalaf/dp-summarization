I also scanned the bottom and side panel from the master carton these come in and have uploaded those images as well. I like these well enough to have set up a Subscribe & Save subscription for monthly delivery. My only advice is just to be careful about ordering in warmer months because these have a chocolate base that can become a melted mess. These ship with cold packs in the master box during warm weather; just make sure that once delivered you get them in the house or a cool environment as soon as possible to avoid a potential mess.",

I happened upon these goodness knows bars after typing healthy snack into the search. I read the ingredients, took note of the caloric intake, realized these bars could be a part of my diet so I ordered them, not expecting much!! BOY was I wrong!! The peanut butter ones and the mixed berry/almond bars completely satisfy my cravings for something sweet!! I am more than ok with that!! I recommend highly and parents I even believe your kids will eat these too!!!",

We demolished the box during the road trip, and I still look sadly into my hiking bag in case I somehow left one there. The chocolate and blueberry flavor was so perfectly melded and the almonds added a great texture. Probably my favorite bar out there (except for maybe mint chocolate Cliff bars...I'll have to do more research heh heh).",
