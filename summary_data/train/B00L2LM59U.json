Bought a cheap spray gun and played with the pressure a bit and covered the entire inside of my Jeep Wrangler YJ with 2 coats...Unfortunately for me the following days had temps below 40 degrees and didn't allow this stuff to cure properly. The entire back half started to crack and peel. I waited till the spring, prepped the back half and was still able to spray 2 coats on the back half of the tub which finally used up the gallon. Still gets 5 stars as the cracking and peeling was on me and I would buy again without a doubt, just be mindful of ambient air temp (which is listed on the container).",
