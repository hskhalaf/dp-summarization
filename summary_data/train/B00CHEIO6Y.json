Anyway.... kit came with everything shown. Bucket, clay, tubing, air pump, rockwool, and stone diffuser. It is perfect for your first system to learn with. Only reason I took off 1 star, the air pump is not very good. I ended up later upgrading it. Works fine for some plants, but larger plants that may need more oxygen should have a larger pump.",

All they did was drill a hole and put a rubber adapter for the water measurement line which is blue and impossible to read as others have pointed out. You could build this yourself probably for less and better quality.",

Update: Another lesson learned, always read ALL the instructions carefully, apparently i placed my air pumps at floor level about a foot below the water level which caused water to siphon into the pump.
