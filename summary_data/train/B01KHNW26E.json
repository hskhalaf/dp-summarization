I have found that the very best use for it is in GarageBand where you can replicate an endless amount of sounds to make your own background tracks. I could not for the life of me get the darned strap on though. The holes on the strap itself are way too small to force the peg into it to attach to the Jamstik. But I'm content playing it seated in a chair anyway on my lap.",

Also, that's not always the best way for me to learn. So when I saw the Jamstik, I thought it was my best shot at attaining my goal. So far, so great! The lessons are fun, the device was easy to set up and I'm able to go back to develop the basics that I know will help me to play guitar. I'm getting better every time that I practice. This is a well thought out product that is perfect for what I want.",

I'm not a musician, maybe they are better equipped, but my brain does not function that way.

    "description": "Style:Case Bundle\n\nThe jamstik+ is a digital guitar that works wirelessly (Bluetooth) with your devices and our apps to finally teach you how to play guitar. It comes with an interactive guitar lesson app series and works with a multitude of other music apps, so everyone from beginners to pros can just play. The jamstik+ comes with: 4 free apps, a guitar strap, 2 guitar picks and a rechargeable battery. \n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\n\n\nYES YOU CAN LEARN TO PLAY GUITAR. Maybe you tried guitar lessons once upon a time, learned a few chords but didn\u2019t stick with it for various reasons like: cost or time. Or maybe you\u2019ve never tried to learn for the same reasons. Those roadblocks are exactly why we created the jamstik+, the app-enabled smart guitar that teaches you how to play. Fast.\n\nIN FACT, YOU'LL BE PLAYING CHORDS IN MINUTES. How? The jamstik+ interactive teaching apps walk you through step by step. Sensors in the jamstik+ detect the placement of your fingers and display them in the app, giving you instant feedback with zero guesswork. Don\u2019t know how to read music or hold a pick? No problem. No music experience is needed to be successful with the jamstik+. It doesn\u2019t even need tuning.\n\n\n\n\nGUITAR & LESSONS IN ONE When you buy a jamstik+ your lessons are included in the form of simple, interactive teaching apps; saving you money.\n\nWIRELESS & PORTABLE The Bluetooth connection to your device is fast, stable and best of all, wireless. Being untethered gives you freedom to practice and play anytime, anywhere.\n\nMIDI: PLAY ANY SOUND Already a guitar player? The jamstik+ is a versatile MIDI controller, compatible with 100s of apps, so you can create virtually any sound you can think of. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Startup Describe your product in 3 words.\n\nLearn. Play. Create.\n\nHow did you come up with the idea for this product?\n\nThe inspiration for the jamstik+ was ignited when we saw the popularity of guitar rhythm games peak in the late 2000\u2019s. The desire to learn guitar was amplified. At the same time, we saw the rise of mobile devices and the ways in which they were changing how we live, work and play. Bringing these worlds together resulted in the jamstik+, a portable smart guitar that can truly teach anyone how to play.\n\nWhat makes your product special?\n\nThe jamstik+ is the only digital (MIDI) guitar that has real strings, real frets and optcal sensors, which provide instant feedback while you're learning.\n\nWhat has been the best part of your startup experience?\n\nWithout a doubt, the best part is seeing the looks on people's faces when they play their very first guitar chords on the jamstik+. They're surprised, excited and want to keep playing.",
