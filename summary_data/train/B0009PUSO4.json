I've been sleeping in this thing for a yearr straight now whenever it gets cold and it's held up and kept me warm as hell when it drops to 20F. I don't know if I'd actually try this in 0 degree weather but, it's a really warm bag, it's cheap, and it's held up to a total of 10 months of straight use every night so, I have absolutely no complaints. The only complaint I would have is the footbox isn't as insulated as I would probably like it to be.",
