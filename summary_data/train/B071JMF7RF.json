Was a longtime Brooks runner, then switched to Saucony because I liked their combination of light weight / support. Will try something else now.",

The Mizuno's have a slightly harder sole, but they are an extremely well built and comfortable shoe, plus the slightly wider toe box is an advantage.",

I'd read some complaints about the construction of these shoes but my first pair held up quite well. Aside from the cushion support breaking down (which is expected) I also wore out the inside of the heal area, but I think that has more to do with me not untying my shoes before slipping them off.
