      "text": "I wanted to love this, but just can't! I have a neck pillow I use everyday for my train commute and purchased this as a new one for my flight from the east coast to Hawaii. Unfortunately, this neck pillow is way too firm. It was so uncomfortable on the flight and virtually impossible to use with the plane seats. The quality of the pillow and cover is great, but it's just to big. I think if you could withstand the uncomfortableness until the memory foam squishes down, it would be a great pillow, but it just wasn't worth it. Wishing I didn't waste my money.",

The memory foam is so much more comfortable than the inflatable travel pillows and unlike the bead filled pillows, you don't have to worry about beads falling out if it gets a small hole.

It folds into the bag in seconds, and provides different levels of plumpness. STRONGLY recommend if you don't have a travel pillow or you have one that is bad, hurry up and get this one.
