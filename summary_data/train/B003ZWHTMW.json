I do use it as my local office printer, scanner and copier. It does a nice job of feeding, scanning and printing. Installation with Windows 7 was straightforward. Pros: good paper feeding, excellent print quality, many function options that work intuitively, very good value Cons: a bit bulky, there is some mechanical noise while moving paper, ships with a low-capacity toner cartridge If this unit demonstrates typical HP reliability, it will keep me happy until it becomes hopelessly obsolete (like me)!",

The refilled cartridges cost about $14, and one in four of those isn't any good, but they are so much cheaper than OEM that I just buy four at a time and it is still less than OEM and print quality is very good. I liked it so much, I recently purchased a second one and it was less than half the price of the original a couple years back. It will stick out from the shelf you put it on, but that doesn't bother me.",

This feature alone might be a contributing factor to the future of the world, including world peace and the cure for cancer. Only time will tell.",

I do not recommend it to anyone who needs scanned images at full physical size. There may be a work around, but if there is I completely resent it.

      "text": "We have installed many HP MFC devices. I was surprised to find that this unit does not provide the ability to select the destination from the M1536 control panel. If a user wants to scan to his computer they have to initiate the scan at their computer. This is a major deficiency and impacts productivity. Also we've had a lot of problems installing this on Vista OS with no help from HP support. Their response to our problem was to return the printer. I would not recommend this printer.",
