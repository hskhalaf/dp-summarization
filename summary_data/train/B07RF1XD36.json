The laptop uses the same body as the $500+ Acer Aspire 5 models which is to say it is a fantastic body that is light and compact and very portable. Ram can easily be upgraded and adding a 2.5\" SSD allows for additional memory over the 128gb included on the computer. The keyboard is comfortable to type on and as a bonus still includes a full numpad even if it is a bit cramped. The screen is a solid IPS screen and when you consider the price tag is amazing and beats a lot of the more expensive laptop screens I have seen.",

She is a very fast typer and very adept with technical things (when it has to do with a game of course). I got the extra 4GB of RAM as recommended, installed with ease, and it runs fast. Decent priced laptop with a beautiful FULL HD screen, everything checked out good on benchmarking especially graphics as this has its own dedicated chip for graphics, unlike the integrated 630's you see, which do not do much, as in there is no video editing etc, but with this one, shes all good!",

This laptop only lasted me 5 months before the screen went completely black and now it will not turn on. It started with the screen blackening in and out while I'm in the middle of working or browsing webs. Come to find out this one had bad sensors when you open and close the laptop. And since I'm well past the return date - I have to chalk this up as a loss. Horrible quality laptop that I will not buy again.",

I've adjusted the audio and volume settings, utilized the Windows Help and Support options (which are very unhelpful), updated the audio drivers, deleted and reinstalled the audio drivers, and nothing has worked. From reading online troubleshooting guides, this appears to be a somewhat common issue for users of this type of laptop. Will not purchase this brand again.",

What really impresses me is the ability to upgrade the RAM, the SSD, add another hard drive and even replace the battery. Construction is better than expected for this price range. I only wish I could have purchased it with 8GB of ram pre-installed and it had USB-C ports. I would have paid $50 more for those two options and not regretted it.",

No dedicated 'Pg Dn' & 'End' buttons. They are part of the number pad, and needs to switch mode w/ 'Num Lock'. I really miss the extra buttons when using Excel. 2. No SD card reader 3. The 128GB M2 drive is divided into 4 partitions. With Windows being in 3rd one. So cloning things to a larger drive is a bit more difficult.",
