I would have liked to have one that is vented to the outside but due to the kitchen design, it would have been expensive and would have resulted the project not being a do it yourself job. The installation was easy. Any experienced do-it-yourselfer should not have any issues with the installation. The shipping was super fast! As far as the performance, the fan does a great job of moving air and filtering it. It prevents the steam from escaping all over the kitchen and does a decent job of filtering out odors, however, not as well as a fan that is vented externally but that is to be expected.",

I did expect the fan to be more heavy-duty than it is, but it seems to keep cooking steam moving in the right direction. I expect this will cut down on grease buildup around and above the stove. Being a ductless model, the filter will filter out grease, protecting the fan, but will do nothing to remove cooking odors from the room. The light over the stove is fantastic. I used an LED bulb that uses less than 10W so I don't have to feel guilty about leaving it on as a night light.",

It's very sleek looking, and the stainless steel will be a breeze to keep clean!\" Included a picture of our old one for comparison. Pros: Stainless steel construction, low maintenance, high durability; all needed hardware included (except wire nuts); simple install. Cons: None. Conclusion: Recommend the low maintenance of the stainless version if that color will match your kitchen decor; your wife will thank you for the easy cleaning!",

Finally there is really NO smoke removing technology other than possibly the filter, but unless it's able to pull in the smoke I can't know how effective it would be. Hope this is helpful, I'm doubtful anyone can find a quality hood with good suction anywhere in this price range. But I can't just keep throwing good money after bad etc.. good luck.",

If you cook a lot of food on super high heat that smokes a lot, this may not be the hood for you. It really sucks nothing up. Sure it makes noise like it is, and there's even a nice filter, but trust me, it doesn't suck the smoke out. For normal everyday cooking it's fine though. If you have the option to vent outside, do it. But if not then this hood is just fine. Doesn't come with a light so make sure you have one handy.",

Fan is nice and the light works well. For the money this can't be topped.",
