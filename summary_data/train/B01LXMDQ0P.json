This was a great replacement. It's been tugged and pulled quite a bit and so far so good. It would be great fun for kids to have to play with in the backyard or playground too. It's not as heavy duty as those that PE teachers use but it's good quality and the price is great.",

It seems well built though. Folds easy. If any things goes wrong with it I'll come back and add those comments. If you have fewer kids I'd get a smaller size, but this should be good for 8-12 children, or 4 - 8 adults.",
