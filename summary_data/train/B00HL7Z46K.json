I guess you get what you pay for. This is a bad product. I should've read the other reviews claiming usb connection issues. I'm beyond my return window so if I can't return this product, I'm leaving an honest review. I hope someone out there reads this review and doesn't make the same mistake I did. DO NOT BUY!!!!",

After asking a question on Amazon, I was directed to call technical support, who told me that these aren't intended to charge. I really think that should be made more clear in the description. For anyone here for the same purpose I was, THESE DO NOT CHARGE AT ALL. I'll be returning them, as they don't do the one thing I bought them to do. However, on the positive side, they do light up and I'm sure they act well as hubs.",

      "text": "I have bought a number of powered usb ports, but I always had the problem of the computer giving me an error message stating that there is not enough power on the USB bus, which indicates that the \"powered\" USB hub was actually using power from the computer. This item has worked perfectly, with all the usb ports filled, no drain on the USB buss on the computer! In other words, it works like it is supposed to work. Note: there are two buttons to shut off either half of the USB ports. If the blue LED's are not all on, look for the buttons.",

A minor gripe of mine is that the power cable and data cable are on the same end, which makes the hub awkward to place on a desk as you have a cable coming from the back of the desk and a cable from the side of your computer going towards the same object, so you end up with a sort of Y-shape setup that is a bit cumbersome. No complaints otherwise, though.",
