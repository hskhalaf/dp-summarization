Once they are on, and it took a shoe horn and a lot of grunting, their okay, but now I have to wear them for an entire year without ever taking them off because I don't have the time to go through that ordeal every single time! It is my sincere hope that the designer(s) of this shoe are somewhere else with a different job.",

Partly my fault for not having a sweat sock on but I do not think its an issue of running small. With that said, I look good but I am crying on the inside.",

If there is anything negative to say it would be that they are somewhat difficult to put on which at first will make you think they're too small for you-they're not! It's just that the inner elastic liner needs to be opened up as you slide your foot in. This is part of what makes these shoes wear like they do and grip the ankles for superior support. The shoes are excellent for performing exercises which is all I bought them for-to exercise inside the house.",
