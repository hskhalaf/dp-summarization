I was thinking they would be something along the lines of a La Croix but no. The juice means they have a small amount of calories. I drink these to sort of satiate myself on a low calorie diet. The carbonation seems weak to me also. I need my senses assaulted by a blast of bubbles to boost my neurotransmitters that are all in meh-mode on a restricted diet. Sorry, these didn\u2019t do it for me. Someone else might like them, though. The grapefruit flavored one was the most enjoyable, I thought.",

Spindrift is the best healthy option with juice (and some sugar from the juice) , water, carbonation, and you could drink large amounts with no health problems. I just don't feel satisfied when I drink a Spindrift so will just drink tap water and eat fruit. The Amazon mixed pack is a good deal if you want to try it.",

The mixed raspberry flavors are kinda meh though and the flavors don't mix that well and tend to drown out the raspberry flavor. Would've preferred just a straight raspberry flavor.

To ME this product was horrible and I threw 1 case away. I kept the other to give some of the product to others to see if they would like it. 3 family members and 2 neighbors all agreed it was not good/very bad and rather than drink it they dumped it out.. sorry spindrift...",
