In order to reverse it you have to take the fan out of the window and flip it over or take it out and flip the control on the opposite face. It does have \"dual control\" but it is a control on each face of the fan. It feels well made and should last a while. On high you may need to turn the volume up on your tv or radio. It's not real noisy but just enough to interfere with hearing in a small room. Hope this helps.",

The only thing the electronic model has going for it is the fact that it is electrically reversible. This model you have to turn around manually.

I am really enjoying this exhaust fan.",

Purchased Apr 7th, noticed the fan issue April 20th the next year. I've had fans in the past that lasted me 5+ years each time. I would not buy this again. I can't believe I'm only getting a year out of a fan. The only upside is that it's more aesthetically pleasing than most fans.",
