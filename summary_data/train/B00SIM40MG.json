It's high quality too. I didn't want to get my son one of those cheap and cheap-looking backpacks, ya know?! We also have the matching insulated lunch bag, plate and bowl set, and fork and spoon set. The photo was taken 2 months before our son turned 3 (getting off the airplane.) He's 95th percentile height (40\") and weight (38 lbs) and wears 4T, so the pic should give you an idea of the backpack size. It should probably work for ages 2 through 6.",

Great quality with large zipper pulls so he can zip it himself. Holds its shape well, so it's easy for him to set it down and put things in it. Definitely a good buy. Glad I bought it.",

The only issue I have is that a regular sized folder, from her class, will not fit in the bag. Her teacher has to fold the folder in half. I\u2019m sure the dimensions are listed, and my fault for not paying attention, but we love the bag so much we don\u2019t care that the folder doesn\u2019t fit. The quality of the bag is great. The zippers are not flimsy, the seams of the bag seem well put together. I think it will last her the whole year.",

I use the one for my baby as a \u201cdiaper bag\u201d for short trips like to the store or a doctors appointment. Just a cute grab and go bag and it definitely can hold all the basics. I plan to give it to her when she is a toddler to play with. My only gripe is that I wish the bag was a plastic material so I could wipe it down easier. I can see the canvas type material holding onto stains.",

I throw it in the washing machine about once or twice a month and it comes out good as new. The only problem I have with the backpack is that many people think it is a rhino instead of a unicorn.",

I believe the zipper has a nice sized pull tab, which is also ideal for little hands.
