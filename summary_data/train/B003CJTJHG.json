I have previously owned 2 Dell all one in printers which worked for years without any problems. I have had this printer for less than one year, and the printheads have had to be replaced twice already. You can spend hours trying to troubleshoot and clean the printheads, and nothing works. There is a serious design flaw with these printheads. Other than that I found that everything works fine, although it is prone to printer jams.",

When I said I had this problem before and it's re-occurring, the rep said \"this product has had problem and recommended you buy another printer\". Wow!! I think we should do a class action lawsuit against Dell for a faulty printer. This printer is truly a \"LEMON\".",

We paid for Dell support to help us fix the problems, but after that they soon returned. It is constantly giving me messages about why it cannot print. My husband is a computer DBA and he is frustrated with it. We got so sick and tired of it that we are throwing it out, getting a printer from a different company, and I plan never to buy a Dell printer again.",

The wireless feature is always having problems, requiring me to carry my laptop over to the printer and reconnect the USB cable. Basically, I have to re-install the printer every couple of months. Also, it uses up ink like crazy . For regular print jobs, there is no \"quick print\" option, so you always have to use a lot of ink. Now, after less than a year of use, the printhead needs to be replaced, which goes for about $70. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRINTER!!",
