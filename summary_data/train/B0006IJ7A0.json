      "text": "My Aunt gave me a sample of this makeup remover & it is by far the best I've ever used. One swish on a cotton ball takes off my waterproof mascara & liquid eye liner. My eyes used to get rubbed pink with other make up removers. I had to rub & rub to get my mascara off. I usually purchase moderately priced toiletries but this to me is worth the splurge. My husband pointed out if I use less of it & it does a better job then I'm not really paying much more for it than a bargain remover I have to use 9 drops of. I will continue to use this remover, I just love it.",

Not too oily or watery, it doesn't leave a residue on the skin, but seems to hydrate and moisturize the skin around the eyes nicely. I haven't used it on my lips yet. I'll definitely buy this product again.",
