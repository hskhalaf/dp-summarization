      "text": "I love this cacao powder. It's organic, it has a very fine powdered texture and has a really nice cacao flavor to it. I freeze banana chunks on a cookie sheet in the freezer and put them in my NutriBullet with some cacao powder and a handful of cacao nibs. I use almond milk as the liquid and I blend with a drizzle of raw honey until I have banana chocolate ice cream. I crush raw walnuts on top and enjoy. My husband loves this as well. So nutritious!

On top of that, every time someone asks which cancer causing chemicals this product contains here in the Amazon Q&A, some dude just directs them to the website. In addition to the whole little cancer issue, honestly this cacao just made my smoothie taste gross. I definitely don't recommend it.",

It tastes better to me than the usual overly sugary cocoas that often also have artificial sweeteners in them. I also add it to yogurt and put raisins in for sweetness. Adding sunflower seeds somehow fools my taste buds into thinking there are chocolate chips! So, good for the health benefits as well as cutting down on sugar and calories. Some say you should not heat it, so I wait till the hot water cools down a bit before pouring. Don't know if that helps.",

Very economical too compared to buying small containers--I plan to put it on auto shipment. Very happy with this product and highly recommend it.",

Make sure you have a large bag clip on hand because it will be the only way to reseal it. Otherwise, I love the taste and texture of this cacao powder much more than Hershey's brand.",
