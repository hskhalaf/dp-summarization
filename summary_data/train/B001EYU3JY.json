What I stumbled on was a high quality piece of audio gear that gives my $100+ Klipsch ear buds a run for their money and depending on how you like to listen to music arguably outperform my fancy noise cancelling Bose. I have been burned in the past by relying on the Sony brand for low end products, but this time I picked a real winner.",

Based on the reviews of others, I would have to say your mileage could vary, but clearly most people have good luck with them. I just ordered another Sony MDREC36V/BLU replacement for the failed unit.",

I love these earphones and I abuse them (throw them in the bottom of my purse or gym bag)... so it's really surprising to me that they lasted that long. A few weeks ago, the left earbud stopped working, so I bought this pair to replace them. Sound quality is decent for the price, but I am not picky about that. I also like that they come with 3 different size ear pieces because I have small ears and the Apple earbuds that came with my iPhone hurt my ears.",

They're okay to listen to for short periods, but due to the brittle high end, listener fatigue sets in. Bass response seems adequate. Can't really judge the quality of the mids ... they're overpowered by the highs. Decent value for under $20.",

But I would know if they sounded crappy and they don't. I like these b/c they have in-line volume control. Much more convenient than trying to locate those controls on my phone. The main reason I buy these is because the jack coming out of the device is at a right angle. The one downside is the rubber at the jack end does crack and split eventually. But only after a few years of consistent use so it doesn't keep me from buying them.",
