When they first arrive they do need washed since they seem to come with a paper dust all over them. The colors of the rocks are very nice, having a natural look but still plenty of variety in the shades. I bought one bag for my 20 gallon aquarium and it works, but I'm picking up a second one since the first bag only covered a portion of the bottom of the tank. The rocks are all completely smooth too so your turtle can't injure themselves somehow on them. They work great!",

Soak and disinfect pebbles by placing them in a large bucket of water for 15 minutes. Rinse until all of the visible particles are removed and the water runs clean. Comes in pack of 2.
