Light, small footprint. Software downloaded fron web, not supplied with machine. No USB connector supplied. After a couple of weeks of use, all the above holds but I still can't get over the speed. Reduced time spent on this very boring task dramatically.",

No cable with a 3 pin plug and instructions in every language but English. I could try and fathom it out but I really do not have the time and not very IT savvy. As this was for a small office I am still waiting for an invoice and my team waiting to get scanning. I have managed to down load a 200 page user guide in English so when I loose the will to live I'll read it. Until then I cannot give a true star rating",

User instructions are not that great so it's helpful to have some basic knowledge of networking. Thats said the Brother Help Desk is good and with Webchat they can sort things out. The unit is compact and easily stored in a drawer. It's certainly fast and hasn't thus far jammed. Quality is excellent and by experimenting with different outputs I've found a happy compromise or speed and reproduction. For home use it's brilliant and I wish I'd bought it before forking out \u00a340.",
