      "text": "I've had this trampoline for a little over a month and already 2 springs have broken off. Bought this for my kids one is 65lbs and the other is 80lbs. They use it one at a time and still the springs are breaking off as its being jumped on. They use it for 5-10 minutes at a time and only really when its raining outside and they can't go out and play. DO NOT BUY IT'S NOT WORTH IT. What a waste of money I will not EVER purchase this brand again.",

In the instructions it says not to tighten too tight. Anyway, we are really happy with the tramp. We really like the size...can't imagine it much smaller.",

It is sturdy, well constructed, and I appreciate how the springs are very well covered with what looks like a sturdy vinyl.Overall it looks like it will last a long time even with a lot of use. Time will tell, however. I plan to order a second one for my other set of grandchildren for the holidays, I like it that much.",

My little one loves to jump on it too, so it can wear her out and help me lose weight when the weather is crappy outside.",
