When I take it within 5 minutes..I am so relaxed I don\u2019t have a care in the world. Which is nice when you live with chronic pain and anxiety. Other CBD oil products even medical grade ones I\u2019ve tried don\u2019t do that, and this one does! It\u2019s also very affordable! Make sure you shake it before each use.
