The game has an in-game cash shop and you best believe the game is going to target your pockets. The developers will also remove any comments you make in the forums about the game if those comments don't praise the game. Do yourself a favor and save your money on this one. Guildwars 1 was horrible and that alone proved the company behind this series is not creative so what do they do, copy from other MMORPGs and create Guildwars 2. Phft!!!!",

Every once in a while, the program fails to recognize the IP address of our computer, and the game locks. The only way to unlock the game is by responding to an email. When there was a program update, it took a full month of back and forth with Guildwars support to get the game unlocked so the kids could return to playing their scenes. Overall, a great game, but the paranoia of the publishers makes it a bit of a chore to keep it running.",

The personal story makes it seem like your character is really a person in this world. The creativity in the quests is great; they're not all (or even mostly) \"go kill X number of Ys\" quests so everything is a fresh experience. I would totally recommend this game especially as it's just a $60 one-time cost.",

I tried using my old account password and didn't work as well. They recognized my old character names, but I can't enter. I can still use them to play GW 1, however. Their customer support on both their phone and their facebook site is lousy-they don't reply at all to your questions. I'm done with this company, good riddance. Good thing I bought it under $25, so, I can swallow this loss better if I had say bought it at its highest price.",

The production quality is very good, but the game isn't very intuitive. In other MMOs the learning curve comes naturally, you can virtually learn the gameplay by intuition, but not so much in GW2, it can be a little bit complicated to learn the gameplay at times. But hey, Great game!",
