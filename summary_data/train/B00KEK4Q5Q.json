The \"product model\" field is not accessible in the registration webpage and i kept getting a run around from different departments each claiming the other being responsible for product registrations. As such to date my product is unregistered.",

A reboot every 2 weeks on average, will keep this thing running \"smoothly\". Sometimes, the wireless printer is dropped from the network. Other times, it won't issue DHCP addresses to devices, even though there are available addresses to hand out. The decision to \"upgrade\" from an old Airport Extreme to the WRT1900AC was a very bad mistake, followed closely by not returning this pile of hot garbage during its return window.",

Setup is very easy through the app or on a laptop. 4 stars because of some app inconsistencies (password fields, etc). However, once it's set up, it just chugs along, quietly doing its job. Dual band is nice, gives older devices a chance to connect as well as new devices.",

One interesting thing to note, this is the first router that I've had which includes a small fan in it. I suspect that heat has played into the failures of my previous routers (though I keep my router in a well ventilated room), so I am happy to see that this one seems to be designed to stay cool.",

Even the hard wired Ethernet connections will not get you out to the WWW until you go through the initial setup. Not a big deal, but could cause worry if you are unaware of this. Do yourself a favor and be sure to set the 2.4GHz to a channel that doesn't have a lot of use near your home as this can cause issues that are not the fault of the router",

Aside from all that, 4 stars because at only about 50 dollars more the ACS also has nearly twice the resources.",
