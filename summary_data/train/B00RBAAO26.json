Repeat buyers considered such added feature a plus factor in achieving all-day ultimate foot comfort. Its well-made leather cover tends to be stiff right off the box, but it becomes pliable through constant use. With its budget-friendly cost, some didn\u2019t have second thoughts in buying one or more pairs.",

Instead of making it shorter, so that you can bend your foot up with comfort, they didn't.
