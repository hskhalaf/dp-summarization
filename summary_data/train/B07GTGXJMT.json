Unfortunately the insulated carafe leaks with every pour. It doesn't leak from the spout but rather from the edge where the metal meets the black plastic. It's not a deal breaker but it is a pain to have to clean up after every pour. I would recommend getting the basic model with the glass carafe.",

I was surprised it is still available and must be a testament to how well it works and how many people love it.",

We tried it for 2 months, paid the restocking fee to return it, and will go to a local retailer. We had the option of paying to ship it back to Cuisinart to get a replacement, but saw too many reviews saying the same thing we experienced.",
