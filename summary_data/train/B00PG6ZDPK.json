It still looks fine on the outside and might serve as a collectable model for some but it can't function as in-game content as it was intended to be used. If you drill a hole in the bottom of an amiibo, it can't still be used as an amiibo. Buyer beware.",

      "text": "Arrived in great shape. I bought it for use with Hyrule Warriors and Smash 4. The Amount did not come with the clear support, rather it came with the yellow support as shown in the pictures. The yellow support does not detract from the overall quality. Also, the sword was not bent or anything like that. Overall, the product met my expectations and I am satisfied with the purchase.",

It wouldn't let me do either, and just kept telling me it was corrupted, making this amiibo absolutely useless for the game. Not cool.",
