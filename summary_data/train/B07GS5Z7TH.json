The handheld pink one is nice, especially for me since I have no feeling in my hands so I\u2019ll drop things quite often. Because you can slide your whole hand into the top of the pink one it makes it quite easy to hold onto. I feel like it gives me a massage and exfoliation because it is quite hard but not sharp.",
