      "text": "Pros: Excellent for the price. Sounds great right trough the speakers. Lots of different sounds to choose from. Also worked perfectly with Garage Band -- the sounds were matched up perfectly with each pad without any assigning of notes, etc. Con: If you're careful you can usually avoid it, but you will probably get accidental double kicks with the included pedals. This doesn't really interfere with your playing, and this can be upgraded later if you choose to. I've played drums at church for a couple years but never had anything of my own to practice on. This is a great solution if you don't have a lot of money to invest in getting a full kit.",

It works great with headphones, sounds great without. He hasn't used any of the midi interface capabilities yet, but it looks really promising.",
