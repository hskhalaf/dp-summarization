My cat is having a lot of fun of chasing the laser point, and I could just watch him play while I'm laying on my coach. It can take your cat's extra energy without scratch my other stuff. On the other hand, the battery seems lasting longer than I expected. I have bought this for two weeks and use it 30-40 minutes everyday and I haven't exchanged the battery yet. Highly recommend this toy for all my friends with cat.",

I also received a credit on my Amazon account. I appreciate the prompt refund and replacement. Gave it a one because zero doesn\u2019t show. Too expensive for a few uses. Laser light went out. Rotation etc continues working but ne light. Wish we could purchase additional lasers to fit. I have other lasers that work for years. This one lasted a wee. Very disappointed.",

Stays on for 15 minutes then turns off so you will have to hit the button again if your cat wants more. Not sure how long batteries will last...there's a little motor that rotates the laser, and the laser itself. Overall happy with purchase, and the cat says thank you. Well, he says \"meow.\"",

With the top off you essentially have a laser pointer and we just by hand move it around and the cats enjoy it. Personally, for my cats I wish I had just purchased a hand laser for half the price.",

      "text": "I have it 4 stars bc it's a neat idea. I'm just 2 weeks postpartum and wanted something that would keep my dog busy as she loves lasers. The laser could be darker/stronger. I feel it could have a faster speed. I'd like if it was more unpredictable. Maybe cats can't figure it out, but my dog figured it out quick. My dog still rather I use a hand laser pointer thing we have, but will for brief moments (less than the timer) be okay with this interactive cat laser toy.",
