Much bigger and game play quality is amazing. Wish though they added some more features which I believe they are doing in further expansion packs.",

Then there are the numerous Playstation 4 bugs that cause the application to quit (and you loose your progress). Finally, the graphics are so slow in some places you feel like you are playing in slow motions. Any amount of joy you get with this game is short-lived. I'd suggest waiting a year or two and pick this up on a sale or in the bargain bin. Simply not worth even the sale price of this game.",
