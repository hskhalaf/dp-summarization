I'd suggest listening the first few times you make it, that way you don't burn it. Also, then you can figure out the exact time that works best for your microwave oven.

The flat lid doesn't create the same condensation phenomenon. So I ordered the smaller flat lid after using this one for about a month.",

Just wipe the insides of the bowl and the lid and it's ready for the next use. Package directions caution against the dishwasher because it \"could discolor the product.\" I've used the dishwasher with good results. Let your microwave decide how hot and how long to cook your popcorn. The popcorn setting on my microwave is too hot for too long. It does an almost complete job (only 4-8 unpopped kernels!) for me at a manual setting of 3 minutes at cook power 8. Good gadget.",

It takes a little trial and error to figure out your exact popping time, so you definitely need to listen near the microwave the first few times. Also each brand of popcorn seems to pop slightly differently. We like keeping our unpopped kernels zip locked in the freezer to keep it nice and consistent and to keep the freshness. Just scoop 1/3 cup of kernels into the popper and put in the microwave. Really enjoying the healthier alternative to snaking on chips.",

I have a 1500 watt machine and the native popcorn setting works fine -- just follow the directions. I even add the tablespoon (or a little more) of olive oil and the bowl works perfectly. I can see why you may want to play with the settings, as putting less than one-third may result in burned popcorn or more may result in too many unpopped kernals but this should be fairly easy to adjust. Great product!!",

The Nordic Ware popper has performed very well, producing excellent popcorn at a far lower cost and much less trash. I would never have guessed a simple device like this would work this well, but it does. My microwave's sensor doesn't work properly with this popper, so I have to stay close and listen to the popping to cease, but that's not much hassle. And the popper did develop a couple hairline cracks (not sure how, but maybe the dishwasher?), but they don't affect popping performance or cause any additional mess (i.e. no oil or steam leaks out). Otherwise, it's been a perfect popper.",

I can (optional) put flavored oil and salt on before microwaving. I put it in the dishwasher several times and used it for other things as well. No problems at all.

    "title": "Nordic Ware Microwave Popcorn Popper, White, 12 Cup",
    "description": "Style Name:12 Cup| Color:WhiteNordic Ware Microwave Popcorn Popper, 12-Cup, White\n\nAMAZON.COM\nMade of gemstone, an unbreakable, chip-proof cookware material, the Nordic Ware corn popper efficiently transmits microwave energy directly to the popcorn kernels, popping them quickly without oil. It produces the results of a hot-air popper without an additional appliance. This oil-free method is refreshing when compared to bagged corn, because you don't have to contend with grease, salt, and artificial flavoring unless you dress the corn yourself after cooking. However, take care to monitor the progress of corn during the first use. The manufacturer lists a three-to-five-minute cook time for 1/2 cup of unpopped kernels, but as microwave ovens vary, it could take considerably less time to pop. And overcooked corn burns fast using this method. Luckily, the base and lid are designed not to warp or melt, so burned kernels won't damage them. Use this versatile popper for cooking, storing, and serving popcorn and other snacks. The popper base is also ovenproof. --Carol Gnojewski",
