Hopefully her products reduce in price now that she is a racist lol I\u2019d enjoy that. Also if you are worried about fake products, which you should be since they are very rampant...normally I would say buy direct from her website, however I took a shot and purchased this spray on amazon instead and the box came sealed, identical to the other products I\u2019ve ordered from kvd beauty. It\u2019s real, but DO NOT Buy her setting powder From amazon its TOTALLY FAKE.",

      "text": "I didn't even know or ever heard of setting spray until I watched this new Reality TV show called Glam Masters. I saw this being used and thought it was a wonderful idea. After doing research, I bought this product because I use Kat Von D's Powder Foundation and although very expensive, I found heaven when I used it, I trusted the brand. This setting spray was incredible!! I didn't trust it at first because it's counter-intuitive to spray a liquid in a dry, powdered face, but it really WORKS!! I didn't get oily the whole night. It's a definite GO for me!!",

I have very dry skin and this product works so well that I bought a second bottle!!",
