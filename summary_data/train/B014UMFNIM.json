This scope has almost no magnification at all, and has such a small exit pupil that moving it just a gnat's hair off center causes the view to black out. There's a reason there are no hard specifications on this product. I returned the Roxant and ponied up the extra $30 for a Polaris Optics Titan 12x50, and I'm extremely happy with that. It has 12x magnification, and a big enough front lens that the view is bright without blacking out when you move it slightly.",

I am just now packing it up and sending it back. Given what many other reviewers have reported, I should have just passed on this scope. On the positive side, though, it looks nice, has great hand-feel and a really nice eyepiece. Just no magnification that I can discern. What a shame.",

I\u2019m interested in attempting some cell phone photography through the lens as well. While I haven\u2019t had the opportunity to test the scope out while fishing I took it on a short hike around the neighborhood and I am very happy with what I have seen so far. The scope was delivered swiftly as promised. The quality to price ratio is, in my opinion, enormous- I look forward to bringing my new companion on many future adventures!",

He always used these large old binoculars he kept on the quad bike. He complained how heavy they were and how cumbersome it was to get them out or keep them around his neck. So I gave him this gift.

To me the most impressive feature is the optical quality. There is no perceptible distortion and the distant image is quite clear. The outer case of the scope appears rugged and would offer protection from drops. The only criticism that I would offer is that the focus ring is stiff.

      "text": "I bought both the hand grip and mini. Both are excellent. Used the large for watching the sidelines during football game. Surprisingly excellent optics for the price and size. Smaller one I've used less but it goes everywhere with me in the vehicle as it is tiny. Works well. Will use for inspecting buildings and construction sites from the street. And of course bird and wildlife. Grip scope is at home near window where we watch birds. Smaller scope works great. As a gift the small scope is a no brainer and I'll stuff a few stockings with them. The larger scope is a nice gift for the enthusiast more likely. Price on both is excellent .",

The scope is equipped with a no slip comfort molded grip which provides less shake so it\u2019s very easy to hold steady with one hand. Our premium construction features high definition optical glass with premium fully multi coated All glass lens which guarantees superior light transmission and brightness for optimal bright, crisp, clear viewing. Understanding optics 101: most newbies figure more powerful is better. When it comes to handheld scopes, more powerful is not better. Why? The larger the magnification, The more shake and jitter you will have. So an ideal size for a small, handheld scope would be a 6x. Fact: although a magnification of 10, 12 or higher is available, 6x power scopes are easier to use and in most cases more practical. Without a tripod or telescope stand 6x will give you the best optical experience. This scope also adds 6 x30 wide view lens so you\u2019ll be able to experience the whole panorama in crystal clear beauty. Unlike most scopes this size, ours features a retractable eyecup for use with or without eyeglasses. Accessories include a carry pouch with belt loop + cleaning cloth and neck strap. Ideal for: travel, concerts, outdoor activities, nature, bird watching, hunting, archery, target shooting, hiking, camping etc. Makes a great stocking stuffer!",
