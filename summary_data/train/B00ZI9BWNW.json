But I bought this to study at my college library, and it was great. Low speed didn't blow any papers away, was refreshing, and the noise didn't distract me. Unsure how it works on places like Las Vegas or Texas where it gets scorching, but it's been great here in California. Now I'm thinking of buying some for my family in Brazil. Unsure how long the battery last. I'll update this post in a couple months or so.",

It also has substantial air movement for its size. The fan looks as if it would be top heavy and easily knocked over - it is not. It's quite sturdy, and has a small footprint. The only downside to this great little fan is tat is not as quiet as I'd like. I use a quieter fan for sleeping.",

Plus if you you need moving air this will get the job done. Also will run while plugged in charging. Use it next to chair in my great room if needed when AC is not running and I just need a little air flow. Also use in bathroom while putting on makeup.",

      "text": "I bought 3 of these fans for my kids. They brought these with them to their outdoor summer camp and everyone there wished that they had one of these. The charge seems to last all day. Very easy to refill and it keeps them cool. It's light weight so not hard for kids to carry. The mist is great. It's a must have for a very hot day.",
