      "text": "This spray smells great. I have curly/wavy, thin, long hair. I was really hoping this would be the spray on, walk away, go out product I've been searching for. It's really not. It smells great, and is definitely nice & light, but I still need to use a curling iron to get the beach waves look I desire. It's okay for a day I really don't have a chance to do anything with my hair, but won't be used as a daily product.",
