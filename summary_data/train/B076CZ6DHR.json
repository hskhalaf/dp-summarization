The setup allows you to setup what type of grass, soil, flowers, sprinkler heads, zone size and more to ensure the right amount of water. Tech support is very good and responsive. The unit requires a WiFi connection and being in the garage it sometimes can not connect and that is my only issue.",

March 1st will tell if it is set up correct as we go to 3 times a week for spring. Will report back on it then. Update, still happy with this controler.

Just follow directions, take photos of your wiring and follow on screen setup. The best feature I like is how it links with the local weather to not over feed your lawn and does not require rain sensor. This smart controller is worth every cent you send. I highly recommend this product. UPDATE: 5/12/2019 - after using for the first entire season, this is still by far a 5 Star review. Couldn't ask for a good price and quality product with simplistic program features, hands down worth the purchase. Enjoy!",
