The first three times the eggs were solid/overcooked. The fourth time the eggs were completely liquid. I could\u2019ve tried additional times at 50% power and increased the cook time, but I was done. I watched a Utube video on poaching eggs without any special device and was able to do so. I wish I had done that first. This was not very expensive, but still a waste of money for me. And now I have 16 eggs as cooked as a hard-boiled egg, to eat.",

Easy to clean also - hot soapy water and it's clean in seconds. Right now I consider this a perfect purchase and the price was fantastic!

There is a learning curve but once you know the time and yolk consistency in your own microwave they turn out great every time. Super easy to clean. it's not non-stick but very little of the egg gets stuck in the cups after cooking. Super happy with my purchase.",

Adjust cooking times by +/- 10 seconds per 100 watts ie. use 1:40 (at 80 POWER) for a 1,200 watt microwave. Make sure the poacher is in the center and follow the instructions - 1/2 tsp of water under and over each egg (1 tsp total). If you forget to use 80 power, your egg will be hard. I hope this helps...",

I did it without adding a little milk and then with adding just a touch of milk. The cook time increases if you add even a little milk. However, both versions were fine. It makes an easy no mess omelette. I added sausage and cheese after the first cook cycle (1.5 minutes) and then when it was folded over, all the stuff stayed in although it wasn't a 'sealed' omelette. It presents well and is quick. Buy it. Just do it.",
