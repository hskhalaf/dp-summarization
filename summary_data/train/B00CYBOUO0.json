      "text": "I never knew I could love headphones this much. I had a previous bias agains on-ear headphones but these aren't your average set. The cushions feel like I'm wearing pillows and the sound is crisp. The ear pieces actually form to your ears so as to isolate noise. I particularly like the bass that they can deliver. I recommend listening to any song off of 'Run the Jewels 2' to see what these guys can do. They came at a high price point but they're worth every penny.",

      "text": "I had been using Bowers & Wilkins P5 for years, and it's a good solid headphone. But until I listen with KEF M500, I found the what I heard in the past with Bowers & Wilkins P5, is not good quality of sound. The Bowers & Wilkins P5, the mid tone and treble are not clear and even fuzzy. But on the KEF M500 you can hear the details of the music, and the depth of the space. Buy the KEF M500, you will not be sorry to your ears.",

      "text": "Perhaps some of us just have fat heads :-) But the pressure builds up after about an hour and these beautiful headphones start hurting the ears... geeez--- I mean really uncomfortable... and I find myself moving them forward trying to relieve the pressure. If I make them larger, the pressure somewhat dissipates but they'll slip about. I also own the KEF M200 earbuds and while I really like the sounds from both KEF products, the M200s also have well-documented \"fit\" issues. So, KEF needs to address these issues and perhaps offer optional ear cushions for both products -- which would greatly enhance a pair of outstanding products.",

The office can be noisy sometimes but these headphones are excellent for sound isolation, which helps me to concentrate. They are well built, light and comfortable to wear. I don't have any other headphones to compare them against, but the sound is excellent. I have no regrets about buying them.",

Every worth of penny. You should have a good hi-fi dac to use full power of m500. Sound stage is centered properly and above all, bass is awesome, tight and deep, clear. I seldom write reviews but I like to share how great this is. I had chance compare this with momentum and Marshall monitor,m500 is the most comfortable, balanced, neutral and clear bass. What can I say, just buy it.",
