I've had to use my regular soap to do the job, and then use the L'Occitan face wash.",

This works great is the slightly more humid weather during Monsoon Season, as well as the dryer season the remainder of the year. It's gentle, yet very effective - including removing eye makeup. It's pretty much everything you could want in a cleanser -- and refillable! Love that. Would easily recommend this cleanser -- it's a winner.",
