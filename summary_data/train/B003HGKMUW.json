It also developed a big bubble in the middle from time to time, like a large hump. This bed is totally flat on top, and stays that way, due to the layer of support inside. It's thick, solid, and beautiful. Best waterbed experience I've ever had.",

I can\u2019t say anything about durability as we\u2019ve only had the mattress a few months. So far, this is our favorite mattress.",
