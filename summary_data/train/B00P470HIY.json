My second week I snapped the front brake when I was trying to put the bike together again because the wire always gets caught in the handle. It\u2019s also super clunky when putting it together or taking it apart compared to other foldable bikes. I personally have not had a good experience and would not recommend this bike.",

Pretty worthless and was a lot of inconvenience so I strongly recommend against buying this, especially since another reviewer had exactly the same two issues and so this is not an isolated occurrence.

My husband fixed the sprocket, so the bike is ridable. This was easier than sending it back. The box it came in was not broken, so I do not know when it became damaged. I probably would have given a better review if it arrived in good condition.",
