It zips them around quickly and they have a blast. Much safer than the two wheeled scooters and way more fun to play with I think. Definitely glad we bought these",

Very disappointed that we only got 7 months of use out of it. Thought I would contact Razor, but the warranty is ONLY 90 DAYS. I thought for sure it would be 12 months, but only 90 Days is very disappointing for a major manufacturer like Razor.",
