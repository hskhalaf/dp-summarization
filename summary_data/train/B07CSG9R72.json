I cannot get this drone to function correctly at all. Tried in many places to get GPS signal but always says weak signal. When you finally get it to work it is very unstable and is all over the place, even indoors with absolutely no breeze. Only way for this to work is is no GPS mode and that is unstable too. Very disappointing as this looked like a good drone and was excited to fly it and never got the chance.",

After waiting for the weather to get in an optimum state for testing, I tried flying the drone again.. The drone , after configuring the compass and GPS sensors, part of the wacky setup process, flew very well. The drone started up (hooray!), then immediately spun into a very controlled hover. Very nice to see that sellers still appreciate their customers.",

It slammed into my window quickly, but fortunately the glass was not broken. Playing outdoors, you can play easily. It can be easily connected to my iphone.

Some notes first the flight time states 10 minutes but once you start recording you cut that time in half. Second thing is due to the extremely light weight you have to be careful in the wind, I was flying about 50 meters up and the wind took it away but once it went out of range the auto return home kicked in and it landed inches from takeoff. I would definatley recommend this drone for beginners. The picture quality is very good as well.",

The drone itself is great, its lightweight and all the features from the auto takeoff and hover, to the return home to land, all work as they should. The only issue I've had, is the drone being so light, that any wind at all makes the video and photos shaky, so to get good quality photos and video you need to fly this drone in absolutely no wind, which is a very rare occurance, especially where I live. Overall for the price, it is a good drone with a decent amount of features for the price point.",

The drone was easy for him to use, the video quality is great, and if there\u2019s a light breeze it fights pretty well. Within the first week (learning period) he put the thing in a tree, smacked it into a wall, and on several occasions lost it when the battery died. That\u2019s pretty normal but the bad part is that because the propellers don\u2019t have covers or guards around them he\u2019d break at least one each time.

This one was easy to operate from the get-go! I really like how it takes off automatically, and just as easily returns to home and lands safely. Pairing with a smart phone is nice for controls and sharing pictures/video. It takes decent pictures. The battery life is a bit short, though. Not fully 8 minutes as advertised.

I've flown a number of large and small drones and this has been one of the better ones as long as the directions are followed. I madly went through the directions and failed. When I actually read word for word it was paradise. My 11 year old daughter took control and didn't total it like she did with one of my minis. We are having a bunch of fun and taking quality photos, that also took some getting used too. I told my brother we need a few of these guys for hunting and fishing and having fun!!!",

I haven't tried the follow me feature yet. The camera quality isn't professional quality but is much better than the cheaper drone I have. All in all, I would recommend this drone for someone looking for a toy-grade craft thatperforms as advertised. Also, it handles wind better than the cheapercraft but 10 mph or higher winds would make handling difficult.",
