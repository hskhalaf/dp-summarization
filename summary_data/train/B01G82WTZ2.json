Other Notes: - Mine needed a shim (included, easy to install) to get to espresso-level grinds, so don't be afraid to add the shim if you aren't getting the results you're expecting. With the shim the grind quality is fantastic.",

I was skeptical about spending the money, but it was well worth it. I notice the weight is not dead on every time, but the intelligent scale does seem to realize it missed and adjusts its expectations. Usually only noticeably off when I change coarseness or change beans. There are cheaper iterations that don\u2019t have the weight feature, but I found it was worth including to reduce my startup time - instead of single dosing and weight after time, I can get right to tamping.",
