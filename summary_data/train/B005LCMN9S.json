I usually have a size 37 for street shoes, but irregular long toes so I go for 37,5 just to be sure, but it's still too small for me (yeh I suppose climbing shoes should be tighter than usual but not the kind of tight that hurts and prevents you from climbing). So if you like them do make a safe bet by ordering 1 size up. I have to return the shoes though since they are too small for me.",

I really enjoyed how they hugged my foot and the way the soles felt, just need for my toes not to be cramped.",

The only complain I have is that the rubber isn't very sticky, hopefully it gets better after a few wears.",
