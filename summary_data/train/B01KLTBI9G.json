It is supportive and these are very well made. They are easy to slip on and off. The pink color is just like the picture-not too bright. I used Amazon's sizing suggestion and it was spot on. I wear a 9.5 in Nike and I ordered a 10 in these and fit perfectly. I wear these as everyday shoes. Even though these are golf shoes the bottoms are not too \"spikey\" to wear everyday. I would recommend for sure.",
