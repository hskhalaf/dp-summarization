But the build itself was one if the worse experiences I've ever had building a kid's toy in my life. Took hours, the instructions literally have no writing, just small, poor black & white photos. They expect you to get the screw driver into small areas, where you have literally no leverage to drive the screws through un-pre-drilled plastic. It was torture, I'd rather have three vasectomies than build this ever again. The manufacturer is sadistic. -3 Stars.",

Some holes that were needed were also missing. About halfway into forcing pieces together, I thought about the price and decided it definitely wasn\u2019t worth it! I repackaged it and sent it back!

The piece where the grill top is supposed to go on is not only too low but it's also too long so the grill top doesn't fit. It took a little while to put together so I didn't want to order a new grill section and risk the same result. My husband plans to cut into the mold to make the grill top fit. I also did make sure the table top for the grill was pushed all the way down and was evenly placed.",

My children are gaining memorization, organizing and management skills just by taking orders, cooking and cleaning up their kitchen which is so awesome! We've also had a playdate with a couple of other kids and the children were in that kitchen for hours. I am extremely happy with this purchase and will recommend it to parents who have small children that want to just get into doing grown up things.",
