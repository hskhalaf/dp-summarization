It's designed to have each \"bubble\" hold a single, small flower. You can't put six gerbera daisies in this (they're too large/heavy), but you could put six wild daisies or six black-eyed susans. I got this for my mom on Mother's Day and she keeps it on the windowsill in her kitchen with cut wildflowers from her garden. It is glass, not plastic, and fairly thin so you'll have to be gentile with it. Mine arrived poorly packed in just a padded envelope but surprisingly it was undamaged.",

Service of seller was outstanding, and they proactively reached out to me via email to ensure I was happy with purchase, and confirm it arrived in the mail in one piece. 5 stars.",

The Caterpillar bud vase has been universally loved for it\u2019s ability to make stunning arrangements for weddings, dinner tables, night stands, or even the windowsill, with just a few simple blooms.\n\nOne of the best things about small vases for flowers is that you can sneak them into any nook or cranny that needs a pop of color to liven it up.\n\nFor wedding and events, line up a row of Caterpillars end to end down the center of the table to create an illusion of droplets of water sprinkled down the table.\n\nThe Caterpillar bud vase is a connected row of glass bubbles, each with a small hole (approximately half an inch)\n\nThe Caterpillar bud vase is 10.25\" long, 1\" wide, 1.5\" tall. \n\nFlowers We Love in this Vase: Baby Cymbidium Orchids, Ranunculous, Craspedia, Sweetpea, Kermit Mum, Waxwing, Hydrangea, Dandelions, Bouvardia, Spray Rose",
