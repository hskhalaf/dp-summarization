I think it a great solution for people like me who want to get into kettlebells inexpensively by using their old plates and even dumbells inside. The strong, 19\" long waterproof bag and attached webbing loops could probably support twice the 10 kg it's rated for. I knock off two points for coming installed with delicate plastic attachments from there, that resemble what you'd find on cheap luggage. A ring and the handle snap broke on me very soon after I got it. The attachments to the webbing should be metal rings. There should be more substantial handles than the straps provided.",

Rather than using water or sand I put some of my 10 and 5 LB weight plates into the bag and it fit perfectly. The only complaint that I have is the handle is not super stiff like you would find on actual kettlebells, which seems obvious, but it is not quite as comfortable to hold as actual kettlebells. The pros of the adjust-ability of bag far outweigh the negatives. I would buy again in a heartbeat.",

    "description": "Introducing Drybell: the world's first heavy duty drybag built specifically for use as a dumbell. \n\n\n\nNOW YOU CAN LIFT WEIGHTS WHEREVER YOU ARE! Wouldn't it be awesome if every hotel, campsite or hostel you stayed at while away from home had a weights room, if you're like us it never does: biceps curls with a tin of beans in one hand and a milk carton in the other just don't cut it - so we created DryBell! \n\nWe've been using drybags to work out with while travelling for years, however there's a few issues: \n\nWith normal drybags you can't tell how much water or sand is in each bag so if you're working with two bags or on different days, you usually have uneven weight. The DryBell's internal graduations tell you exactly how much weight you're lifting. \n\nCheaply made dry bags aren't up to the job - they're simply not designed to lift weight; we've used the toughest materials available meaning these bad boys won't come apart. \n\nWith other drybags, the catch can accidentally come undone (resulting in a wet floor and shoes!) and they are often uncomfortable on the hands. Drybells come with a removable SoftGrip handle which makes accidental unfastening almost impossible and they are not going to chew into your palm like regular drybags.\n\n Fill them with water or sand; sand gives you different weights (10L = 16.5kg with regular sand) so the internal graduations measure water. Sand works best - if you're using water, line the bag with a garbage bag.\n\n You don't want to work all year on your beach body just to have it waste away while you're enjoying the beach!! Order your DryBells today to stay in shape wherever you are!",
