I bought this for my Granddaughter and it was hands down the easiest assembly I have done in all these years. Imagine the screw holes are countersunk so it goes together as fast as can be. From taking it out of the box to total assemble took 2 1/2 hours. Every part fit perfectly. Since it is Thanksgiving time I only have to wait one more month for the look on her face. I'd give it more stars if I could.",

Pink of course is her favorite color. Bought a inexpensive coffee table, used a lazy susan and mounted a board on top. Glued green felt on it and that's what the doll house is setting on. Allows her to rotate it around from front to back without moving around to the other side. Looked at a lot of possible doll houses and picked this one after thinking this one would be a good one. This turned out to be the best !!!!!!!!!",

This is a very solid dollhouse and heavy. After reading the reviews warning about possible splintering of some of the wood my son drilled through all the screw holes again. Only one screw hole was drilled in the wrong place.",

Still, it looks fantastic, and my daughter loves it. The decorative details are really nice. I love how each room is finished and ready for furniture, and the shingles are a nice touch. It's a great marriage of form and function at a decent price point; you can buy much fancier dollhouses for 3-10x the cost, but most of them need to be decorated from scratch. For an actual working, playing dollhouse out of the box, go with this one.",

Anyway, the cheap Chinese screws that put this dollhouse together should have been the first warning, but putting it together has been more than just a little annoying. I'm not done yet, but I am thinking of taking it apart, and buying better screws and using glue on everything and taking a couple days instead of a couple hours to put this together. Either way, it's not worth the price, unless your expectations are lower than mine.",

I had wanted a long-term wooden doll house option but didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars--this more than fits the bill! Highly recommend it!",

There isn't a child that comes in that doesn't run over to it immediately. It comes needing assembly but the directions are clear and it took me about an hour with no problems. We haven't had it for very long so I can't say how many years it will last but it feels very sturdy and durable. I love to play with this as much as the kids do! I got it for my five-year-old but younger kids seem to like it a lot and also my 8-year-old and her friends play with it.",
