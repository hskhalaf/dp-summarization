The audio quality is loud and clear, so no complain there. The dual lens came in very handy, especially if you're a Uber driver. Probably the only downside is that it doesn't come with wifi connection. You've to take out the memory card to view the recorded video. Otherwise, it's a great deal.",

If both cameras could record at 640p standard resolution, this would have been ideal for my uses. Not at all a bad dash cam, but there is better.

The only things you should aware that the charge come with original car charger, not USB charger, you\u2019d better to purchase a car charger adapter in to to charge your other device.",
