I suggest buying extra lube for the install as they only give you a tiny amount. I figured I would need to turn my rotors because I had some pulsation, but didn't have time. Turns out just replacing the pads was enough that the pulsation with away. My stopping distance is significantly shorter now too!",

Since I Tow a boat quite a bit i wanted pads and rotors that were more heavy duty. These Delco pads are awesome. Quiet, stop fast and very easy to install. I had lots of stopping power when hitting the brakes towing last weekend. I will buy these again next time i have to change brakes!",
