Quality s horrible. Will spend a few extra bucks and get an llbean or timberland one so it will last. This one is so poorly made that my husband would need a new one next year too. Beware!!",

      "text": "PRO: Great delivery & very warm coat for sking & snowboarding. The XL size for a 6'2\", 210 lb. highschool senior fit perfectly. CON: After the 3rd day of snowboarding, the zipper cloth seperated from the zipper line at the bottom. (18 year old said he kept the bottom snapped when the coat was zipped up.) After that time, whenever the coat was zipped, it would separate from bottom up. (Glad I brought a spare coat for skiing.) See the attached picture to see how the zipper tore apart at the bottom. Bottom line, very nice coat FOR 3 DAYS.",

Any decently constructed jacket would've survived that with minimal damage if any at all. Not this shoddy jacket.

The zipper in the coat I received looked like it was a decent quality, and I noticed reinforced stitching in the underarm area, so perhaps the manufacturers read some of those reviews and made some adjustments to the product. Anyway, I've only had the coat for a few days, and so I have no idea how it holds up to long-term use, so unless it fails to get me all the way through this winter, then I will leave my rating at 5 stars.",

It's a ski jacket, so they're not playing around with keeping out the wind. There are snaps, drawstrings, and zipper covers everywhere designed to trap the heat in, and keep the chill out! It even keeps the air from sneaking in thru your sleeve hole/glove area. It's like the pants with stirrups for ladies, but for your hands, lol! That thing does hurt a little because it's a little tight between the thumb/finger area, but that's literally my only complaint. Very nice jacket.",

      "text": "So this jacket was great for the first 3 weeks or so then the stitching on the shoulder tore a little from light use which was a huge disappointment since I actually really liked the jacket. It fits nicely and is very warm but after the small tear it just kept ripping down the seam so maybe the quality isn't as nice as it seemed at first. I can't even say I got my moneys worth out of this thing because of how short of a time it took for it to tear. So buyer beware.",

I wish I could have tried one on before purchasing. I normally run a large but I like a snug fit so I'm curious how a medium would have fit. With all the reviews of people saying it fits small I thought I'd be safe ordering a large. Well... the large fits like a large. Tadaaaa. Great jacket for the price though! I love it and I'm glad it's in my closet. The hood is huge btw. Definitely a weird fit and no straps to pull it down.",

Plus It\u2019s not too bulky like other snow jackets are. Great for wearing with snow bib also!! Bravo!!!",
