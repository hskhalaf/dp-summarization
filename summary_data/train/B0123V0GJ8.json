Now with the app you can mark two points on your local street. Walk from one point to the other letting the OneTweak count your steps. Convert the distance to inches, divide by the reported steps and multiply by 2 (A stride is a left step plus a right step). Input your stride to the OneTweak.",

      "text": "Walked over four miles wearing a FitBit and the OneTweak Pedometer to check for accuracy. Step count and mileage were almost identical. The OneTweak EZ-1 Pedometer is easier to read, easier to use, doesn't require frequent charging, doesn't require an app, and costs much less than a FitBit. If you just want a good pedometer for your waIks or jogging I would highly recommend this one. Just remember to set the proper stride length to get an accurate mileage reading.",

After that, it's been great to use. We had a walking regimen for years and never really knew how far we were walking and our actual pace. Now we know. One Tweak sent us the pedometer promptly and is interested in feedback from buyers/users. Evidently a responsible and customer friendly company. We highly recommend this pedometer for walkers.",

If it came in a smaller size I would order another one. Also, all I want is to know if I got my 10,000 steps per day. I don't need any other info. Thanks!",

I also like seeing how may miles I've walked. I did have a little trouble initially setting it up. I think because I held the button down to long. Just click in whichever button you're using (reset and mode for up and down) and it's a breeze.",
