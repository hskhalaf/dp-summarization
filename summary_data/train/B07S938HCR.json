I play pickleball in them and did not have to \"Break\" them in at all. They are not heavy which is a great assest for me since I have bad knees. I don't even think of my shoes once I am playing they are like just an extension of my feet. I highly recommend these court shoes.",

Sent them back and got a smaller size. She wore them to one practice and the sole on the front of the toe started to seperate. Currently waiting on another pair. This is our team shoe so she has no choice but to wear them, otherwise we would stick with her Nike or Mizuno. Not impressed so far. Thank you to Amazon for handling our situation so well, very accommodating",
