That's too many for me. Plus, they give me heart burn within minutes. I even get heartburn when I just take 2 at a time. Now, I'll admit, I'm pregnant and get heartburn more often, but the Prenatal One (or calcium or folic acid) do not give me heartburn. And they are really stinky. Early in my pregnancy I had a strong aversion to smells and the smell of these made me gag. Get the Prenatal One instead!",
