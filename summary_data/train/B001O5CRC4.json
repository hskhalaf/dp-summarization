I've been worried that upon some 1 star review about people getting seemly fake items, I have been paying attention to all details such as the graving on the soles, the blue box and the code. It seems like authentic and the leather is soft and comfy. Didn't like the strong plastic smell of the dust bag though to be honest. I heard about a saying that some buyers bought authentic items on Amazon but return the fakes ones!!! OMG!!! That's maybe why the inventory is contaminated! However if things like that happens Amazon should be responsible for the QC!! I think I may be lucky to get a pair of authentic boots! :((",

I am a true size 11 but after reading about three boots I decided to size down a half size as I would be wearing thin socks with the boot as I am from Southern California and there is no need to thick socks here. If I were to wear these in colder weather I would have definitely ordered a size 11 as thick socks would not work with the 10.5. As far as the boots themselves. They are amazing and I am so happy with them. They are genuine Stewart Weitzman boots, came in purple box with dust bag and all!",

The boots came in the purple box and that\u2019s where the authenticity ended. The suede is cheap, the leather interior bends roughly and just by picking them up you can tell how light they are. I know there\u2019s a market for knock offs but the price tag is a bit steep making you think they\u2019re real. There is no way to tell from far away they are fakes, so if you like them, keep them.

Anyway, I complained to Amazon and they immediately mailed me another pair in the purple box. All is good in boot heaven now. :D. They are beautiful and comfortable. I usually wear a size 8 but got a 7.5 in these and they fit great! Now I'll just have to wait for another sale to get another color.....",

For about $300 w/tax I think I got a hell of a deal. If you\u2019re on the fence just buy them.",

It was also a sign of the quality that there was absolutely no discomfort or 'wearing in' period - they fit like a glove from word go. I went down a US half size to 10.5 which is the euro 41, they are roomy but not in an oversized way, just super comfortable.",

The day they arrived I put them on and wore them for hours that is how comfortable they are. Note, as they are suded and thus prone to staining I would waterproof them first to minimise scuffing. These boots turn alot of heads, simple in design yet elegant on the leg. Well made, Highly recommended. I waited for the sales to be able to afford them. They are well worth thr price as they never date I will be able to wear them for many seasons.",
