I bought 2 sets (because I have long thick hair) and I used the 8 biggest to do my whole head. I just wrapped the big ones not too tight and had no problem with kinks from the slits and used the clips. I would say the clips work best if you clip underneath the roll and not on top. I also bought pins just in case for the smaller rollers and I put one under each bang just at the scalp for volume without rolling into a full curl. I recommend setting with a flexible hairspray.",

I am very disappointed in the short life of these rollers. So, I will not be purchasing another Conair product. As a side note, the customer service employees are very nice and helpful, but my unit is out of warranty when I expected them to honor the date of the 2nd unit received. I am escalating my request, so we will see if they honor their warranty.",

I almost never used the smallest size, so the loss of the smaller curler doesn't bother me, either. I've only used it a couple times, but it's decent. Don't think one should have to spend so much more to get decent clips, though.

      "text": "FIrst off, this is a great value for the money, its hands-down a very solid headset. I have large ears and these completely cover them while also providing decent noise cancellation.. The build quality seems very good and as for the mic, it works fine and I have had no issues for this week of use. The sound quality is just right with the bass being the perfect amount to groove with. The mic itself from what I've tested sounded clear to me which I didn't have a problem with when it came to communicating with anyone. The mic stays attached the entire time, so that may be a negative to some. overall its a great gaming headset!!!",

I was also careful to select the model that depicted the on/off switch when ordering. I was surprised that in fact, there is no on/off switch as per the reviews. Wasn't too worried...just plug/unplug. However, the quallity isn't the same as the last set identical as these. Additionally, the clips that come with it are no only bluky to store, but they are made of very thin, cheap plastic and dont hold the rollers in well. Disappointing.",
