Update on Merrells I did't get round to using them until some time after buying them, when I did I notice on the first time when I wore them that the right shoe was slipping off the heal, I inspected the shoe and notice that part of the heal collar was missing, i was a bit too late to send them back. now I think that these shoes were seconds, so I have now reduced my rating to one star. shoes now heading to the bin.",
