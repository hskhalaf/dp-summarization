I did have one cone so far that had a chunk taken out of it right out of the box. They are a bit light just placing them on the grass. You may have to work them in a bit so the prop wash from the propellers don't flip them over. Attached are photos of a quick little test course I set up in my backyard for one of my tiny whoop quads and my other racing drones.",

Out of the box these cones were flimsy and very slippery, which makes it for a challenging task when carrying many of them in one hand, probably why they have the holder, which not something I use. The fact that they are flexible and lightweight makes them susceptible to flying away on their own with windy conditions. I prefer a slightly more heavy weight disc cone, but for the amount I got for cost. I can live with it.",

It's also a good combo of distinct colors. The base is made of pretty basic plastic (all I'd expect for the price), so it can be a little fragile. My base showed up broken, but the manufacturer replaced it free of charge within a couple days of receiving my complaint, so even that problem was quickly solved!",

The stand itself is really lightweight and could use a lower heavier center of gravity so it would be possible to give it a light toss without it knocking over (again I play wheelchair basketball so it\u2019s a little difficult to bend down to pick things up and move them).

Thankfully we bought the large quantity cone bundle and were able to quadruple them up to make them rigid enough to produce the desired effect.
