There is also that puckering defect on the rim of the glasses as others have stated. My question is does this company have any sort of quality control?

Truthfully, they were an impulse buy from amazon daily deals; but I'm so happy with them. The size is perfect. I used them as juice glasses for a brunch I had and they looked perfect. I also plan on using them for berries and cream and of course for martinis. Best impulse buy I had in a long time.",
