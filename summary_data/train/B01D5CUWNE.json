And it\u2019s adjustable for what size IPad you have. You just unscrew and move the holders to a new position. It has a cutout for the camera and home button, but there is a insert to cover access to it if that is what you need. The locking feature is nice and works well. Plus there is plenty of space to install your charging cable. I used a little longer cable than the normal Apple cable for extra room.",

Still, when you manage to get it positioned correctly, it\u2019s held in place pretty securely.",

I have explained to MOUNT-IT that without the screws (missing 2 of them) which is what holds the ipad IN place inside the holder - this is USELESS to me. Waiting a response from them as waiting 10 weeks to see IF they even find any is NOT a good solution.",
