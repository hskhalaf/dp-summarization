Had the phone for a few hours and decided to return, thankfully Amazon have a great policy. Bought this for a gift and never been so disappointed for the person I bought it for. Have a Samsung S10+ myself and would rather pay a premium as it really makes a difference. The phone itself looks nice, the fingerprint reader is the fastest I've ever used, but massively let down by \"Honor\" and the \"Magic\" software.",

I wanted a low cost phone that was nice to use and had a great screen. Best things about this phone are the amazing finger print reader which is just unbelievably fast and reliable and the very strong battery life. The screen is a better size than the pixel 3xl also with it being slimmer but longer. For the price it's excellent value and after a lifetime of buying iphones and recently Google pixels I don't think I'll go back to either brand after seeing what such little money can buy.",

Not saying at all it's not great, but it still takes the same quality photos as any other Huawei device. I think this was a tiny bit mislead. However, the stamina and process of the phone is near exceptional and the price for it is a bargain considering the quality of the device. A solid 9/10!! Thanks amazon! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4d",

The depth sensor camera is clear, and although its only a 2MP camera, photos are clear, and sharp. The display is better than I thought, although an AMOLED screen would have been better, its still a great device for the price. Only on complaint that I've noticed recently, the charger that came with the device is not a super fast charger. Not sure if this is normal for devices like this, but I was a bit annoyed I didn't get the right plug.",
