The instructions to assemble were easy to follow, all the components lined up as they should. The strap to fasten the dogs in is very secure, and well made. The Bichon is an escape artist, and he squirmed the first time in the seat, trying everything to get out without success. I assembled them in the house, hooked them in, and tucked the straps under the seat (to secure) to give them a test run in the house prior to putting them in the car. I am very happy with the purchase.",

I sent it back to Amazon and asked for a replacement and the replacement did the exact same thing. I've lived with it and just duct taped it and it has been holding up. Do not recommend this to anyone with dogs that shed a lot either. I have a corgi and his hair sticks to the material and is very difficult to remove.",

Traveling with the pup is now enjoyable and I can bring him on more excursions. I do wish there was a bit more comfy padding in this thing. The bottom pad seems really cheap and not very plush. If they corrected this, I would say this is perfect. Still worth 5 stars because of how miraculously it works. Thank you!!",

      "text": "Love this. My dog is a skinny cavalier spaniel 10ish lbs. she fits just fine, has room to move around. I had another car seat thing but it was too low for her to look out the window and the strap would loosen if she pulled. This thing is sturdy, hard plastic frame, the seatbelt is strong enough to keep her in the seat while I\u2019m driving. She likes it better because she can see out the windows. Overall very happy so far. The thing is bulky and doesn\u2019t exactly fit in my standard car bucket seats... probably would be better fit with suv seats. But it works and we are both happy.",

The pillow has reversible sides - one is a smooth side while the other has a bit of fluff to it. Assembly took about 10 minutes while it took less than five minutes to get it in the car. I already ordered another for my other dog and two extra so that I don't have to switch it out when I drive another car. The dog featured is Cody; he's a Pomeranian and weighs less than 20 pounds.

In the previous one we had, the leash was attached to the seat itself and it eventually broke off. With it going through the seatbelt, there's nothing to break. Very stylish, looks great. If I had one suggestion it would be that the cushion were built in to the cover itself. This makes it soft and cushy even up the sides, and makes it so the cushion can't come out. Other than that, great seat!",

I was driving on a busy street in rush hour when a car in the left turn lane decided it didn't want to turn left and cut in front of me. I had to slam on the breaks. This normally would have sent my dog flying off her seat. She was asleep and didn't wake up, She was completely undisturbed. The car seat didn't budge an inch.",

I also use the harness belt. The first time I put Sophie in it, she jumped out and ended up hanging next to it (from her harness). But, she quickly realized you're supposed to stay in the seat and now she likes it. I love how high it sits for her. She has a perfect angle to see out of the window comfortably. I'm happy with this investment.",

I felt this model was safer than most of the other \"open\" models since it is attached with the seat belt, and the harness attachment slides onto the seat belt itself-not the carrier (only through the it in back). Much safer this way especially if you use a safety harness. The unit itself is heavy duty, dbl-walled molded plastic, and easy to assemble. Very solid and do not foresee any wear & tear issues other than the easily replaceable covers. I did put a waterproof pad under the pillow that comes with it.",

Pom usually likes to lean against the back of the seat, but with this booster seat, the rigid material is hard that she gets uncomfortable and fidgety. The bottom cushion is also strange - more poly fill, not a firm cushion, so it slides around under her when she moves or when I turn corners. I expected a more firm, fitted foam insert for the bottom that would resist shifting. This booster seat may be perfect for smaller dogs up to 10 lbs, but for my weighty Pom I wish I'd put this money into something else.",
