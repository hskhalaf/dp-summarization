They still fit and feel great, haven't worn out, keep my hands ventilated enough during warm days and now that I've been out and about in cold weather, I still love them. Very true to sizing on the product page, and very good dexterity even while wearing them. Highly recommend.",

I would have returned them until I realized they fell apart just outside of the return window. Does anyone sell gloves that are designed to last? I've been through to many gloves at this point.

The knuckles and reinforcements are just hard plastic but you shouldn't expect metal/carbon fiber at this price point, and hard plastic will still save you from having your hand bits left as a smear on the pavement if you go down at high speed.",

The straps are durable, but bad if you need to take them off quickly. With practice you can get faster at taking them off. If you're just using these for a bike or daily work gloves these will definitely stand up to that.",

The knuckles are just a tougher fabric than the rest of the glove. The knuckles bend and give and provide less strength and protection. Will not be purchasing again.",
