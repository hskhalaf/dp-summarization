I only use it once a week and it still works great. I have 4C African American hair, so I always have to use a lot of product. I use this mainly on my roots and scalp and use a cheaper shampoo (Trader Joes tea tree tingle shampoo) on the rest of my hair to stretch it out. Highly recommend",

      "text": "I found this while I was looking for a replacement for Nizoral AD as it shares the active ingredient (ketoconazole) that I was looking for to tame my crazy dandruff. This stuff works just as well as Nizoral AD and has a pleasant scent. The one qualm I have with it is that it doesn't lather very well at all, so it does take more to properly apply than you'd first anticipate. This is the only reason I rated it 4 stars. This is also quite gentle on the face, so people who suffer from occasional seborrheic dermatitis or an overly itchy beard, this stuff works great there as well.",

With the pump bottle I find I'm using 6-8 pumps of shampoo to clean my scalp. It also doesn't lather well. The smell is overall pleasant and not to strong.",
