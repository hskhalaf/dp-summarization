BUT after turning the unit off and on a few times I broke it! The fatal flaw is that there is no switch in the conventional sense. You twist it on and off. But, If you turn it too far, you will split it open. I tried to epoxy it together with out any luck. Good news. I called the manufacturer about it and they sent me a new one, postage paid. I am keeping the 2 \"O\" rings well lubricated.",

Also, it takes 5 D batteries, and I anticipate having to change them often. 3 hours doesn\u2019t feel like a lot of run time. That remains to be seen. This device does a good job, and comes highly rated from a friend, but it\u2019s a very slow process. The suction path is only a couple of inches wide, and I have a 22 ft round pool.",

Had some mess on the bottom of the pool we just couldn\u2019t get out. I just used it for the first time and it\u2019s clean! The biggest plus is that it doesn\u2019t go through the filter so no loss of water when back washing. This is essential for us because we are on a well and have limited water resources. The only drawback I\u2019ve seen so far is the filter on s small so needs cleaning frequently. But, I did have a bit to f bottom litter to remove. Well worth the money in my opinion.",

I have a 12\u2019 x 24\u2019 above ground pool with a skimmer that hangs on the wall. The vacuum that attaches to that would pull off the skimmer and it was a huge pain.

The base layer depth is 12 inches deep I was disappointed in the suction power as the vacuum had,and had to be right on top of the particle. It is possible the batteries which I bought new were depleted, thus poor suction. The impellers tended to push particles away - leaving me chasing around the pieces to vacuum up. Upon turning it off - the particles (not all of them) but a great amount were released back into the water. Disappointing !",

I read where there was trouble with battery corrosion, so each time I use it I open up the battery compartment and let it sit for a few hours. It has never had any moisture inside. I am very happy with how this works! It doesn't come with an extension handle and I didn't see where to purchase one, but my husband rigged up a shop broom handle to it and it is perfect.",

On a twelve ft extension it is difficult to perform either of these actions especially if the broom is wet and slippery. Why couldn't you just put a switch on it? Very poor design.",

Also, the item appeared to have been used although I purchased a \u201cnew\u201d one as the filter was already attached to the broom. In addition, the box didn\u2019t include an owners manual or warranty card. VERY disappointed in this company! I don\u2019t recommend that you purchase from this company! I kept the product despite this as it did work but due to the \u201cbait and switch\u201d tactics of this company and no warranty card, I will most likely be buying another one soon. :-(",

My only gripe is that depending on how dirty your pool is and how small the debris is, you seem to have to empty the bag every 5 minutes. Silt will coat the whole bag pretty quickly and stop the suction. Tip: do not turn the vaccum off while still in the water; it will cause the debris to come out of the bag and back into the pool.",

When we looked further, there seemd to be water getting into the moter, somehow. It was very disappointing and we were 3 days past the return date. We've had it for a month. Kind of expensive for 3 uses. We are going to contact the company, however if it's not made well, the next one will probably last no longer than this one.",
