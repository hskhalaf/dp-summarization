      "text": "So this is my second pair. For me the sound is great. The seal is great. It's light and comfortable. It would be nice if the battery lasted more than 6 hours on a full charge but it's not a biggie. The wifi can intermittently cut out and sometimes requires reconnecting, once again not so bad. So the reason why this is the second pair is that on the first pair the connection between the cable and the ear piece just began disconnecting meaning I had sound from only one ear. Shure said that they'd look at it it. Couldn't be bothered with all the back and forth so I just bought another pair.",

It skips just putting my hand up to my ear or taking my glasses off. The cable is designed to go around your front which is ridiculous. If you put the battery part and cable behind your back as you would expect with this type of design then the volume controls are inaccessible. Do not buy these if you like your music without skipping.",

For the price and size of the headphone, the sound quality is good although sometimes Bluetooth suffers from interference with different devices. They work near perfect on iPhone, though! Major design issue is the flex cable which you loop around your ear to keep the ear phones in place. This snaps after a while and means that it loses all grip on your ear. I had one replacement from Amazon for this issue and I am now experiencing the same with the replacement!",
