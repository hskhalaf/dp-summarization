It doesn't feel like it moisturizes my skin at all, and it doesn't \"blend\" into my skin. It covers my skin with a grainy look. I'm 75 years old. Never wore foundation makeup and swore by the old Neutrogena - which kept my facial skin soft, tanned looking, and safe from sun rays. This is quite a different product. Will not purchase again.",

      "text": "Nice smooth application, didn't pill up. Natural light coverage, nice matte, but not too matte finish. I have drier, mature skin, and this didn't seem to sink into my lines as much as other of these types of tinted moisturizers do. I did apply a bit of moisturizer first, if not, I think this might have been a bit drying, but it seemed to work out great. Lasted all day, and into the early evening, didn't oxidize, and didn't burn my eyes, which is a problem I have had with this line in the past. For the price, I'd recommend.",

It's hard to find a natural make up that actually looks natural, and stays put! I am in love!",
