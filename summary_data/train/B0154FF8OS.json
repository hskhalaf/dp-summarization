We just bough the Joovy Loo and the opening is much bigger -- just wish it looked the same as the Summer Infant and made cue flushing sounds :(",

Without the splash guard, the raised \"bump\" in the front is still generally too low and most of the time a little boy will end up peeing over the top of it (and all over the floor). The idea behind this product is great, the execution is horrible. For the price, I expected some minimum level of functionality, but was sorely disappointed.

Hen then thought it was just a regular toy and only wanted to play with it. When he finally used it an was rewarded for it he got super excited! We put it in the bathroom so he can see the resemblance of our original toilet in the bathroom. He now is getting used to using it and really loves the flushing sound it makes. I like the wipe container at the top so we can ensure he is cleaned really good.",

Her parents have one also. the storage area leaves much to be desired as it is too small to hold her wipes, but we will find a use for it.",

This is our 4th type of potty we've tried (starting to get expensive here) but the flushing sound and that it looks just like mommys toilet is big motivator. First night so far she sat on it no diaper and pushed and tooted! This may not sound like much but at almost 4 years old we were getting desperate. I am hoping this trend continues she didn't go but was very proud and excited that she could sit on it and loves flushing it. She even said she would try again tomorrow!",
