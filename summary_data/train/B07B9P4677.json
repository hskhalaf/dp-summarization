I returned the playstation once i realized it only streamed in 4k. Ive now had the xbox for a week and i'm hooked. The free 3 month's of game pass that's included is awesome, i don't think i could go without it. Streams beautifully, plays discs beautifully, im highly satisfied! I was worried that the device would be noisy like my old ps3, but i can't hear it even standing next to it. I don't think I'll ever go back to playstation.",

Old enough that it isn\u2019t covered by any warranty. Amazon can\u2019t help because it is a third party seller. Microsoft can\u2019t help because it is over a year old and they can\u2019t be responsible for sellers that hold product for years before selling. I recommend you don\u2019t buy this.....definitely worth a trip to the big box store or their onli e site. This one was a rip off.",

I didn't know what the Xbox game pass was and assumed the code was only for Xbox live. I figured it out later. \ud83d\ude1d",
