      "COMES WITH SAFETY COVERS \u2013 These knives are extremely sharp. For safety purposes, we\u2019ve included four sheaths that fit snugly over each knife, preventing any accidental contact with the blades. Each blade cover is a different size, designed specifically to fit the unique shape of its corresponding blade. When not in use, store these professional knives with their sheaths in place.",
      "LIGHTWEIGHT, ERGONOMIC CUTLERY \u2013 Even though ceramic knives are harder than traditional steel knives, they are also lighter. In fact, these ceramic knives are half the weight of most metal knives. Additionally, our knives have an ergonomic, arched handle, giving you excellent grip and control while cutting boneless meat, bread, fruits, and vegetables.",
      "NON-REACTIVE BLADES \u2013 Ceramic knives have unique properties which make them resistant to oils and acids. Because of this, they are especially well suited for slicing boneless meat, vegetables, fruits, and bread. These knives are rustproof and stain resistant, and they won\u2019t absorb any food elements. This means that the original taste, smell, and color of your food will be preserved after cutting.",
      "STAYS SHARP LONGER THAN STAINLESS STEEL KNIVES \u2013 These ceramic knives are made of zirconia, which is second in hardness only to diamond. They are substantially harder than stainless steel knives, and retain their sharp cutting edge up to ten times longer than steel knives. Unlike steel knives, ceramic knives do not need to be regularly resharpened.",
