I wanted a really nice coat rack that could hold a lot of jackets and not hog a lot of wall space. And this was it! I had looked at other coat racks, but they generally tend to be ugly and/or have only a couple of usable hooks. This one will hold 8 coats, 3 umbrellas, and a hat (or some other combination of items, depending on where you put them). The only minus is that it does list to one side, as others have mentioned. It can probably be leveled, but apparently it's not perfect right out of the box.",

Before purchasing this I ordered another similar yet less expensive one on Amazon. That less expensive one was a piece of junk. It had large cracks in the hooks that screwed into the coat rack top making them loose and one even fell apart and off the rack, also the finish was very cheap, dull and ugly. This coat rack however is everything that less expensive one was not. Trust me and pay the extra $30-ish and get this one and you won't be sorry.",

It did come a little marked up so with that I gave this a 4 star rating.Overall with the 3 legs and a little marked up I used a little blue medium grade loctite were you screwed it together and a black permanent marker to cover up the marked areas it turn out really good and its pretty sturdy not bad . Use a T handle allen wrench to get a good secured tightening on the legs with the loctite and you'll never worry about them coming loose.",

      "text": "It assembled in less than ten minutes. Mine has 3 legs, but seems very sturdy, It has a good color. all pegs are stained to match. My only complaint is the top tier. It doesn't attach at all, it just sits with a peg in the hole. I would prefer a non swivel. Don't hesitate to purchase. This is a nice piece with good weight.",
