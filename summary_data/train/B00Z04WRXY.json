For those that like to point out the precision machining evident on the lamello, just remember this is just a plate joiner. This is a tool used by woodworkers to align boards for glue ups. The cordless feature is amazing. With a 5amp battery pack, it has enough power for any job.",

Lastly, this is a tool-only version so you need your own batteries and charger. Battery drain is a non-issue. I never seem to need to cut more than a dozen or so biscuits for a project and by then I take the battery off to use on the orbital sander which is also awesome.",

    "description": "Style:Bare Tool OnlyThe Makita 18V LXT Lithium-Ion Cordless Plate Joiner (model XJP03Z, tool only) provides portability and performance in the field or in the shop -- without the cord. The XJP03Z combines power and precision with ease-of-use features for strong and accurate biscuit joints for furniture making, cabinet construction and fine woodworking applications. (note: battery and charger sold separately). For improved tool performance and extended battery life, Makita created Star Protection Computer Controls. Star Protection is communication technology that allows the Star Protection-equipped tool and battery to exchange data in real time and monitor conditions during use to protect against overloading, over-discharging and overheating. For increased versatility, the tool can also be powered by Makita 18V LXT and Compact Lithium-Ion batteries with the star symbol on the battery indicating Star Protection inside. The XJP03Z provides up to 320 cuts or 160 joints on a single charge (18V LXT 3.0Ah battery, sold separately) . The rack-and-pinion vertical fence system is engineered for accurate fence adjustments, and the cast aluminum pivot fence has three positive stops at 0 degrees, 45 degrees, and 90 degrees. The blade diameter is 4 inches, and there are six depth settings with one-touch stops for the most common biscuit sizes including #0, #10 and #20.",
