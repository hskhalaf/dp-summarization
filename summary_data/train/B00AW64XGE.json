The rhodium and gold finished beads look great, and I would think the piece cost considerably more. If it lasts even a few months it is well worth the price. Meaure your ankle before ordering. I have very small ankles, and I doubt that it would fit someone who has a large ankle.",

Pure silver was found to be a soft and easily damageable material. When combined with other metals, most commonly cooper, it produced a tougher material that could be heavily relied on. Throughout the next few centuries, sterling silver was used as currency and for household items. It was often used as silverware and became the material used in a proper table setting between 1840 and 1940 throughout the United States and Europe. Because of this popularity, silver companies began to grow. During this craze, companies began to experiment using sterling silver compositions in jewelry, as it was a material that was easy to mold into intricate designs and gave a luxurious look with its metallic finish. Today, sterling silver is widely used in all kinds of jewelry styles and shines as beautifully as other precious metals, with the benefit of affordable pricing.\n\nSterling Silver Composition\n\nWhile pure silver can be combined with many different types of metals, sterling silver is created when combining pure silver with copper. Sterling silver jewelry can be composed with different amounts of copper but is most often seen with the .925 stamp, meaning that the composition is of 92.5 percent silver and 7.5 percent copper. This has been found to be a good combination for maintaining the silver's durability without harming its sparkle.\n\nCaring for Your Sterling Silver Jewelry\n\nSilver should not come into contact with harsh household chemicals such as bleach, ammonia, or chlorine. To avoid scratches, store silver in a lined jewelry box or pouch, as it is prone to tarnish as it naturally reacts with sulfur or hydrogen sulfide in the air. Cleaning and wearing silver jewelry regularly will prevent this and help maintain its shine. Immediately upon noticing any discoloration, use a gentle polish made specifically for removing tarnish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPRODUCT DETAILS\n * Is Discontinued By Manufacturer :No\n * Product Dimensions :5 x 5 x 0.7 inches; 0.32 Ounces\n * Item model number :XMZ20011P-10\"\n * Department :Womens\n * Date First Available :February 11, 2013\n * Manufacturer :Media Imports Inc\n * ASIN :B00AW64XGE\n\n * Amazon Best Sellers Rank: #14,233 in Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry (See Top 100 in Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry)  *  #26 inWomen's Anklets \n   \n   \n\n * Customer Reviews:4.6 out of 5 stars1,806 ratings \n\n\n\nTHE AMAZON CURATED COLLECTION\n\n\nDiscover the Amazon Curated Collection of fine and fashion jewelry.

This piece features a metal plating or flashing, or an electrocoating for a more lustrous appearance, but it can wear off with long-term or heavy use. To ensure the longevity of your plated items store your jewelry in a dark, cool, dry place such as a pouch or air tight box and avoid rubbing plated items together.\u00a0Also try to avoid exposure to cleaning products and perfume which can both negatively affect your items. Your local jeweler can advise you where to send your jewelry if you would ever like them replated."
