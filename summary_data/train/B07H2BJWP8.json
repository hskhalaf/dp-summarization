I know it's from the sharp bits off of the cedar juniper we use, but everything wears. I decided it's also because we haul as much as we can lift, which weighs more, speeding up the wear. We're only loading it to the top of the side walls now. Hoping less weight means it'll last longer.",

I simply got tired of the bark/twigs/etc being left on the hearth AND the annoyance of making multiple trips from the wood stack to inside the home. This product is fantastic! I can fill an entire night's use of wood in ONE TRIP and no more bark/leaves/etc left on the hearth for clean up. To add... I recently needed something to use to pick up sticks and twigs after an ice storm and used this as a convenience. Worked great for that too! I highly recommend it and I am very pleased with the quality. Great job, INNO STAGE!",

This wood be great for camping, beach trips or other ways in which you need a big bag to carry a bunch of random stuff. Very pleased.
