      "text": "I am six feet tall and the back track doesn't massage my neck area well enough. This may be because the automatic measuring doesn't work very well. Also, the calf massage doesn't reach my calves. This may be because I am too tall and my legs are too long to fit the chair well. Overall it does give a good massage and I especially like the heat feature. The leg massage area does lengthen when you push on it but it still doesn't go out far enough to allow the back of calf massage to engage.",

I do not know the model, and I am pretty sure I paid way too much for the chair also, so be sure to check the prices, as I am now seeing the one I got for half the price I paid and less. The controller is very basic, and the options are very limited and not intuitive. It's OKAY, but definitely not work $2000. If I could return it I would.",
