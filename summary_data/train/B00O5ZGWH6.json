First, the bottom nut for one of the feet was missing when I received it. I contacted the seller and they promptly sent me out a new set of feet and nuts. The reason I deducted one star is because the yellow rings are made of plastic and the seam where they clasp together has roughly molded edges, which catch when the numbers are flipped over, which is rather annoying when flipping them over.",
