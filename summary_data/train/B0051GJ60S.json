Box was very well protected with extra cardboard on each end of the main packaging box and there were no damages to the nightstand pieces. Looks good in the room and the dark color makes it more elegant. We also purchased the matching dresser () and was unfortunately not as happy with how it came from the factory since the damages on that one would have never come from transport. Overall, not a bad price for what you get even for fancy particle board.",
