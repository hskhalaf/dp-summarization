      "text": "Wonderful shelves to creatively display anything your heart desires! These things are beyond aesthetically pleasing. The shelves themselves are quite beautiful, and feel very sturdy. As others have stated, the mounting process can be a bit of a chore. The anchors they provide are flimsy at best, and the directions definitely leave something to be desired. I wouldn't take off a star just because of the mounting process. It really isn't that bad. BUT if you can manage to weather a little bit of mounting grief, the shelves will hang firmly in place, and add a beautiful addition to your wall decor. Definitely would recommend these shelves for anyone wanting to give their wall a wonderful accent!",

      "text": "I returned this without even removing them from the box. They appeared to be well constructed and were in the size range that I needed, but the wood of the shelf and the plastic trim on the pressboard edge were two different white tones. The edge was a more blue white while the shelf was a more eggshell. It may work in some environments (or with different lighting - we use soft lighting in the 2700K range), but it caught my eye in a way I couldn't stand. Easy return so it might be worth a shot if you love them.",

I used my own, higher quality dry wall anchors but still tried to use the included screws. As you can see in the picture, one of the screws broke as I was screwing it in. Once you get past that, the shelves are pretty nice. They're light and you can arrange them however you want. Also, the included paper template was extremely helpful for guiding where to place the anchors/screws.",
