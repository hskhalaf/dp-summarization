That being said the in-game graphics aren't bad just not up to par at all with the pre-rendered animation. They rarely upgrade graphics and don't give pc users enough control. That being said they do update content alot, and try to balance though this can end badly or in favor of your favorite class. They have completely overhauled some classes and just removed countless abilities which while it may have helped streamline they for a few classes like WHM was unfair.",
