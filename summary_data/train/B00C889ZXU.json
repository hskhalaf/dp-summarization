There are definitely a few areas for improvement such as an easier way to get on and off as all it had to aid in that process were 2 tiny pieces of Velcro. Also, the head hole was quite small; I bought this for a 4 month old who has a smaller head and this was extremely tight in that area. Despite those 2 issues, it\u2019s a well made costume and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a Halloween costume for their little.",

The costume fit well but the head area was a little tight to get over his head even though he is only 10 lbs. The costume was very long so there would be enough room if your child is older, the hat fit good. The only thing to keep in mind is you can't wash and as we all know you want to wash everything before you put it on a newborn. All in all the costume made everybody smile when they looked at him.",

It fit my baby's head fine (at 5 months), but my baby has a smaller than average head...like...the 10th percentile I think...so if your baby has a larger or average head I might heed the \"too small for my baby's head\" reviews. Also, the costume is like a sleeper gown, so that is something to think about if you plan to tote them around in anything with a harness type strap like a stroller or baby carrier...hiking the costume up around the legs kind of ruins the look. :)",
