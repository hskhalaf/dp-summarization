They write fat letters (in an already confined space) and if you're writing multiple items on the calendar at the same time, they fade pretty quickly. NOTE: early reviewer talked about her \"disappointment\" with the calendar being shipped rolled up. I found this comical! How did she expect it come? Folded up?! In a large flat envelope? I unrolled it and had ZERO issues attaching it to my metal refrigerator.",

Trying to update a message was ridiculous, this magnetic calendar solved all of our problems, plenty of room to write, any message can be changed so easily and the magnetic pens make it so easy to keep track of a writing utensil. Securely sticks to refrigerator and clean up is a breeze. Love this product!",

I do find that the longer the marker stays on the board the harder it is to take off with just an eraser or cloth. I used a little dab of water on a paper towel and the marker/writing comes off right away, without a problem. Would definitely recommend.",

It is large enough for him to see the day of the week from the table where he sits. I mark off each day as it passes with the erasable markers and write in his appointments so he knows what to expect for the month. The print on the calendar is large and clear and there is plenty of room for you to jot down any notes. Much better than a regular calendar hanging on the refrigerator like I used to have. Item arrived quickly and was a steal compared to the big box stores!!!",
