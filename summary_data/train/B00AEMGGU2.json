I paired it with a Sonos subwoofer which I highly recommend and now there are nights where I never turn the TV on, but just listen to albums I loved from my past and new music. Totally delightful.",

I agree that for the price, there are probably better options if you are building a traditional surround system. However, you cannot beat the flexibility of this system and being able to cater to the occasion that you are hosting. Sonos continues to be a top notch company that puts out quality products and support. Looking forward to the release of TruePlay later on this year.",
