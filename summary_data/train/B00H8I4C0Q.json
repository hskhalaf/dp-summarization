My only dislike is the visible silver screws, but a little paint will fix that right up. Kind of a given when buying something that needs to be assembled.",

It\u2019s pretty sturdy and looks really pretty. I recommend getting a 6\u201d mattress if you really want the detail to stand out. I got an 8\u201d mattress and it covers it up a bit. Also, be gentle with the bed! I do think the bed itself can hold a bit over the weight limit. Overall great bed I\u2019m in love with it!",

My husband and I assembled in about 2 hours (could have been less but chasing a toddler in between and feeding which left hubby alone some). It is pretty much just pictures and matching part A with hardware 1. Some hardware did kick the bucket, but they actaully send extras with it for both the bed and the trundle so we had plenty and still extras for down the road. There were no imperfections or sharp pieces on ours. It also comes with the wrench and allen key for the hardware so no having to get the toolbox. Best purchase!",

      "text": "The bed frame arrives two weeks than expected. It comes with many parts very to assemble but it\u2019s time consuming. It took my daughter and I all afternoon to put it together. The clamps that go in the center of bed were hard to clamp so I had to use a hard cover book to pop them in in. Instructions are easy to read. The bed is very study and the way it\u2019s put together it\u2019s good quality. Very happy with it.",
