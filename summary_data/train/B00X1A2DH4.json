The only downside which I don't care about is that he has bigger stools now. The extra clean up is worth it to have such a happy, comfy dog! (Bluetick Coonhound/German Pointer cross).",

The starch helps promote yeast in their systems. I would recommend this one. We are on our second bag and will have to rotate to another type of food in a few months, but this is a great dog food.",

She can only have venison or kangaroo, she won\u2019t eat venison which leaves kangaroo. I would like to see the ingredient of peas removed, not to be replaced by sweet potatoes either. It has a direct link to cardiac failure in dogs. Please take that out.",

She seems happier and her coat looks amazing. I attribute that to the great quality of the food and no chicken meal. She tried the lamb nutro and still had issues. So for the extra $15 a bag I think its totally worth it.",

Additionally, her licking and chewing has slowed down considerably. Previously she would lick and lick all night long. No longer. Expensive dog food...but so worth it. We now have a real dog.",

I think they deserve it. If you think about it, you could blow this much on a single human meal. So...go for it. Try the small bag first to be sure it's going to be a good fit. That's what we did.",
