The worst part was that the orange had discoloration and black marks on it when I got it. It also does not feel as smooth as the 3x3 I\u2019ve gotten in the past. If I didn\u2019t get this product on sale, I would be very much disappointed.",

Unless you're just getting it just for looks, I recommend purchasing an off brand cube ($3-$8?) instead of this one. You'll get something easier to turn that will likely be more durable.
