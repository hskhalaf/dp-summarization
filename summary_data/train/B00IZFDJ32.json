The \"Best By Date\" on the product is only two months out from the day it was delivered. There is a March 2018 date on the bag. I am hoping these mints will not taste stale for our guests.",

It pays to serve wine and mixed drinks I guess. By the time the buttermints are put out, who really does care? They looked pretty on the tables~ :~)",
