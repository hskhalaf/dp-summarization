It folds up pretty small for a double stroller so I think it will be pretty easy when traveling on the Disney busses. The sunshades are a little small but it's not really a big deal for me. It is really easy to maneuver. The only issue is the height of the handles. It's a little low, I'm 5'2 and it's perfect height for me but I can see how this would be a problem for a taller person.",

The other strollers are collecting dust, not the kids... Thought I ought to clarify. This stroller folds up to nearly nothing! Instead of filling the trunk with a few hundred dollars of the stroller, we can cram hundreds of groceries. We have owned this for 13 months and the wheels and strap fasteners are still in great shape.",

Cons: can not push it one handed, the wheels aren't exactly level and one side wobbles lightly above the ground while others are flat. HUGE FLAW: child can easily stand out of the stroller seat due to the harness coming from the cloth seat and not from a place on the frame, this is not a securely harnessed stroller at all. I can picture it tipping forward over onto children if both were standing up.",

I\u2019d rather have them gone. 4) there\u2019s really no reclining even if they say there is 5) impossible to push/maneuver w one hand What I like: 1) wont care if it gets lost 2) small footprint for going on trips, riding planes, buses, etc. 3) convenient if your child doesn\u2019t arch back/try to get out",

We are doing a Disney cruise in November, and this thing has turned a daunting adventure into one that we will be able to enjoy without the usual hassle. 100% recommended.

I should have seen this in the description but I missed it and read the question and answers and went by that. Don\u2019t make my mistake. My boys are under 30 lbs each and it just feels flimsy.

The one downfall which I've read on other reviews is that the shade part is really narrow so it doesn't really provide any shade.

I'm still giving it 5 stars even though it has some flaws, but the 5 stars is for what the product does and the low price.",

The compact size while folded is great, as we're able to fit it in our vehicle with all 3 rows up. This is not possible with other strollers we have. I'd definitely recommend this to others. As others have said, the only con to this stroller is the size of the sunshade. It's not very useful to block the sun.",

I\u2019ve had it about 6-7 months, using for everyday out and about like the mall, walks, etc, as well as zoo trips and things. It started off as a pretty good stroller but now the brakes have pretty much broken off and one side is suddenly very hard to fold up. It\u2019s also not maneuvering quite as easily. Still \u201cdoes the job\u201d but I think we\u2019ll be getting a better stroller soon since we\u2019ll be needing it for a while longer.",

It felt like my hand was vibrating while pushing the stroller, but it was just how the stroller operated outdoors vs. indoors. It's best for indoor use.",
