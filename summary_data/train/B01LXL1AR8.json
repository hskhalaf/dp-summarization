It cannot run DD_WRT or Merlin, so you don't get the advanced features like VPN, but the hardware is capable.

However, if you do, you won't be able to connect to that drive from a Windows computer without potentially opening your computer up to future attacks. Windows has disabled the 30 year old protocol SMB1 (that's what this router uses) because it is insecure, so if you want to set up a network drive on this router, you have to re-enable SMB1 on your computer it and keep it re-enabled. I guess I have to hold on to my NAS drive for a while longer.",

Wireless signal became significantly stronger around the home, and my download speeds increased SIGNIFICANTLY! This router has just about everyone anyone really needs. Most of all, I love the QOS feature and capability. You can set the download & upload limit on users so you can distribute bandwidth accordingly. I never deal w/ slowdowns on any device, EVER, because of this. Awesome device, highly recommend!",

I connect lots of devices (10+) and we are as family heavy on streaming or watching videos for the most part... This router hands well... For the features it provides, the cost is pretty low in my opinion, and probably gives those 'high-end' routers a run for its money. IMHO a great product and possibly more... Thanks.",

On 5G it gave an output of 350-600 Mbps just next to the router while on 2G it only managed to give an output of 100 Mbps. 2G signal is barely useful beyond the adjacent room of the router but the 5G signal was able to provide 100+ Mbps throughout the two-bedroom apartment. Update: By keeping the router on a 6 feet high shelf instead of the carpet, the signal strength and range were boosted considerably from 100+ Mbps to 200+ Mbps throughout the apartment on 5G.",
