The sign is very bright and can be seen from a good distance. It definitely gets your attention. I would say its surprisingly bright. Its by far the least expensive exit sign available that will satisfy the fire marshal. Its LED so you will never have to worry about replacing bulbs again. The backup battery is a single rechargeable AA battery that is 700 mAh. It's made in China.",
