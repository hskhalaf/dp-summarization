My skin always looks great with the exception of when Winter comes. The bitter cold makes my face red, peeling, flakey and dry. It looks awful! I have used every serum and moisturizer known to man to fix my skin and nothing has worked until I got my Clarins Santal Face Oil yesterday. My face is already looking and feeling better. What a fabulous product. Thank you Clarins and thank you AMZN!\u00b0",

I ordered the Santa, Lotus and Blue Orchid formulas to try each of them. For me, the Blue Orchid scent is much better, so I will use that one in the future. But apart from the scent, this oil is very, very good.",
