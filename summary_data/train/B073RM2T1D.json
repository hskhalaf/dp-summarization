Also, the plastic on shelving and drawers is a little thin and I can see it breaking without too much effort. No kids here though, thank goodness. Lots of bells and whistles operated by computer chips so god help us when something goes wrong, in the future. Sure is nice to have right now though.",

I already removed all the food and the installers moved the old fridge out and brought the new one in. I had no choice but to keep it they said that it was the same as on the order sheet. Which was true. It just didn't match the picture! I have little choice on what size refrigerator I can install in my space and it was a \"good\" deal so I guess I'm keeping it. It runs good and quiet just want to warn others be-careful buying site unseen.",
