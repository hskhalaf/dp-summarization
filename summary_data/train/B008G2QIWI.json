The right side does not appear notched to hold this small piece of metal in place. Therefore the product is useless to us currently. I believe the replacement for this part is selling for around $5 online. This lapse in quality is beyond my comprehension on a child's toy that should otherwise be durable.",

Unfortunately, in April our daughter caught it with the side of her car while backing out of the carport. Broke the handlebar and bent the axel. Of course I couldn't fix it, so I'm ordering another. Our little boy pushes it to the top of our slightly inclined driveway, hops on, holds his feet up, and away he goes! It doesn't turn over easily while turning curves like his old little 3 wheel did. Low to the ground and can take the curves better, but will still turn over. Great 3 wheel trike though!",
