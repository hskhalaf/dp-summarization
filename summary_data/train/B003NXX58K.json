Great for smoothing rough skin! But the nail files leave edges on your fingernails feeling like they were made of glass, with the smoothest, cleanest edge! She said she loves feeling the tips and revelling in how smooth they are, and I agree. I love the feel of my nail tips these days! But the price, which my friend doesn't know, is the best! Many other Czech glass files have poor finishes on them, that wear down quickly. These last! Great purchase!",

I think I will get the least use out of that one. The largest file is also significantly thicker than the other 2. I will keep the small file in my purse and use the medium for everyday. I've already noticed that these files do not leave rough edges like other emery boards I have used. Major plus!",

The coating is now coming off and they no longer file my nails down.",

They are also used by many celebrities. Set includes 1-small (3 1/2 inch), 1-medium (5 1/2 inch) for manicures, and 1-large (7 1/2 inch) file for cracked heels and calluses. If you should drop your file on a hard surface, it is designed to break in a blunt fashion. Other types of files that have not been through the tempering and hardening process can splinter and cause injury. The grit on the small and medium file is approximately 200-220 grit and on the large file is approximately 180 grit. Please note, the \"grit\" is etched into the crystal glass. The cheap imitations have grit bonded onto the surface of the file and wear down quickly. These are the best ones made! You get what you pay for!
