I\u2019m very much surprised that it\u2019s not the standard. I love that it is secure and latch it to my carryon when traveling with my kid. There is no research to prove it is safer for your kid vs a non-latching booster seat, BUT it DOES 100% prevent it from being a projectile in your car if you were to get in an accident.",

It's lightweight and easy to position, with a shoulder clip to adjust the car seatbelt if the position is too high. The optional clips attach to anchors in the car seat and are easy to engage and disengage in most cars. The only thing that would make it better would some type of built-in strap or handle for carrying, but it is possible to attach a third party strap to the anchor clips if you want to.",

      "text": "It's time for our 4.5 year old to upgrade from the big bulky car seat/booster combo to an easier-to-use booster. He has become more independent, and insistent on buckling/unbuckling himself, and the 5-point harness on the old booster was becoming too uncomfortable and difficult for him to latch. With this booster seat, It is now easy for him to buckle and unbuckle himself (which is nice, considering we have baby #3 on the way). It comes with a strap to position the shoulder strap, but honestly it's not really needed unless your child is in the middle seat of the third row of your van. Otherwise, the shoulder strap from your vehicle should come across your child's shoulder just fine.",

      "title": "Why this is the better unit",
      "text": "I looked at a LOT of booster seats and glad I chose this one. #1 reason is the LATCH pull system to ensure it's secure. The cupholder is the right size and the pull out tray is useful. Very light yet sturdy and quality product. Arm rests are in the right position. Very well designed and great value. Again, the key to this unit is the LATCH pull system. I also like the seat belt adjustment ring. It slides onto the shoulder seat belt of the child and pulls it down to the correct height for safety vs. putting it behind them and not having one or being too high on their neck / face.",

The one hand front adjuster for the LATCH system is wonderful, and the positioner actually makes this even better than his old seat, He's at a size (~64 lbs, 4 ft flat) when the shoulder strap just doesn't quite sit right on him, and the shoulder belt positioner makes sure he's snugly belted in on all points.",

You can loosen the straps with a push of a button and tighten them with one hand. All the other car seats we have had require a lot of fiddling around (sometimes with your hands squeezed under or behind the child seat) to adjust the LATCH straps. This is way better. Plus the fabric cover comes off so it's easy to clean.",

However, make sure you measure your backseats if you have a midsize sedan and especially if you plan to install 3 boosters. It can be very frustrating latching to seatbelt locks. However, I learned if you do not install the plastic cup holders it will allow more wiggle room for 3 boosters to fix in your \ud83d\ude98 (Camery, Passat, Altima etc size sedans)",

      "text": "I have been searching for seatbelt adjusters as my 6 yr old is too big for high back boosters. If I take the back off her old booster she was not high enough for the regular seatbelt to fit correctly and safely in her shoulder. I have noticed that many reviewers never even mention that this booster seat comes with an adjuster. GENIUS!!! Now she is really a big girl with the seatbelt sitting securely on her shoulder. She loves the cushion on the seat. She says is so soft! Great seat!",
