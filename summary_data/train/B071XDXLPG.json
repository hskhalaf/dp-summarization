Like has been posted elsewhere, I began to see artifacting on the device, leading to a total inability to boot the laptop. It's now on RMA #2 with Asus, and I am waiting on a proper fix. I'm not feeling terribly confident that they'll get me sorted. It's a sad state of affairs for such a costly piece of equipment.",

I used to have a 17 inch thin gaming laptop for VR development and gaming but it was too big for a lot of bags and not good for airplane travel. This newer small form factor is great. The keyboard being all the way up the edge is not the best design but I understand why they had to do it. Hopefully next generation laptops will have the keyboard at a more ergonomic spot. Also the trackpad buttons are great because they are actual easy to click buttons. However I do sometimes press the arrow key instead of the left mouse button since it is right next to it.",
