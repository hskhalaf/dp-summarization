Because it's \"reach-in\" the cold air doesn't fall out. She loves it, and I'm very satisfied with the purchase.",

It's decently well insulated on its own but you can feel how cold it is to the touch so I know there's a lot of room for improvement. It runs very quietly and I like that it has precise temperature controls as well as the ability to put it in a more efficient mode which further reduces fan and compressor noise. While in the insulated case, it barely uses any electricity at all and holds it's temperature fairly effectively.",

Am really liking my fridge so far. Worth every penny to finally have cold water Eggs and bacon again. Edit: it broke and had to be returned, stopped regulating temperature correctly.",

It cooled from room temperature (75*F) to 38*F in just a few minutes and it's very quiet. I really like the design, inside and out, and the digital readout that shows the current temperature inside the unit. Well worth the money.",

It will run on the two marine batteries for about 60 hours and will shut off before damaging them. I am extremely pleased with this product so far. I have only used it for a couple of months but so far works very well",

Sometimes the wires come loose on the circuitry through shipping so try and reconnect them before having to return this item for a new one.. I want to velcro a cutting board to the top of this thing for added functionality.",

This unit gets cold enough (-3 to -8) to keep my home cooked meals frozen. It dose take up a fair amount of space, but I wanted the storage capacity of the larger unit. I love how it automatically draws from either the AC or DC power depending on what I feed it. Overall I'm very happy with my investment.",

Since I bought it as a dented/open box and I've modified the fridge (cut the 12v plug and hard wired it) I don't expect it to be warrantied and I don't mind seeing how much it's going to cost to fix. However, I've been trying to get Whynter's customer service to give me a location for repair for 2 days and they've been nothing short of terrible for responding after the initial \"trouble shooting\" email. Great timing since I have a 5 day trip coming up in 2 weeks.",
