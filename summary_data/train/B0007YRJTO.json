I love the product, but I can't afford to replace it for $100, every couple of years. The warranty is only for one year, therefore the cost is on the owner's shoulders. Richard",

Looks and feels as sturdy with changes mainly in fasteners and base design. I just attach the two bottom ends to anchors at the end of the driveway, net sloping away toward the back. But for more active use and safety as designed choose the type of anchor to suit the environment. Perfect for ball return and keeping them from rolling into the neighbors; just don't run into it or fight for rebounds if you use it as pictured sloping forward.",
