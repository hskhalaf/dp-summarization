      "text": "Love this gun. We live in a condo, so a regular full size smoker isnt an option. However, having used this gun, it is surprising how strong of a smoked taste can be infused in just a few minutes! My advice is to just go a few minutes the first couple of times. It only takes a small pinch of wood chips. Be sure to get the wood shavings type made for these type of smokers. We ordered a three cup pack of different flavored chips when we ordered this item. That will be enough for years!",
