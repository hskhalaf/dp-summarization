      "text": "I wanted to get a set of stainless steel pots to be more cautious about what chemicals I ingest in my body (stay away from teflon). I learned that stainless steel grade 18/8 and 18/10 have an acceptable balance of nickel and chromium (which leeched in high doses overtime is bad for you). However, when my pots arrived there is no label on them or notice in the instructions or box that says they are 18/10 or 18/8 quality. Its disappointing since I am specifically getting this to be more health conscious but have no guarantee of their quality. If you're buying these for the same reason I suggest you look at other options.",
