It is nice you can pin exactly what apps you want to the start menu (and can get the rest of the apps on another screen if you need them. The camera is a little cumbersome in its use (I am still not comfortable using it), but the photos are good. It is an unlocked phone, but there are many apps that can only be used with AT&T. Not a problems for me because most of these apps cost additional money and I would not use them anyway. Good phone for the money.",

My wife keeps up to date with her Facebook contacts and we always know the weather. There are many other apps but we don't really use many of them. As a phone it works great and as a internet hot spot it serves us well. We have the new 10G plan and we tether our computers for internet access. As RVing volunteers we travel most of the country. ATT is available in most of the areas we work, many being remotely located. The ATT plan and the HTC phone is a great combination.",

I gave it to my teenage sister and I'm not worried about it breaking if she drops it or does God knows what else with it. In my experience it never lags even though it only cost $175. Was able to update it to Windows phone 8.1 by signing up as a developer (don't actually plan to develop anything... I just wanted to get the swipe keyboard and the voice recognition software updates... It's free) which I highly recommend if only for the much improved keyboard. Overall I highly recommend this as a decent sub-$200 phone.",
