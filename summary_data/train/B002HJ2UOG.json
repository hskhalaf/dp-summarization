      "text": "Needed a very comfortable sandal for doing Disney for 10 days when our daughter comes down this summer. Tried them out at Bush Gardens. They are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. I do wish the stitching around the perimeter wasn't there, but even with that they are still more comfortable than other Clark's sandals I have. Would like to get them in another color, but they want $30.00 more for the white and not eligible for Prime free 2 day shipping. I am going to wait and hope they come down in price or are offered by another seller. Different colors from different sellers can vary quite a bit in price. Still very comfortable!",

      "text": "Clarks shoes is awesome, great, comfortable, I bought these sandals in black before a recent trip to France and wore it constantly. Its very nice looking to wear with summer clothes/styles and incredibly comfortable. The strap allows for size adjustment which helps if your feet swell, and they are lightweight and a bit squishable, which makes them easy to pack. The best thing however is the thick sole. In France I found myself walking endlessly on pebbled pavements, cobbled streets, and walkways of sand. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!",

The only thing I don't like is the raised stitching that runs the perimeter of the foot pad about a half inch from the edge of the shoe. I wish the surface under my foot was totally smooth. Also I've gotten mine wet a few times and the edges of the velcro tabs are curling up a bit. But I'm still rating 5 stars because of comfort and support!",

All the straps would be better if shortened, as they hang so far off the side when tightened all the way. Too bad they don't come in Narrow. I can't imagine anyone's foot being wide enough for the Wide. I considered going down a 1/2 size but they are barely long enough as it is. Verdict: I'll have the strap shortened because the exceptional comfort makes them worth it.",

They have just enough arch support, are stylish, stable, light weight and all around adjustable with velcro closures. Three things would make these shoes perfect: 1. sueded soles 2. lower price 3. broader availability of colors in 11W, especially in the dressier black snake version without the weird white stitching I came back to order more and was disappointed again, in the limited selection of available colors.",

No awareness of something digging in, or your heels starting to hurt, or the balls of your feet starting burn. This can wreck your day.
