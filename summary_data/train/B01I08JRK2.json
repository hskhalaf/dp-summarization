It is important to add it to hot coffee (or add the hot coffee to the cup with the tablespoon of cacao in the bottom) or it won't mix. Originally I rated it with 4 stars because I have trouble getting the lid on and off. But I figured out that if you twist it on and off, the lid is easy to take on and off. So I have updated this to be 5 stars.",
