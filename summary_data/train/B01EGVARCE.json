I always add an additional orthotic to all my shoes. Low tops are generally too shallow making the top edge of the shoe ride high on my heel when adding an orthotic. These fit perfectly on my heel with the orthotic insert. Very sturdy shoes which is what I prefer over a fabric mesh type shoe. For these reasons Puma in now my go to brand for athletic footwear.",
