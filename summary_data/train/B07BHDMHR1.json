Battery lasts more than 24 hours on a charge with average use for calls, SMS, emails and some web browsing. About 14 hours if you use navigation, music and videos. The phone is a lot of fun to use. Weaknesses: The phone contains a lot of bloatware that cannot be used or removed. For example, Huawei cloud is not available at my location (US) but the phone keeps asking me to enter login credentials for it. My unit came with a British plug. Since the USB cable can be removed this is not a problem.",

And the internet data connection both wifi and 3G get disconnected when kept idle for some time. Due to that WhatsApp calls do not get connected when others call. Dual SIM card.

The other problem is that the phone itself goes to sleep - there is no option to extend the \"awake\" time to more than 10 minutes! Once the camera app goes to sleep - then, depending on the phone settings, the phone will go to sleep and require button presses and passwords etc to wake it up.",
