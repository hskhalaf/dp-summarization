The hook is not too thin so that it cuts into your purse handles. It is very sturdy and works like a charm. I love it and highly recommend it. Feel free to ask me any questions whatsoever.",

It's a wide hook, so if you're hanging something with a thicker strap, there seems to be less of a chance of it falling off.

As others of stated, it does stick out from the back seat of my 2018 Honda CRV, but it is not a problem to me. I used the other hook in the front of the passenger seat, and it is very useful. I put my lunch cooler on it as well as my purse, and I no longer have to reach to get them off the floor and their contents when I apply my brakes. I highly recommend these!",
