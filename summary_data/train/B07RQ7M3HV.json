Drain almost immediately, lightweight, and have super sticky grip. When walking on grass or flat ground, still comfortable as I can't even feel the giant grippy lugs on the bottom. Smooth run.

I am able to get through muddy terrain much quicker than most people on the course and they do just as well on other terrain. I wash them in the washing machine after each race weekend and they have still held up. I tried the new RD shoes from Spartan because they were so hyped up but they were terrible. Slipped around everywhere and could feel almost everything against my feet because the sides are so thin. I am definitely sticking with Inov8!",

      "text": "Love the sole. It looks super useful for muddy trails! The length is perfect for a men's size 15. However the width appears to be that of a 10. Inov-8, bigger size doesn't mean only longer, it has to be wider as well. Give it a try and maybe you'll be able to sell more of the bigger sizes, reduce the number of returns, or both. Also an extra inch too much wouldn't bug a narrow 15 person as much as a narrow 10 person since its proportionally less. So there is less danger to err toward a wider shoe.",

These bad boys griped really good. But when I wore them the day after for the Sprint I decided to put foot glide but I guess I missed a spot. Because after the race I ended with two HUGE blisters on my big toe. So order a half or full size up if you can. I also wear compression socks and ankle braces in case your wondering.",

I have a few different trail runners I race in and I'm going to say these have the best grip/traction of them all, no slipping or sliding what's so ever. They do however lack the cushion that some of my other shoes have, but still comfortable for a decent distance. I strongly recommend them.",

    "description": "Inov8 Mudclaw 275 Trail Running Shoes The most agile trail running shoe on the market, designed to propel runners faster than ever before through all soft ground. The MUDCLAW 275 works naturally with the foot, allowing trail runners and obstacle racers to move fast and react even faster to changes in terrain. Inov8 Shoe Fit Scale For technical footwear, a good fit is essential to enhance your performance. Inov8's new Shoe Fit Scale makes it easier to find the perfect fitting shoe. All Inov8 shoes are designed with Met-Cradle technology to lock down the mid-foot for a stable hold, where they differ is in the toe box. The shoes are now graded from 1 to 5, Grade 1 representing their closest, most precise fit and Grade 5 representing the widest fitting toe box. The lower the number on the scale, the narrower the fit, which ensures minimal internal movement of the foot when running fast on technical terrain. Shoes with the higher numbers on the scale will suit athletes with a wider foot and those wanting that extra comfort in the toe box. This wider toe box allows the toes to splay for increased stability when lifting heavy weights. It's also perfect for longer runs and races when toes begin to swell. Inov8 have graded the Mudclaw 275 Trail Running Shoes as Grade 1. Breathable Upper The highly-breathable, non-water absorbing upper keeping you dry at all times. By preventing water from entering the shoe, the upper gives you peace of mind in wet and muddy conditions whilst the breathable upper allows cool air to flow into the shoe, absorbing moisture and keeping you damp free. Overlayer encases the upper providing added durability and a more enhanced fit whilst unique on-the-shoe gaiter hooks offer a more secure attachment system, which allows a race ultra gaiter to be secured directly to the shoe and defend against debris. Additionally, a gusseted tongue prevents debris from entering the shoe whilst also providing ultimate comfort. Exterflow Midsole Infused w",
