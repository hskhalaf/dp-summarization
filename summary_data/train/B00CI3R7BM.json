Also, The camera in this combo feel surprisingly heavy and is not comfortable to hold over a long period of time. The lack of a proper handgrip causes the discomfort, so a shoulder or neck strap are a must. Otherwise great little camera with fast and fairly reliable autofocus! The bundled lens is very sharp and easy to focus manually. The EVF is large, bright and sharp but sits very clumsy on top of the nice camera body",

The camera has a nice look and feel. It is light, but you can get functional lenses that are not that heavy or overbearing. Sometimes manual adjustments are a little buggy getting them to lock in. It may be my inexperience, but in the digital age, it should not take experience to press a button and have it kick in in the change between 1000 and 3200, for example.",

    "description": "Color:Black| Style:Body OnlyDesigned with a modern twist to the original PEN F, fans of the award-winning Olympus PEN family of cameras now have the Olympus E-P5 PEN Mirrorless Digital Camera Body. The flagship PEN body that delivers a portable, premium quality experience. The E-P5 is packed with the latest innovations Olympus technology has to offer including 1/8000s Shutter Speed, 5-Axis Image Stabilization, \"F.A.S.T\" AF Speed, Built-In Wi-Fi capability, 2x2 dial control and more.Advanced Design for a New GenerationThe Olympus PEN E-P5 carries on the essence of the design found in all Olympus PEN cameras and advances its appearance to a new level. Exacting attention is made to materials, form, texture and color. The body is finished to be seamless, none of the screws can be seen on the sides, front or top of the body. Form and operability of dials, levers and buttons are positioned for optimal ease-of-use and comfort.1/8000s Mechanical ShutterThe E-P5 is the worlds first mirrorless camera equipped with a 1/8000 sec. high-speed mechanical shutter which allows you to freeze action without blur. Use prime lenses at their maximum aperture allowing you to capture beautifully defocused background images even in very bright daylight.Precise Flash Sync up to 1/320sSyncing your flash with fast shutter speeds is typically tricky; the flash is just too fast! The E-P5s shutter can sync with the built-in flash at shutter speeds up to 1/320s. This maximum sync speed gives you greater flexibility choosing the correct exposure settings when shooting outdoors in bright of back-lit conditions where fill flash on your subject is desirable.9 FPS Sequential ShootingHigh-speed sequential shooting as fast as 9 fps can be accomplished when using the Tracking AF (C-AF+Tr), which works in tandem with the Autofocus to follow your subject.",
