      "text": "Tent was an amazing birthday gift for my 1 year old. He loves going through the tunnel. We opted to not fill it with balls and just use a small basketball. He is starting to get the hang of it. I also have an 11 and 9 year old who can fit in there (even the tunnel) but I do not recommend that for constant play. They showed him how to crawl through the first time and he loved it. Pops up and goes together easily. Holds up well so far. No rips or tears. We even has a pup run through it before we could catch her. Tons of fun!",

There is an opening for the tunnel in the ballpit but since it does not attach, the balls dont stay in, they just flow out the poorly designed pit. It's extremely flimsy, my 11 month old rolled over in it and as he rolled into the side the entire ballpit turned over dumping the balls out. Avoid this one and find one that isnt so cheaply and poorly put together.",

The artwork is fun, the tent is big, and he absolutely gets a kick out of sitting in there with mom and dad. The downside is, parts of the construction are a little on the weak side. We've had it set up for just a couple days and two of the ties that hold the tunnel onto the ship have already ripped. Granted, our toddler is pretty rough on it, but he's a toddler, so there's not much I can do there. With the ties ripped, balls come out the sides and make a bit of a mess.",

It its not very stable but I have it on the basement floor so it's not staked to the ground. I've noticed the kids will pull the rocket over as they crawl through the tunnel unless I add some weight in the rocket. The only real negative is the tunnel is tied to the rocket and ball pit. These ties do not keep the items tight and tend to come untied. I'm considering add Velcro ties to better attach the three pieces.",

Omg, it\u2019s a nightmare to pick up (I filled it with 800 balls!). I had to create my own system where I plug up his tunnel (which kind of defeats the idea of having a tunnel to crawl through) with 2 really fluffy couch pillows.

      "text": "This rocket ship play tent will be a hit for kids. With a tunnel, ball pit and small basketball hoop, any kid will enjoy the variety in their own home. The colors are eye-catching. This is easy to put up with four detachable rods for the castle part. Disassemble is very easy with taking down the rods, and twisting it all into a flat circle, inserting it all into the enclosed bag. An innovative play place for kids!",

So Grandpa headed out to find them. He bought 400 balls (to the tune of $48) and it filled it maybe 25%. So just know that you are going to need at least 1200-1500 balls, and they are not cheap. That's why I gave it 4 stars.",

For our infant who likes to crawl around and explore, we only use about 150-200 balls, which is just enough to line the floor and still be safe for him.",

Only drawback is that in the rocket ship opening there's nothing really keeping the balls in, so if it's packed the balls will just tumble out on that side.

My only complaint is the material is cheap. It started ripping and tearing in the rocket ship and the ball pit part 3 days after using it. Also the ball pit is extremely hard to fit back into the case so I just leave it out.",
