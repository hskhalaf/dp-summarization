I have 2 Kilspch subwoofers that shake the room. This one is barely audible up front and close. You have to put your hand on the subwoofer to hear a light vibration. But the size is almost as big as my two other Kilpsch SWs. This was for a family room where I could not position any large speakers, it is a very asymmetric room. Yet they are connected to a Samsung 48 in 4K curved TV. We have to make do, I guess.",

      "text": "Hooked it up yesterday. We ran a bunch of wiring through the attic to hide all the wires, should have looked at the product closer before. The subwoofer is actually like a computer too. The speaker wires go from the speaker to the subwoofer, then the woofer has an output to your receiver - this is ok, I just used some quick butt connectors and everything is good to go!.. Great product, as always with Bose.",

Proprietary Bose technology brings lifelike sound to your stereo or home theater components. This 5.1 surround sound system blends easily with your d\u00e9cor, making it an excellent choice for smaller rooms.\n\n\n\nFree from the audible distortion, the Acoustimass module can be placed almost anywhere\n\nInnovative Bose technologies let you hear new details and nuances even in your most-played favorites. The system's five Virtually Invisible cube speakers deliver vivid and lifelike music and movie performance. Just three inches square, these small speakers faithfully reproduce the clarity and natural sound of a live performance.\n\n\n\nDownward-firing drivers deliver the lowest audible notes and effects with clarity and balance\n\nSystem setup is also clear--and clean--with the SL2 wireless surround link (sold separately). This optional accessory eliminates the need to run wires to rear speakers from the front of your room.\n\nTHE POWER OF ACOUSTIMASS TECHNOLOGY\nThe innovation driving this 5.1 speaker system is the powered Acoustimass module. Free from the audible distortion that can betray its location, the Acoustimass module can be placed almost anywhere--behind furniture or drapes, for example--and the rich, broad spectrum of music and movie sound appears to come from the small cube speakers.\n\nThe powered Acoustimass module adds drama to music and movies. Downward-firing drivers and proprietary technology deliver the lowest audible notes and effects with clarity and balance. Acoustimass speaker technology enables powerful low-frequency effects. Place the module almost anywhere in your room and all the sound appears to come from the cube speakers.\n\nThe Virtually Invisible cube speakers--each only 3\" high--deliver high-fidelity sound for music and movies. Enjoy premium performance from speakers so small you can place them nearly anywhere and they seem to disappear into your d\u00e9cor. And automatic protection circuitry prevents the drivers from being overdriven to provide increased reliability while minimizing interference with the listening experience, giving you a long life of high performance.",
