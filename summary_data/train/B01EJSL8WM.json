      "verdict": "Climbers who wish to boost their performance while bouldering might want to give the Butora Acro a try. Indeed, this superbly comfortable climbing shoe is well equipped for such a pursuit. That said, this amazingly grippy footgear also excels in both heel- and toe-hooking scenarios.The only thing that gives this purchase-worthy product a bad name, however, is its allegedly too-spacious heel region. Nonetheless, the Acro is yet another Butora masterpiece whose strengths far outweigh a couple of missteps.",
      "pros": [
        "The Butora Acro blue and orange (narrow and wide variants, respectively) are extremely comfortable, as mentioned by almost every buyer",
        "Many of those who have put the shoe through the wringer say that its outsole is remarkably sticky",
        "Its hooking abilities (whether heel or toe) are nothing short of spectacular, according to several reviewers",
        "A good number of people who have purchased this Butora rock climbing footgear swear by the shoe\u2019s exemplary bouldering prowess",
        "Some owners who have bought the Acro find it a nice piece of investment",
        "This Butora offering does well on overhangs, based on a couple of reports"

      "cons": [
        "Several wearers claim that the heel zone of this product is too roomy",
        "Less than a handful of shoppers complain about the Acro\u2019s rubber wearing out in just a few months",
        "Its sensitivity could be a bit better, claims a moderately experienced sender"

      "text": "I have wide feet and having a hard time finding a climbing shoe that fits wide feet but this shoe is a horrible choice. It is narrower than my Scarpa Vapor V and Scarpa Force V and horribly uncomfortable. 99% of the shoe is hard rubber including the heel cup it's like putting your foot inside of a tire comfort wise. The heel digs into the Achilles area because the rubber is so hard. I was only able to wear the shoe for about 10 seconds and couldn't even stand up in them they were so uncomfortable. If you are looking for a wide climbing shoe or one that is reasonably comfortable keep looking.",

      "text": "Wow! This shoe is not only the most comfortable aggressive climbing shoe I've worn but the most comfortable climbing shoe, PERIOD. The wide version is AMAZING for my wide but low volume feet. The liner is super comfortable and even with curled toes I haven't had the irritation problems most other climbing shoes give me. The shoe locks into place and has a great combination of stiffness and sensitivity for both bouldering and sport use. Very comparable to a Sportiva Katana, another great all around shoe, but far more comfortable and a MUCH better fit for wide feet.",

      "text": "These shoes are amazing. From a performance point of view, these are great. Espcially for overhangs and bouldering. For routes that require edging on small holds I still prefer my Miuras. Their huge benefit though, is that they are one of the only shoes In the market that offer a narrow fit. I am sized 42 with running shoes and with La Sportiva Solution I used to go down to size 38, which is insanely painful. With these however, I can go with 41.5. La Sportiva shoes, while great, fit better for wider feet (even their women models).",

It has a cool look to it and it did the job on this last outdoor rock climbing hike I did. Definitely recommend it",

As for the shoe they feel good and most likely fit better in time. I can't wait to try them out at my local gym TRG. I'll update my review later. But if your looking to buy I can only comment and compare theses Butoras to my Evolv Rastas. Update 2-21-17 so far these shoes are comparable to my Evolvs as far as performance but are not as wide as the Evolvs so they feel a little tight, I'll keep wearing them to break them in more.",
