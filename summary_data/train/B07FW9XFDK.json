They fit more like slippers than shoes, in that the elastic closure is not very tight, making it easy to get in and out but providing a relatively loose fit",

Since the size options are for men, to find women's size, check your European size on women's size chart first. Then find it on men's size chart. For example, my size, US 6.5, is Europe size 37.5 on women's size. Europe size 37.5 is US men's size 5. I love these black shoes, but if the holes are black that would be perfect.
