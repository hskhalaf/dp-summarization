Boy am I glad I did, the heat for some reason made the texture feel ever so slightly bumpy but after I aired it out and 'fluffed' it up, it feels fantastic! I would recommend trying it out for at least a week in case you think at first its bad.",

Thought I would give this one a try after researching for months. This one is perfect it\u2019s fluffy, warm but not too hot or heavy. It\u2019s light weight and I love how crisp it is. I of course use a duvet cover too to preserve it and for looks. I love how the feathers don\u2019t shed or shift. Worth every penny. I hope it holds up as it has for a long time. Great purchase and more affordable than $500 from bed bath and beyond.",

So over all for the price its a good blanket but the feathers leaking not so much! I would not buy again just due to the fact the feathers constantly leak. currently looking for this blankets replacement, my reason for the the review.",

This one is perfect for Northern California, that it is warm but not so thick as to be too warm. Might be a little thin for sub-zero, but it sufficient down to the 30's. The cover has a soft, smooth surface, like sateen and has good baffling to keep the down from drifting, which is also important, like brakes on a car. It also has discreet corner loops for duvet covers and is priced, in my opinion below its value.",
