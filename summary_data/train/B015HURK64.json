      "title": "If You Want An Accurate Tire Pressure Gauge- Here It Is!",
      "text": "I decided to splurge and finally get myself a professional tire pressure gauge since we acquired a 2018 Honda Sport 2.0 with a really finicky tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS). If you're off by 2 lbs of pressure the thing goes off. The JACO ElitePro Pressure is great. The cord allows you to get a good reading without crawling around on your hands and knee in the snow. Since it holds the pressure reading until you manually release it you don't have to wonder if you read it right each time you use it.",

It's easy to read how many pounds of pressure is in the tire. My car warns if tire pressure is low but doesn't give the current pressure so I'll know if it's safe to proceed. I'm not sure if it's 100% accurate, maybe a pound or so difference from the tire store. It's close enough for me. The only possible negative is that it's larger than the pen-style pressure gauges but so worth the extra space it takes up.",
