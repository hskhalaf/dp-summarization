Naturally, bingo was a game mentioned and I had went from store to store trying to find a game adequate enough for a large group. Finally I realized I would have to go on-line. When I saw this, the description was what I was looking for, and since I had an Amazon gift card, I purchased it. My church sisters loved it!!! The colored cards and large print numbers were perfect for the elder sisters and the quantity of cards allowed for many to have at least 2-3. I'm so glad it bought this!",
