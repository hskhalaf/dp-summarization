I'm 74 and was never a fan of my smart phone, I found it difficult to use as a phone as I had to keep my hands off the touch screen, otherwise it would end or change the function. I swapped the sim card over and it was live straight away. I am finding it difficult however to get the internet connected. I've looked on the Vodafone website, but their instructions for the 3310 2017 model vary from mine.",
