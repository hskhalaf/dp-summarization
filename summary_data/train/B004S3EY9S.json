The packaged app for Windows use is okay, but after trying it, I decided that I prefer the standard Windows camera interface (Windows 8.1 in my case, but probably works with older versions). This is basically a low-quality USB web cam with a magnifying glass and 4 LEDs attached to it. A nice kid's toy, but should be updated with higher quality image processing (how about at least 4 megapixel?).",

      "text": "After unsuccessfully trying to download the Zoomy software onto our Mac, we decided to try to use our Chrome notebook (which is my 7 yo son's designated computer anyway). Instead of downloading Zoomy-specific software, we used the WebCam toy from the Chrome webstore ([...]), and it worked great! You can even share the image on various social networks. Unfortunately, with this particular software, you can't take movies, but perhaps other software would have that capability. Aside from that, the microscope is awesome--fun, good resolution and super kid-friendly. I teach Biology, and I'm definitely going to bring this to my class. I could even hook it into the digital projector. Highly recommended. We're having so much fun!",
