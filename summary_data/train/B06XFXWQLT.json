I have friends who have different prints and theirs seem like better quality. I was honestly concerned I ordered a knock-off since I ordered on Amazon. I paid more for this because of the great reputation. I wouldn\u2019t recommend buying this - use an old t-shirt (it will hold up better) and save $40.",
