Btw, I have an hour glass figure, 5'7, 185lbs, small top, wide bottom. Usually wears medium tops and 12-14 jeans. (Hope that helps). The material is silky and seems sturdy with good stitching.

I tried to return, but shipping would be about half of what I paid for the item so it isn't worth it. I would definitely beware of this particular color at least, because everyone else photos look great :(",

      "text": "I have an \"hourglass\" figure - meaning I have a proportionate bust and hips with a smaller waist. I wear XL in both tops and pants (leaning towards L, depending on the brand) and the XL fits perfectly. It's the right height for the high-waist fit on me. I could see it being too short for those with a longer torso. If you're a different size for top and bottom, I recommend buying separate pieces over a set. I'm super impressed with the quality. It feels more luxurious than any suit I've gotten from Target or Modcloth. I highly recommend!",
