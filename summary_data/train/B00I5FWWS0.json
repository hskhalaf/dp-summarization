Peet's brand- dark roast are are my second favorite, as they taste like the Seattle's Best coffee that I purchase in 2# bags at Sam's Club. I tried Gevalia's medium roast K-cups, and they didn't taste half as good as Caribou Mahogany! No comparison- these are the absolute BEST BEST ones you can buy.

It's warming and full-bodied, and is a pleasure to drink at any time of day. If you're also a picky coffee drinker, I recommend giving this one a taste.",

For taste, I think the Caribou Mahogany is a little darker/stronger than the Pike's but not as punchy as Sumatran beans from various brands. I really don't like Dunkin coffee and the Starbucks Blonde Roast because they're way too weak for me.",

I initially thought my keurig needed to be replaced so I even bought a new one and was still experiencing the same problem. Morning after morning I would put the k-cup in and i'd get a cup full of coffee grinds until one day I realized that the cups causing this were the deflated ones!",

I feel like these cups do not make smooth coffee - I would describe the flavor as somewhat soapy. I even washed out and wiped out multiple mugs and cups to make sure it was the coffee taste. This would likely be remedied by cream/sugar, but I drink my coffee black. Probably won't order again.",

By the time I'm ready for breakfast, I move to dark roast, Peet's Major Dickinson or Starbucks French Roast, both of which are a hardy drink but lighter on caffeine.",

Once in a while I also make a cup of La Colombe's Corsica coffee using a k-cup adaptor. The boys at La Colombe would probably consider this brewing method sacrilegious but it still produces a damned fine cup of strong coffee.",
