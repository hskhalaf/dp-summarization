I rarely shave my legs, so when I do I have to go over and over the same area. So I read reviews on all the newfangled razors and chose Schick intuition for sensitive skin. I don\u2019t want to smell like some bizarre fragrance. Love this razor! No shave cream needed and it cut my hair close with the first swipe. No smelly scent and my skin was moisturized. Now if I could figure out Instagram, I\u2019d really be a modern woman!!",
