The sham is incomplete. I am revising my earlier review. CUSTOMER SERVICE is SUPER. Bedsure offered to send a replacement for the incomplete shams I originally received. They didn't have to, but they did. The replacement is just as soft and pretty as the original except both shams are the same. Thank you, Bedsure!!",
