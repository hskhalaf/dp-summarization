The only advise I can give is try to center the swiveling plates on the board you are going to remove, and do the outside boards first and then the center.",

After a year of frustration and water time I broke down and bought this tool. I broke down five pallets yesterday afternoon in about the same amount it would take to break down one. The only boards that broke were already split or in bad shape anyway. It's solid and has a nice weight but I broke down five pallets without wearing myself out. The only complaint I have is that I didn't order this a year ago.",

It is only 50% successful at loosening even the weakest of pallets but only boards towards the center where you can get leverage by standing on the pallet and slightly more successful lifting the middle sections of those boards (ends are a problem where only one side of the pallet buster will contact). I\u2019ve tried other pallet busters and they work better. This ones angles seem to be off and make it really hard to leverage boards. This one is only useful inly if lighting the middle sections and cutting the boards off at the ends/sides.",

Granted some of the pallets already had broken slats, if you are careful and use the tool as shown in the videos you will get plenty of usable wood out of a pallet.

Pros: high percentage of saved boards, much easier then large crowbars, way better control of nails when used in demolition.

That said, the only place this tool has fallen short, is if the boards are spaced really close together, and even then, I only have to pop one board off by hand, and the rest is a piece of cake. The \"feet\" being able to pivot provides solid pressure across the entire board, minimizing splits. If your goal is reclaiming pallet wood, look no further, as this STURDY, and well designed tool is the best that I have come across.",
