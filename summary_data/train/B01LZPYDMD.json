The sides are constructed with multiple layers of mesh that are layered so as to keep the contents of the bag concealed!!! It doesn\u2019t seem to interfere with air flow or prevent any drying. The exterior upper pocket is large enough to store all those extras that you might not want to get wet. Seem to actually be water proof!!! I was able to store my post dive hoodie in it during a rain shower and had a perfectly dry hoodie to put on after my dive. Great construction, super convenient, and at a really great price!!!",

Dive gear is very expensive, so we all want to transport it safely from the car to boat. I am extremely happy with this bag. I have used it on several dives now and holds my entire kit. You can either carry like a duffel bag, or backpack. Very nice waterproof end pocket that holds more than it looks like it would, and the zipper is heavy duty. I would purchase again or recommend to a friend.",
