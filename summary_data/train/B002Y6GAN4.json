They get stuck and wiggle around until they die of fear or starvation.

There are some super tiny scorpions in there along with a few spiders. If I smash a cricket, I put it into a setup trap to lure more in. The crickets don't seem to be able to chirp after they wander in. They fold easily and this year the paper comes off easier. I will be back next year for the on-slot next year.",
