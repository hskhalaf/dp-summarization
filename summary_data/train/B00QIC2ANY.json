      "text": "This beauty arrived yesterday. I noticed many reviews mentioned the buttons - either that they were fabric or that they came off. Mine are metal and they seem to be sewn on securely. If they come off, I'll just stitch back on. This pack seems to be well made. It has LOTS of good padding and the inside polka dot lining is adorable. I was looking for something strong and protective, yet feminine and this seems to fit the bill. The external fabric has a nice look/feel, the zippers seem strong and there are pockets-o-plenty! I will update the review if something changes, but I cannot wait to use it! PS - The cobalt blue color is perfect!",

She didn't even ask for a new backpack this year, and it still looks great. She will probably use it next year too. None of the other backpack companies had something that lasted 2 years. Worth the price. My only negative - this is a smaller size, so, it doesn't hold everything if you like to be prepared when going out for a long day, this might not do it for you. Your back will thank you, though.",

It has a million and one compartments which really help to keep me organised. I could go on and on but will sum up this bag by saying that 'they really thought of everything'.",

This issue with it is how close together the straps are. They pressed right down on the most painful part of my neck, and I couldn't handle having this on for more than a few minutes at a time, and walking just wasn't working for me. It is adorable, and the inside is great! Tons of storage, great compartments, and tons of storage and organization. I just wish the straps were better placed.",

      "text": "Nice backpack, chevron inside is neat. 4 stars because there's not much padding in the straps making uncomfortable to carry. Walking through the airport I had to take off several times because the straps were hurting my shoulders. Overall, I like the style and functionality of the backpack.",

      "text": "I really love this laptop! Every zipper compartment is double zippered which is great. There are lots of small pockets inside the first one to hold pens, pencils, calculators, cards, etc. The laptop sleeve is padded, sturdy and large enough for my 17 inch laptop. One of the big things I was worried about before I ordered was that it would look bulky. I really didn't want a laptop backpack that LOOKED like a laptop backpack, so if you are looking for something similar, this is perfect for you. Even with my laptop in, I can fit three 1in binders and my charging cords, ipad, pens, pencils, a calculator and a water bottle. Awesome, awesome backpack",
