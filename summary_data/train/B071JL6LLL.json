This has all the settings you need for pedals and amps. Have an old cap and the value or number is worn off? No problem. Set it for capacitance and read get the value. Then mark it on the cap for later reference. The extra adapter for checking FET values and operation is a real bonus. I would recommend this meter.",

Measuring 120 VAC, if the voltage is not present, the meter will display digits that have no bearing on the measurement. The meter for example will display 540 VAC when the 120 VAC is not present. There is no way the circuit would have that voltage. Most meters I have used will show zero or the correct voltage. The meter is also slow to display the reading when the reading is correct. Personally I would find another meter.",

The one thing I wish it had is an ohms symbol on the dial that had multiple options such as rx1,rx10 rx100, etc. If the auto ohms scale proves accurate I will use that and it will actually be easier. Overall a fine meter for the price so far.",

Two minor wishes for a future version: - It would be great if there was a way to disable the Auto Power Off beep.
