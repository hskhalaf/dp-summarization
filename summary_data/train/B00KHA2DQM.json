I've downloaded several games from play store and all seem to be working well, with no stuttering (mostly flight sims) fast, responsive. nice screen resolution. cons: extremely poor battery life. 3-4 hours and must be recharged. even in idle, it dies overnight. I have a 1st generation ipad which STILL gets through an entire day on its battery after 5 years. Samsung is known for their weak batteries, but c'mon guys, you've had years to figure this out. Silly bloatware. spent an hour turning off/uninstalling unnecessary samsung crap. Still did not help the battery life, though.",

Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the microSD card slot doesn't snap the card secure in place; I have to hold it in with finger pressure until I'm done with whatever I'm doing to transfer files for storage or installation. Not a big enough deal for me to return it, especially since the USB cable can be used to do these operations from the computer. If I was in need of having an SD card affixed in the device for any length of time then I would want it repaired under warranty or replaced.",

I can only hope he didn't lose his job. It works like new. Probably saved me over $200. I wrote a glowing review for the tech (sparing details that could be dangerous for him) but never heard back from his boss.",

I have updated it up to the current android version (Marshmallow?) and it does not seem to slow down.

My primary usage for this tablet is reading books from the kindle app, and watching Korean Dramas from time to time. So all in all if it still runs, I am going to keep using this tablet until it breaks down (hopefully not to soon!!)",

You have to swipe at the right speed/direction to get it to trigger. You have about 5 tries to get it right, then it looks you out for 30 seconds, this happens enough that it can be annoying. Its nice that this includes an micro-SD card slot, as the storage quickly fills up. I would buy again.",

Cons: Battery is not great, its very important to use the battery Power save mode and adjust the screen brightness to auto (many people might find auto display mode quite anoying).

The Galaxy Tab S certainly lives up to all the advertising superlatives with it's superb screen resolution and snappy task execution. It does however have some minor irksome irritations, firstly, in my opinion it is shipped with far too many pre-loaded apps of which many cannot be uninstalled. Secondly, as a first time smartphone/tablet user I found the Samsung \"TouchWiz\" app interface very cumbersome so I loaded the \"Nova\" alternative which I find a lot more intuitive. I highly recommend this digital marvel.",

It sometimes feels a little slow to wake up and present the unlock screen. But once it's unlocked it behaves perfectly. I thought I would be annoyed by TouchWiz but it's actually pretty good. I would like to be rid of some of the bloatware, but buying from any major brand has this downside. The package arrived quickly and in perfect condition as you would expect.",
