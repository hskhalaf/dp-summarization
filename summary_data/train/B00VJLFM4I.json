This is a simple feature that Kavalan should add at the manufacturing stage. Bonus Feature: This also makes for a great breakfast in bed tray too!",

I am working from home temporarily and needed a quick and cheaper alternative to a desk. I can use this on my kitchen counter as a stand up desk or on my couch as a makeshift table. Very useful.
