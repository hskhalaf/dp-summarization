It comes with a usb cord and just plug into your digital recorder and ready to go! It records and plays back my tv programs perfectly. I do recommend this.",

      "text": "This is a great product. The reasons that I bought another unit from Silicon Power are: 1. Bought their 1 TB version a couple of years ago and it works flawlessly - ran out of room. 2. Bought the 2 TB version this time in hopes of saving more stuph (photographs; RAW and processed mainly). 3. A primary caveat for me is that it's power by the USB cable - no external power needed which makes this perfect for traveling and backups for the \"just in case\". 4. It's reasonably priced too. Would definitely buy this product again and from this company. Excellent.",
