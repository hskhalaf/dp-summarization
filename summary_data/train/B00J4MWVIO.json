      "title": "ARIAT NEVER DISAPPOINTS!!",
      "text": "Ariat is my favorite boot Brand as - never has a boot fit so well with instant comfort and no down time to \"break in\" the boot. I thought about this purchase for 5 or 6 days before buying because I am not a cowgirl nor do I even ride horses. but - they were so tastefully done. Color is right. Fringe is placed just right and well Ariat produces the most comfortable boots in the world. So ...they arrived today and I LOVE THEM!!!! I think they are in the category that merits a \"work of art\". Very comfortable - VERY stylish with attitude. What could be better!!",

      "text": "Super Cute and comfortable! I ordered these 1/2 size up based on reviews but I do normally order boots big for socks. I think these will be fine even if my heel lifts a little while walking. I think if I wore these barefoot they would be fine. Shaft is plenty wide for my thickish calves. Update, if I had to do again I would have ordered my actual size and not gone up 1/2. They did stretch a bit after wearing.",

      "text": "The fit of the boot is excellent. I have large calves for a lady so the high boots don\u2019t work for me. These are in between booties and taller cowgirl boots. I am a 6.5 in sketchers and took the same size in this boot. I have had foot surgery because my big toe can\u2019t bend and I am able to slide my foot into these boots. The foot bed is amazingly comfortable and supportive. This was the most comfortable boot I tried of all the brands.",

      "text": "The fringe is so swingy and lays nicely to the shape of the boot. I was hoping to get by with a narrow toe and these are working well enough. Since breaking a toe, it tends to swell and doesn't like to be confined tightly. They aren't as roomy as my fat baby boots (which I really love too) but I wanted these so badly and if I can keep my feet from swelling ( they always do if they get hot) then we'll be together a long time.",

The fit is exactly right, they are comfortable to wear, and the heel is not too high to dance in and run if the mood strikes you. The look is perfect if fringe is your thing. You can't go wrong buying these boots. Since the sizing is so precise, I would recommend them for gifting, also.",

The fringes make a swishing sound when you walk and to me it is happy sound. They are the high quality I have come to expect from Ariat. These are my second pair of Ariat brand boots and will not be my last.",

I wore them to a gig the first day they arrived and they look awesome for performing. But they are definitely head turners in the streets too. I love how they look, how they fit, and the level of comfort they provide. I wear an 8.5-9 and the 8.5 fits great. They are starting to break in, so I only imagine they will become even comfier. I have wide feet and large calves and these boots make me feel like a million bucks. Seriously fierce and really attractive. We are in love.",

I don't usually wear fat baby boots but these are amazing the tassle detail lifts them and the narrow toe makes them ore slender better for a shorter person like me. The obviously need wearing but all new boots do but I buy a 7 in cowboy boots every time and these for perfect.",
