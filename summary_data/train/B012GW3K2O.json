I only use cucumbers and limes, so I'm not sure what has developed on the infuser. The band that holds the lid up also snapped, and they don't sell replacements. So the lid just flops around. If the company offered replacement parts, this would be a non-issue...but you have to buy a new bottle once the seals go bad or snap.",

Over time it seems that the band gets cut and eventually breaks. I tried replacing it with a rubber band and that worked for a while before it got cut too.

The product is VERY badly designed for balance.. it regularly falls... even with the 'sleeve' it doesn't keep cool for any amount of time and while the top seals well it also contributes to its tendency to tip over and roll around the floor. Don't bother putting a carabinor into the hook it pulls it over when 1/2 full if the top is not sealed it spill all over the place. Very badly engineered.",

I love that it is really spill proof, I feel comfortable enough to put it in my handbeg lying down. I mostly use the bottle with sparkling water and the bottle handles it very well. I use the recipe book for infusion combinations and it is very detailed and delicious. I am considering buying one for my mother as a gift because, she is trying to reduce the amount of soft drinks that she consumes and I think this could be a great replacment for that!",

Another is, if the previous one fell over, it would leak. Not a lot, but still something to point out. This design is 150% leak-proof. Definitely worth 5-stars all-around.

Although you can find less expensive versions, I spent the extra money because the infuser goes all the way to the bottom of the bottle and it has the outside sleeve. It was worth it! I have had the bottle for several days now and have noticed an increase in my water intake because water is now more enjoyable to drink (more often and in larger quantities). I have used fresh fruit and frozen. Both work well. The infuser has kept the frozen fruit from crumbling apart in my water. I am very pleased and highly recommend this product. I will purchase this again and use as birthday gifts for family and friends.",
