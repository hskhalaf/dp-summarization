I just switched to the Kinvara 7s and found them not quite as supportive as I expected from a shoe that is touted as one of the best for plantar fasciitis sufferers, but they are comfortable nonetheless. Compared to the Grid Cohesions and numerous other popular running shoes, they are extremely light, balanced in the sole, and just enough wider in the toe box to allow for a comfortable spread and natural footfall. Little to no break-in time doesn't hurt either. All in all, I'm pleased so far.",

      "text": "I really like the comfort and weight of the kinvara 7. It felt like I was putting on gloves rather than running shoes. I did buy them a half-size larger than my usual 9.5 US size since they run slightly smaller. Despite their lightness, I felt my high arches were well supported and didn't have any flare-up of plantar fasciitis, which can occur if I use shoes with too little arch support. What remains to be seen is whether they hold up well with my weight over 170 lbs. I still expect to use my Saucony Guide 10s for longer training runs over 13 miles, but will definitely consider using these for my next half-marathon.",

I put in a number of 15-20+ mile runs in this shoe, but usually ended up blistered afterwards due to the top of the shoe being very narrow, and didn't offer much room for my feet to breathe. Overall decent shoe. They were okay to use for a few months but I would not purchase another pair.",
