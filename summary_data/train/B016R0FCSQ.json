Welder has been super useful for hobbyist type welds, and occasional automotive fixes. My crowning achievement so far was an RC Lawn Mower I was able to build - thanks to this welder! I recommend getting 'Tip Dip' nozzle gel, I've done tons of welds on the first tip and at this rate, will never have to replace it. Get this one, skip the cheaper welders on Amazon.",

      "text": "The Forney Easy Weld 299 125 FC welder is great for a beginner who does not anticipate going beyond 3/16\" in thickness. In destructive testing, I was able to fully bend 1/8\" think steel without welds breaking, however, when stepping up to 1/4\" (above max recommended) the welds broke out before the metal would bend. The arc, compared to a major brand with red case, is very comparable. The only con I can think of is the included sample wire, ditch it in favor of something higher quality.",

When it does work it welds like a champ. In the process of sending this back and replacing with hopefully a better built one. Did notice that when I got the unit the front was broke and there is a circuit board lose inside. I would recommend for sure just need to watch there quality and assembly. Hope the next one works like it should.",

Bottom line; if you\u2019re looking for a good inexpensive welder or are looking to get into welding, this is an excellent choice and is miles better than any Habor Freight welder. There are limited settings but that also means less chance to pick the incorrect settings- very helpful if you\u2019re a novice like me. It won\u2019t do heavy duty welding, like a winch bumper, but I welded stainless exhaust pipe no problem, and it should handle most hobbyist level tasks. Buy an extra spoil of wire, the spool it comes with is very little and you will run out quickly.",
