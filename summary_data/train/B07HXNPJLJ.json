As soon as the Arlo Doorbell detects motion, after a second or two delay, the front door camera starts recording.

There is also a 30-45 second delay from when the doorbell is hit until the chime goes off. And the communication when trying to use your phone to talk to whoever at the door is so low quality it's impossible for either person to make out what is being said. A huge disappointment on technology that should be pretty straight forward.",
