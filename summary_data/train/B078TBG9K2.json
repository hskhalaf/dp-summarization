My husband ran the 24 hour Spartan Ultra World Championship in Iceland, which was in brutal conditions. These socks kept his feet comfortable and warm through 20 straight hours of running in the snow/wind through the iclandic mountains. He was totally impressed and commented a lot about how much he loved the socks. We would purchase again if need be. Thanks for a great product.",

Normally, on a run this cold, my feet would be numb with cold and just pounding it out. I'll try them out with my xc ski boots, next. I'm expecting good things.",

I was literally in the creek for the whole 7 mile hike and they kept my feet pretty dry, that was until water got in over the top, then they were useless. However if you don't plan to be getting into deep water, these work perfectly. I also recommend wearing thin sock liners with these, because the inside isn't the most breathable, and the liners help. The biggest problem is that when the inside gets wet, they stay pretty wet. For the price, these socks are pretty great!",
