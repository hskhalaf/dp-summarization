Colimation is spot on, probably due to the excellent packaging, they had a stiff 3/4 in air cell cushion on all six sides in the factory box. The not so good. This is a second quality item. They have a large blemish on the painted parts. The IPD hinge is vary stiff. They do not have a tripod port, Although the little cover were the tripod port would be is labeled with a tripod symbol. I guess that's why they were priced so low. Never the less I will keep them for there quality image.",
