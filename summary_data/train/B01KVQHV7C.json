Good for chopping vegetables, it\u2019s small enough to trim meat, yet heavy enough to be a cleaver. It\u2019s the most versatile tool I have bought for the kitchen as far as dicing, slicing, etc. The bad is the handles are too small for the tang so the edges stick out and are sharp and catch things.

I wish that I had bought one of these a lot earlier. My 'acid-test' was thin-slicing and 'match-sticking' carrots. I almost cried at how much easier it is with this, not just because of it's sharpness, but also because of the balance and curve of the blade.",

The only reason I would recommend a Ravenger is that, not being practiced with a cleaver, I find that I have caused divots in our cutting board by rocking it too much when slicing. The Ravenger has a rounded end that would make it a cross between a cleaver and a santoku. That being said, it was a good purchase and a fine knife.",
