Tried the chicken and rice thing, but there was little improvement with his digestive issues. I read about this product, and taking the reviews into consideration, decided to order it. He loves them! After only the SECOND DAY of taking them, there was a marked improvement in my Doberman's breath, as well as his stools. We are on the third day, and his halitosis is all gone, and he's again eating me out of house and home. This thing works, it works quickly, and it WORKS WELL!",

Maybe every dog is different, but I would not recommend this product.",
