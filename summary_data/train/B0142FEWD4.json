      "text": "Found deciding on which pair of headphones to buy to be very confusing, so many different things to think of and compare. Never bought a pair before so very unsure. Chose these partly because of the make and partly because they had 5 - 40 frequency. Did wonder if a cheaper pair would be just as good but decided to risk it and ago for these. To listen to my various types of music including hip hop. I am a 62 year old woman who dances away to hip hop. Disgraceful. Excellent sound, good treble, though I do use a graphic equalizer too, glad I chose them.",

They are not as transparent as the beyer T1 semi open back, but they are much cheaper and probably better value. Compared to the T1s, they have a boosted low end, good for rock but not perhaps for monitoring. The ear pads are very comfy but the headband is perhaps a bit small, ear to ear, for my head so that after extended listening they can feel a touch pressing. I've had far less comfortable headphones and am happy with these.",

They sound crisp but without being harsh. The level of detail is the first thing I noticed about the sound. I've had and listened to more exciting headphones, that still maintained a good level of detail. Very occasionally, I find something is a bit lost in the mix, that I'm used to hearing. The build quality seems very good by modern standards.",

      "text": "These headphones, obviously sound phenomenal. They look premium, they feel premium, they sound premium. With that said, Try the DT 770 first, they sound very similar whilst also being significant;y more comfortable (to me anyways) Sound and comfort are both very subjective things, For me, neither of these things were significantly improved with these headphones when coming from the DT 770 which comes in at a much more reasonable price point. I would give them a 4/5 star rating as it is a fantastic pair of headphones, I just think they are not worth buying for casual use when Beyerdynamic have much more sensible offering around such as the DT 770, 990 and the 880.",

I actually prefer this because I can now hear the music surrounding the vocalist. Like hearing old songs for the first time again. My review is based on listening for about 2 months.

I also got it from an authorized seller in case I have to file a warranty claim and was on sale for an amazing price of $414!

If you prefer a more up-front sound, you can easily mod them by removing a piece of felt covering the drivers. If you like a more laid back signature, do nothing. Either way, it sounds fantastic out of the box. Both beyerdynamic fans and those new to the company will appreciate this headphone.",

      "text": "I have used Beyer DT 770 Pro headphone for many years. This is a good upgrade with some cosmetic perks and more solid build. Sonically, they are very close, with a similar EQ curve. And this has slightly more clarity in the 200 hz area. I ultimately decided the price difference was not worth it. But I can recommend for those who like the ear cup options, removable cable, and the general EQ (which is bass strong, and treble strong).",

      "text": "Would be an amazing pair of headphones were it not for the fact that one driver plays louder than the other. Specifically, it sounds like the bass is overwhelmingly coming from the left driver. It looks like others here have had similar issues. And as indicated in those reviews, it\u2019s a shame because these headphones are stellar in every other way. Another review said they are like the DT770s, but with much more defined bass and a more open sound. That\u2019s exactly how I would describe them. I have had nothing but good experiences in the past with Beyerdynamic products, so I am hopeful that they will remedy the issues with the DT1770s.",

      "text": "I spent hours reading reviews, manufacturer's specs and watching You Tube reviews of headphones. This headphone is supposed to have a balance between very even, uncolored response with just a touch of color to make it a pleasure to hear with. It is capable both of being a premium studio recording and mixing headphone, plus you can hear it plugged into almost any sound source (although it would probably be best with a headphone amp.) So why the low star? The factory overlooked inspecting it's product. Really?......a $600 dollar headphone is not inspected before shipping? One side simply did not work!!!!!! Maybe it was a lemon, but I expected more.",

The only problem is that I am starting to question Beyerdynamic's quality control. I recently had to send back a pair of Beyer T1, generation 2 headphones because of rattling in the earcup and eventually one of the drivers went completely dead. Now, the right driver in my DT1770 is distorting heavily, especially on bass notes. I only hope that Beyer will stand by their product and correct things as I really do like the sound signature of these.",
