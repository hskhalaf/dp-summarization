These were a favorite toy at Head Start, and we were happy to find a large set at a good price to have at home.

Definitely not a reason not to big. Overall, it's a great set for the price!!",

The plastic is more clear and looks more like stained glass. It also has less decor/ design to distract the eye. It includes more large squares to build on- 6 I believe. Other brands contain 2. You can build larger projects with these. Cons- the magnets are not as strong as some other brands. I would repurchase more of these. Although I rather like mixing the different brands for variety.",

      "text": "This is the second set of these magnetic tiles that we have purchased for our grandchildren. Our 4 yo grandson is able to built multiple levels and make the pyramids and other shapes. Even our 2 yo grandson likes to put them together. They seem indestructible. They are kind of a pain to keep putting back into the box they came in, so we found a small plastic chest to hold them and that is much easier to manage when its time to pick them up. A great toy that is well worth the expense.",
