The fretboard had glue smudges and looked discolored at multiple frets. When I plugged it into the amp there was a continuous humming sound. The 2 tone controls seemed to have no effect on the sound. Upon playing with different settings (on amp and guitar) I didn't hear the sound expected of an electric guitar (lead, bass etc). It seemed like a patched used guitar was shipped. I've returned this and ordered a replacement; hopefully the next one is in a better shape.",

This would be great for any beginner, like me. I wanted a guitar that wasn't expensive being I never played before and wasn't sure I could due to a disability. It was a great choice. I would go with a more expensive Squire or Fender as I grow with experience, but this is a good model to get started with.",

Trust me, some of my friends started the wrong way with one of those guitars and they only lasted a couple of months before something went wrong. I have already strongly recommended this guitar to multiple friends and in the end, they're all happy that they bought it.",

Even If you decide to do some upgrades, you can throw on new tuners and pickups, and still be a little under half the price of a MIM Strat. Don't let the Squier name turn you away from this guitar.",
