Let that steep for 3-4 minutes, place on coffee cup or travel mug and done. Clean up is easy too, rinse out and leave upside down in the sink strainer until the next morning. Works great.",

The packaging doesn't provide any suggestions about serving size, etc., which is usually a personal choice, but it would be helpful. Overall, it's a nifty gadget, but very overpriced for what you get.",

Our Chemex glass coffee maker was one such casualty. So we bought the cup-top Clever maker and used it with our supply of thick Chemex paper filters. The result: Chemex-style coffee at a fraction of the cost but without the constant risk of breakage. Forget making a pot of so-so drip coffee with an electric maker and have a perfect cup instead. Good grounds, good filters, and good technique (see YouTube instructions) comprise the secret--along with this simple pour-over maker--to a great cup of joe.",

Once set on the cup, the coffee does filter through quite quickly, unlike other pour over products. It is a bit larger than other pour over devices, so having a 16oz size coffee is no problem. This is actually my second purchase of the Dripper. This generation seems to be made of a better plastic than the previous generation.",

Enter, this product... It's absolutely the best of both worlds.

By the way, this is my second Clever Dripper - the first lasted about 4 years but cracked when it fell off the counter.",
