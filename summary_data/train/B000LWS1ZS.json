Doing the math, that means the candle is over 200 inches in length. That means the winding candle wick would have to be over 6 yards long. It is not possible. It appears to be a lovely product, but it includes false claims regarding the number of hours the candle will burn.",

However, during use the wax melts and runs down onto the clip, making it difficult to disengage. Also, the \"spooled\" part of the candle is hard to reposition into the clip, especially when it's \"full\" and very near the clip. You have to bend the wax back and forth as you push it into the clip. It has never broken on me, but it often feels like it's just about to. Overall I like it and would buy again.",

This candle does not have any odor once burning- there are no added oils, etc... It is a beautiful and mesmerizing flame, and the presentation is spot on for our decor. We love it!!!",

Three crooked spokes, poorly welded to the base stick up to support the coil but are basically useless and just make it look kind of cheap. That and that metal copper \"tone\" painted on is a bit cheesy. I didn't notice right away but after a couple of uses I realized that the clip that screws on top of the middle spoke was not a perfect fit but someone had wedged a tiny piece of paper in the screw to make it seem tighter. Weird. Still, it is kinda cool.",

      "text": "I love how it looks and how bright it burns, but it's VERY frustrating. The clamps are SO hard to open and it's really hard to re-position the candle once it's burnt out because of the clamping mechanism. Maybe mine is just defective. Also, it's very difficult to light. I went through 5 or 6 matches trying to light it and it still wouldn't light. My fiance had to burn down the side (wasting a bunch of wax) just to light it. I usually don't review things unless I have good things to say, but I was upset because this candle had so many good reviews and it has been troublesome.",

I don't know if she'll actually burn it, but knowing that she can buy more coils in the future definitely helps. I didn't pay attention to the actual dimensions while ordering so I was surprised at its size when it arrived. From the picture I was definitely expecting something big and heavy but instead this is more cute and light.",

However for my family that has proved to be its main attraction. Similar to having a fireplace. When it is by choice, you generally enjoy all the fussing. Second would be the lack of scent beeswax candles are known for. My wife suggests that maybe the process to get the wax flexible is at fault. If so, it is worth the trade off. I suggest getting the refill at the same time so you don't have to be so conservative you lose enjoyment.",
