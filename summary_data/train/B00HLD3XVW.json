You do need a proper back support, but it handles very well, it is very tough, it has a higher than average weight limit and quite stable.

So if you want a beginning to moderate/advanced yak, this one is really hard to beat.",

Now I want to purchase a new one because the colors were so bright next to my early 2000's Ocean Kayak Frenzy. And I like the updated graphics much better than mine!! I'm a huge fan of Ocean Kayaks! Highly recommend this kayak for lake or ocean kayaking!!",
