The texture seemed a bit different than my other blanket and I had to use over 10 lint removing sheets (front and back of blanket) in order to remove the extra lint. After 30 minutes of removing lint, I am definitely wondering what changed between these blankets and my previous blanket.",

I ordered 1 when I adopted my dog 3 months ago, and have ordered 3 more for her since then bc they're perfect in size and texture! Love this blanket. Shown below in both car and dog bed.",

He loves snuggling up with the blanket, as it is very soft. I have caught him chewing on it a couple times, but no damage! Great product - thank you!!",

I am surprised this happened as the reviews for the blanket seemed mostly positive - it's really too bad as my dog loved it.",

I'm curious to see how it performs with the pet hair, meantime my dog is enjoying it.",
