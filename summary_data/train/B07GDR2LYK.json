Because the quality of the microphone and / the digital processing of the voice makes them unusable for phone calls. And if they are unusable for phone calls, then they are unusable period. When a phone call came in, i had to plug in my \u00a36.99 wired generic headphones to have a conversation. After paying \u00a3329... ridiculous. Sent back for a refund. Sad really, Sony achieved the hard challenge (sound quality & NC) but failed on the easy part. (Simple phone conversation)",

In my opinion, the answer is unequivocally \"Yes!\". The Bose are beaten in terms of sound quality, noise cancelling, build quality, features, accompanying app and looks. The Bose may be a tad more comfy (really marginally) with a little more room in the ear cup and a little less imposing on you skull but that's all they have going for them over the Sony's. Oh, well I guess I'll give them the edge for the carry case too. Winner = Sony!",

However, soon after receiving them I noticed that when noise cancellation is active there is a constant hissing noise coming from the left earphone. This happens every time noise cancellation is activate, and grows louder and more pronounced the longer I wear the headphones. The right side is fine. I've tried the noise cancelling optimiser in the app a number of times but there's no improvement. This issue is extremely annoying and frankly unacceptable for a pair of brand new headphones that cost me \u00a3265. The noise cancellation experience is ruined.

Also on TWO headsets now one of the ear-cups develops an imbalance in the hiss which is disconcerting. Then after a bit more time you get a variation in his strength and popping. According to the SONY customer representative, this is due to thermal noise issues. I looks on the forums and this is a common defect. They ask yo to send it back to the SONY repair center, bin it and send you a new boxed headset. If you are unlucky, the replacement has exactly the same problem.",

The only reason I can't give a 5 star is a terrible hissing in my right headphone, that only got worse with further listening after resetting after disuse.

So the noise cancelling just works in 1 ear. Annoyingly worse than my 1000xm2s. If you're after NC Sony failed with these. Not recommended. Update: moved from 1 star to 4 star. These headphones like the 1000xm2 before are great headphones I use for very long time periods. Feel a bit plasticy and creak a little bit, but NC is great, comfortable, sound quality good (I'm not an audiophile though). Just 4 stars, but if they had better quality control I give them 5.",

I've had many in the past (including Bose) but none that are as comfortable as these for long listening sessions (especially since I wear glasses) and none that sounded this good! If you need convincing, simply find somebody who'll let you try them - you'll be convinced very quickly! For me, the only downside was the ridiculously short charging cable (less than 10cm!) which I promptly managed to lose! However, since the charger is one of the more obscure USB fittings, it took a while for me to find an alternative cable. If you purchase these, do yourself a favour and get a spare charger BEFORE you lose the silly little cable the comes supplied.",

The Sonys are heavier and chunkier and somehow also allow less room for your ears than the Bose. I wouldn't want to wear them for a long haul whereas I have with the Bose and didn't want to take them off.",

A look through the Sony support forums reveals that this is a very common issue. Sometimes blamed on a hardware failure and sometimes blamed on firmware. Either way, not something I will accept from a premium priced product such as this.",

I have to be honest and say that I like my music flat (I'm a sound engineer after all) and was very disappointed with these. A lot of bass in the mix, and the bass-mids were really muddy. I guess it depends what genre of music you listen to. But if you like rock with British type guitars and gnarly mids these are not for you. I can imagine that for someone that listens to electronic styles with lots of sub bass this would be great but yeah, not for me. Returned them",

Go on treat yourself and get them you really won't be disappointed with your purchase. The only thing is DON'T do the latest firmware update from Sony, because as many users have said it changes the noise cancellation for the worse, so leave them as they are until they remedy it.

The only draw backs for me are the single bluetooth pairing, and the degradation in codec quality when using a custom noise shaping.
