I didn\u2019t know any better, I sprayed it all over the coach, the rugs and then I didn\u2019t realized until a lot later that my skin doesn\u2019t like lemon grass and started getting rashes. I ended up moving out of that apartment. Everyone is different, but this is what I learned while using this product. Maybe your skin won\u2019t be as sensitive?",

Their fur stayed oily for about an hour and is still weighted down after several hours but it's not sticky so it's not too bad. i can't imagine spraying this all over the house- the smell although not bad (citronella) is just too much.

I sprayed a little bit around our bedroom and could barely sleep in there. Had to wash our bedding and anything that the spray touched. Instant headache. It was a total waste for us, but maybe I can use it to spray around the perimeter of our house outside. I want to use it up since I bought it, but I just can't see how anyone can handle such an intense scent. It was like citronella on steroids. Yikes.",

She still had ticks and fleas on her after we thoroughly sprayed her and of course she doesn't like the smell but that wouldn't bother me so much if the darn thing worked, after all it's natural so it doesn't harm her. Perhaps more Cedar oil? Oh well, on to another natural product.",
