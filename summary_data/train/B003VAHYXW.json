      "text": "I use the Z515 speakers to play audiobooks from my Note 4 Samsung smart phone using its bluetooth connectivity. The performance is outstanding!! Many reviewers critique the sound quality compared to that of a laptop. Whatever! Most modern laptops have good to excellent audio to begin with so what is the point? In my opinion, the Logitech speaker audio is far better than any smartphone I've ever heard. So, when paired with a phone or tablet, the audio is a vast improvement. I especially enjoy using it when traveling. It is sleek enough to pack in my overnight bag. I can easily use it in my hotel room or in my vehicle. I recommend it!!",

I was looking for reasonably priced speakers (check) that could be used without being plugged in to a power source (check) or connected to my iPad (check) and sounded good (oops.) These speakers are just as bad as the speakers on my iPad. The music still sounds tinny and poor quality, and the only difference is that the tinny scratch music is louder coming out of the logitech speakers. I am returning these and looking for something else.",

Then last month it quit working completely (I've had it 5 months, after a total of probably 20 hrs. of use). It's too late to return it to Amazon, and I'm sure that Logitech won't back it up.

Not exactly what I was hoping for. The sound quality of the speakers was just okay, not great. They didn't seem much better than the external speakers you get with a desktop PC, but they were certainly better than the internal speakers in my laptop. I am going to return this.

I was reluctant at first but when I got it I have only good things to say about it. Of course it is not an explosive sound equipment, but it is sufficient for small apartment parties. If your computer doesn't have Bluetooth, it comes with a usb dongle (about the size of a pen drive) and you can set it up. It also has an Aux port in case you want to connect it that way (which is not mentioned anywhere, I believe).",

The one we had before the plug came apart in the computer which caused him to not be able to hear or use any type of speaker/headphones. Luckily we were able to get the piece out. Sound quality is excellent and loud!",
