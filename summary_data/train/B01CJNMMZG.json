      "text": "Had an old deskjet that lasted 17 years. THEY DON'T MAKE THEM LIKE THEY USED TO!!! This printer stinks. #1 - It never fails to stop printing from the desktop that it is wirelessly connected to. MULTIPLE reinstallations does not help...THERE IS NO SOLUTION. #2 - Print quality is horrible. It's like a little kids printer. I highly suggest spending more money on a printer that works. DO NOT BUY ON AMAZON because return will be impossible when it starts acting up ( 2months after you've bought it. AVOID!!!!!",

The printer is relatively quiet in operation, and fairly quick first print. All controls are on touch screen and work well. Document loader works without jamming, and the wireless system is flawless.

Hopefully I will find that it lasts a long time since it's the highest I have seen. So, I will know in a few months whether there is just a much higher capacity for it to justify the cost.

The document feeder jams most of the time when I try to do duplex scans. It is also a very loud machine in both the print function and the scanning function. I own it and I'll use it but I would not recommend it to anybody. There are better multi function printers on the market.",

The quality is excellent--and I really like the fact that the printer can sense when ink levels are low and will automatically order refills. HP has really stepped up its game with the OfficeJet Pro 8720. I am a small business owner, and this printer is already a valuable asset.",

It worked instantly. It is crazy fast - I didn\u2019t know inkjets could be that fast. And it has lots of great added features like being able to email attachments to the printer. If it holds up well enough, I may be an HP lifer now. The color printing looks great too.",
