It is a perfect light weight, fleece lined, warm coat and perfect for temperatures around and above freezing. He wears it comfortably unzipped when the temperature is between 30-40*, and I am sure tougher people could wear it in colder weather but we live in Texas so we typically don't have to.",

Its great for blocking wind, an has a sporty look. The only small difference between this jacket an the former, is that the side pockets are smaller. Which is great for the look, not as easy to stuff my huge winter gloves in.",
