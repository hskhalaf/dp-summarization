      "title": "Game of the Year - maybe multiple years",
      "text": "This is an incredible game, it was my Game of the Year in 2012. There was an 'updated' version called XCOM: Enemy Within that added a second enemy faction to fight and included some gameplay additions, but by shoehorning in a new enemy it actually interrupted the narrative significantly and made a less satisfying overall conclusion. Given the choice, you should stick with this version. The music and sound effects are top-notch. Graphically speaking it's not particularly impressive, there are visual artifacts and you'll sometimes see the camera make some odd decisions during the combat resolution mini-cutscenes, but that shouldn't take away from your enjoyment of a fun, compelling, and meaty gameplay experience.",

This new game pays great homage to the old with updated graphics, easier combat system and progression. Although the research and engineering part as well as how to make money is not the same. More simplified. Ok since the real fun is in the turn based gameplay. always fun and also hurts too, like when you lose a squad member. definitely worth the money.",

It brings enough of the original game with it to be fantastic, and the upgrades in graphics and the ability to play it on my XBox are awesome. I recommend this to everyone, but especially those who played the original.",

If you loved Final Fantasy Tactics back in the day, you'll love this one. My only complaint is that it was too short.",

The system is smooth and will apply a challenge to the most strategy based enthusiast. The ability to upgrade everything and how all of the upgrades are tied into what ever you do is pretty genius. Any game that makes you use your brain to win should be in everyone's collection. I love this game.",

The only issue i have with this game is that i got an unreadable disc error twice while playing and it is brand new and i also installed it to my Hard drive. This game will probably be one of the best games i have ever played this year",

Turn based games like this one do not require the critical hand eye coordination like Halo and Gears of War, instead I can concentrate on my strengths like cooperation and strategy. I would like the franchise to continue and am a die-hard fan. I have been playing this game off and on for about a month now, still haven't finished it. But I can't wait for the next X-Com release.",
