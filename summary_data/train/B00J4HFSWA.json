My daughter has slept through every level of noise since infancy and this was no different. I slept in the same room with her and by the time I woke her after the alarm woke me up each time, it was too late. We will continue to use this but I am wondering if I should have done more research for an alarm designed with girls in mind. The rating I am giving is mainly for the design/sensor placement and the male-oriented instructions. If this is designed primarily for boys, the product description should state this.",

Sometimes he went to bed at 10 pm and by the time I woke him at 1200 am he was soaked. NOT ANYMORE... we are 3 weeks into this product and he got his underwear wet just 2 times !!

We also bought a book that I read together with my daughter, and we followed all of the suggestions. With the help of the alarm, she gradually started to have better nights and began to wake herself up. After about two months, she no longer needed the alarm. My daughter is so thrilled that she has been dry for a few months now. She asked me to write a good review so other kids could get the same help if they needed it. We highly recommend the alarm!",

We battled night wetting for years, now at age 9 she is finally over it. I think this alarm was just the last straw to convince her subconscious to wake up when she needs to pee.

He had two accidents in the house while playing during those two weeks but he is now going independently to the toilet and we are all so proud of him! This is a wonderful alternative for parents struggling to potty train. I'm so glad the OT mentioned it!!",

He now self-consciously wakes up without realizing it and going to the bathroom. Where as before he would sleep through the whole night cause And have a large amount of urine in his diaper( My son is a very heavy sleeper) It's definitely taking some time but it's worth it.",

We continued the process all the way to the end of the program-and it worked! My son also enjoyed seeing his progress on the chart. There were many ups and downs, but just keep with it. He has been bed wetting free ever since. Wonderful product. Saved our son embarrassment, me sleepless nights and our washing machine many extra loads.",
