UPDATE: Over three years later and these stickers still look awesome! They have had zero issues with sticking to the wall and the colors still look great. I have not ever had one start to peel or come off, well worth the money to add some color and fun to your little's room!",

Adhesive was left behind and chunks of paint came off in a few spots even though I used a hair dryer to help remove the decals. Scrubbed for hours to get the glue off but it's still there. This is compared to the decals we had up for 5.5 years for our older kids and they came off no problem and were able to restick in the playroom. (So it's not just a time issue but rather quality issue.) Will not buy from this company again.",

    "description": "Create a stunning woodland theme on any wall\n\n Avoid the need for completely redecorating a room and instead, create a fun and bright d\u00e9cor for your child or children the easy way. The cost of paint, wall paper and the time to do it can be expensive and time consuming. Instead, take the simpler option of wall decals which will save you money and precious time and will have your chosen room looking great in minutes rather than days. \n\nOur range of safari sticker decals are unique, you can create your own design by positioning the cute animals wherever you want. Getting your child involved makes it a fun activity for all ages too! \n\n How to apply the decals \n\n Choose a clean and dry surface in your room of choice. It can be a wall, door or other flat surface. If it has recently been painted, we advise a good two week period for the surface to become completely dry before applying the decals. Peel your stickers away from the sheeting and carefully apply to your surface. \n\nIf for any reason you choose to remove your decals, they can be lifted and peeled away easily, without leaving any residue or sticky mess and without the need for redecorating! \n\n Safe for everyone \n\n Safety is hugely important, especially when children are involved. Therefore, we have ensured that our wall decals have passed SGS tests and are nontoxic throughout. \n\n BUY NOW and easily add a safari theme to your child\u2019s wall",
