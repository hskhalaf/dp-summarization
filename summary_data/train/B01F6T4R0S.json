Unfortunately out of the 4 that I used in my living room, only 1 of them still responds after a few months. I even tried to factory reset them but couldn't get them to pair again with Alexa. Very frustrating when \"smart\" bulbs work worse than old fashioned LED bulbs that are so much cheaper. Another complaint I have is that when you turn them off using the wall switch, they default to the yellowest \"warm\" white. I wish they would save the most recent settings even when they lose power.",
