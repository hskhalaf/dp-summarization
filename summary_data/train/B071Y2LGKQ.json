I wanted something that I could have on hand so I wouldn't have to rush to the store each time I needed a card. This product is AMAZING! The cards are the same size you'd buy at a store (5x7) and the quality is superb! The cards are made of a thick card stock and the design and colors are beautiful. There is a nice mix of different cards for different occasions. As well, the envelopes are also made out of sturdy/quality paper. I am SO impressed with this product & will be buying ordering from them again!",

The messages inside are nice and simple, nothing overly crazy. I plan to buy the birthday boxed set for the office as well, and I think I might buy this mixed card set to have at home as well.",

I have not stepped in a store in over two months... and won't for a card. This set is perfect and very well made, these are not the cheap type of cards kids sell for school fundraising!
