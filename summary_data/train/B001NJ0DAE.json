The replacement cage looks in better shape but it is so poorly welded it has proved to be impossible for my (very practical engineer) husband to assemble. Some bits were capable of being straightened out with a rubber mallet, but half way through assembly we got to a point where the pieces simply didn't fit together and would have needed chamfering, which we aren't prepared to do for a product that is supposed to be \"no tools required\". So disappointing that an expensive cage is so badly manufactured.",

I went to say good morning to my rats and one was trapped underneath the fallen level. He wasn't moving so I thought he'd been killed. He ended up being ok, but that was really scary. The top level is just not secure enough on the little hooks for how heavy it is. Also having such shallow litter pans is ridiculous. If you buy this cage, make sure to zip tie the level on the far side, and I'm going to add some 3\" plexiglass to the sides by the levels to compensate for the shallow pans.",

The cage we had before was a Rat Manor from Petco and you couldn't clean it well at all - had to be taken apart to really clean it. This is awesome. All 4 front door open completely and you can clean it all well. You can lock the rats upstairs and clean downstairs without fear of them escaping. We also have the lower level guard that keeps their bedding from falling out onto the floor and that's awesome as well.",

Definitely wish the floor tray had more room for bedding- without any adjustments, I can fit maybe an inch of bedding at the bottom.

      "text": "This is a very solid, well made cage which we bought for our two pet rats. They have plenty of room to run around and find their own cozy niches. The pans are made of sturdy plastic that is easy to remove and clean once a week. The entire cage can be taken apart easily for deep cleaning or storage. The horizontal cage bars are spaced tightly enough together to accommodate even young rats. The only downsides are the high cost - but well worth every penny, and also it is quite large, so make sure you have enough space for it wherever you plan to put it!",

My daughter had 2 rats which quickly became 11 rats (one momma was pregnant... oh-oh!), and these rats are totally happy in this giant cage. The panels slide out easily for cleaning and it allows you to either share the cage between the animals or block it off if you want to keep them seperate. Very sturdily built and comes on wheels so you can move it easier to clean it out underneath. This cage would be big enough for ferrets, rabbits, and other larger critters too. HIGHLY recommend!",

These cages are over 100lbs. With all that\u2019s going on right now it would be nice if price adjustments could be made a little easier. $40 in my opinion is a lot, but not enough to justify trying to return I guess.",

Additionally, the door piece and both short side pieces had corners that were damaged/bent and required significant messing with in order to get them to work. Lastly, the silver knobs what make up the door latches do not line up properly. Between that and the damaged corners, the take-away feeling is that the cage is shoddy both in design and execution.

We added an extra large running wheel mounted to the side, a clip on hammock for sleeping/privacy and provide small cardboard boxes for them to sleep/hide/play in. It's easy to wheel from room to room.
