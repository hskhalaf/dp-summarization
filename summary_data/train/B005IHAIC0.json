      "text": "The Sony A77 is an excellent DSLR camera at a reasonable price considering all the features and specifications. Having always used Nikon cameras, I was at first somewhat skeptical of the Sony translucent technology but after reading the reviews , I was convinced that this A77 was in a class by itself. I have not been disappointed, the speed of this camera is outstanding, the build quality is equal to or better than the high end Nikon and Canons and the features and technology are without equal. If you are looking to make a step up from entry level DSLR's , this Sony A77 is an excellent choice.",

I have been using the a77 for 14 months now, and I think Sony has done a great job with this camera to get up to speed with the big players in the category. So much thought went into the design of the camera. Sony really thought through how the user would interact with the camera, both from a hardware and software standpoint. I have no regrets with the decision I made to buy this camera. If I lost it today, I would buy another just like it.",

I had also considered a camcorder, but I didn't want to lock myself into carrying around two devices. I figured that I could easily sell the D5100 if I could master indoor and low light stills on the A77. Well, I still have the D5100 because the A77 in my hands comes up quite a bit short of the D5100 shooting without flash or indoors. It's great outdoors and in well light locations. Video is fantastic, so I don't regret my purchase and I at least have a fall back camera.",

They cannot do both at once. Sony changes all that with the award-winning Translucent Mirror Technology system. It directs light to both the image sensor and the Phase Detection AF sensor simultaneously. \n\n24.3 MP; best-in-class resolution2\nYou get incredible detail and gorgeous enlargements thanks to a 24.3 megapixel sensor. It's the highest resolution among APS-C DSLRs, as of November 2012. \n\nWorld's fastest up to\n12 fps continuous2\nThe translucent mirror makes it far easier to capture the decisive soccer kick or your baby at her absolute cutest.

While Contrast Detection Auto Focus often hunts for correct focus, Phase Detection AF knows exactly where correct focus is, and goes straight for it. \n\nFull-Time Live View in LCD or EVF\nYou can use both the LCD monitor and OLED Electronic Viewfinder for composing shots in Live View. Both provide a what-you-see-is-what-you-get preview of white balance, focus, depth of field, exposure and 100% framing accuracy, plus informative on-screen displays. \n\nWorld's shortest release time lag3 \nHelps ensure that the image you want is the image you get. Once auto focus occurs, release time lag is the delay between fully pressing the shutter release and when the camera actually starts taking the picture. Long lag makes it harder to capture fast-moving objects. The Sony A77 boasts the world's shortest release time lag at only 0.05 seconds.3 \n\nSteadyShot INSIDE\u2122 stabilization\nImage stabilization reduces blur by compensating for camera shake. Typical DSLR systems build image stabilization into selected lenses only. SteadyShot INSIDE\u2122 image stabilization is built into the camera body itself. You'll reduce blur with every A Mount lens, including macro and wide-aperture standard zoom lenses.\n\nHDMI\u00ae output for HD viewing\nEnjoy HD movies and stunning still images on a compatible HDTV.7 The camera includes an HDMI\u00ae output. In addition, the BRAVIA\u00ae Sync system works with compatible Sony\u00ae BRAVIA HDTVs enabling you to control camera playback using the television's remote.8\n\nUp to 530 Shots of battery life9\nTake up to 530 shots on a single charge with Sony\u00ae Stamina\u2122 battery power.9 Sony's InfoLITHIUM\u00ae battery system enables you to see the percent of power remaining, so you can keep shooting in confidence. \n\nP/A/S/M exposure modes\nThe camera offers a full range of controls from the beginner's AUTO+ mode to P/A/S/M: Program, Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority and Manual. On-screen prompts help you refine your skills, build your confidence and exercise greater creative control. Rugged, magnesium alloy body \nThe SLT-A77 is built for the real world with a magnesium alloy body that combines high strength with light weight. Ports, doors and controls are also weather-resistant for smooth operation under adverse conditions. \n\nObject Tracking AF\nLocks onto a specified object and maintains focus even as the subject moves. Unpredictable subjects stay in focus even while zooming. You can concentrate on composition without worrying about focus. \n\n19-point Auto Focus\nTo maximize the value of Translucent Mirror Technology, Sony incorporates Phase Detection AF of great sophistication. 19 sensors with 11 cross sensors maximize precision for both vertical and horizontal subjects. \n\nThree-way tilt/swivel LCD screen \nTilt it up or down to frame high- and low-angle shots that would otherwise be hit-or-miss. Tilt and swivel over the camera for self-portraits. You can even tilt it up and down when you hold the camera in vertical mode! Finally, the monitor folds flush to the camera with the LCD exposed for shooting or protected for travel. \n\nDual control dials\nPerfect for experienced shooters, dual control dials provide direct, hands-on access to two settings at a time.\n\nTop mounted LCD\nIn addition to status displays on the LCD monitor and Electronic Viewfinder, Sony offers a top-mounted LCD with exposure information.\n\n6-image layering \nLeverages the fast BIONZ\u00ae processor to capture six images in a fraction of a second, and then combine the data. The result is one incredible single image that gets a cleaner result in Multi-Frame NR mode or sharper nighttime pictures in Hand-held Twilight mode. \n\nMulti-frame NR\nExperience incredible low-light shooting without a flash. The camera captures six images in a fraction of a second. Combining the data from all six, it creates a single image with a reduction in noise equivalent to two additional steps of ISO sensitivity. Sensitivity selectable up to ISO 16000. (Recommended for still subjects.) \n\nHandheld Twilight mode\nGet gorgeous shots at night without a tripod. Combines six frames into a single image for smooth, low-noise evening shots. (Recommended for still subjects.) \n\nAuto HDR built into camera\nCaptures more scene dynamic range than a single exposure can handle\u2014and more range than photo film. Combines the best highlight detail from one shot, the best mid-tones from a second and the best shadow detail from a third for one incredible shot. (Recommended for still subjects.) \n\n3D Sweep Panorama\u2122 Mode\nCapture vast scenic vistas and 16:9 shots in spectacular 3D. As you sweep across the panorama, the camera records separate right-eye and left-eye images that make landscapes come alive on your 3D television.1 Records both JPEG and MPO file formats. \n\nAdvanced Anti-Dust Technology\nAnti-Dust Technology helps keep the CMOS sensor clean, resulting in consistently clear pictures. First a static-free coating on the sensor's low-pass filter helps repel dust. Then vibration automatically dislodges dust from the sensor.\n\nBuilt-in Flash (GN12)\nTo help you shoot more effectively, the camera includes a built-in flash (Guide Number 12) that can also trigger a wireless accessory flash (sold separately). The integrated hot shoe enables you to expand your lighting options with a range of accessory flashes (sold separately). \n\nSlot for two media types\nFor cost-effective, convenient storage and sharing of your images, the camera accepts Memory Stick PRO Duo\u2122/Memory Stick PRO-HG Duo\u2122 and SD/SDHC/SDXC media (Class 4 or higher recommended, sold separately). \n\nAPS-C size HD CMOS image sensor\nWith 19.5 times the area of the typical camcorder image sensor, APS-C makes the difference between amateur and professional-looking video, delivering an exceptional combination of high resolution, high sensitivity and gorgeous, blurred backgrounds.\n\nSweep Panorama\u2122 Mode\nCapture expansive landscapes automatically. Press the shutter, sweep vertically or horizontally. The camera does the rest, continuously shooting images and stitching them together.\n\nBuilt-in GPS\nAn integrated GPS receiver records the location and time of every shot you take and lets you view your images on a map with compatible computer and Internet applications, so you can remember where you took your favorite shots.6\n\nShot Result Preview\nSee the results before you take the shot. This preview takes the guesswork out of camera settings by showing the effects of the aperture, shutter and DRO settings on the depth of field, motion and dynamic range. \n\n921K dot TruBlack\u2122 LCD screen\nSony's 3.0-inch Xtra Fine LCD\u2122 monitor has 921K dots for superb resolution.
