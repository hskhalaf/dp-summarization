I love that it includes some other useful utensils like a mini whisk and tongs, and the little magnetic cheat sheets will be super helpful while I'm learning how to use my IP. I haven't had time to use everything yet, but they all seem sturdy and good quality. You really can't beat the value!",

It didn\u2019t , but I feel much safer using the springform pan. Also, the egg cups were a big selling point for me. They are so handy for egg muffins and many other things. A couple of things there I did not need, but will likely use at some point. Overall a very good product.",

The dish clip is good for lifting anything out of the instant pot. The trivet is better than the trivet that came with the instant pot. It's wider so it doesn't move as much. The egg steamer rack is good for putting pots on. I like the easy reference magnets for commonly cooked items. That is useful.",
