I am so glad I no longer have to lay my carrying case down to take pics. It is perfectly balanced and therefore does not pull on my arms when taking photos. Great product great price.",

UPDATE: careful of stitching for any of the straps. It pulls out or breaks easily. Only a slight problem but makes me afraid to lift and carry anything heavy and fragile!",

I have 3 lenses, the largest of which is 70-300mm and this bag is just not large enough to cater for it. I purchase with the intention of storing the larger lens in the top compartment, but it's too tight for my liking. The other option is to reconfigure the tabs and store the long lens in the main compartment but again everything appears just a little too tight, meaning that access is not that easy. If this bag were 1 inch wider it would be great but it's just a little too small for my requirements.",

You can never have enough storage on a bag. And the single main strap with separate strap to secure the bag around you waist/chest isn't very comfortable on me. It tends to ride up a bit rather than hang on your body. But it does the job.",

It was so awkward to me, and it took my husband helping me to finally get it on correctly! It was not intuitive at all, and a few days later when I took it with me on a photo shoot for the first time, I had forgotten how to put it on again! My client actually had to help me :) HA! So, other than it being super awkward to put on, it's great. I'm sure I'll get used to it eventually.",

      "text": "When I received the bag, I was very pleased with the size of it. It was/is perfect for what I wanted to use on vacation with my camera equipment. What I packed in the bag was (1) Canon 5D Mark III, (1) Canon EF 600 Flash, (1) MagMod Sphere, (1) Canon Battery Charger and (2) cellphone charger cords. All fit perfectly into the bag. However, the handle on top, ripped within 4 days of use. Although this is not terribly important to me, I was disappointed because I was in love with the bag. Although I still intend to use it, I feel it's damaged goods and don't care.",
