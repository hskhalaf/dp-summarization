As I have continued to use this product, I\u2019ve noticed that I fall asleep earlier, and stay asleep through the night. I have struggled with insomnia off and on, and had been in one of those bouts until I started taking this. I would highly recommend this CBD oil for sleep. The dropper comes with measurements marked on it, so you can adjust your dose to what works for you.",

The older I get, the more trouble I have staying asleep. No problem going to sleep...just staying asleep. Also, I have had full ankle reconstruction surgery, as well as knee replacement surgery just this past February. So I am getting 2 for 1 with this product...pain relief and a great nights sleep! I am always willing to try anything if it will help alleviate pain. Well, I have found it! Thank you for a great product!",

The taste is much better than the previous brand i tried, and i definitely feel like it helps my sleep some (I'm a tough case, \"normal\" for me is less than six hours per night) as compared to when i do not take it. I also think it's helped my anxiety as well. I personally take 2 droppers at night at this point. Will order again!!",

I question how pure it is, I don't feel the overall sense of wellness I have with other products used. (and I have the 1000 Mg bottle) It TASTES terrible. I feel like I am ingesting dirt, perhaps a flavored brand would be better. If I could I would send back, but I did not try this out in time enough to send back, I will not be buying this brand again. It is not cheaper than the other brands I used",

UNTIL, I started using this CBD oil. I've gone from 4- 10ml. daily, to two a day and I'm working on one a day. It's difficult because The agony is still there, but I know this drug is not healthy for my brain or body. I'm so happy with CBD oil that I might have written an earlier review without this much description.",

My arthritis was mild, but seems to be under control now, neuropathy is just minimal, instead of intense, like before. Ordered a bottle for a neighbor, and it took his neuropathy away completely. He ordered a second bottle. I have researched this a lot, and although I have never even smoked pot or handled any type of drugs, I honestly believe that CBD (Hemp) oil works as suggested. And it has no THC in it, so you cannot get high. Just healthier. Thank you R & R",

I am not 100% pain free, but pain is much more tolerable even w/o prescribed meds and there are even some times of day where it is gone. When we get THC-A approved in my state I will switch to that but this works for now.",
