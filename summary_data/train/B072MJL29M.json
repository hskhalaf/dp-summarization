      "text": "BlukSupplements Beef Protein Isolate is my new favorite protein supplement. My sleight lactose-intolerance makes whey a challenge, so I was seeking something different. 30 grams of protein per 4.5 TBSP, and a great value for ANY protein isolate product! The taste is \u201cnatural\u201d, so if you\u2019re used to the sugary whey stuff you\u2019ll want to blend this with blueberries or cinnamon. For regular \u201cSupplementers\u201d like me, it\u2019s fine \u201cas is.\u201d Great paleo product at a terrific price!",

I mix mine with cocoa and stevia leaf so I can control the protein concentration. I have ordered before and will be my primary protein supplement for the foreseeable future. Pro's: no bloating like some proteins (whey) gives me. Mixes well and with other flavors. Cost-effective compared to other brands. Con's: Taste. That's about it.",
