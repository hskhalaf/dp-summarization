So, if you are used to Xbox, Playstation, and PC controllers with the right stick below the buttons then it will take a bit of an adjustment. I was playing NBA 2K and it was very strange having to go up from the buttons to the stick or down from the stick to the buttons. My muscle memory wanted to do the exact opposite. Still, the controller seems to function well.",

Then I used my phone's USB charger to plug the controller into the Switch and viola! It works perfectly. If you have any trouble setting it up, try plugging it in with a separate cable for the initial pair. After that, wireless works like a charm. Otherwise, it's a very good controller with surprisingly nice haptic feedback for the price.",

I also like the joy sticks on this better than the Power A wired pro controller because this one has some grip on the top where the Power A one is a little slippery. Definitely recommend this controller as a cheaper option for a pro controller.",

It's like an annoying buzzing that numbs your palms rather than a normal controller vibration. It's just totally unusable. Feels very cheap. Very sorry I bought it.",
