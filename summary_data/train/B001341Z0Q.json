      "text": "First sink arrived shattered (bad packing) but a replacement sink arrived within 48 hours in perfect shape. This is a well made high quality Kohler porcelain sink with an overflow. It\u2019s a Kohler so you know the porcelain will last 50 years or more. It is less than 15\u201d front to back which allows us to install it in a shallow counter with faucet mounted on the wall, yet it\u2019s plenty big for the task (22x14 1/4) and water doesn\u2019t splash out if it. The clean design works with our 1939 house, but it would look good also in a contemporary bathroom. Good buy.",

We have been remodeling our bathrooms, and I replaced all of the original sinks with these. Five stars for the sink. One Star for this seller. My advice is to buy from build.com.",

I noticed before ordering that there are many reviews indicating breakage as a problem so I made sure to inspect all of the items closely when they arrived. One interesting point was that all of the Kohler boxes had no packing materials inside of them whatsoever, the sink was just allowed to bounce around inside of the box. The Kohler box was then packed inside of a shipping box with packing materials to hold the inner box in place. Compliments to UPS for delivering these undamaged!",

Overall I was quite pleased with this sink. Please note that the sink drain closes by pushing the sink plug down with your fingers. It does not have the pull rod like other sinks you may be used to. I like this because it makes the faucets look clean and with less clutter. If you like the pull rod, then this sink may not be for you...or maybe you can McGyver it to adapt a pull rod into the sink. This sink is nice. Cheers!!!",
