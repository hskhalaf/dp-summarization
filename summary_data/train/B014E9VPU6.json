If you tilt the pitcher to far when pouring the lid falls off and you have a mess, pour design. Also, once the water level of filtered water in the pitcher equals the water level in the \"to be\" filtered reservoir it levels out and when you pour filtered and unfiltered water mixes together. So, at best you can fill it up to the .75L and not the 1.25L as advertised. If that makes sense. Overall the water tastes great but really it's not worth the money.",

Not sure how the unfiltered water doesn't mix with the filtered water as you pour when there is tap water still in the reservoir. Not impressed, not going to be buying any more filters after I am done with the ones I have. Don't waste your money. Zero stars!!!",

Don't forget to remove the tape on the bottom of the filter! My only wish to make this a better pitcher is if it held more water. I do like that it has a thin profile, which makes it easy to fit in the Fridge.",

The way it is designed, the hinge on the fill lid hangs up on the pitcher such that the lid can't be opened. In order to fill the pitcher, the entire pitcher cover would have to be removed.",
