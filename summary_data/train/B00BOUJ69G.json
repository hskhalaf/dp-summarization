This will enable easy removal of the plates and then the stairs in the fall. We used a hard floor plastic desk mat under the stairs to protect the pool liner. They seem very very sturdy.

I was not too keen on that fearing the sand might leak into the pool somehow. We bought some inexpensive lifting weights at the local sporting goods store and a heavy plastic tube from the hardware store and use those to weigh the stairs. No floating stairs. The product is very well made and certainly upgraded our pool. Very pleased.",

I ended up using zip ties to attach 40 lbs of neoprene dumbbells under the steps. Next season, I'll use 50 lbs, and attach them lower for better stability.

There is a video out there on YouTube on putting them together which lasts I believe 5 minutes. I watched the video and put it together easily. It's the best value I could find out there for this price point!!!",

We had to place some wood underneath the flanges that were used to attach the ladder to out pool deck.",
