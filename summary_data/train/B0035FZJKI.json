They are fairly easy to use, take good pictures and videos and I like the use of a SD card rather than plugging into a my laptop which is dependent on the current version of software that I may be running. I have dropped one on these when the lens was extended, I managed to damage the lens retract mechanism and the camera gave me an error message. The cost to repair far exceeded the replacement cost. Found one used here on Amazon for a great price. I purchased an extra battery and larger SD capacity cards. You can take more pics than your phone will hold and videos as well.",

Decided on the Canon, very happy with my camera, still learning all that it can do. Liked that it came with a free picture card, also glad that I don't have to buy anymore batteries, the charger with the battery is great. Glad the av cable came with the camera as well, Nikon did not offer that with the S3000. Will do an update after I take more pictures and learn more things about this nifty little camera.",

After all, what good is the mid-range or top-range camera that you haven't got with you when you need it??? This camera is very compact, can easily fit in a pocket, and is light. What makes this camera a winner is the overall combination of portability, ease of use, and good image quality.",

After comparing this camera with other Canons, and all of the Nikon Coolpix, and reading reviews for all of them, I chose to purchase this camera. I love it! It has many more features than my previous Canon, and takes great pictures. It's so small that I can easily slip it into my purse. A great camera, at a very reasonable price.",

Inside images are still a touch fuzzy but outdoor shots are quick and sharp.

A lot of my pictures turn out blurry, so there must be something out of whack with the auto focus. Pros: Connects nicely and quickly to my computer Nice screen for viewing Easy to turn off flash Cons: Takes blurry pictures / has trouble focusing Long shutter speeds Flash can totally white out details and faces Lots of red eyes I would definitely shop around before considering this model.",

The optics are very good for the price. One of the aspects of a camera like this is when you playback sound using the camera, it is less than meager. However, when you play it back from a computer or playback device, it is quite good. Also, you need to try different automatic camera settings to get the one that works best for you. For example, setting the ISO to 200 is a good move for us. Would recommend this camera for anyone to use.",

If you just leave it in \"automatic\" mode all you have to do is point and shoot, and you'll get very nice high quality pictures. It also has an easy to use menu system if you want to get into it and make adjustments and refinements. I also like the form factor - not too big, not too small, fits in a pocket, and feels good in your hands. This is a great camera for a regular person that just wants good pictures without all the fuss.....",

Sure, I miss moments with my son, but the only way to seemingly avoid that, is to spend over $600 on a Digital SLR. So for the price, this camera is fine for capturing moments of the little ones.",

The SD 1200 zoom was much easier to use as it was on the back of the button and one could use one's thumb to manuveur it. This model has the zoom onthe front and is not as convenient. Also, the image before shooting the picture is not as clear so I never really know if my subject is in focus. I think this problem is attributable to the larger screen. I am only sure of the clariy when reviewing the shot. All in all, I prefer the SD1200 model.",
