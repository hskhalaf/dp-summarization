My concern was that the blades of the centrifugal juicer was causing excessive aeration and heat to occur in the juice which could be affecting the nutritional value of the juice itself. This juicer is fairly stout with a motor wearing much more than most centrifugal juicesa I've ever had. The shoot is large to allow medium to small sized apples or other similar fruit to be fed in. Fibrous vegetables like celery or carrots can wrap around the auger and get jammed so just be aware. The included brushes make clean up much easier as well",
