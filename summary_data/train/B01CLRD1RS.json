The firmness seems just right as well--not too squishy to be ineffective but also not too hard to facilitate more delicate exercises involving a single finger.

With this Serenlite Hand Therapy Ball it has a stitching on the outside that is very soft and is very comfortable, but the best part about it is how it actually feels. This Ball is VERY soft and squeezable, I have excessively used this and I practically take it everywhere as it does not damage or dirty up. Great investment to anyone who needs a very good stress reliever and a hand workout ball!",

Don't complain about the little stitching errors, you might break the stitching by pitching it super hard at a wall anyhow. I did with another brand, but this one seems to hold up better.
