      "text": "Definitely don't expect to get the deep color you get from one use of the St. Tropez foam with the first use, but I actually love this product. It leaves you with a really nice subtle glow, and the shade is a soft beige rather than orange-y. Quick and easy to apply, no streaks or splotches. No lingering scent or stain risk to your clothing or sheets.",
