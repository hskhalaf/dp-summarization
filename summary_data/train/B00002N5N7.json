This ax must not be intended for heavy chopping or the heat treatment of this particular ax was not done correctly. I would appreciate hearing from Amazon or Estwing about a replacement.",

In don't use chainsaws and this tree could not be cut down with a bow saw; this axe made light work of it. I expect to use this more as a felling axe and not as a log-splitter.",
