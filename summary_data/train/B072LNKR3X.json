A big plus is its durable Vibram outsole that is stiff enough for day hiking in easy trails.While dirt and debris can be a bit challenging to deal with, this hiking shoe offers plenty of features. They fit the bill for anyone looking for lightweight hiking shoes that they can take to the beach, forest trails, and everywhere else that calls for highly breathable footwear.",

One was broken on arrival - this did nothing to convince me the other three would survive even moderate wear. As a former fan of Merrell I am deeply disappointed at this shambolic piece of skimping, shoddy design on what is far from a cheap shoe. Merrell, I am done with you.",

These really don't come up to the standard I would expect from Merrell being rather flimsy, I certainly don't expect to get much life out of them.. If I wasn't going on holiday in the next few days I would probably have returned them. Soles quite thin, supposed to be made of 'Vibram' they don't look like it to me unless Vibram has changed radically in the last few years. Basically a pair of cheap trainers that has been modified.",

Would have preferred the rear heel strap to sit higher or be a bit longer but I wouldn't go up a size just for that. There is enough space around the edge and lip at front saves toes from getting hit. Grips well on wet rocks and has taken the beating from that environment unscathed so far. Impressed.",

I have worn them but had to have the straps fully extended, on the edge, and my feet swelled up with the pressure. They are too small and too slim. Normally Clarks 7G fit me perfectly but sadly these did not.",
