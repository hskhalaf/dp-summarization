Wow, so I trouble shoot just like an idiot because I thought maybe it was me. Pull apart dash, pull out stereo, trace wires and everything is very wired correctly. Put everything back together. Try the kenwood amp again and power but no sound. Hook back up the old amp and magic I have bass. This amp is being returned for sure. I was thinking of trying another but no no no I will spend my money on another brand entirely....",

So this amp is a bit over kill. No pops and crackles, just installed and works as it should. After some tuning the amp never gets hot, maybe warm but not hot. Very pleased. Being a class D its pretty efficient and when driving the subs hard no major draw off the vehicles system . Deck is also a Kenwood 99 Ford exploder with sealed box.",
