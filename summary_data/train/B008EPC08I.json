It is sturdy during use due to the design of the base and it's not bolted or secured to the floor. Very sturdy stand!",

Thick stable tubing, easy to put together, good instructions. The only way you could get better is if you got absolute commercial gym quality. For the at home workout this is WAY MORE than adequate.
