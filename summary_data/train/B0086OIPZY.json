I bought another pair of these same exact size for my other daughter from a different seller. They came in a bag that Had Proforce printed on the bag itself. There is a huge difference between the two. The part that goes on the top of the foot is about 1 1/2 inches shorter than the real ProForce. The company will not allow me to return the product. There is no way it will fit my daughter it leaves almost her hole foot exposed. Very disappointed and angry over this one.",

These are fairly uncomfortable, as the design is poor: the 2 ends of the elastic edging of the front of the shin guard meet on the underside (foot bottom) of the shin guard, not the top. The stitching holding the 2 ends together, as well as the slight overlap of the elastic itself, create an uncomfortable bump against the foot arch when standing. Like a small and irritating pebble under your foot. Would not buy again.",
