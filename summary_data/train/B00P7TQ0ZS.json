      "text": "I began my cloth diaper journey 6 months ago and purchased around 24 diapers from 4 different brands here on Amazon, LBB, Lilbits, Alva, and Baby goal. These were all in the same price range. I started using them all at the same time and rotated them evenly. These have held up better than all of the other brands! Many of the other diapers need the elastics replaced, but these are still in perfect condition. I purchased the bundle of solid colors and the material is better quality than the other brands as well. It is sort of like a canvas type material. From my experience, I am very pleased with the performance of these.",

The diapers are useful both by the ability to change sizes by the choice of a snap, and by choosing the number of inserts placed in the diaper as the child grows. Easy to wash and dry (by machine or line). Cheerful designs and colors. Easy to purchase extra inserts when desired. Would definitely purchase again.",

After 3 months of use they are holding up nicely, though there is already noticeable piling of the inner fabric. It is still soft, but not as soft as other diaper brands that sell for only slightly more money. Avoid any of the minky/plush type styles! These tend to wick liquid from the liner into the outer cover. The inserts hold up well enough, but again, for slightly more money there are definitely better options. I think this brand works noticibly better for smaller babies and I\u2019m overall very happy with how they have held up.",

I have a few different pocket brands and they all came with microfiber inserts which don't absorb well in my opinion so I end up using prefolds as an insert. The inserts included with these diapers are a combo of materials and are very absorbent but continue to feel dry on my baby's skin. My son is about 14lbs and they fit him well. They do have sizing options to make them much smaller than a lot of the one size diapers on the market, I imagine they could fit a baby at around 7 or 8lbs and would just be a bit bulky. I'm going to buy another set.",
