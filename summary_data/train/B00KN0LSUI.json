This is unacceptable for a toy that costs $80! The manufacturer needs to do much better quality control. Now we have to wait for the replacement, and we have a child who was upset and crying that we have to return her gift. Will never buy from this manufacturer again.",

I am not pleased with the quality of the product, however now that it is assembled, my 10-month-old daughter loves using it, so we are going to giving it a chance.

The wheels roll easily. It is a little difficult to steer as the wheels don't turn right or left, but the kids figure it out. Removable sides allows them to load it up with dolls, dinosaurs, blocks or each other. I'm so happy I chose this for my grandchildren! They have spent hours pushing this wagon around.",

Have to make it work as it is for Easter. But maybe if they put a little more padding in the box this wouldn't happen. This could have easily caused our daughter to get a splinter or eat it. The Walker itself is very cute though. Cant wait for her to try it!",

Unfortunately the one that was shipped to me was totally defective. the front axle/bolts that are supposed to hold the wheels on dont work at all. missing threading and too short. Even without this, the assembly is NOT quick and easy (took me an hour and I am a professional industrial designer) and overall shoddy workmanship--many of the holes dont line up or are too small unless you hammer the pieces through. If it actually went together it would probably be awesome. HUGE disappointment.",
