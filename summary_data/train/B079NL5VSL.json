Snowboard stomp pads r expensive when u hav a lot of boards and u also want a big pad (so your foot doesnt miss it). Most snowboard stomp pads r small. So i ordered these surfboard traction pads and couldnt be more pleased !! They work really well and r so economical cause i cut them up and outfit 4 snowboards w.one order. Just awesome.",
