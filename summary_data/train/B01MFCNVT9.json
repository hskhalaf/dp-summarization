Yuneec UK customer service very helpful in confirming that if a blue or green light is not being emitted from the front left rota arm, in my case a white fault light LED then there is no WiFi being transmitted from the drone, so I spent a couple of frustrating hours fault eliminating before having to send the product back, maybe this start up advice could be published in the instruction manual, shame looks like a nice well made piece of kit that doesn't work which i'm not going to be able to take away with me on holiday.",

      "text": "For the price this is an excellent little drone. Took it on my honeymoon and got some incredible footage. Wifi connection worked extremely well. Updating the software took some patience but it did it completely after some patience from me! Would have given it 5 stars otherwise. Performed very well in pretty strong winds. The video stabilisation capability is great, as my films were completely level despite the angle of attack the drone had to adopt to counter the wind. Next step up would be to allow the use of the 4k recording with stabilisation engaged as sadly when trying to record in 4k it disengages. Highly recommended.",
