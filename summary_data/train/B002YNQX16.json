The box said they were rust free but they started rusting in just a couple months. Customer service was not very helpful. I guess they know the rust is a problem and are just trying to limit their damage. I would not recommend purchasing these soap dispensers. We have replaced them all with another brand.",

      "text": "I loved the first one I bought and mounted with screws in my newly refinished bathroom, when two dispensers broke, the only option was to repurchase the entire mounting device. I have the one extras stashed away for when needed as a replacement. Beautiful design and great for keeping bath clear of clutter, but too heavy to mount without screwing into wall. In my case, not looking forward to what happens when it is out of stock. UGH",

Just one pump gives you the right amount of shampoo, conditioner, or soap. Very clean and mechanically works great as there is no leakage. Plus they look great too! I bought a set of three for my son but after seeing how great they worked I bought a set for my shower.",
