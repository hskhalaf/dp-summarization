I would rather a reliable heavier D.C. Motor than a lighter AC motor that won't last. Really wanted to love this dryer but back it go's and purchasing another Babyliss as it had lasted alittle over 3yrs with out one problem. The cold button doesn't really work maybe this dryer is defected possibly?",

Now the filter will not even stay on the dryer while in operation. I went back to Amazon to see how to return the blow dryer, by the Return Window closed on January 31st (FOUR DAYS AGO)! Wow.
