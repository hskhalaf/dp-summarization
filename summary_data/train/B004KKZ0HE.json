      "text": "I was really impressed with this camera when I first got it. Nice LCD screen, good zoom (although I wish I had found the shortcut to quickly zoom in all the way before going to yellowstone), and a decent mic if you only plan to use video on a rare occasion. Overall a very nice little camera. My only complaint right off the bat was at short range it made skin tones look strange. After about two and a half years the zoom started acting up- once zoomed in youd have to turn the camera all the way off to zoom out again and about half a year after that started happening the zoom function broke down completely.",

Everything about this camera is great. The best positive I will leave you with is to describe the picture quality. We have three pictures from a Europe trip which we had made into 24 x 36 prints on canvas. Everyone that sees them cannot stop staring. They look like beautiful paintings and on one we made of a canal in Bruge, you can look into a window of a home and appreciate the 5 red apples on a kitchen counter. Terrific!",

I thought perhaps dust got into it so...in July 2012 I bought another camera, same one because when it took clear photos I loved the camera. Within 4 weeks it stopped working. I tried two different fully charged batteries that worked in the first camera (that is unusable because of the gray splotches) so it wasn't a battery issue. It just died, and I babied this camera. So now I'm stuck with two of these cameras--one dead and one unusable. I wouldn't buy this product again.",

I've always tucked my user manual into my camera bag for quick reference. \"Tuck\" hardly describes what I'd have to do with this printout. For now, I would say I like the camera but the documentation leaves lots and lots to be desired.",

I love the 16x zoom and was able to get clear shots of houses at the top of mountains while standing at the bottom. Pictures are clear, colors are nice, and the automatice setting is all I used. I should have used the night setting on a couple of shots, but for the most part it wasn't neccessary. I recommend this camera!",

With both a great zoom and a wide-angle, this camera does it all for me. And for all that it does, it's still small enough to be easy to carry. My wife liked it so much, that she bought one too - she's a realtor and says it takes great indoor wide-angle photos that are as good as another realtor's $5000 camera.",

It worked much better when I chose my own scene setting. However, I have heard this is a problem with most cameras. All in all, great photos and great videos. I would highly recommend it... especially for the low price (paid $150) to get 16X optical zoom and wide angle.",

The camera is light weight and fits in the shirt pocket easily, but it feels substantial, not cheap. Good directions are provided.

I especially like the 24mm wide angle, which is one of the main reasons I selected this camera. It is just the right (small) size and seems very well made. It apparently will do all I need without the bulk and weight of a SLR. My three old film SLRs can't compare.",

The camera is fairly heavy for a handheld, but still fits in my pocket. I like that the zoom can be changed while recording a video, but it takes up lots of space on the memory card. Overall I like the camera. But my 3x kodak camera seemed to take better portrait photos than this camera, despite all the options to make it work.",

I really wish it came with a video tutorial. I don't even know where I could go to find better instructions. So five stars for the camera, no stars for the owners manual.",

I would recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for a mid-level camera. Spending the little bit more for this one was definately worth it!",

    "title": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS8 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 16x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD (Black) (OLD MODEL)",
    "description": "Color:BlackFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n ZS8 \n\n 24mm Ultra Wide-angle 16x Optical Zoom LEICA DC Lens\nThe compact, versatile lens system is the hallmark of LUMIX ZS(TZ) series and now this lens system is totally redeveloped for the DMC-ZS8 in both optical and mechanical design. The new high-quality LEICA DC VARIO-ELMAR lens system is even more versatile with 24mm ultra wide-angle* to powerful 16x optical zoom (35mm camera equivalent: 24-384mm). Comprising 12 elements in 10 groups, including an ED lens and 3 aspherical lenses with 6 aspherical surfaces, this advanced lens unit suppresses chromatic aberration which tends to occur in telephoto shooting. It also boasts a short total length of lens unit despite its higher versatility with longer zoom range, which is made possible by development of a new mechanism for the structure of lens barrel. The lens system is also compatible with high shutter speed of min.1/4,000 sec.\n\n*Converted to standard 35mm camera equivalent, at the maximum wide position.\n\nPowerful 16x Optical Zoom\nThe DMC-ZS8 features a powerful 16x optical zoom lens (35mm camera equivalent: 24-384mm). This gives you highly natural expressions from people and animals that you can't get close to. It can also be used for shooting movies, and is designed to suppress noise while zooming. This compact, pocket-sized camera can easily go wherever you do for both everyday snapshots and traveling.\n\n\n\n\n\nVenus Engine VI\nThe high-speed, high-performance Venus Engine VI is incorporated in the DMC-ZS8 to enable the recording of beautiful images with higher quality signal processing including the Intelligent Resolution technology. An advanced noise reduction system in the Venus Engine VI applies noise reduction (NR) to luminance noise and chromatic noise separately. As a result, beautiful images with minimal noise can be reproduced all the way up to ISO1600 high sensitivity at full resolution for beautiful night shots or dimly lit indoor shots.\n\n\nIntelligent Scene Selector Scene Detection\nWhen the camera is in the iA Mode, the Intelligent Scene Selector automatically sets the Scene Mode to one of Scenery, Portrait, Macro, Night Portrait*1, Night Scenery or Sunset. The camera judges it from the various detection results such as focusing and brightness level of the circumstance*2. You are free adjusting settings every time the scene changes when taking images with these frequently used Scene Modes to get beautiful results.\n\n*1 In the iA Mode, the Night Portrait is not identified when the flash is turned off.\n*2 With some subject and shooting conditions, it is just not possible to judge the best shooting details. When this happens, it is recommended that you shoot with the Scene Mode that best suits your purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAF Tracking Subject Detection\nOnce you focus on your subject, the AF Tracking automatically tracks it until you press the shutter. When you're taking images of an active subject, like children or pets, this function eliminates the need to press the shutter button halfway down repeatedly to readjust the focus. The AF Tracking makes sure you don't miss those once-in-a-lifetime shooting opportunities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.0-inch, 230,000-dot High-resolution LCD\nThe DMC-ZS8 is equipped with a 3.0-inch LCD with 230,000-dot high-resolution. The big screen reflects fine details, making it easy to check the focus before shooting. It also serves as a photo and video viewer, allowing you and friends to enjoy viewing the still and motion images together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n iA (Intelligent Auto) Mode\nWhen you don't know which mode will give you the best shooting results, or when a sudden photo opportunity pops up and you don't have time to change any settings, simply choose the iA (Intelligent Auto) Mode and let the camera do it all for you. You just choose the iA Mode, aim at your subject, and shoot. Seven detection and correction functions are simultaneously activated to optimize the settings, so you get stunning photos every time. In addition, the Intelligent Resolution technology is always activated in the iA Mode which results in clearer and higher image quality in every photo with extended zoom range equivalent to 20x by the Intelligent Zoom.\n\nPOWER O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer) Shake Detection\nEveryone has had an experience of taking a photo at night and hoping to capture all the memories and beauty, only to be disappointed at the poor result. Panasonic has worked on the low-frequency vibration hand-shake component, which is physically generated when pressing the shutter button or when shooting at night with a slow shutter speed. The POWER O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer)* nearly doubles the hand-shake correction power of conventional MEGA O.I.S. You get bright photos without blurring even from handheld shooting at slow shutter speeds.\n\n*The POWER O.I.S. is automatically turned on in the iA Mode and can be turned on or off in the P/A/S/M Mode or some Scene Modes. \n\n\n LUMIX Image Uploader\nThe DMC-ZS8 gives you a new form of communication by letting you share your photos and movies. All you have to do is checkmark the photos and movies you want to share and connect the camera or SD/SDHC/SDXC Memory Card to a computer. Uploading automatically starts by simply following the guidance.* Facebook can be used for photos and YouTube\u2122 for movies. You can join these social networking services without having to install any special software. It's easy to share photos and movies on the spot, which means that your friends don't have to wait for you to come back home to see them.\n\nEasy Computer Connection\nSelect \"Upload Set\" from the playback menu, and then select the photos and movies.\n\nUpload Photos and Movies\nThe software is launched after connecting the camera or SD/SDHC/SDXC Memory Card to a computer.*\n\nShare with Your Friends\nYou can share the URL by e-mail right after the upload!\n\n\n\n\n* LUMIX Image Uploader starts up automatically on the computer the supplied software \"PHOTOfunSTUDIO Ver. 6.0\" or later is installed.\nIn other case, start up the menu by double-clicking the file \"LUMIXUP.EXE\" in the folder below:\n[My Computer] > [Removable Disk] > DCIM > AD_LUMIX (Windows)\n* YouTube is a trademark of Google Inc.\n* Facebook and the Facebook logo are registered trademarks or trademarks of Facebook, Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's in the box\nLumix ZS8 digital camera, Battery Charger, Battery Pack, AV Cable, USB Cable, Hand Strap, CD-ROM",
