This trowel has a stainless steel blade and shouldn\u2019t rust, also it is bigger than most other trowels out there.

Junk. Reduced to 1 star. Original Review: Good sturdy blade and comfortable handle, but the first time I gave it a twist while digging a hole in soft potting soil, the rubber grip twisted around about 25 degrees. Still functions just fine, I just would have expected a secure mounting of the grip.",
