      "text": "These are great winter boots. It's been below zero in CO and has snowed a lot. I wear these to the Doggie Park and also wore them to a Broncos game. They are a bit heavy; however, they do what they are meant to do. Keep my feet warm and not let me slip and fall in snow and ice. I love Sorel boots. I had a different pair before these that lasted me for about 3-4 seasons before they were just too worn. I got a pair of Columbia's on sale thinking that with that name they would work good... NOPE! I will now only ever get Sorel from here on out!",

They are a nice weight and easy to walk in for long distances and waterproof up to about 2\" (or so). Once above the rubber the insulated sides will get wet. They are perfectly snug and warm. It was amazing to feel the difference of how the new boots felt (after so many years in the old set). We are vegan so it was wonderful to see that they were still available. We have no hesitation in recommending them.",

These came highly rated, and I am happy to say they lived up to all of the hype. I almost can't wait for winter weather to roll around again so that I can wear them again! They are in such great shape after one winter, they still look brand new, even though I used to walk miles in them. They don't rub painfully like some other boots do, and they have great tread for snow and ice. I'm very impressed!",

I got these to replace a pair of LL Beans that I've had for 20 years, but were really bulky and have always driven me a little crazy.

The 8 was huge and I could pull the boot off even after tightening the laces as much as they could go. I exchanged for a 7.5, and it fits much better although still a touch wide. However, it feels well padded with a lot of support so I am keeping them and I think they will work well for my needs (low-impact use).",

      "text": "Often we can find warm boots or waterproof boots, but mother nature and outdoor activities sometimes require us to have both at once. The rubbery bottoms and the warm lining (which goes right over the top, thus preventing irritation) are a great combination, and not too ugly as designed here. The tightening occurs in the front which is pretty easy, and the heel is supportive. I think they run a bit small, but maybe the snuggly lining will pack down over time. I trust Sorel for real winter wear.",

They feel big though, and they have too much room in the ankle. It also feels impossible to lace them tight enough, and after a few hours there's a space in the calf. I'm glad I have them, but I wouldn't recommend them to someone else because of the fit and lack of arch support.",

My only one complaint is the picture makes these look like more of a white color and when I received them they were very cream (almost dirty) looking. I still gave a 5 star review because that will not show as much with my snow pants over them and does not effect the quality or the fit of the boots.",

I've decided to go with the Vasque Pow Pows instead, which are even more comfortable and waterproof to boot (the Cumberlands are merely waterresistant, although the rubber section seems waterproof).",
