The Capresso has hot coffee every time and it tastes much, much better. I thought if you dripped water on coffee grounds it would all taste the same. Not so.",

What is really poorly designed is there's a space between the glass pot and the plastic rim that holds the cover. This space traps the coffee or soap water and doesn't allow you to pour out all the liquid in the pot! No matter how hard you try! Why didn't they seel the plastic rim to the glass so it doesn't trap liquid? You are constantly cleaning the liquid that drips down from the rim seam. Really bad design. And I have to think not very sanitary. Would not buy another because of this issue. Thank you, Neal Boynton",

This happens once a week and I'm usually too sleepy to see the grounds in the first place. If I still had the box I would send it back.",
