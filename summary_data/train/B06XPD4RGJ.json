She absolutely loves them and fit perfect (and comfortable) on her feet..The skates come already sharpened so we use them right out of the box. She is just a beginner skater but is confident with the skates, We have used the skates for about more than 40 hours already. We dont have experience with other brands skates so can't compare. ( I'm sure other $200 or $20 skates may be better as comfort and quality )",
