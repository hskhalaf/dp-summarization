The same thing happened with a Neutrogena gloss I just bought in the shade Pure Cider, it's almost clear. The $3 Essence glosses have way more pigment than these.",

Yes the color was not what it was advertising but the stuff works. It smells like chocolate peppermint candy and I adore the applicator. I love the thickness of it and it tingles instead of burning like other brands. I really like it. I'm gonna buy rosewood again and maybe I'll try a different shade.",
