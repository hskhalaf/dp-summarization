I have had good quality air beds in the past but this is another level I genuinely can't fault it in any way. If you're on the heavier side as I am then I only hope this review will help you buy with confidence as I have put it through it's paces, no air bed is built for everyday use but this has certainly stood up to exactly that.",

This is not an issue unless you want to put some bedding on the bed. KIng Size fitted sheet was too small. I'm keeping but will look for a gigantic fitted sheet or at least a flat one.

Purhased due to the amazing reviews and having previously borrowed an awful one! Super easy to inflate and roll back up-just follow the instructions-simple. We popped it in the tent in the garden due to lockdown and tested it. No complaints, very very comfortable, its huge! We have booked campin end of june and hopefully restrictions will have been lifted so we can go and use it for a week.",

I've never had an air mattress high and firm enough to sit on the edge before - this one you can. I don't sleep well but had a great few nights in my 5m bell tent with this.

Since arrival I'm using it which is about 2.5 weeks now to ensure it's durable enough before I even use it for guests. So far it works very well. I re-inflate every 5-6 days just to maintain the desired hardness. I like this bed a lot.",

Slightly longer than other beds on the market so is perfect for me as I\u2019m tall and usually end up with my feet hanging off the end, but not with this one! Recommended.",
