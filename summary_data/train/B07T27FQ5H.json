Decent sound scape for listening to music - improved if you have quality original sound source. Big tick on that, and good charge length. BUT, if looking for something to do calls on too, i'd look elsewhere, unless sounding like your speaking whilst drowning is what you're going for. Also, you cant walk v far away from your source before things start cutting out.",

If you buy it you will love it. The only downside was that I ordered the brown one and got a black one. They are sealed in the packaging from the factory which says brown on the box but when you open it mine was black and others have reported it also. I would definitely buy again even if I get the wrong colour again.",

They\u2019re very comfortable to wear, I like the built-in voice that tells you you\u2019re powered on and then tells you you\u2019re connected to whatever you\u2019re using; for shutting down, it\u2019s a simple low pitched double tone. The instructions say to answer a call, tap the button that looks like a power button - circle with a vertical line through it - but on the headphones, that button they\u2019re referring to is actually just the Play button - a triangle. I carry them around more than use them, so I\u2019m really pleased with the hard case. Highly recommend, and don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything better at this price out there.",

If the music source is flat, muddy, tinny, or otherwise bad, no amount of headphone is going to do a whole lot to improve it, but there are many headphones that can take a quality music source and ruin it. I'm using these on my phone and PC, and both have the ability to customize the sound coming out. Personally I like punchy bass and crisp clean highs. I don't like the mids to wash out the highs nor any echo. I want headphones that will respect that and deliver. These do. Perfectly. They're so good they make songs I don't like listenable.",

Unlike a few other BT headphones I own, it struggles to cross over concrete walls within the 25-30 ft radius. I suspect the aluminium on the cans has something to do with it. But it not terribly bad. Just ok. Anyway, I'd buy another pair before returning these headphones. Worth every penny.",

I've not tried a pair of Bose or any other major brand as far as noise cancelling is concerned so I couldn't tell the difference. The phone calls a very clear. Overall a great investment.
