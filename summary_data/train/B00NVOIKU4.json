When the zipper gives out, the way that I can\u2019t fix. So, now I have to buy another $70 bags. Luckily for me, I have a Jack\u2019s bag that\u2019s about three years old and is still going strong. My Jack\u2019s bag was $20, I can afford to buy this every year without any issues. I wish there was some sort of repairs and six pack could make, but they said they don\u2019t. So unfortunately, I\u2019m down to two stars.",

I can fit about 3oz of rice and 3-4oz of chicken in each one so they are smaller portions. I\u2019d say not good for a bulking plan. PROS: Inexpensive Durable cold pack included 3 durable containers included Compact CONS: Small containers Not a whole lot of storage for other things. But it is the compact version. This is a great product but for myself, I probably should have purchased a larger version.",

You can wipe it clean, or even spray it out with a hose in case you spill something in there! For multiple meals or trips with the family we have also purchased 6 Pack Fitness' larger cooler.",

Side pockets also stretch and hold my water bottle and coffee nicely without poking out of the bag giving it a more professional look than carrying the traditional lunchbox. The gel packs could use improve however, they last about 6 hours which I guess would be good for a normal shift however I work 12 hr days. Other than that I find the bag very streamlined and convenient.",

Lots of extra room and the storage system is removable allowing lager meal containers. I highly recommend this bag.",
