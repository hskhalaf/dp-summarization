The pockets are two squares of material that are stuck to the front of the robe, which means they are not very durable. I ripped one of the pockets soon after purchase and I barely use the pockets. There is also a tab you can use to hook onto a robe hook. If you want a warm robe and don\u2019t want to spend a lot of money, this robe is sufficient, just don\u2019t expect it to last.",

Small would worked as well if I was going for form fitting and not lounging around the house. Nice length and the way the loops and belt are designed make them sit in place when not in use.

      "text": "I have always wanted a pair of onsie PJ's. These are so comfortable and so warm!! They fit me perfectly!! I'm afraid to dry them, because if they shrink even a little they won't fit anymore, but I wash them in cold and hang dry them, they actually dry really quickly! They are perfect for cold winter nights!!",
