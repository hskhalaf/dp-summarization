Also they use the universal ribbons which is great because I hate the newfangled ink attachments other brands have started using. This transaction went very smooth. Thank you",

On other, cheaper calculators, the printing on the tape started too far down in the calculator, you had to be right up against it to see the last number printed. This is a little better. Bought because my accountant had another model by Victor and recommended a Victor.",
