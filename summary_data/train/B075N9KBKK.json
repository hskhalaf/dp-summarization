My only wish was that they were packaged better with something that said BPA free, dishwasher safe, something. I had to get back on the page to re read through it to see.

They are slightly skinnier than the straws that came with our Ello tumblers, but it isn't a problem, since the tumblers aren't meant to be perfectly leak proof. These are so nice, we will be using them outside of our tumblers. They'd be super fun for summer parties!",

Great for anyone with senstive dental work needing to keep certain liquids away from the teeth or even staining of the teeth. In my house they're used constantly now. We like the look and finish of them too. Cleaning is quick and easy and while the included cleaning brush is another nice perk.",
