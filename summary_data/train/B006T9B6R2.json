I've gotten remarkable results with this and the Lexar 1000x SD Card for my camera. If you want full speeds for your card without a reader as a bottleneck, definitely go with this one and it's at a budget price.

It not only works, it's quick. Highly recommended. Note: The body of this reader is 2.7cm wide. Because it plugs directly into a USB port, before buying it, make sure you have room around the port you intend to use it in. Anker also makes one at slightly higher cost that has a 0.4' cable to keep it well away from adjacent ports.",

This card reader from Anker worked perfectly with the Mac and Windows 10 on VMWare. I am also happy with the build quality: I intend to throw it in a drawer and am confident it will still work when needed again in the future.",

Since I buy from Anker for my phone cables, chargers, and battery packs, I decided to get this one. With this, I can keep it in my camera bag whenever I need to transfer files. It's very convenient since it'll be hard for me to lose it that way. The transferring speeds are also noticeably faster, so I'm very happy with my purchase.",
