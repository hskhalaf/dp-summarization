Not only was this one much more difficult to assemble (alone), it came with soooo many imperfections. Thankfully, many of them are hidden once the cabinet was assembled. One of the imperfections that is not hidden, is that the door is clearly a different color from the rest of the cabinet. This item is suppose to be \u201cexpresso\u201d in color. Everything is expresso except the door.",

The packaging itself was fairly well done. It wasn't extraordinarily packed but it was protected well enough. As for the actual cabinet itself, it only had a couple of very minor chips, nothing a sharpie couldn't take care of. Otherwise it was a good shape and assembly was fairly easy too.",

My 2 gripes which is why I try only has four stars is that the drawer shuts hard, and the second is that I didn't realize the glasses were just meant to be on the shelf.
