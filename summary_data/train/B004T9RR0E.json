You plug in the router, put the CD into a laptop (in my case) that wasn't even attached and the software did its thing in about 5 minutes. A network name and password are offered or you can change if you wish. Guest network with password also set up automatically for you. Easy to change, just click Change. Haven't compared speeds and distance to my old linksys router yet, but so far it is doing its job and looks so sleek and unassuming in its corner. Great value for less than $50.",

I asked the techrep what router she would recommend and she recommended Linksys. I ordered one from Amazon, followed the direction from the CD, and installed the router. The only problem I experienced was getting my Roku connected. My fault for not reading the directions more closely. Since installing my Linksys over two weeks ago, I haven't lost the internet once. My thanks to Cox, Cisco Linksys, and Amazon (for a good price and fast delivery).",

Easy to install and set-up. I opened the box and had the unit working in less than five minutes on two PCs. I have only used the Linksys, so to be fair I don't have experience with other brands but once I find a manufacturer that works trouble free it's hard to switch. The boost is for real as I noticed a big increase in the mbps. I would recommend this unit to anyone who wants to upgrade from their old G series.",

Nowhere was I told that this was the network name and password! And nowhere was I told what kind of authentication was being used. I still don't know. It eventually took over an hour to get working, and I still don't have bi-directional wireless communication with my printer established. Bottom line, I sure wish that Cisco provided an \"experienced user\" setup!",
