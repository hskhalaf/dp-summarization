      "text": "We bought two of these with the brown leather/fabric cover, for our motorhome. We have two chairs that aren\u2019t recliners, but we found they each just needed an automan. These are the perfect height, 15\u201d high and across. They have a nice covering to them and match the fabric in the RV. We were surprised that they came in a flat box. But they unfolded, the support board went in the bottom, and the heavy duty lid went on. The surprise was how sturdy they are! And yet, we could fold them back up flat for storage if we need to. Yes I would recommend these!",

At that point, I took a spray bottle of household vinegar to it, spraying down the entire ottoman, inside and outside, and rubbing the vinegar in with a washcloth. Then I set it under a ceiling fan to dry. A short while later, no more smell. An excellent, affordable storage ottoman, especially if you plan to use it for items that don't absorb odors. If you plan to use it for storing yarn projects, throw blankets, stuffed animals, etc., you might want to take the extra steps to neutralize the smell.",

As these are 43\" wide, they fit very snugly, with just enough space for the baseboards and to be able to lift the cushions to access the storage. They're very sturdy and super easy to set up. They do stick out of the nook, but I knew they would based on the measurements, but considering the price, it's nothing short of perfect for the space I have. I will add larger cushions to sit on as they are quite hard, but overall I'm very happy with my new reading nook.",

I give 4 stars for \"sturdiness\" only because I would not use it as a \"seat\" for anyone much over 150-175 pounds as a safety measure. Perfect seat, however for children at the coffee table or additional seating for smaller adults. Exterior is very nice and wipes clean with a damp cloth. A great addition to any room.",
