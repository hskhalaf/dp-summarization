Any problems with fogging can be mitigated by either scrubbing the inside lens with toothpaste and/or baby/kids shampoo however burning off the manufacture process that leaves a film of silicone on the lens is the fogging problem in which you have to remove... And burning it off is one method that I mastered and everyone should please take note that it may damage the seal inside the lens however this process works best for me .",

We tried a number of things to free it but to no avail - until we returned to the boat and used some toothpicks to move the bobber and dental floss to keep the airway open for future snorkels.",

But it still fogs up, therefore I can't see a thing. So I will likely return. Unless someone from the company can give me feedback & has any recommendations!?",

However I HATE the snorkel, it lets waster in the bottom EVERY time I use it, its' practically useless. I'm no snorkel expert but it is so uncomfortable to use. So pretty much just bought this for the mask, can't return it since it's so close to my cruise :/",

Fits very nicely to facial contour with no leakage and comfortable to wear. The trick is to make the head band as loose as possible and not have any water intrusion. What the manufacturer does not tell you, or at least I didn't get a booklet, was how to adjust the band. The two little opposing buttons on the strap retainer have to be pushed in, which loosens the clamp that holds the strap. This bit of information is not self-evident, and it took a little playing around to figure it out.",

The dry snorkel eliminates the continuous need to blow out water on surfacing and the mouth piece fits very comfortably in my mouth. Also the snorkel is fitted with a very practical clip system which makes it super easy to attach and detach it from the mask strap. Finally, the price is excellent.",

It did fog pretty bad, but that's probably user error. Someone at the resort where we vacationed said you can try using a jetdry type gel on the inside of the mask and wash it out pretty well, and it should prevent fogging for a few trips. I'll have to try that next time.",

The snorkel is very impressive -- well built and the splashguard does a great job keeping water out when a wave or some spray comes overhead. The mask is great as well. Very soft/pliable rubber surround that seals to my face. Haven't had any problems with leaking, and the soft nose piece makes it easy to clear my ears. The strap adjusment locks are also a breeze to use and the snorkel has a cool easy-on/easy-off clip that allows you to detach it from the mask very quickly.",

We would have missed many special moments without these. Bonus: they're incredibly comfortable and easy to use.

    "description": "Looking for a Great Mask and Snorkel Package? Cressi has a great little package for you!CSBFM Cressi Frameless Mask:Frameless masks are loved by many divers for their low-profile and ability to fold flat for easy carrying, even in a BCD pocket. Cressi's Frameless Mask design bonds a high-grade silicone double feathered edge skirt directly to a single tempered glass lens for the ultimate in simplicity. The low internal volume allows for effortless clearing and the quick adjust strap buckles are molded directly into the skirt for a flexible fit and reduced drag. The easy access nose pocket can be used with one hand for proper ear equalization and the single lens design affords a wide field of vision. The Cressi Frameless Mask has a wide split mask strap design for comfort and to give even tension on the skirt for a proper seal. Mask comes with a protective mask box.CSBSDDWH Cressi Supernova Dry Snorkel:The Supernova Dry Snorkel has an anti-splash end with a special valve that seals the tube as you dive, almost totally preventing the entrance of water when the snorkel is submerged. The lower end has a corrugated section that has a smooth internal bore which prevents trapping water inside the snorkel tube allowing excess water to quickly drain to the collection reservoir below. The corrugated section also quickly drops away from the diver's mouth when switching from the snorkel to the Scuba regulator.The special water collectio",
