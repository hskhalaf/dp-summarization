It's a snap to use, but I did have to replace the cutting wheel midway through. I thought I'd get more life out of the cutting wheel, but bought a second one just in case, and I wound up needing it. The cuts are pretty clean, although I did use a rubbing stone to smooth out each tile after I cut it. All in all a good, well made tile cutter at a reasonable price.",

I will never do a diagonal pattern again, but that's not the point here. I read some reviews where there was surface chipping in the area of the cut. I put down 13 boxes of tile and did not have one piece that did that. I'm guessing it depends on the quality of the tile. It's a simple device; measure, make your mark, score it, press down and it snaps in two. Seemed like a very well made device.",

My project is taking longer than I thought it would and this is much easier than renting a tile cutter from Home Depot or Lowes.
