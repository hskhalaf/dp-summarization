My fault, I guess, but I didn't realize that the Q&A was for multiple DIFFERENT models, NOT just for the model I was looking at. One of the top answers stated that the until held 320 blurays. The slim tower will barely hold 100, and even less DVDs. Once bitten, twice shy. Last time I order anything like this online. As for the quality. Easy to assemble, but cheap and came with a few nicks in it. Not worth the bother to send it back. I could actually use another one, now, since this did not have the capacity I was anticipating. nah.",

Overall, not a bad piece of shelving, but definitely not what I would call quality. I think much of the issue has to do with shipping and its packaging. While it does look nice, and was easy to put together, it is not something I would recommend if you have to have it shipped across country.",

Yes, there is some hammering of a few nails involved, but if you prepare all your pieces, lay out the instructions and just follow the step by step, it's an easy job, and you will end up with a nice shelf for your CDs.",
