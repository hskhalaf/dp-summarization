I was using the Ethernet adapter on the 2nd Gen Stick, but found it useless to use with this Stick. It only caused interference problems and appears to only see WiFi. So I unplugged the adapter and went with just using the WiFi. The interference stopped and now it works great! Now to only get a 4K TV!",

Since I was beyond the return period, the only thing I could do is buy a new one, which I did. I have this new one for a couple of weeks, and again, I have to keep unplugging it and plugging it back in. I am running other things on my WiFi with no problems. The only problem is the Amazon stick. I think it's time to return the stick and buy a Roku.",

Response to voice commands has been generally pretty poor, with either a complete lack of response, or a misdirected result, so we rarely use that function. Why we would have so much trouble with this particular feature is unclear; but is probably some sort of user or setup error.",

Remote has a volume control and easily paired to my sound bar. Nice feature. Nice buy especially if you can get it on sale which I did (on special for $26.99!!!). Remote batteries included. Easy setup. Disney + App works on this 4K Firestick. Please click helpful if so inclined. Thanks.",

There is a Youtube app but that is not the same as a Youtube TV app. Why doesn't the Firestick support all the streaming apps?
