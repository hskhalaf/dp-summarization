      "text": "I purchased this set of weights just before covid hit, I use them in conjunction with the digital Peliton app now that I am not going to the gym. They are very well made and easy to use. The locking mechanism works very smoothly. For me, the best feature is the adjustability, from 5 to 52 lbs is a nice small package. My only complaint, which I have seen in videos, is they are very wide and can get in the way but I have quickly adjusted to them. Perfect product for me.",

But the big drawback are the huge plates. For almost any weight that you select, the dumbell ends up being huge. And this can be a big problem when you're trying to do certain exercises. Look for photos of how the weights during use before you purchase this",

I would still recommend them, but it isn't a true replacement for an actual set, just a great space saving feature. Also, these aren't the heavy ones, so dont need to drop, but if you are somebody that feels the 52.5lbs setting is heavy for bench (105) and would drop the weights on last set, I think it would wear these out and break them over time. For that reason for a heavy set I will pony up and buy urethane covered heavy set",

Make sure you don't do weights over anything or do any pushups or lean on them because they are not meant to be used that way.

      "text": "Pros: Compact. Doesn't take much room for a great range of weights. Quick and easy to swap weight amounts. The grips are nice. Good build quality. Cons: They're a little large, physically. Specifically, they're very wide, which makes a few movements a little more awkward. More points of failure. I don't have much reason to worry currently, but there are a lot more moving parts than, well, zero, on a regular dumbbell. I'm definitely more careful with these than I would be with regular weights.",

      "text": "Love the versatility of these dumbbells! I used a pair of these years ago, but never had a pair of my own. Bought a set when they were on sale to help build out my home gym. I didn't want a fell set of dumbbells that'd take up a lot of space so these are perfect. They're easy to adjust and comfortable in the hand. Gave 4 stars because occasionally one of the dumbbells locks up and can't be adjusted. It's a pretty easy and quick fix, but still a pain when it happens in the middle of a workout.",

My son who benches 300lbs thinks they are too light, but uses them anyway. Oh tried to buy a used set on Craigslist but these hold their value so for about $20 more I bought them brand new on Amazon. Great purchase really like the quick change feature.",

The time it takes to change into another weight can be your rest time between sets anyway. The con would be that the material of the weights themselves is not indestructible.
