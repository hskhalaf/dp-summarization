The consensus is simply that the scanner is incompatible with the specific setup, and Canon is not interested in addressing the issue as of yet. I would avoid for now if you're running this configuration. Replaced the scanner with an Epson one and that one works perfectly.",

We decided to get a stand-alone scanner that could scan both documents and photos. Of course, I immediately had to scan a multi-page document for business. Figuring out how to do that with the provided manual proved to be impossible. After a few hours of poking around, I finally figured out how to scan multi-pages, and how to make the scans go where I wanted them to. If anyone wants me to post the exact instructions, just post a comment to this review and I'll edit it, otherwise, no use boring everyone.",

This causes anything about a quarter inch before it overflows out of the scanning area to be a little blurry - not a big deal unless you're scanning art. Also, scanning color is not great, but any basic color adjust (i.e. photoshop) will bring it back to the same color quality as the original work.",

You can scan one-page PDF directly from the button on the scanner. However, you can also scan multi-page PDF from the PC software. Wished they could have combined this onto the button also. But the scan quality is fine for my document scanning needs which is 300dpi or 600dpi. I don't do much in photographs as nobody uses film anymore. Overall, it works as expected and good price value.",

I have a mac and just went to the Canon website for the software--- too easy! I am a student and on the go a lot, this is the size of a laptop so it is very mobile.
