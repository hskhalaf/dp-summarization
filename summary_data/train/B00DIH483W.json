This scrub is incredible!!...I have combo skin, olive tone color and 46 years old. This stuff reguvinate my skin and repairs it overnight after being in the sun all, exposing to pool chemicals and wiping sweat from a long workout. It usually takes 1-2 days for my skin to recover but I use this every other night because thats how GREAT it is!!....I get BEST results when I apply my moisturizer after using the scrub. I LOVE IT!!...This will be my face best friend for a long time.",

It doesn't smell the same as the scrub I purchased at the store which had a refreshing minty smell and tingly feel to it when I use it. This one is missing that element altogether. The smell isn't unpleasant, but isn't anything I want on my face/under my nose either. It also feels like there is more grit & slicker mud than my previous Clinque scrub, which isn't overwhelming, but, again, just isn't the product I thought I was buying.",
