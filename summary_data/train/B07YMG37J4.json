On average it's lasting 6 hours of screen on time as I watch Youtube videos on my free time and still managed to give me sufficient more battery. Lastly, this phone is really snappy and smooth. Like damn! Reeeeeally quick app opening and everything, you will love the 90Hz screen as you use it.",

It is supposed to have a bigger battery then the 3xl but it felt that it was weaker. The Pixel 3xl is still the best out of the Pixel family and I was so disappointed by the 4xl that I had to return it. Very bad upgrade on googles part.",
