      "text": "Have been running in these for a couple of months now. I'd had a few issues with my knee previously and not being the most slimmest of runners wanted a shoe that reduced the impact on my knees. This pair certainly ticked the box. They are super comfy and wide in the toe box so no blisters. They also feel very light and are well ventilated so none of that hot feet feeling whilst running! When I first tried them on I wasn't sure about the laces but they are actually really secure. Am now an On Cloud convert and will be looking to purchase another pair in different colour \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",

Not sluggish or cottony as the WR 19 and 20. The footing on paths and fields is very secure and adapts very well to the bumps and wholes. I run with them on wet surface and mud and are astonishly gripping very well. The blocks of the plateform play a very important role to stabilise the footsteps. No vibrations either. Definitely a replacement to Mizumo for those who like firm and responsive shoes.",

The ride is very smooth and although they don't look particularly cushioned, the cloud pods certainly do their job well. Only slight niggle is they come up quite long - I'm usually a UK 11 and bought a UK 10.5 (as I read about their length on other reviews), yet they're still pretty long. Will be running a Marathon in these in a couple of weeks and if I had the choice I wouldn't choose any other shoe!",

      "text": "It's like someone took a cast of my feet and made me a bespoke pair of running shoes. From out of the box, slipping on (yes, slipped them on) and set off on a 10-miler only to break my 5K record in the process - but that's not important. What is important is the comfort, the fit, the quality and the look and they have all of these attributes in spades. Watch out Ron Hill, I'm coming to get your 52 year running streak!",
