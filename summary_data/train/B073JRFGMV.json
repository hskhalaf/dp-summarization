      "text": "All of the fans in our house were replaced in the first few years with Emerson units back in 02 and 03. Two have remotes and one remote had pretty much stopped working. Emerson doesn't sell the older model remotes like ours anymore and what they offered online were considerably more expensive than this Pikeman. The Pikeman remote looked identical to my old Emerson and used a four gang DIP switch to change frequency so I figured I would try it to see if was compatible. When it arrived I installed the 9 volt battery and aligned the DIP switchs to match my old unit and it works like a champ! Quality low cost replacement for older Emerson units!",

The only negative I could cite is that the LED light fixtures don't dim all the way down. Just how far they dim will probably depend on total wattage and the particulars of the fixtures. I used it with 6 can fixtures and they dim to where they look equivalent to approximately old 20 watt frosted incandescent bulbs. However, when you turn them off, they are completely off.",

      "It is only a transmitter. This Package does not include a receiver. If your original transmitter looks different from this product, Please purchase a complete kit with a receiver in the store. Note: seasonal changes of forward and reverse cannot be changed with remote",
      "This transmitter is to be purchased only to replace the remote your Fan was originally installed with. You cannot simply add this unit to any Fan that does not already have a receiver pre-installed",
      "Look inside the old remote with the battery cover off. There is a series of \"dip\" switches (4). with a pen, slide the switches in the new remote to match the same pattern as the old remote. Replace the battery in the new remote and things should work",
      "This is the remote control for the Ceiling Fan. As long as the Fan has the receiver in it this remote will work with your Harbor breeze Ceiling fans, just remember to set the 4 dip switches inside the battery compartment(they are kinda hidden behind the slot for the battery itself)",
      "Make sure the original remote control model is KUJCE9103\u3001FAN-11T or FAN-53T, or make sure your original remote control model is FAN-HD5 or FAN-35T, otherwise the remote control may not match your receiver."
