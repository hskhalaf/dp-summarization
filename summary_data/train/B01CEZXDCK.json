The soft center boot is a so nice, there was no pinching in on the tops of my feet like hard boots, and the ankle locks held my foot stable without any pressing or rubbing like traditional hockey skates. My only thing I could complain about is that I'd like a little more arch support... but now I'm getting into sneaker level complaints... For a boot sport like skating... these are an absolute dream.",

With blade protectors I've been walking around the house to fit them in. My initial impression is that these are a great value.",

Took 2 stars off b/c of the sizing issue. I ended-up purchasing a more expensive K2 ice skate in the bigger size. I hope it will fit better!",
