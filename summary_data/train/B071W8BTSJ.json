I am a smaller frame so the shoulder straps took some adjusting but we got it to fit!",

Keep in mind that for newborns you need to buy the padded insert. Alternatively, you can do what I did - fold a baby blanket into a 6-7\" \"booster cushion\". This way the baby is comfortable and you always have a spare blanket (JIC). You can also use two thinner blankets, just as long as there's about 6\" of coushion. Regardless, buy this harness, it is worth every penny!",

The wraps are annoying to get on, especially anywhere in public, then they stretch out during use and you have to keep readjusting and you can't back carry. This is super easy to use and adjust plus the back carry option is nothing short of amazing. My back never hurts from using this. Great buy. Well worth the money.",
