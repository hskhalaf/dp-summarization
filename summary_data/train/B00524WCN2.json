This led to some pain in my hips, knees, and along the outside of my legs. I realized I needed to mix up my routine and add rolling, too. This shorter, wider roller is easy to use, and the textured surface makes it easy o control. It definitely helps relieve discomfort, along with adding some weight training and stretching. I like the length, too, which makes it more convenient to store and use.",

      "text": "I got this to replace my Trigger Point Performance roller. I love that roller, but it was leaving ugly red marks on my back and my husband's too. That roller must pinch the skin as it rolls. The marks would remain for days after using it. They looked like scars. (A massage girl was mortified the first time she saw the marks that roller left on me!) This roller works just as well as that one and was about 1/2 the price. I keep it by my bed and use it almost nightly before I get in bed to loosen up my back. I've only had it a short time but it's working great so far.",
