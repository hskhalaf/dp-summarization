I bought this back in 2012, and just recently found an unused chalk cube that I've put into rotation in my gym bag. The only thing I can say negative about the product is it'll kinda make of mess around the gym. But if your like me, who doesn't care; than rock on and hit them Gains Bruh.!!",

But.............hmmmmmm........ Also, i purchased other brands gym chalk cube, they are much tougher which made me use it longer.",

It's extremely fine which causes a bit of slickness. I wouldn't say that it has caused me to fall off of anything and it's certainly better than no chalk at all, but it's below average even for a basic block chalk. Since I have a full pound of it, I'll go ahead and use it. I've found that blowing on or clapping my hands before a climb to get rid of excess chalk does the trick. Next time I'll buy a different brand.",

Currently, I use them mainly for my grip workouts, especially on the tougher IronMind grippers. The box comes with 8 chalk blocks and they will last a very long time.
