The stock cable is flimsy. If you can leave with 2.5mm cable, buy it. Note. Currently Apple version is $85 cheaper than Android. Buy it for Android and get the cable which is $30. == Saving $50. The Apple and Android headphones are identical, it's only about the controls on the cable. No matter which version you take, sound will work with either Apple or Android devices.",

      "text": "I got the Sennheiser Momentum 2.0s for Apple Devices in ivory white, and after several weeks of using them, I have to say that I\u2019m really satisfied with them. First of all, it has a really sleek design, with a metal headband and ivory housing. The headband folds in, making it convenient to carry around in the provided case. The ear pads are quite soft and fit comfortably, but they do still heat up and hurt the ears slightly after prolonged periods of time. It has a very clear, well-rounded and authentic sound quality, making it suitable for a wide range of genres, though I find it particularly suitable for bassier electronic music",

Lesser headphones don't reproduce all the music. The more you pay (up to a point) the more you hear. So skip these and save up your money. Spend as much as you can afford.",

Overall, the drivers are pretty flat* in response, handling lows and highs equally well. The sub-30Hz-ish range, unsurprisingly, is thin, but for a \"clean\" sound, they can carry bass-heavy music tastes (with a little EQ help). The construction seems solid. The wires from the headband to the drivers likely are the weakest link - or, maybe, the proprietary 1/8\" jack. Assuming the leather holds up, these classically-styled cans will look as good as they sound for years. Since these were a gift, I'll update as necessary... or get my own. *Tested on a phone playing FLACs.",

      "text": "I have had these headphones now for over three months and am happy with my purchase. The Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 headphones have metal components in critical places on the band like in the hinges to keep the headband from snapping which is an issue I have had with other brand headphones. As far as sound quality they performed better than I expected, the Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 is not a flat set of headphones as they slightly overemphasize low end frequencies but this is still done in a tasteful fashion that leads to a positive listening experience.",

I love their look, I like that they have a mic, that they're closed and had a low impedance. They're comfortable, even with long listening sessions, they're not heavy and the pads are soft. the sound quality is quite good, not sell your stereo good, but you won't want to punch yourself and others while listening with them. They also came with a good quality case, which I appreciate. All in all, a great pair of headphones that I carry with me.",
