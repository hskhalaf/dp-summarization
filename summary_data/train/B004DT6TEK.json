      "text": "What a great idea! This tool is very practical and easy to use. It should have instructions to make sure you scrape through the coating on the Ferrocerium rod before expecting to see any sparks though. Initially sparks were not produced but once we used the sharp edge of the striker and firmly pushed down on the rod while striking, the coating scraped off and the sparks started flying. If you purchased one and think it does not work, just employ the above simple technique and you are off to sending plenty of sparks to light a cotton ball for fire starting. I am going to keep one with my camping gear and in the car.",

I had to do multiple swipe to get enough sparks to start a fire. I\u2019ve tried it with another brand with a longer stick and it took 1/3 of the swipe to start a fire.

It's a solid construction out of good materials and it's a really great design with a small footprint. I especially love the small compartment for storing tinder.

      "text": "It looks great on paper, but when using it, I find this fire starter to be less than ideal. While it will produce sparks after the coating on the rod is removed even when wet, the sparks failed to ignite dry tinder. I tried cotton balls, cotton balls with petroleum jelly, dry leaves, and dry paper but the sparks aren't hot enough to ignite anything. I looked at various YouTube videos to see demonstrations and followed their procedures without any success. The rod is now completely shiny, and I spent over an hour outside trying to start a fire. Like the other Bear Grylls Gerber products, this was overrated. Overall: 2/5 stars.",

I have use many magnesium fire starters and the bottom line is that this is the best one out there. The sparking blade is curved and when you hit it the right way you get a significantly better spark than any other product. It also has a cotton ball for tender in a small compartment for emergencies. The sparking blade is what makes this product so great.",

The construction isn't all that great, the two ends push together to cover the flint/striker, but mine didn't really seal well because the plastic was a bit warped. But it's not gonna affect the way it works so i'm still giving it a 5, as it could save a life someday.",

Granted, it was at home in a controlled setting with a shredded up cotton ball, but it worked. The whistle is loud and takes no effort to blow, the little signals painted onto the casing are a nice touch, and the striker works great once you get the anti-corrosive coating off the stick. Throw in the fact it weighs almost nothing and you've got a great addition to any backpacking/hiker pack.",
