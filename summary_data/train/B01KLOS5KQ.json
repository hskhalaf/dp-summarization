Your skin should feel a tad \"slimy\" when you remove the mask. Just rub that in and you'll be good to go!",

One of the few skincare items I will continue to repurchase any time I run out of. 100% recommend.

My skin is glowing and smooth. The texture of the mask is a little slimy, but I like that because to me and it means the mask won\u2019t dry out in 20 minutes. I have had so many compliments and I quit wearing foundation and concelears. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone.",

It is very moisturizing and feels like silk on my skin. I love this especially in the winter time when my skin is very dry and flakey at the end of the day and in the morning. These sheet masks really help. I use them 1-2x per week and will be reordering once I'm out.",
