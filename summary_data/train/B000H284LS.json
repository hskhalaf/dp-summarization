This knife truly cuts tomatoes without smashing the tomato or making a mess of things. I researched several other knives on Amazon but didn't find any that were so inexpensive yet so effective. I put my full stamp of approval on this knife! One thing to note is that the silver steel one isn't supposed to be put in the dishwasher. I hand wash this knife and dry it quickly in order to make it last. To me, that's not a big deal though because I try to hand wash all of the cutlery knives.",
