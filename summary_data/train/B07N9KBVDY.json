      "text": "For the most part, I love this skillet. It\u2019s easy to care for, has a very large cooking surface, and heats quickly and evenly. The only issue I have is it specifically says you can bake with it in the product description but the temperature dial is just low-high. No temperatures, which will require a lot of experimentation and probably wasted food on my part. Also the recipe book has no baking recipes, which would have been helpful. But if you are looking for a great skillet to fry, saute\u0301, and so on, this one is he best I\u2019ve tries so far in this price bracket.",

The handle broke within the first week because the monstrosity fell out of my dish strainer and it's weight fell all on the handle. It's easy to clean and the color is pretty.

I had to clean it in a hotel bathroom so the ability to get it clean fast was put to the test. The temp control is nice it does get a lot hotter on the outside but that isn\u2019t a problem for me. My biggest issue is storage at my house, as I said it is very large and thus needs a large place to be stored.",
