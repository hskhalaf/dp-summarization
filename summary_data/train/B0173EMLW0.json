I was careful to read & follow all cleaning directions to care for the carafe properly. After each use, it was rinsed and dried or air dried before retuning to the base. After less than 8 uses, there appeared a rust line on the interior of the carafe. I tried to clean it but after the next use, it was more distinct. Stainless steel should not be showing rust after use.",

There is some plastic parts but none that come in contact with our tea or water. Thank you Mr Coffee for making a safe plastic free tea maker.

I decided to try a cheaper version. This tea maker works fine. I think the tea is good but I don't like the rim around the top. It traps tea and debris and is hard to clean. I wish the entire top came off for cleaning. Other than that, I am happy with my purchase.",
