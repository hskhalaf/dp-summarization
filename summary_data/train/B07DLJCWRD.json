That being said we always try to find reasonably priced paddles that still have good quality. These check all of the boxes. They aren't professional level or anything but we both feel we are able to control the ball, even getting some solid spins on the ball while we're at it. I want to add that my 4 and 6 year old nephews also use them and they survived.",

My kids used them to take their \"PingPong\" class and were getting used to it. However, only one month later, one of them was broken its handle for no reason. I tried to fix it but it is very difficult to do that, then I gave up. Hopefully this can improve their quality in future.",

Have sent an email to them, so if the replace it and the new one does better, will update, but the handle on this one was clearly only glued in one small place and fell apart very easily. Gave it 3 stars because the padding on the paddle really is quite good and gives you a great amount of control and power. I've never been able to spin the ball as well as I can with these. Would love to give it 5 stars because of that, but unfortunately cannot due to the poor handle construction.",
