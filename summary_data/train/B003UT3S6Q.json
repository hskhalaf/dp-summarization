      "text": "I have a BMW M3, which comes with particularly aggressive brake pads. The amount of brake dust this generates is unbelievable... it only takes a few days for the wheels to become totally black. I've tried dozens of cleaners. My weekly cleaner is actually P21S Wheel Gel, which costs a fraction of the Sonax. But for heavy accumulation or a \"deep clean\" nothing is better than the Sonax. It has a chemical to dissolve iron, similar to other products like Iron X. Since brake dust is primarily ionized ferrous material from disc wear sticking to the disc, the dissolution of the iron is important to get a totally-clean look. Expensive stuff, but does exactly what it is supposed to!",

Maybe I am allergic to whatever is on their ingredients but man, I am a little surprised by it. I wouldn't buy it again.",

They also happen to WORK well, which is why I use them. The result is a nasty looking wheel after only a short time driving. I do use a brush for the brazillion crevices in these wheels but I could not GET them clean without Sonax. Good Stuff!",

Sonax was able to remove some of it, perhaps half or so. The remaining part stays no matter how long Sonax is left to treat it. Working with a brush helps to a point. Perhaps Sonax is good for mild cases when dirt did not get stubborn yet.",

From having brake calipers etched from previous sprays, I'm careful not to let this set too long or using just after a drive.

Unlike many which have a VERY strong sulfur smell this one has a faint citrus scent which keeps you from being overwhelmed. As a result of the slightly weaker smell, I'd imagine it's slightly less aggressive than cleaners like Nanoskin Iron Free or other similar products BUT the biggest difference I've noticed is that this will not stain tires like others do while still dissolving Iron and making for a simple cleanup. And it's not a gallon - remember it's 5 liters so you get almost an extra quart of liquid over US manufacturers.",

      "text": "Nice wheel cleaner. Used it as a replacement for Iron-X on a heavily iron contaminated Porsche Cayenne in a pinch. Worked pretty well, not *as* good as Iron-X but still better than nothing. Definitely softened and loosened the particles up so I could pick it all up with some clay. Works great for the wheels, but it is a bit \"expensive\". The CG Diablo Wheel Gel is just as good without the iron reaction color-change, and is diluted so will last a LONG time (up to 4:1 dilution ratio, they recommend 3:1)",

Best thing is soap and water with some elbow grease . All this stuff is all the same . Also smell is bad .",

I use a simple spray nozzle rather than a pressure washer like suggested. I would approximate it gets 90% of the dust off. If I used it more often it would probably get nearly off of it off, but because it is not cheap and you need to spray a decent amount on there it would get expensive quick.",

This does not get rid of every single layer of brake dust as brake dusts layers on top of each other, so I would recommend people using this twice as needed or use an all purpose cleaner/car wash shampoo to make sure all brake dust is cleaned on each wheel.",

Any kind of racing pads will produce a dust that quickly etches into the finish and even this product (as good as it is) doesn't remove it very well. Maybe some will come off but not all. There's another product which is similar and changes color the same way and is a little cheaper. Can't recall the name but saw it on a youtube video from some detailer. It was only a couple of dollars difference but over time would amount to a lot. This bottle is somewhat smaller than I expected. You will go through it very quickly.",

Sonax works extremely well, I still have to scrub but the dirt and brake dust come off easily. I also don't use as much spray.
