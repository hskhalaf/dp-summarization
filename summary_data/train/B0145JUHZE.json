The size chart said I'm a large, but I'm lanky and I was worried about the arms and legs being long enough, so I ordered both an L and XL. The XL was waaay to poofy in the body and that didn't translate into longer limbs. The L was perfect, of course. So listen to the sizing chart. I expected it to be cheaply made, but it's not. It's pretty well made. I see people complaining about loose threads, but that wasn't an issue on mine. I had a couple loose threads, but I also have scissors, so I guess I'm one of the lucky ones.",

The body however is extremely roomy - you could probably fit two average sized adults in it. Since you can't be too choosy when buying an adult dinasur onesie, my expectations were pretty low, so the fact that they're short wasn't a deal breaker. ;)",

That said, pockets could be deeper so things don't fall out, and a zipper would be a little nicer than buttons. Overall, I am happy with my purchase, and I would reccomend this costume/brand to someone who was in the market.",

It even has pockets! The last onesie I ordered was a gloomy bear and sitting was uncomfortable because the short tail stuck out, but there's no issue with this onesie. Comfortable for lounging as well as being around the house/public. Kigurimi shop would normally charge $60 for this exact same outfit so this price was awesome! Very satisfied!z",

Its difficult to tell from a photo exactly what you are ordering and this product was better than expected.",

I have big boobs so it does open a bit around the bob area but other then that I love it. One of the tooth\u2019s were a little bent but it\u2019s not too bad. Oh and it\u2019s pretty thick and warm!!!",

Not a deal breaker but can be a little uncomfortable as it squeezes my leg. So if you are 5'9\" go for the x-large. Other than that it's super comfy and looks awesome!",

One thing to note if it matters to you, you have to basically step out of it to use the washroom, tail and legs could get in the way in some scenarios. All in all, I love it and recommend it!",
