Both consoles and games fit comfortably in the case, I don\u2019t even have to strain to zip it! This was a great investment and",

Gave him the DS weeks before his birthday with a few games. Product is durable,sturdy,and good quality. It will last as long as it is keep up.

I'm not sure how long the elastic will last before it deteriorates like most elastic tends to, or if the elastic will effect the labels of my games, but it seems safe so far. It's a bulky case. I don't believe it's a good idea for travel, but for safely keeping your games at home, it's tough to beat. It's a bit pricey for what it is, but nothing else on this site compares to it, so it's worth picking up. If it was about $5 less, I would've bought two of them.",
