After a couple of weeks you are required to pay at least 60$/year or you will be limited to the last 2 hours of alerts. Pretty much makes this useless to most people. What happens if something happens and you can't watch your phone in the next 2 hours? I'm in meetings most days...The free plan should include 24 hours of alerts. Unless you plan to buy a membership look elsewhere.",

Shame that this didn't quite work out. The thing with security systems is - you really can't gamble with it. I don't have a sense of security with this system. It might be just the lights, but who knows.....",

It means that you have to view all alerts right away or you wont know what happened, it kinda does defeat the purpose . I think a minimum of 24 hours should be built in the camera.",

    "title": "TOUCAN WIFI Outdoor Security Camera, Powered By Your Light Fixture, DIY Installation, Works with Alexa",
    "description": "Toucan Outdoor Home Security Camera is a preventive surveillance system built to retrofit most existing outdoor light fixtures. With a wide angle, adjustable HD camera, passive infrared motion sensor, a 100dBA remote panic alarm and 2-way communication speaker and microphone, Toucan detects activity at your doors providing automatic notification directly to smartphones via the Kuna mobile App. See and talk to visitors no matter where your are, using live video and captured footage. Toucan patent pending smart socket allows remote light control. It's an easy 3-step installation, no hardwiring or batteries needed \u2013 if you can change a light bulb, you can install Toucan.\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\n\n\nSmart Detection and Auto Greeting Receive instant mobile alerts when people are approaching so you can safely take action using your HD live feed, two-way intercom, automatic greeting (chime or message), pre-recorded deterrent messages, 100+ decibel siren, and control your light.\n\nEasy Installation If you can change a light bulb, you can install Toucan. (1) Install the Smart Socket; (2) Connect Camera to Smart Socket via included USB cable; (3) Download and set up the mobile app. Done!\n\n\n\n\nFREE 2-HOUR LOOK BACK See recorded events for up to 2 hours, including 10 seconds of footage before the activity was detected.\n\nSATISFACTION GUARANTEED 60-day returns & 1-year warranty.\n\nVIDEO DOWNLOADS 3 event downloads per month for free. More with optional paid premium plans (visit www.getkuna.com).\n\n\n\n\nSMART EVENT DETECTION Many detection-based cameras capture your visitor\u2019s back or only after they have arrived, losing visual evidence of the story. We capture 10 seconds before an event is triggered, so that you see your visitor\u2019s face as they walk in.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Startup Describe your product in 3 words.\n\nOutdoor Home Security\n\nHow did you come up with the idea for this product?\n\n\"We would sometimes have unsavory strangers coming around our neighborhood. Most of the time they were harmless, but my wife and I still felt unsafe: opening and answering the door put us at personal risk, but so did ignoring them, because if no one responded they would walk around outside, looking for something to take. Sai-wai has had similar experiences. That's why we created Kuna and licensed it to strategic manufacturing partners. Toucan is powered by Kuna Technology and works with Kuna mobile apps.\" - Haomiao, Kuna co-founder & CTO\n\nWhat makes your product special?\n\nPreventive vs reactive: Our unique position outside the home allows you to detect that something bad is about to happen, and react to it. And, in the unfortunate event of something bad happening, it allows you to download and share useful evidence with your local law enforcement.\n\nWhat has been the best part of your startup experience?\n\nTaking something from a simple idea to protect my wife to a reality that will protect thousands of homes around America is exciting, terrifying and energizing all at once. We've worked how to understand our community's security needs and build a product that not only meets these needs but goes above and beyond with extra features that delight and reward the user.",
