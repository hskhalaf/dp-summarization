At 20 packets that makes these VERY expensive to purchase. Think about it, they are missing around 30% of the product in the box, so you will have just 3 weeks worth, instead of a full months supply (30) like all other probiotics. When either the price is reduced to reflect only getting 20 packets, or they add the additional 10 packets so that you get a full months supply, that is when I will buy these again.",

I have mixed it in with water too, but the cloudiness threw me off a little.
