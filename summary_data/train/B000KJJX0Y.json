The head extension is comfortable. Also don't usually use the flat piece under the head rest which is suppose to be a place you can place your hands and rest them during massage. You might use these extras if you have a larger person. It folds up easy for closet storage. It is easy to adjust the height as well.",

I am an athletic trainer and use this predominantly at the rugby pitch for tapping, stretching and evaluation of injuries. It's had held up in the rain twice so far this season. I just make sure to dry it out afterwards. Cons: Carry bag is very thin and easily tears. Cushion on top of table is also thin. Maybe uncomfortable if on it for long periods of time. Clasps that hold table closed when folded are not very durable and some times difficult to maneuver. Not as sturdy as more expensive brands for bigger folks. Some of my bigger players cause it to sway a little.",
