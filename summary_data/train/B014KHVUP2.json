It has a great design and the carbon fiber shaft or whatever it's made out of is nice and light. Definitely and upgrade over the $40-$60 cheapy sticks.",

The shaft is great really like the feel and its length. The head is good, make sure you break in your pocket. The one thing that I'm noticing is my strings are getting a bit fuzzy. When you burn the ends make sure you do correctly, you don't want the ends to keep fraying.",
