The battery went bad again just 3 months after my last replacement. The warranty was up, so this last go round I replaced the battery myself. It now has a bad charging port, so I ordered a new dongle to solder on.",

This model is almost completely stock Android, which is great if you don't want many manufacturer-specific apps. It can be upgraded to Android 7 (Nougat). One small addition is a great Moto app software feature where two shakes of the phone turned sideways in a chopping motion turns the LED light on or off. It's a simple feature, but it's a slick interface. The phone is an incredible bargain overall.",

I tried most of the \"fixes\" that people reported in internet blogs, but none worked and decided to return it. I ordered a replacement phone hoping that another Moto G4 Plus from another manufacturing batch would not have the problem, but after the first day the flickering/screen jumping started on the second phone.

The camera keeps crashing at which point the phone needs to be restarted which is super annoying when you are trying to a moment. Even more frustrating is that when you turn off the phone to get the camera to reset IT EARASE ALL YOUR MUSIC OFF YOUR MEMORY CARD!!!! All I kind find online are article about how this is a known issue but no solutions.",

Cons - After 6 months of use, the phone becomes slow and hangs. - The jack for the earphone is crappy and there seems to be a loose connection in it. I identified this problem too late, else I would have returned it. - While walking in the sun, the phone becomes very hot and hangs a lot. Never buying a Moto phone again.",

      "text": "Really loved this phone, but after about nine months of normal use the user interface kept crashing, sometimes as often as every few minutes. Then after nearly exactly one year, the speaker completely failed so no phone calls were possible without headphones, no alarms could be heard, etc. Finally, around the same time, and probably another symptom of faulty user interface, the phone stopped communicating with my sim card requiring a complete restart. Of course all of this could be because, even though I purchased a \"new\" product, the one I received had a passcode set, therefore not actually a new product. Beware the business you buy from. Way too much money to spend for only one year of use.",
