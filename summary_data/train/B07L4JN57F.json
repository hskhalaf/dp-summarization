But what bugs me is when I pay full price and when I get the product and it doesn\u2019t work. Humminbird charges me round trip shipping and makes me pay insurance on it just so that I can get a product to do what it\u2019s supposed to do. I didn\u2019t expect that from a company like Humminbird. When you sell your customer a product that has a warranty don\u2019t make the customer pay for your mistake.",

My old Lowrance only with 50/200 kHz read at 25 mph. The transducer wire is REALLY too short. I have a 23 ft boat and had to buy an extension for the transducer. It was not cheap. So, make sure you need to add almos $50 for the extension if you buy this unit. I really did not see the benefits I was expecting. Can not return because is installed already and was Very difficult to run the transducer wire. I strongly do not recommend this unit.",

It gets confusing and by the time it\u2019s all said and done and nickeled and dimed you\u2019ll wish you had spent the extra $300. All of this should be common sense but there\u2019s so many models that are really closely related. Just because something is \u201cavailable\u201d for your model don\u2019t mean you\u2019ll get it. With all that said I\u2019m super excited about the technology and I\u2019ve bought into the unknown, now i have a need to know!",

      "text": "I am no stranger to using fish finders, been using them for years. Did a lot of research on this because i wanted mega down imaging and side imaging. Long story short, had my old 2d sonar active while testing the new helix 7. old 2d sonar was marking fish, side imaging and down imaging was pretty garbage even the 2d sonar was picking up the fish on this. Fishing crystal clear water at DVL, i see 10+ pound carp swimming underneath my boar and helix 7 didnt see them. even spent hours look at the play back, wow what a disappointment. I should have got a lowrance.",

The quality, screen clarity, user interface and features are leaps and bounds over the Hook5 that I had. I am very pleased with the features of this unit including the AutoChart. This has proven to be very helpful when trying to repeat that hot line over and over again or seeing the depth changes. I would buy this unit again if I had to. Great sonar for your fishing boat.",

Not sure how all the features work yet as this is going to be a \"learning\" experience, but so far it is great. Really like the maps view as I fish large lakes in Michigan and so far all the lakes I fish are included in the maps. The only thing I haven't liked; maybe understood, is how the down imaging works as a view of the bottom.",
