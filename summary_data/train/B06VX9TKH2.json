      "text": "This purse is very soft - it ends up feeling kind of flimsy and cheap (well, it is cheap, so can't really complain). The annoying thing is that the buckles that hold the shoulder straps are attached to one of the outer panels of the purse, rather than the center, so if you put your phone in the opposite panel from the one that has the shoulder straps, your purse will hang parallel to the ground. Kind of hard to explain, but it's very annoying that I have to check which side to put my phone in every time (or have something of equal weight on the other side to balance it out).",

All my items fell out all over the airport. The zipper was not fixable so this item is basically useless now. Really annoying.",

The card slots comfortably hold my drivers license, insurance card, credit card and debit card. The center zippered section holds all of my change well with ease. The two open-faced sections easily hold the following: a hair tie, Burt's Bees lip balm, a few tissues, gift cards, coupons and quite a lot of cash. The crossbody strap is adjustable so it works for anyone on the height spectrum very well. I am 5'11 and experience no issues whatsoever. I am very happy with this product. I cannot leave my apartment without it.",

It has 3 separate compartments. It holds my credit card holder, telephone, keys & anything else I may need while I'm shopping. Also has slots for your cards. The middle compartment zips & there is one big zipper that zips outer compartments together giving the middle compartment double protection.",
