Suffice to say the things I needed in a tablet (for industrial design sketching/rendering) are all here to such a great degree that I really enjoy using it. Pressure sensitivity is good, just as importantly 'initial activation pressure' is very light. This is essential for me because I do light underlays for most of my sketches. Accuracy--dead accurate, cursor goes right at the tip of the nib Drivers; no issues, everything works as intended without workflow-breaking bugs.",

You're drawing on one hand, but your eyes are looking up at a screen. This is my first drawing monitor tablet, and good lord this was the right choice. Total immersion, no disconnect. The screen is matte, so no harsh glossy reflections from other light sources in the room to distract you. My art has greatly improved to a degree I have never imagined. Although higher priced tablets does not inherently improve your illustration skills (practicing does), a monitor tablet such as this makes you feel much more comfortable and focused when drawing.",

At this sort of price you'd at least expect a good IPS panel on it. In any case I ended up just going with a new Intuos Pro instead. It's still fairly price but the Pro Pen 2 is really worth it.",

Only critique is that it doesnt have buttons like on the intuos pro so that was annoying not to have the fast keys and it's a bit big/clunky.

      "text": "Not only does the screen come pre-calibrated, but the quality and texture of the screen is perfect. The pen picks up strokes really nicely, so you don't really have to worry about glitches in your line work. My only complaint is the stand for the drawing tablet is really low, so it's straining to your back. But I splurged and also purchased the WACOM Cintiq 16 stand adjuster, so that solved my issues right away. I would also recommend purchasing the drawing tablet traveling bag, as that protects my screen on the go. Overall, completely worth the price and then some. Only buying Wacom stuff from now on.",
