I was assured by the insulation contractor that the gaps were normal and that I just wasn't able to see down in the gaps where there was an abundance of insulation. The thermal camera does all the work, instantly pointing out hotspots. I had hundreds of hotspots in my house, and when I sent the pictures to the insulation contractor, he was amazed at all the spots his guys missed. Between the extra insulation I will get and the energy savings I will enjoy in the future, the camera has paid for itself.",
