I coaxed her over to healthy \"people food\" over the years, but couldn't convert her off of seed, spending $300+ over the years, trying everything under the sun. Finally! I found this and she LOVES it! She was getting a little Vitamin A deficiency, even though I fed her plenty of organic carrots, but after a month of Zupreem's Nut Blend, her feet went back to normal and her very quiet wheeze went away. Now on month 14 and she's a huge fan. \"I love you too Alice!\"",
