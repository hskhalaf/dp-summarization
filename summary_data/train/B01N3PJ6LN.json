The planets are not to scale, the body parts don't seem to be either, the world map is lackluster, and US map has really strange images on each state. I wanted to like them! We will still use them because, as I said, they're functional, but I wish they were cuter and had better material printed.",

The back of them is fantastic because it does not move around on the table (unlike most educational placemats). They are also good for using with modeling clay or crafts.

      "text": "These placemats are nice and thick, really great quality. What\u2019s even more impressive, is the accuracy of the information on them and the simplicity of how it is portrayed. I bought these for my kids 8 and 4, but find myself(and my husband) poring over the maps and learning some new things too! All in all, a fantastic purchase and well worth the money. Will purchase different ones in the future again. Thank you Merka!",

This will help them stay engaged in the learning process and encourage fun at the same time. Our 9yr old is getting a jump start on learning the 50 states, and their capitol cities.",
