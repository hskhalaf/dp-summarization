The metal clasp has stained all three of my dogs white chests. What is this fine powder, nickel? This cannot be good for them. The staining does not wear off, but is cummulative and only comes off with bathing. The other aspects of the collars a quite nice, but due to this staining I've replaced them with plastic clasp collars (as much as I hate plastic, at least no staining). Disappointed.",

The collar itself I do not feel will last long for a dog that is playful and going to be in and outside and rolling around. It is SO thin and cheap. The metal clasp is very cheap. I am extremely dissapointed especially for the price of this collar!!",

The only thing I hope will soften with time is where the material meets, right now it is stiff which causes the collar to bend. I can't tell how the metal will stand up to use, I only received it today. But so far, I'm super happy!!",

We have literally gone through 5 collars in 3 months everything from the cheap cheap to a fancy Kong and she ripped them all off! She\u2019s also an escape artist so it\u2019s also come in handy for people to call when she gets out. Best collar!! I will probably buy another one just as a back up since this one has outlasted just about everything else!",

Of course he is much stronger so the real test was putting it on him and taking him outside. It held together and I couldn't be happier with it!",
