I demanded that he try something different so he chose these shoes---and surprise, he actually loves them! Nice light color, but with enough black and white accents to break things up. Fit was just as expected. My one star off is minor. The shoe is a little stiffer in construction than the Nikes he usually wears: this is a good thing in my opinion---I hate the way some sneakers get stretched as they're broken in---but my son says the shoes make a little more noise than he likes.",
