However, I have a function I need to attend in a day and a half so I'm up a creek without a paddle. I'm very disappointed that a company would reship a costume, particularly without inspecting it. I'm also disappointed in Amazon for using companies who'd do such shady business.",

A bit shorter than I like but I have a petticoat underneath, I highly recommend it because it totally makes the dress. Since it\u2019s shoter I don\u2019t need to wear heels all night.

I plan to use this costume in a promo appearance for a summer children's theater performance of \"Alice in Wonderland.\" It is actually of good enough quality, we may use it for the performances as well as the promo. The bustier/corset is not boned, so if you want an hourglass figure, use a \"real\" corset underneath the costume. The front panel is somewhat see-through, especially with stage lighting, so wear something opaque underneath. The skirt is really, really long, so if you are petite you'll have to do some hemming. I'd recommend this as an all-purpose costume for Halloween, theater, or any other fancy-dress party.",

I'm sure there's something you can do in advance to remedy that. It does have a pettiskirt under it, which I cut out because it made me look too 'hippy.' Just a forewarning, the hearts on the costume are made of gitter, so you will end up getting glitter everywhere. I am a busty DD size 6-8 and got the medium, it fit perfectly. Overall, this costume was exactly what I had expected!!",
