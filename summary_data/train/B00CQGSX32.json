However I purchase pliers, not a case, and the pliers are very good. I took them fishing in the salt water, and not a part of them rusted, even after I didn't clean them. So they are built quite well. If I could change something, I would probably dip the handles in plastidip, as they can get pretty slippery in salt water. But all in all, excellent pliers on the cheap.",

The leash has saved them from falling off the yak a few times as well. I have some more expensive ones and these actually cut better. A little rusting in areas - so keep it rinsed off.",

When your hands are covered in fish slim handling these pliers can be a bit tricky. The replaceable working end of the pliers don't really close all the way. This really hasn't been too much of a problem because I use them to take out large hooks from fish and to cut 20-50lb mono. It would have also been nice if the sheath came with a belt clip rather than a belt loop. Again...not really an issue...just my preference. I would still recommend these pliers to anyone I meet.",
