Have rolled several games in the last two months and am enjoying the fun and relaxation. I only roll straight balls. Am not interested in even learning to curve and hook. Rolling 150 to 170 will be good enough for me. I have no doubt the ball could do much better than that, but it will probably have to find a different owner to do so.",

For Christmas, my son and I bought him another new bowling ball that would give him the \"hook\" that bowlers want / need to \"bring it in!\" That ball worked great. But...now he needed a ball that he could throw that would hang straight down the lane so that he could pick up those all important spares. This ball is that second ball - that ball that brings in those spares! He loves it! He's happy ergo I am happy.",
