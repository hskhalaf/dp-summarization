It turned out it was a deffective unit, and after I got a replacement, it works perfectly. Be sure to test your keyboard for several minutes while you are still within the return period in case you have the same problem!",

Keys are a little noisy when you start typing fast, but they are easy to press. First time using a bluetooth keyboard, always used the onscreen one. This keyboard will make it so much easier to do my school work when I am away from home. Would purchase again.",

I can't even do a control find, if the directions were better maybe I'd be able to figure it out, but the directions will show you initial set-up and then they want you to go back to their amazon store to buy more of their products.",
