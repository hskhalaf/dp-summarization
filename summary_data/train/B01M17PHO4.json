Almost lost my keys a number of times. Then seam started to come apart on the phone pouch. Also noticed the belt kept getting loose around my waist in spite of constantly adjusting the strap. Turns out the adjustment in the strap just doesn't hold. Last straw...I went to zip up my phone on this evening's jog and the zipper came off in my hand. Again this is after daily use for about 3 weeks. I am returning the item.",

The phone and wallet fit in it great and it was comfortable on rides. I felt like everything was secure and it was great for easy access. After 4 days of continuous use of the zipper, the end of the zipper came undone. (See photo). Frustrated that I won\u2019t be able to use this pack again since I\u2019m an avid themepark enthusiast.

Sometimes the strap loosens a little while running but I think that\u2019s because I also wear a hip belt for running with my dogs so it slides a little more. But the zipper broke. It just spread apart. I can sometimes get it to get on track but mostly it just spreads open again. It\u2019s only 2 months old. I though about buying another one because I did like it. But, the price went up also.",

I like that there's an extra compartment for my keys and a little cutout for corded earbuds. Very pleased with the purchase!",

It works best when I turn it so the pouch is on my back... somehow bounces less that way. I think it would be perfect if the band wasn\u2019t elastic. Definite flaw, but I\u2019ll still use it & make the best of it. The pouch itself is sturdy & holds all I need - my phone, keys, chapstick & fecemask.",

I might have kept it despite that, because the belt overall is fits nicely for running. However, I have an iPhone 11 with the Otterbox case. Just a heads up to anyone with that phone/case combo. I could get it in the waist pack if I squeezed it, but it was too tight of a fit in my opinion. I wouldn't be able to access it easily. If you had a different case or smaller phone, it would work fine.",

The pack was comfortable for the entire run, since the pocket is long and flat so the weight from all that stuff was distributed across my waist and there weren't any spots that stuck out obtrusively. Highly recommended for runners, or anyone who likes a fanny pack but wants one thin enough to conceal under a long shirt because let's be honest, fanny packs are not fashionable but they are useful and this one could be easily hidden.",

The key pouch is great, it looks small but will expand to accommodate car keys with the fob plus a couple of keys with it. I guess it\u2019s always a balancing act to come to a size that makes the most sense. I like it.",
