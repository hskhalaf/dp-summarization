On the flip side of things, I decided to try this product on the black dash/console of a 2004 TJ Jeep(plastic/synthetic Chrysler dash), and holy god, does it work well, and repels dust. This stuff seems to be armor-all on steroids.. at least with my car. With all cleaners, try a small spot, and go from there.",

It will clean all the dirt where you spray it, so I spray it on a little towel and then clean the furniture with the towel. In my experience this gives the best results!",

Also as others commented, it leaves a really attractive leather scent. Love this product and I'm so happy I bought four. The only caveat I have to put out there is that like any other leather cleaner, protector, it leaves any surface pretty slippery so if you get it on your floor, you should probably wipe it off with a damp cloth or else you might end up sliding across the floor!",

It has a nice leather scent and does a great job of cleaning and shining up my leather. Hard to say if it's actually helping it preserve it yet (that's the only reason I did 4 stars instead of 5) as I haven't used it that long yet. But it does seem to be helping keep the leather soft and supple.",

      "MOISTURIZES AS IT CLEANS - Over time, leather products fade and show signs of damage. This spray moisturizes surfaces such as sofas, car seats, and shoes to prevent them from cracking and dulling. It brings back their original appearance and keeps them from looking dehydrated. And unlike artificial cleaners, it leaves behind a cool leather scent.",
      "REPELS WATER - Leather has a naturally waterproof exterior, but in the long run it's still affected by moisture. This results in permanent damage, soiling, or deterioration of aesthetic qualities over time. Mr. Leather helps leather items repel water and restores their natural beauty, guaranteeing pieces that look as good as new."
