I saw other review that talked about the switches breaking, I have only used the switches a few times since I have it plugged into a switched outlet, but they seem sturdy enough to me, basically the same as any lamp I have ever used. These allow more light through than the kind that have metal hoods around the lights so I recommend this over the all metal ones.",

I was pleasantly surprised when it came. Super easy to put together took me less than 5 min to set it up. Provides a lot of lighting and you can point lights in different directions.

I contacted Amazon but they don't have any warranty information on this product. I have not been able to find any contact info for the vendor or manufacturer. I hope that one of them will read this and contact me.",

      "text": "Unwrapping (from impressively small package) and assembling took less than 10 minutes. Looks good, neutral enough to fit different kinds of decor. Have only used for a few days but seems well-built, sturdy. I like that the \"cans\" allow some light through the sides, really allows it to light up a section of a room well (vs whole room with standard lamp or just spots with lamp like this with metal cans). I'm using some 52W halogen bulbs (\"75W-equivalent\") and it's plenty bright. I use it for reading and with Windhover's sunrise outlet timer to simulate a nice sunrise to wake me up very morning. Will update if I have any trouble with it.",
