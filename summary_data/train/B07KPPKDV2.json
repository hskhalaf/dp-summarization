      "text": "I did some 100 degree desert hiking in May of this year and got horrible heel blisters and was worried that I needed to purchase new hiking shoes. After some research, I learned that people with narrow feet are at increased risk for blisters if feet sweat and are allowed to stay wet. I purchased these socks for a return desert hiking trip in July, and although I did not hike as much, it was hotter out and these socks kept me blister free. I wore these under my regular hiking socks. You will notice that the segmented toes do feel a little funny at first, but you quickly stop noticing it. I wish I had purchased these earlier.",

They fit perfectly--snug enough to prevent bunching but not so tight that they are restrictive. I purchased these for hiking the Tongariro Crossing, layered underneath a pair of lightweight Smartwool socks. They performed perfectly and prevented my toes from getting squished against each other uncomfortably. I have since worn them when I ski for the same reason, layered under heavier Smartwool socks. Even though the liners aren't knee high like my ski socks, the tops of the Injinji socks do not cut into my calf uncomfortably when squeezed into my boots. I am so happy to have found these!",

Over time I discovered that the Injini liner socks without an over-sock work better and are more comfortable. I will buy the Injini socks again and I recommend them to other buyers.",

      "text": "It takes some time to get used to the feeling of the sock going inbetween your toes, but after you get used to it, you won't be disappointed. I use these as hiking sock liners to protect my feet. Even with a decent fitting pair of hiking boots, I would regularly get blisters at certain hot spots, but after wearing a pair of hiking socks over these liner socks, I never get blisters anymore! The material also wicks away moisture, and keeps my feet nice and dry. After washing these in a stream, I noticed the material drys pretty fast as well. Very satisfied with purchase",

      "text": "I got blisters between my toes on my last long hike, so I bought these hoping they would prevent blisters. They were too uncomfortable to wear. I wore them under thin Smartwool socks, and they made my toes feel crowded in my hiking boots. I hiked with them for a 9 mile hike, and they were annoying the whole time I hiked. The pinky toes bunched up since they were longer than my toes, and made my pinky toenails feel squished. I constantly noticed the crowded feeling of my toes. I think I got slightly less blisters, but the socks were too annoying to wear again.",
