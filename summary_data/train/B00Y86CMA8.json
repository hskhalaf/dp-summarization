      "text": "Very tetchy router. Easy to set up but the touch panel is again - very tetchy, may take several attempts to register a command. Very little in the way of a signal boost. Repeater failed to work. Lots of drop outs until it failed completely after around 1 month - returned - well trying to as Amazons Hermes collection never bothered turning up... Overall (at present) there's better available out there, more reliable and faster, the touch screen is a gimmick and a poor one, so best save money and get something better.",

I have to say the design looks really cool,l much better than the plain white one - but you pay for this! WiFi coverage to my first floor is very good and I have very thick walls.",
