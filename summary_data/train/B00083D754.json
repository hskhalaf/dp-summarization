I love the rattle myself - super cute, and soft in case he accidentally bops himself in the face with it.",

It's the perfect size for her small hands. It's soft enough so she wont hurt herself.

The small size makes it easy to grab and also easy to travel with. She automatically ques on to the rattle sound and loves hearing the crunch from the legs. The same can be said with butterfly and its wings. She love following the flapping effect when its above her. Then when it lands on her chest she grab and hugs it. I highly recommend these toys for your new born to encourage hand-eye. The travel size lady bug and the large butterfly is a great combo for diaper bag or home play time.",

It usually ends up around her wrist or being kicked but either way she has fun with it so I'm satisfied. I like that it is soft so that when she does start holding it with her hands she won\u2019t hurt herself if she accidentally hits herself in the face with it. Great for a first rattle",
