It is very sleek and the portability is great! It weighs next to nothing and fits pretty much anywhere you would carry a phone. The only con to this product is the touch screen. I am so used to my iPhone touchscreen being glass, this one feels like plastic. It just seems cheap and it lacks sensitivity, sometimes I find myself mashing on it way too hard to get it to work. Other than that, overall A+!",

And this thing is tiny, so it would look ridiculous on any tripod, even a gorilla pod. Any night pictures are hideous and grainy. Adding digital zoom makes things awful. And the while balance is very off. I should have kept my old cannon, as it took much better pictures.",
