The removable racks give you a flexible environment for smoking large meats or several racks of ribs. The design is well thought and well manufactured. The digital interface is easy to understand and use. With the included thermometer, you set the smoke temp and the meat temp you want. Close the door and lock the latch and let the smoker do all the work worry free. I considered getting the glass door, but I am glad that I did not. I did not want to spend time cleaning glass when I should be eating delicious smoked meat.",

Love that I do not have to coat or fry the fish or use tarter sauce they taste great right out of the smoker very happy. Main use will be for fish, turkey and chicken. I got plenty of smoke flavor in the fish only being in a little more than an hour so I am guessing birds will have alot of smoke flavor being in much longer. Will have to update after poultry have been done but things look good from here.",
