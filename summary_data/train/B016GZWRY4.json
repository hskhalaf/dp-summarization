      "text": "I bought this lock August 14, 2017 for my daughter at college. She has used it only 4 times and now it has quit working/locking. When I turn the key the internal mechanism does not move. One side is in lock position and the other side of the bolt is in unlock positon. It has not been abused, tampered with, broken into etc. At first by reading the reviews I thought I had bought a top notch bike lock but now I am not sure. I will be contacting the manufacturer and see what they will or will not do.",

The lock itself feels very sturdy and trustworthy and the mounting bracket works perfectly, I am not worried about it falling off while riding through the city. The problem came when within two days of owning the lock, it jammed. I removed the lock from my bike and when I was trying to put the crossbar back on the U it just wouldn\u2019t close no matter which way I turned the key. :-( seemed like a sturdy lock for a good price but perhaps the mechanics need to be redesigned.",

The cable holder does not secure to frame tight enough causing cable to loosen while riding.

I don't use the velcro attachment for the cable- it's easier to just carry it with me, but it's a nice option at least. I use this lock in Baltimore, and I'm comfortable leaving my bike on the street with this lock. That should convince you.",

It's solid and not too heavy. I used the included mount and mounted it to the frame of my cruiser bike. Outside of a faint jiggling, I don't even know it's there. It's a nice bonus that they include a separate chain lock, as well. I use the U-Lock to lock the back tire and frame to the actual bike rack and the chain lock & a padlock to anchor the frame and front tire to the rack as well.
