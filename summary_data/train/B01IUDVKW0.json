The shop I was getting my certification at had some rather expensive bags and I didn't want to spend that much so I got this one instead. It's quite roomy (longer than I needed, for sure--I'm 6'3\" and they fit my flippers just fine), and the mesh makes for easy drying. That said, when I keep a full set of weights in the bag, I'm concerned it might break. So I'll probably only put in the weights I plan to use or keep the weights outside the bag.",

The bag seems well made and while I was skeptical of the zipper at first it actually seems pretty sturdy and is similar to the zippers we use on our everyday gear bags.

We used it for three stops on a cruise and toted the thing everywhere. When not in use, it folds back into itself and takes up practically no room at all.",

I was contacted by the owner of Kraken Aquatics regarding my problem with the zipper. He sent me a new bag with the larger zipper free of charge I have no doubt I'll be upgrading my review to 5 stars after I've had the opportunity to use the bag a few times.
