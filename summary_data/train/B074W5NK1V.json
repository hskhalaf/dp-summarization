It's sturdy, strong, spacious and has a nice sized pocket in the front. I'm a pretty hardcore person with my things so I break things a lot. I was sure at some point I'd somehow rip the straps off, but this bag is very well made. if you're looking for a nice sized clear back pack you've found the one.",
