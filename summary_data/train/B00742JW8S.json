It took about a week for the hair to grow back but when it did oh my, the area was inflamed and it made me itch. Again, not the fault of the device but it doesn't grow back \"cute\" it grows back coarser. So I would say skip this one.",

I advise exfoliating your skin prior to using the epilator. The hair is removed much easier.",

My husband loves it and remarks often on how soft I am everywhere without stubble. In the winter, I use it every 2 weeks. During shorts seasons, once a week. The hair grows back finer and I haven't needed to shave in between. So very happy that I finally found something that works exactly like it advertises on hair removal.",
