I gather from various mothers that almost everyone carries a changing pad with them and would not use the disposable liners, even if they were available. Perhaps a future redesign could make the liner holder removable (if not wanted), allowing more elbow room when the changing station is open.",

We had the construction crew install this item so I am not positive on how difficult it is for the average person but they installed really quickly. With a 2 year old son I have used a lot of changing tables and this one is a nice one. It folds down easily and returns back to place without falling on its own. If we choose to make both of our bathrooms family rooms we would buy this Continental White changing table again.",

The only thing I could suggest to them is to include two more of the flip out anchors for the block. Only two were sent and needed a total of four to mount in the block. I had two of the anchors and bolts that I needed in my shop so not a big deal but if you didnt have them you would have to purchase them. Overall a great product for the price and shipping was quick.",

I gave it four instead of five stars for the following reasons: 1) Not enough anchors, only two come when there are six holes, 2) the anchors straps break easily, and caused me to loose the anchor behind the wall, 3) It comes with a plaque to indicate that there's a changing station, but the light green color makes it a bit difficult to see in muted lighting, and 4) being that it is for such delicate use, it should come with a poster with cautions, and not place on the customer the burden to choose what's appropriate to relate.",

We measured what it said and it was super low, I don't know how they came up with that.",

(H is height, the vertical distance from lowest to highest point; W is width, the horizontal distance from left to right; D is depth, the horizontal distance from front to back.) When closed, the changing station measures 4 inches (D). Molded-in dual liner dispensers hold approximately 50 liners for protection. The diaper changing station can attach to standard 16\u201d on-center studs, or to a hollow wall. (Mounting hardware is included.) The unit includes a self-adhesive aluminum placard for the restroom door to identify the changing station\u2019s location. The changing station complies with the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) F2285 - 04(2010) standard for diaper changing tables in commercial facilities, and American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Z535.3 and ANSI Z535.4 standards for safety signs, symbols, and labels. The unit complies with the Americans with Disabilities (ADA) act when properly installed. Continental horizontal diaper changing stations are generally used in a commercial environment. \n\n Continental manufactures plastic and metal products such as restroom supplies, buckets, refuse containers, carts, and trigger sprayers for the janitorial and food service industries.
