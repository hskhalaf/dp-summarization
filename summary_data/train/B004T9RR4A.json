You will need to use the admin pages to set up. The CD will unlikely work on the operating systems currently running today. However it does work, so if you need a router this will work. Just keep in mind that their intended installation process will probably not work for your computer. Currently running the latest firmware, so don't worry about upgrading.",

I had to call the company and perform a manual setup which took over an hour. Considering that Linksys is one of the leading router brands, I was shocked. The person who helped me on the phone was helpful but said that they simply just haven't updated their software yet. Seriously?!",

I've had to use another wireless router as an access point to extend the range so there's 5 bars no matter what room in the house I'm in. Another thing this router could have used is a data use log to see how much data is being used, especially useful for ISPs which have limited data and charge large overage fees.",

First, after spending more than 4 hours with Linksys technical support - they could not determine why I was only getting 1-2 MB/s with a cable connection that would get 25 MB/s wired. So they sent out a replacement (looked refurbished). Now, 3 months later the speed went from a respectable 10 MB/s down to 1-2 MB/sec again. Yes, it has good features. Yes, it has easy setup. But it doesn't stay fully up and it requires alot of time. Maybe Belkin will do a better job than Cisco.",

The best I've dealt with in this field and much more knowledgable and responsive than their competitors.",
