      "text": "This product is very limited. No built in wifi. You have to buy an adaptor for bluetooth. The screen can't be seen from four feet away. The network was impossible and does not work. There is no support for any streaming services. Unless you only want to use internet radio which does not find all of the stations you look up or at via USB. It is pretty much useless. On the bright side the sound and price are very good if you are on a budget. With the extra money you have to spend to get some kind of use out of it I'd buy something else. I've requested a return.",

      "text": "Pioneer Elite N- 50 Audiophile Network Auudio player is a beautiful music player. The sound quality is very good. I use it mainly for its internet radio capability. I also listen to my IPod through the pioneer N-50 and the sound is just lovely. The negative things about the pioneer N-50 is that it fails to play some of the Internet radio stations that have been authorized by radio-pioneer.com. Also the Pioneer Elite N-50 has no WiFi capability and you need to buy a WiFi adapter or you will have to hard wire it to your router.",

Wish I could day the same about the Pioneer control app...while it gets the job done it looks and feels like an app that was developed 10 years ago and nobody bothered to update:) I tried both digital and analogue outputs and my preferred set up is Pure Audio via analogue: with a quality RCA interconnects the soundstage really opens up and the details are greatly enhanced. Overall a great sounding, well built piece of kit. Definitely recommend!",

Having said that, the digital to analog conversion is just superb!!! What a difference it makes to the output! The pioneer control app is a joke. Pioneer has launched a completely new line of network players and has abandoned the N-30 and N-50 altogether. Pity.....",

The improvement in sound quality compared to the Airport Express was unbelievable. Even my wife noticed and complemented the sound (and she's no Audiophile). One minor difference in functionality is that you could control the volume from the iPhone with the Airport Express but the N30 does not respond to volume controls so you have make adjustments to volume at the receiver/preamp.",
