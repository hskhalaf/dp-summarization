That said, the boot deserves to be taken seriously as it offers loads of comfort and super-reliable surface grip. Its almost non-existent break-in period is also a great contributor to its remarkable reputation. Unfortunately, behind such marvelous qualities lies complaints about its inconsistent sizing. Overall, the Berghaus Hillmaster II GTX comes out strong what with all its phenomenal traits dwarfing its pretty solvable downsides.",

The Hillmaster is a stiffer boot and feels a bit strange at first after the softer Fellmaster, but walk around for five minutes and they're just fine. Out on the hills I noticed a big difference. The sturdy Vibram soles deal with any terrain and the upper provides plenty of support. It's a good idea to order at least half a size up from your normal fit, especially if you have wide feet, but you won't be sorry - this has to be the best three-season hillwalking boot in its price range.",
