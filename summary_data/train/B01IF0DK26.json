The quality is good and what I was hoping for behind the doors on the bottom was that regular size bottles could fit and they do indeed. I have gallon size bottles on the sides and everything fits. It is a great piece for the price and although time consuming it all fit perfectly together. The box was extremely heavy so make sure you have two people to carry it in, it came undamaged and on time. Well worth it for the price and very happy with it overall. I highly recommend this product.",

Large drawers and cabinets are particularly valuable for a small condo - I can free up the cabinet in my kitchen that I was using for liquor. I assembled it by myself in 2.5 hours, but I would recommend using two people. The package is heavy (120 lbs) and some of the pieces are large and would be a lot easier to handle when assembling with 2 people. There are a lot of pieces and hardware but the instructions are pretty straightforward even for someone who isn't very handy - it just takes a while. A drink or 3 while assembling is suggested.",

Also, one of the doors doesn't hang quite straight despite many adjustments. It drags on the bottom unless I pull up slightly as I open/close it. It's not obvious when looking at it, though.",
