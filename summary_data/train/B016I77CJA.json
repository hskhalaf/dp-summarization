Update: after 3.5 months of use the glue that holds the brush to the handle disintegrated cause irreparable damage. The brush head separated from the handle. Was a great brush till it broke. Because of the breaking after only three months of use. I'm taking this down from a 5 star review to a 1 star review. If it lasted a year, I'd leave it at 5 stars, but only 3.5 months? That's not that great. Especially considering I only shave twice a week at the most.",

Just got it, he hasn't used it yet (and believe me, he is very particular & highly critical of things), but so far, ladies, if your man doesn't like it, you will!
