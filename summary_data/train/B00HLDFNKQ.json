I've taken it to concerts and sporting events and could zoom in on singers/player face while sitting in nose bleeds. Judging by my pictures, I was in first row! As far as batteries go, I haven't had any issues and charge usually lasts all day. Highly recommend it",

Image colors are generally good, without being over saturated. Zoomed images are sharp. High contrast shots (aka backlit conditions) are handled very well, automatically. On board GPS initialization is cumbersome at best. User manual is poor in this area. Even once GPS is locked on to satellites, re-establishing satellites a few minutes after shutting down camera and powering back up is extremely slow. I leave the system turned off and carry a dedicated GPS, then geotag images once I return home.",

First, Robert Plant at the Riviera, then the Afghan Whigs at the Metro and most recently Placebo at the Hose of Blues. The shots are clear in low light. It has a good zoom and anti-shake feature which helps a lot. I'm happy with my purchase.",

      "text": "With just one exception, this camera is great for video (my main use). Nice wide-angle, lots of zoom for a pocket-cam, good low-light contrast, 30.mins video recording time at 720P (maybe 17-mins at 1080P). Downside is low-light-FOCUSING is weak.. during low-light videos it sometimes has trouble finding what to focus on, and goes a bit blurry. Non-issue for normal videos. And low-light contrast quite good for it's size. The mic (for recording audio) cannot handle loud sounds (like filming loud bands), but not much worse than other pocket-cams (or iPhones for that matter). Way better pictures than smartphones. Good overall picture quality. Overall good for pictures and videos.",

With Hybrid Auto, this \u201chighlight reel\u201d is stunningly beautiful. Hybrid Auto automatically recognizes the scene and optimizes camera settings to capture the highest possible image quality. The resulting 720p HD video is properly exposed, crisp and steady.\n\n* Pictures can be withheld from the resulting video via menu settings.\n\nA SMARTER CAMERA MEANS BETTER PHOTOS AND VIDEOS\nSMART AUTO\nSophisticated Canon technology that makes getting that great shot as simple as pressing the shutter button, Smart AUTO automatically detects scenes by assessing various factors in both the background and the subject. On the PowerShot ELPH 340 HS, detected scenes are analyzed using 32 predefined shooting situations. The camera then makes optimal settings to ensure the best possible image capture, whether you're shooting stills or video. Smart AUTO also includes Advanced Subject Detection, which allows the camera to detect and track non-human moving subjects like animals and vehicles. With Smart AUTO, all you have to do is frame your shot and capture away.\n\nSHOOTING MODES/SPECIAL SCENE MODES\nSmart AUTO The camera automatically selects the best shooting settings for optimal quality based on subjects and environmental factors to provide point-and-shoot simplicity. Movie Digest & Hybrid Auto Automatically selects shooting settings for optimal quality and records a video clip every time you capture a still image. One day's worth of clips are then combined into a single video. Program The camera automatically and intelligently selects the aperture/shutter speed combination based on the shooting conditions. Creative Shot Analyzes the scene and applies a number of creative filters to automatically create five variations in addition to the original image. Portrait Brings the subject into focus while beautifully blurring the background. Smart Shutter The camera automatically takes the photo when people smile, wink, or get into frame. High-Speed Burst Captures rapid action frame by frame, by shooting continuously at a high speed while the shutter button is held down. Handheld Night Scene Take clear and steady pictures at night without the use of a tripod. Low Light For high quality image capture in an amazing range of dimly lit situations. Fisheye Effect Now you can get the fisheye effect \u2013 a classic photographic distortion \u2013 without a fisheye lens. Miniature Effect Give images a miniature look with an effect that emphasizes perspective by blurring the top and bottom of the image. Toy Camera Effect Simulates photos taken with \u201ctoy\u201d or pinhole cameras, darkening the image at the edges to create a vignette effect. Monochrome Choose from three single-tone effects: Black-and-White, Sepia, or Blue. Super Vivid Super Vivid intensifies existing hues, saturating the scene with bright colors. Poster Effect Poster Effect combines several similar shades into one color, turning subtle gradations into eye-catching, scene-popping contrasts. Snow Shoot clear snow scenes without darkened subjects or an unnatural bluish tint. Fireworks Create brilliant images of skyrocketing fireworks. Long Shutter Use to blur moving subjects for artistic effect, ideal for urban night photography. Movie Record video in stereo sound. Unwanted scenes can be deleted in playback mode. Actual results may vary from examples shown above.\nFinal image may vary depending on picture composition.\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\nINTELLIGENT IS\nIt's easy to capture clear, steady images with the PowerShot ELPH 340 HS, even in low light without using a tripod. That's because the camera is equipped with Canon's innovative Intelligent IS. The system automatically analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation \u2013 allowing you to focus on framing and capturing your shot. For stills, the system selects from Normal IS, Panning IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Tripod modes. When shooting video, the system selects from Dynamic IS, Powered IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and active Tripod IS modes. New icons clearly mark the image stabilization mode, whether you're shooting still images or video.\n\nStill Image Shooting Normal IS Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills. Panning IS Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement. Macro (Hybrid) IS Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting. Tripod When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed. Video Recording Dynamic Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking. Powered Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified. Macro (Hybrid) IS Corrects for motion blur that is likely to occur when shooting video while walking. Also compensates for the shift-type camera shake common in macro shooting. Active Tripod IS When shooting video while using a tripod, the image stabilization is active to compensate for slight camera shake. ECO MODE\nThe PowerShot ELPH 340 HS features ECO Mode, which provides more shots per single charge through LCD monitor and camera power management. ECO Mode can be activated for easy power preservation when an outlet is unavailable or the moment is too exciting to put the camera down. The mode quickly wakes the camera from sleep when a button is pressed. With ECO Mode activated to conserve power, you can even stay connected for longer with the built-in Wi-Fi\u00ae featured on the camera. When the fun with family and friends runs late into the night, you can be assured your camera can keep up.\n\nEASILY PRINT YOUR FAVORITE MOMENTS\nIt's quick and easy to make beautiful prints from your PowerShot camera. With the built-in Wi-Fi\u00ae on your PowerShot camera, it's easy to send your images to a PictBridge (Wireless LAN) compatible printer. Or use the Direct Print system; simply connect your PowerShot ELPH 340 HS camera to a Canon PIXMA or SELPHY photo printer with a USB cable and press the button to print. Easily turn every favorite moment into an amazing photo.\n\nAVAILABLE IN 31 LANGUAGES\nThere are now a total of 31 display languages from which you can choose: English, German, French, Dutch, Danish, Finnish, Hebrew, Italian, Norwegian, Swedish, Spanish, Simplified/Traditional Chinese, Japanese, Russian, Portuguese, Korean, Greek, Polish, Czech, Hungarian, Turkish, Thai, Arabic, Romanian, Ukrainian, Farsi, Hindi, Malay, Indonesian and Vietnamese.",
