I was worried if the wedge would give enough stability - I have had others that feel rather tippy like you could twist your ankle, but not so with these. Leather I like too, soft and a bit pebbly. I don't know though how the heal and sole are going to ensure. They are made in China, and just don't seem quite the same \"last forever\" kind of boot like my other made in Mexico Fryes. I will keep them for indoor wear. I think they look good with any kind of pants or skirts, so quite versatile.",

The ankle space is quite loose though - I would only wear these with skinny legs that would easily fit inside the ankle area. I returned these based on price, the overly round toe (which I thought would be more pointed) and I'm hoping to find them in brown.",
