I Was disappointed in how soft both sides are compared to the previously purchased mattress. Not something u would have purchased for my newborn. Turns out the other mattress was a \"Cool Beginnings\" and this is \"OptiCool\" . Apparently Cool Beginnings can't be found. Luckily I have the ability to switch the two so my newborn has the more firm mattress. I feel overall, this is a good product, just much softer than I would have preferred for a newborn.",
