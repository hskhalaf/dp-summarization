      "text": "I ordered this board under the impression I was going to have to do the bios update before installing my 3600x. However when I got this package I saw the box was updated to say \u201cryzen 3000 support\u201d. Even tho the image of this board on amazon shows it saying ryzen 2000. So I figured I would try my 3600x and just see if it would recognize it. And happy to report it did indeed ! Worked right out of the box with my 3600x and 3200mhz viper ram! Great board and I\u2019m happy they updated the bios in the new ones! Made my life a little easier!",

My main problem with this motherboard is just how bad the BIOS is because of the fact that this original version does not have enough space to store a higher end BIOS after updating it to support Ryzen 3000. There are also some other things like the fans fluctuating up and down constantly for no real reason and the placement of certain headers. If you really, really don't want to spend ~$10 more for a MUCH better BIOS and most likely more updates, but this instead of the Tomahawk Max. Otherwise, get the Max.",

Keep in mind you'll need to hold it in place if you get a fan that screws directly into it. Also keep in mind the ram slots are super close to the CPU, and depending on the size of your fan, could end up obstructed. I had to remove & flip mine to access them again. Overall very satisfied.

Fan headers, plenty of sata ports, and a nice red rgb glow on the back of the motherboard to finish off this beast of a motherboad. It's extremely easy to update this motherboard too, just a touch of a button and it's done! This board is absolutely perfect to me and it hasnt failed so far. I recommended it to my friend and he hasn't had any problems so far! However, this is a motherboard that DOES NOT HANDLE OVERCLOCKING WELL. If you want to overclock, I suggest you buy an x470. Overall, it's a great motherboard and it'll fit really nice in a red and black theme!",

Allthough the software by MSI is simple, it is very responsive and has been great for me to use since I began PC building. If your are looking for a reliable, well-designed board that will fit into any system and that has a classic neutral color scheme, this is an excellent choice. Supporting both Ryzen 2nd and 3rd gen, it is reliable and will provide good upgradeability. It is a perfect choice for new PC builders and people looking for solid performance and a good-looking design.",
