The picture image is ultra-sharp, as the name suggests and the screen is more matted than the screen on my last monitor, so it is easier on the eyes and has less glare. I love, too, that the stand allows me to swivel the screen, perfect for reading and writing of long documents.",

This is a great looking monitor with very thin bezels and a great stand that is height adjustable, tiltable and rotates. Comes complete with a three-year warranty from Dell.

Because the 4 screws are recessed you cannot just take mounting bars of the back of your existing monitor and screw them straight to the back of this one. I now have to spend time and expense to find another bracket which will fit. All the other monitors I have owned have had flush fittings.",

This monitor is really very sharp and everything - text, pictures, gaming - is clearer, brighter and neater. What a difference! It is quite long and not too high, which I love (the ratio can vary in 27 inch monitors) and I can easily see two applications side by side which is great. I no longer have to have two monitors, I'm not moving my head so much, it's much better. Happy bunny.",

At normal viewing distance the screen-width is enough to fill the field of normal vision and the colours and colour-balance are as accurate and vivid as I would want them to be. The resolution is fine beyond measure. For single person use it would be difficult to imagine an improvement",

They are being used for software development. The monitors have no defects and the stands make them really flexible, with them rotating in all directions. Only negative is the lack of HDMI cables and the shortness of the supplied cables, but that's a minor thing.",

The device is thin and light with great anti-glare properties. Screen quality is OK, but only OK. To be honest it's not worth the money being charged. It's more of a \u00a3350 monitor, not a \u00a3700 monitor.",
