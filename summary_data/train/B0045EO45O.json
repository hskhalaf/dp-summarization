As a whole, despite its unsatisfactory points, the Zamberlan 1025 Tofane NW GT RR is still a pair of backpacking boots that has a lot to offer on every adventure.",

My friend also recommended that I put in Superfeet Green Support and Comfort Insoles, and I did. I have worn them 4 times hiking over 15 miles each time. The first couple times, I felt the boots to be too rigid. The rigidity improved but still not as comfortable as my other boots. I'm hoping that they will fit better after several more uses. However, I have to say that they are really sturdy and protective of my ankles. So, I will recommend them to those who want better protection of their feet.",

I can't say enough good things about the fit and how well they feel. The foot stays nice and warm, but doesn't get hot. Just right. For context, the two boots I used before and liked were the Asolo TPS 535, which is a very good boot and the Zamberlan Vioz GT, whic si also good but not as much as the Asolo. This model is far superior to both and well worth the cost.",
