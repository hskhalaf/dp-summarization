I'm also short (5'1\") but the boots still fit comfortably with the top of the front of the boot hitting above my knee. You can't see much leg when I have these on. I've also got big calves and was able to pull the regular (not wide calf) up, even if putting them on and getting them off is less like a strip tease and more like wrestling an alligator. They fit, were a great deal, I'll wear them, they're a keeper.",

Well, just the second time I wore them, the elastic at the top of one boot ripped badly. It's way too noticeable to wear again, and even if I could ignore how bad it looks, I'm sure that wearing the boots would only make the tear worse. Definitely not worth buying just to wear twice.
