Although the watch had no physical damage and looked pristine, I guess the tech decided the screen stopped working because of moisture. I never even washed my hands with the watch on. The only moisture it was ever exposed too was sweat. So the folks at Samsung are pushing a wearable activity/sports watch that has no warranty or guarantee against sweat... Waste of money!",

It was new in box so it was not the fault of the seller. Upon further research I found many forums with people experiencing the same issue going back over a year. Amazon support was quick to handle the RMA process. I generally like Samsung, but they dropped the ball on this model. Going to try the newer pro version and see if it does any better. It's a shame as the unit feels premium and durable while handling it. Shame it wouldn't power on.",

If its on power savings mode, I get about 2 to 3 days wear before needing to charge. If I don't use the power savings, I have to charge it daily which is why I gave 4 stars.

It was incredibly flimsy and became the watch became unstrapped at even the slightest grazed touch. My mom has nearly lost the watch on multiple occasions because of the poorly thought-out strap. This watch would have easily gotten a 5-star rating, but having to be constantly worried about whether the watch is strapped on at all defeats the purpose.",

The Gear Fit 2 has a color screen. I do recommend purchasing a better replacement band so that you don't lose the watch. It's upsetting to lose that amount of money.",
