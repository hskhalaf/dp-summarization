It's SO loud the kids cover their ears! Two weeks later, I can't get a wireless connection at all, and I've changed NOTHING on my network. This product is a huge letdown, and needs to be tossed.

For me at least this is especially true with envelopes. 3) When you install the drivers from CD, you get the usual HP suite of bloatware that comes with it.

      "text": "Purchased printer a little over a month ago. I needed a wireless printer for my son's laptop and my IPad. A friend (computer geek for short) of mine recommended this printer for its ease of set-up and its capabilities (especially a copier). Couldn't be more satisfied, easy to set up, prints from the peripherals with no problem, in short, so far, so good. Would recommend.",

      "text": "I've had this printer for several years now. It is not used heavily but it has served well. This print quality is very good. If you use photo paper then the results are quite good. The scanner works well also. I bought it because it supported wireless printing from Apple devices. My wife can pull up a PDF file on her iPad or iPhone and print it directly to this printer. You can also print from any Mac, iMac, or windows computer. The scanner shows up immediately under Image Capture app on a Mac. Very convenient. You probably can't buy this model anymore but a successor show work as well or better.",
