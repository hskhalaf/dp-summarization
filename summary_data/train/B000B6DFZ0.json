Paint is easy to use and didn't run for me at all. I was impressed by the color, ease of application and how quickly it dries.",

It was an easy job and the wheels look factory-fantatstic! (A suggestion \u2014 you might want to cut out a simple round template to cover the tires while you spray.)",

The color looks like it matches my BMW but it looks horrible and uneven and I think is not viscous enough (the rim is vertical and this stuff doesn't stay put). I probably made this worse and now have to find someone to do it professionally.",

For my steel wheels I do one coat of Rustoleum rust converter as a primer, then a thin coat of the Dupli-Color. Then a second heavy coat of the Dupli-Color to achieve the finish I want. Very tunable. Put it on heavy and you can get a near gloss satin. Go a bit dryer by holding the can further away and you can get a less shiny result.",

      "text": "Lets not shake it any other way, its rattle can. That said, this is the best paint I have found that can be had at just about every local auto parts store. I recently refinished a set of wheels, stripping them down and building up. Self etching, gray filler, black inside, bronze on face, and clear on face to finish. As with any rattle can, watch for over spray. The paint tends to dry quickly, spray fine, and can powder over your nice finish easily if not careful. Make sure to read the instructions carefully on each different can, and follow them. Very happy with the end result,",
