Thank goodness a review, from a previous (very angry)consumer, said what kind of USB cord to get. I sure hope once I get the cord, the scanner will work and do what I need it to do. I'll let ya know.

I have a brother printer and sewing machine so I decided to try this one. For my purposes (office, not photos), it's a great machine. 1 star off because they don't include the USB cable (I used the old one). Kinda lame. It's also a little bit slower than the old machine, but again, fine for my purposes.",

    "title": "Brother High-Speed Desktop Document Scanner, ADS-2200, Multiple Scan Destinations, Duplex Scanning",
    "description": "Style:New Model: ADS2200 Scanner\n\nPerfectly balanced for the small business or home office, the Brother ADS-2200 is a high-speed duplex desktop color scanner that is fast, reliable, and affordable. Made to handle single- or dual-sided document scanning with a capacity of up to 50 sheets thanks to the built-in auto document feeder with additional page-continuous scanning, the Brother ADS-2200 can scan to multiple destinations and offers multiple connectivity options. This desktop scanner is built to save space yet can handle multiple media types and paper sizes, including legal and long paper, business and plastic ID cards, receipts, and photos.\n\nThe ADS-2200 was designed to be user-friendly. A great example of this is the simple, intuitive user interface that delivers customizable one-button scanning. Auto-size document detection makes scanning different-sized documents easy. The ADS-2200 also offers the ability to scan and retrieve files without installing any special software on the connected PC because it is recognized as a mass storage device when used with a USB flash memory drive(2), with minimal setup required on the host device. The ADS-2200 supports Windows, Mac, and Linux environments along with TWAIN, WIA for PC, ICA for Mac, and SANE drivers(3), providing the flexibility you need to support your business processes and systems.\n\nThe ADS-2200 also includes multiple image-optimization features, including background removal, multiple-feed detection, and blank page removal. A bundled software suite also includes a business card management and desktop document storage program.
