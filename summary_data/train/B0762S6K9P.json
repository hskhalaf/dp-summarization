I tried the reset as per troubleshooting instructions and it still will not work. Contacted the UE support, which was very hard to get to. They tried to walk me thru similar troubleshooting for not avail. I am told that they will send an email instruction how to capture a video of me troubleshooting so that it can be sent back to them before processing any possible replacement. Until now, the email has not arrived. What a joke! I will not recommend the purchase of this product because the of its short life and support is TERRIBLE.",

It can be heard clearly across the yard and would probably irritate the neighbors if I turned up the volume too much. The only issue is the MegaBlast seems to be hard of hearing. If you have even modest volume playing on the speaker, you pretty much have to shout \"Alexa\" to get a response from the speaker. Repeatedly shouting \"Alexa\" is probably more irritating to the neighbors than the music.",

Also the alexa is kinda trash in this speaker, but only because it doesn't have all the features of a real Alexa.",
