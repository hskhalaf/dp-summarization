They are a bit lower than chairs at a table, but that is perfect for lounge chairs. The arms are long and very nicely positioned. I just wish they offered other colors for the cushions. Assembly was easy. I glued all the joints when I screwed them together, just for better durability. Very nice and smooth wood. Highly recommend these chairs. I am 6'2\" tall and 180lbs and they fit perfectly.",

They need to be 1-1/2\" screws, not the 1-1/4\" included. We made a trip to the hardware store for screws for the last chair. It's the sturdiest chair of all 4 of them. We may be heading back to \"fix\" the other 3 chairs, too. Pads are nice and thick.",
