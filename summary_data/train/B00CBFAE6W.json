      "text": "Have been using this for about a year now. I \"prime\" it before each use. (Pour boiling water in and let it sit for about 10 min) Then, I dump the water, give it a quick wipe with a clean towel to dry it, and fill with hot lunch.......mac-n-cheese, chicken nuggets, hamburger helper, soup, leftovers......it stays warm until my kids are ready to eat. A great tool to have if you don't want to send cold lunch every day. Note: If you put hot food in a cold container......the container will lech the heat out of your food. That is why you need to warm the container first with the boiling water. :)",

It also fits inside her lunch bag perfectly. She does have a hard time opening it but the teacher or her classmates (who ever sits next to her) helps her out. Overall, it's a great thermos and it does indeed keep her food hot IF YOU FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS (fill and close with hot water for about 20mintues , empty the water out and add your food). It's also super easy to clean, I just hand wash it with some soap and water.",

My daughter actually prefers this since her soup isn\u2019t super hot when lunch time rolls around. Her lunch bag is kept in a heated school though, so if you were somebody who worked outdoors without the luxury of having a heated place to store your lunch bag it would probably cool off too much by lunch time.",

      "text": "These are great small size thermoses! This is the second one we\u2019ve purchased for our children\u2019s lunches. The size is great for a lunch box and allows a decent potion of food for a child. I warm food up in the morning and have had no complaints about it being cold by lunchtime. We have not had any issues with leaks; however, I have not sent anything like soup. I hand wash the thermos as the directions stated in the hopes that this will prolong the seal to avoid leaking. It\u2019s also very easy to clean. I would recommend for use with children\u2019s lunches.",

When putting macaroni and cheese, chicken nuggets or anything warm in it, I will microwave 1-2 cups of water for 2 minutes and place it in the thermos for a couple minutes, pour it out and add the food. This helps keep it pretty warm for 5-7 hours before he eats his lunch. My boss liked this idea and bought 3 for his kids lunch boxes. This is also awesome for keeping things cold as well. he will keep his veggies, fruit, or cottage cheese in it too.",

After 3 hours mac n cheese is 150\u00b0F. Should be 160\u00b0F for food safety but close enough for my likes. I bet it rocks for soups. It's hard for little children to open because of width and how tight it locks. Wish it had a push button or something for easy open on top. Other than that its great!",
