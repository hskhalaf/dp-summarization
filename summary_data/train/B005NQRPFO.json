Use the white trainer disc first to make sure you have a good handle and to make sure your skin responds well. Pull skin taught while running device across your face. Don\u2019t hover in one spot too long. Don\u2019t repeat sections of your face that you\u2019ve already gone over. Wait 6-7 days before using again. Try to resist the urge to touch your baby soft skin all the time!",

Well, I was wrong, he did it as recommended, I truly wish I had before and after pictures: it has been about 4weeks and I can\u2019t believe the difference.

As such I'm going to get rid of this and obtain a professional machine with a diamond tip since this is what is currently used.",

It's easy to use but you need to be careful because the strong suction will suck up loose eye skin. I would put MONEY that the girl in video does NOT have machine on. She gracefully glides it on her face. I wish the box to store the little machine & extra items was nicer. It's chintzy & won't hold up over time. I do recommend.",
