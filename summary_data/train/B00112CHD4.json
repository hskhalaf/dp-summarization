      "text": "Great game! I teach English in Korea. The adult version is too hard. But this is perfect. Some of the references (culturally speaking) they didn't understand and a few of the cards were too difficult for some of the levels. That being said, my students love this game. It encourages them to relay thoughts into English as well as letting them argue, thus improving debate skills. Looking at getting the version for even younger kids or the Disney version. But, so far not available for international shipping.",

However, some of the words and examples were of a more adult theme that my kids didn't understand or hadn't heard of (Bill o'reilly). So I decided to try the kids version, and it's great. They can understand the terms and examples, and we can still be creative and silly! Overall great game!",

My first grader is at a third grade reading level, so this is just right for him, but it might be a bit advance for emerging readers. Highly recommend for family game night.",

      "text": "A fun game, easy to start playing right away. The junior version is fun for adults, and doesn't have all the obscure pop culture references that the regular version includes (even better for grownups in my opinion). It's really good for kids who need to build their vocabulary, since they'll be learning synonyms for easy words while they play. Sharpens your wit, too! Lots of fun conversation starters in this great game. Kids can play it with other kids, or with their grownups and have a jolly good time.",

Funny enough, she has no idea she'll be learning the entire time she plays it! Each card describes the word and helps players learn new vocabulary and the type of word it is (adverb, noun, etc). It's always a hoot to play with a group and see what people come up with - but since it's the Junior version, you don't have to worry about \"adult topics,\" which I'm not interested in with my family group. Love this game!!",
