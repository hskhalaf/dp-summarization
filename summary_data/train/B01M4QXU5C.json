The arm came out looking like kindling!

I was super excited about that. I would definitely buy them again!",

Definitely genuine wood, and the lenses are a lot more tinted than I expected, making it easier to see when it\u2019s really bright out. One thing that I didn\u2019t anticipate however is the size of the glasses. I expected them to be average, but the lenses themselves are pretty big. I\u2019m 19 years old and I know that\u2019s kinda the trend to have bigger lenses, but I personally prefer smaller glasses. Although they are bigger than I like, they\u2019re still super good glasses so I\u2019m still giving them a 5, just be certain that you like larger lenses.",

Broke within a month of very light usage. There was a knot in the wood of one arm that concerned me as soon as I opened the box. It simply snapped while in use. Poor quality control to release this pair for sale.",
