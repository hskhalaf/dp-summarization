It is definitely louder than my older pre-amp, but does not compromise the sound quality. Just what I needed! Pros: - Affordable - Simple design - Easy to set up - Small, lightweight. Easy to hide behind a turntable. - Great sound quality, good volume - Includes ground connection - Additional 1/4\" output connection - Handy On LED light indicator Cons: - None",

For modern receivers with no phono input, this is a great option for a few bucks. I bet you need to spend tons more to achieve better sound than this and mine is part of a pretty decent system in the $3000 range.",

The record player I bought (Pro-Ject Debut Carbon) came with a cheap, terrible preamp that incessantly buzzed at a very low frequency. I hemmed and hawed and delayed upgrading because I thought I would have to shell out a ton of money. Finally, I just pulled the trigger on this one on a whim, and really couldn't be happier. They low-end buzz is gone completely, and this thing just sounds great. If you can't spend the big bucks on a fancy preamp but want your records to sound good, there's no reason to not buy this preamp.",

Maybe not as well as some other really expensive units out there, but if all you really want is to be able to hook up your turntable to your old power amp... this works just fine. Bear in mind that it's not this giving you issue if you hear hum coming from your speakers. It means that your turntable is too close to your amp. Separate them as much as possbile and you'll be just fine.",

Couldn't believe it when I saw how cheap this thing was, but that's Behringer for you - and like other Behringer products, it's a tremendous bargain. It's been running for a month or so now without a hitch, gets me plenty of volume, and an authentic, warm sound. Even better than the built-in phono on my old receiver. I'm sure audiophiles can pick this thing apart but I've got a good ear and it sounds perfect to me. Highly recommended.",

However, I use my turntable just for scratching so the hum isn't an issue for me and the preamp was only 20 bucks. I really wish it had an on/off switch, you need to unplug it to turn it off. Price and preamp = 5 stars Hum and lack of on/off switch = minus 1 star",

This Preamp performs flawlessly. I have it connected to the video 2 input on my Onkyo 7.1 receiver. Hum is only audible at Max volume. And it's only heard without the vinyl playing. Who listens to music at Max volume? LOL!! If you did you would only hear the hum between tracks, that is, if you knew what you were listening for. This is a great Preamp don't waste money on a higher priced one. Your vinyl will sound tremendous. Thanks amazon for a great product ! CODEMED",
