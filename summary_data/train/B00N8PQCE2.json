It eats through motor oil like it's going out of style, so be sure to have some nearby when using this. I have cut roughly 2.5-3 cords worth of wood and it's still holding up strong. The battery last about an hour with constant use and this didn't bother me because I already had another battery from B&D Hedge clippers, so I just kept changing them out. 1 year update, cut through about 15 trees, you can see how big they are in the picture.",

Second, as I have experienced with other gas-powered lawn equipment, if I don't use it frequently I often can't get it started when I need it.

What a surprise. This saw cut through and trimmed for tying and disposal three large 10 inch oak limbs, cutting through them like butter. Much more powerful than expected, and the battery retains power until it runs down. I estimate that it ran 20 to 30 minutes. With two batteries you could do an hour's work. And there are additional well designed 40volt B&D products which use the same batter, including a blower/vac and hedge trimmer. I bought them all.",

Definitely don't fill to tank capacity or you'll waste oil just draining out underneath and on to any surface. Definitely an issue on clients walkway or in truck bed when working jobs. Otherwise, overall impressive performance and chain life.",
