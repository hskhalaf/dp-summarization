      "text": "Dog eats it sort of, but not the reception I was hoping for. Way too expensive for a mediocre response from my dog -- but in all fairness, he is a very picky eater. I found some freeze dried stuff by Merrick that he eats better from the pet store -- that's expensive too but its a bigger bag and the dog eats it better. Do not mean to bash this product -- just my dog's reaction and my reaction to the cost, that's all. Again, dog is hot and cold on foods so I would probably buy it again.",
