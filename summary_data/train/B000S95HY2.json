On the downside the Fast-Trac III Ratchet Suspension system wasn't included so the hard hat is completely unusable. Don't know if that was a mistake or intentional. The description indicates it's included so without that I might as well use it as a bin for ice and beers. It's useless to me and now I need to purchase the ratchet support system just so I can wear this thing. Very misleading by the seller. SHAME ON YOU!!! caveat emptor. If I get shipped the suspension system immediately, this review can be changed.",

I chose the white version versus natural because I work around heavy equipment and it stands out better and stays cooler in the sun. Some reviewers mentioned a person\u2019s initials written on the inside of the hard hat. It does indeed come with initials, but they are part of the QC process at MSA.",
