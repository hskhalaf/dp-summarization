Before this I had an i7 hp 12gb ram 1tb storage laptop but windows crippled it. I doubt I'll ever go back to windows. Outstanding product!!!",

Love that it has a stylus but have not used that yet. So far I am extremely happy with it's sleek appearance and quick setup! Way to go HP and Google. Oh and the price was right. Got it $100 cheaper on Amazon.",

They were both from the same vendor, so I don't know if they have a bad lot or what, but image quality issues like this shouldn't be a thing twice in a row.",
