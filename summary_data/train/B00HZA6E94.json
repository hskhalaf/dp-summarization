Pros: Bluetooth connects instantly, and you can skip songs strait from the unit, and you can change the colors to match your dash. Cons: The mic could be better for making calls, it's quite, and there is no dimmer on this unit, so it can be bright at night.",

The wiring harness that comes with this actually has labels on each individual wire so you dont have to keep referring to the instruction booklet like most radios.

If you need a a stereo with decent features at a very good price then this is one I would recommend. Mine was a breeze to install in my 2006 Silverado. I was replacing another Boss unit and the plugs were exactly the same. Unplug one, plug the other in, done. The Bluetooth is very handy for answering the phone while driving and the display is nice and big. The variable colors are nice to have, a brighter color in the day and a more subdued one at night keep the unit easy to view in all conditions.",

To make it worse, the replacement does not remember the last volume setting and defaults to 20, which is fairly loud.

I only have two gripes - the digital balance controls are not fine enough - sometimes the setting I want is between \"zero\" and \"one\" and it doesn't do decimals. The other gripe is that, when playing from a USB drive, \"random\" seems to usually play the same \"random\" order... as in, not 1-2-3-4-5 but 3-140-79-20-50... every time you put in the same stick and hit random, it'll usually play in the same non-sequential order.

This stereo delivers a flawless BT experience. The sound quality, while not perfect, is very good. To improve the sound quality, you may need better complements (amplifiers and speakers), since I don't think this stereo will be the quality bottleneck. I have just installed the device, installation was easy with standardized connectors and screws. Let's if remains solid in the next weeks.",

I put this in a double din size whole and had to get a file and take the whole down another 1/8\u201d to fit it in, so I don't know if the radio is alittle bigger than double din or if the whole in the 98 ford ranger was slightly to small.

The light brightness issue that some of the other reviews mention is there, but just setting it on red worked for me. The main issue I have with unit is the built-in microphone. It's sound is terribly low and others can barely hear me speaking. I am having ground loop issues with it, but it might be just my connections.",
