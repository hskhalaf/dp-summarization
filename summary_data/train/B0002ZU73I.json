This is not a professional wood working sander but a handy homeowner tool for many jobs. Treat it for what it is and its' worth every penny. I've since used it myself and was please what it could do.",

I paused it for short periods when it showed signs of slowing. I combined this with coceca aluminum oxide sanding belts which fit this sander perfectly and are really tough belts.",

      "text": "I've had good experiences with Black & Decker power tools over the last several years, so when I finally decided to purchase a belt sander - I went with this model. The one really nice design feature this belt sander has compared to almost all comparable belt sanders is the nifty small front belt pulley. This feature makes it ideal for getting into small crevices - something that most other belt sanders are just not able to do. This sander seems pretty sturdy and can run for quite some time before it seems to be getting even close to overheating the motor. Generally, the weight and other ergonomics, relative to the price - makes this a pretty safe purchase.",

The dust bag can be a pain to get on/off sometimes and the zipper on it to empty seems almost unnecessary because it opens just as far as the hole to fill the bag. But for a cheap little sander this works well.",
