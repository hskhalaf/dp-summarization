The plastic cover reminds me of something you would put over furniture before putting it in storage...It's not pretty and it is not form fitting. I use it for added protection under a traditional couch cover. I pull the plastic back from the arms of the chair so you really can't see the plastic under my fabric cover. I had to do a lot of tucking and folding but overall, it works well for me. The plastic is very thick and durable, and it gives me the added protection I'm looking for without being a total eye sore. Make sure you measure your couch before purchasing.",

We bought them to protect our couch, loveseat, chair and ottoman from our psycho cat who pees on anything that she deems \"hers\". We cover everything up when we are at work or sleeping, and so far the covers keep cats totally off. The chair cover did not cover our oversized chair, but it covered the ottoman perfectly so we just got another loveseat cover. Not the prettiest solution.",

I put a large blanket over the plastic to make it more comfortable as I don't like the feel of plastic nor do I want my dogs claws to rip it.

After trying many products to deter my cat from clawing the chair upholstery this was the only one that protected it from her. She will lay on the protected cushion but no more trying to claw it. It also is comfortable to sit on or I can easily remove it and place it back on when I leave the room.",

They're easy to remove when we want to use the chairs and put back on. Thankful I found these!!!",

I keep furniture covered when I am not using it or when company is coming over because I have 3 cats which either occassionally scratch the furniture or pee on it (my male cat). This solves both problems. Plastic is strong enough to sit on it if you wish although I prefer to sit on the furniture fabric itself. Highly recommend.",
