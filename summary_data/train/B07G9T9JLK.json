For others like lettuce, cucumbers, green beans, peppers, etc. the food becomes wilted or spoiled much sooner than it would if it was kept in a plastic bag or container. If you use your vegetables soon after purchasing them or you keep them in another container they are still a great purchase because you don't have you use plastic bags from the store. If I need to keep something in a plastic bag I just reuse bags from loaves of bread or some other food item.",

So watch what they are doing to your produce. The stores haven't quite made it to this type of bag yet. Maybe they need to be on TV once in while so everyone learns about them.",

      "text": "I bought this set of 15 produce bags to put my vegetables into after washing them. (Plastic grocery store bags retain excess moisture so the produce does not keep as well.) These bags are a breathable mesh with small pores, so the excess water evaporates, but so far, in the crisper the vegetables have not gotten too dried out either. The bags are sturdy and look like they will hold up through many uses. So far, I am happy with my purchase.",
