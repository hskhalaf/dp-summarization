My two complaints are that it only has a single display port input, so if that port dies your screwed. My second complaint is the power brick is proprietary. So if that breaks your also screwed. Please make the next model with more then one input (DP + HDMI please - mostly for console hookups) and a standard power cable. Everything else is superb. Good stand. Amazing picture.",

Why is beyond my understanding but most likely because of the fragmented market of 3d and the lack of compatibility between systems. Every component must be on the same tech and that rarely happens across 4 or 5 requirements needed just to get there. Anyhow I had the right equipment except the monitor. It works. Delivery was super fast. Arrived days earlier than noted in the tracking. Thank you.",

The only drawback for me was that I'm not fond of the \"no-button\" power on/off feature. Putting your thumb/finger sometimes powers it on/off without issue, and at other times you have to do it a couple of times to get it to work. I'd much prefer just a button.",

Works on the DP 1.1a cable I had (8 foot) so the 1.2 port does not require a cable advertised as 1.2, test what you have before buying an upgrade. It comes with a 6' DP cable, but I need 8' to avoid strain when shifting the monitor. Crisp and smooth. 11/4/14 edit to clarify DP cable.",
