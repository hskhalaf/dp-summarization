There really isn't anything bad I can say about it. These are my favorite things: \ud83d\udc5f The Polar Flow service is stellar. It's easy to create \"phased\" runs (warmup, intervals/tempo/fartlex/etc cooldown) \ud83d\udc5f It's recovery module seems pretty accurate. I use TrainAsOne to guide my training and it's like they are in sync. When the watch says I'm ready to run TrainAsOne has one scheduled. So I'm pretty sure they're working on sound principles to make their calculations. \ud83d\udc5f The watch is really easy to use.",

      "text": "This is a beautiful GPS sports watch. It feels very sturdy, the screen is beautiful, and it handles the fitness functions well. Unfortunately, it would keep losing connectivity with my phone, and would stop updating my profile. This also ruined the usefulness of smart notifications, as they would just stop when the watch lost connectivity to the phone. I've used other Polar products before with my phone, so I suspect it is an issue specific to this watch (and might be fixed in a future firmware release). For now, I've returned the watch and gone with another brand.",

Some others could give you heart rate information on your swim once you were out of the water. I do not care for how it fits on my wrist though. Also, I wish it had built in optical heart rate monitoring. I have the OH-1 optical heart rate sensor that I use with it for some activities, but it is another thing to deal with.",
