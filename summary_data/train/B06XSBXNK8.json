The trainer\u2019s lightweight nature yet supportive build also resonated well with testers. Though the trainer was deemed comfortable, there were others who wished the midsole provided more cushion. Other gripes included the inconsistent width measurement and the high collar that caused blisters. But in the end, the lack of a movable tongue which made it tricky to put on became a huge factor for users not to recommend it to their peers.",

I has to take them off to walk to my car. I will try a pair of original heavy blue and white Thorlos that go above the ankle. My old Converse Chuck Taylors were better for the gym.",

Pulling them tight against your toes. You have to work your foot for a while to try and get it to fit right. not a deal breaker but annoying, I would not buy again.",

This is a training shoe with a 4mm heel drop and has lots of traction when doing explosive movements like bounds, skips, jumps. This shoe also does very well for running, which adds more bang for your buck. Most training shoes are way too expensive nowadays $80+ and IMO a complete waste of money. Here is a reasonable priced shoe that can be used for training/walking/running, is incredibly comfortable, and has a 4mm heel drop (nearly barefoot feel)!",

I use them for CrossFit style workouts and they have a slight heel lift, good for Oly lifting. Definitely wouldn't wear them for rope climbs though.

I also will often go the entire summer without wearing socks, so a shoe that breathes is important. These shoes take care of everything, while not looking clunky and goofy.

      "text": "Bought these for my 10 year old son in a size 7 men's. We had a super hard time even getting these on. After the first day of wear he wouldn't wear them again because the shoe is a sock style -- there is no tongue -- and there is a thick tab on the back that comes up real high. He said it was rubbing a raw spot through his sock. I decided to make two vertical, half inch cuts on each side of the tab thing to take the pressure off, which he said fixed the problem and the shoes are comfy otherwise. I'm just worried about the shoe falling apart now since I had to cut it.",
