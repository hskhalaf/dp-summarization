I asked the seller if they could offer me a discount to buy a smaller new one, and of course, they refused. They made this wrap super stretchy to make money, so that moms like me have to buy their wrap again and again.",

I have tried several wraps, baby wear products and I have not been able to find anything that was quick and easy to wear, specially when you have a fussy newborn and don\u2019t have much time on your hands. This wrap is sooo easy to put together and my baby falls asleep almost instantly while i have him in it!!!!! Overall this is an Awesome product and reasonably priced and amazing quality!!!!!! I also love that you can get different sizes to fit your body type which is great since many products out there are a one size fits all and sometimes that doesn\u2019t work for everyone.",

Thought this would be easy to put on and take off but with the multiple loops it\u2019s honesty not any easier than a wrap that is one long piece of fabric that you tie. This comes with too separate pieces, and depending on how you are carrying baby you still have to tie a separate piece around your waste. Was also not confident it was tight/secure enough.",

It was so much simpler to put on (though I admit it took a couple tries to get it right) and it was easy to slip her into it. She started falling asleep immediately haha",

I'm finicky about how my clothes fit in general, so maybe that's part of why this didn't work for me. It was handy when he was 0-3 months, especially in restaurants, but now I dread using it so much that I either carry him or use the stroller instead.",
