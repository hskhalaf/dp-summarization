Put the line to the test on some yellow fin tuna and wahoo and went undefeated on the day. Nice castability and no break offs. I tied a short length of flourocarbon in case a giant Trevally took me into the coral but never became an issue. I was able to put enough pressure on the fish early and kept them out of the sharp stuff.",

As an added bonus you can clearly tell the Piscifun braid is way brighter than the power pro. I love this when drifting lures in the river and detecting light bites!

I also cast it a bit with a 10\" worm and the line cast very well. It is on my Shimano Calcutta, which I also use inshore fishing in the Indian River. I will update how the line holds up in my mixed salt and freshwater use.",
