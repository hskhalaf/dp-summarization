I don\u2019t know of any knife that is that thick. Unfortunately, in one of the photos you can see where one of the rubber pieces was missing and I looked in the box to find it. It\u2019s missing. Still not a deal breaker although the wobbling drives me insane. Overall, I\u2019ll use it because it seems simple enough, compact and it beats busting out my deli slicer.",

Additionally, when you use it, you cut into the wood sufficiently to chafe/cut some away, which leaves wood and surface coating on the bread sometimes. If you are cutting bread with a thick crust, you either can tear it off or cut into the breadboard a bit. Finally, the distance between slices is thick enough that it's too much bread for sandwiches or even toast, unless you want very thick slices.",

Its way to short to be used in the slicer because the tip comes out of the slot and then hits the dividers. If you're going to include a knife it needs at least 3 more inches to be useful.

      "text": "Very easy to use and collapses nicely. When not using as a slicer I use it to butter toast, build sandwiches, etc. use caution with the shorter guides in the middle, serrated knives can catch on the wood in you\u2019re not careful, but it all depends on the skills of the user. We use it all the time now that we make our own sandwich bread at home.",
