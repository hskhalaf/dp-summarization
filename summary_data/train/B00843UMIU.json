Fun times. Also had to clean out the plastic remnants left inside (there was a lot). The only plus was the screwdriver left inside the cargo hold.",

Stable enough for EXPERIENCED kayak fisherman to stand in, and very light and easy to paddle. I've added gear tracks and more rod holders. You'll need to buy scupper plugs directly from Lifetime(it comes with none), but they are inexpensive. Very good purchase, but understand you get what you pay for; seat will get uncomfortable after a long day out, storage compartments have no stops so anything that goes in is free to slide around the entire hull, not as stable as other more quality kayaks",

      "text": "These took a bit to get here but the shipping co was great and moved up the delivery date. They are great quality and we love them. We take them out almost every week. Am now looking at getting another one for our son. We love that the fishing rod holder on the front side is removable so we can remove them for transporting. Our did NOT come with paddles and that's the only critique I have, that they should come with them. Very happy with these otherwise.",

Pros: VERY stable, I could easily stand up and fish in mild wind and waves on the grass flats Light and easy to transport on top of a car Lots of storage and tie down points Great build quality Cheap white bait buckets with the red lit fit PERFECTLY into the dry wells and even lock into place ( Attractive looks Cons: The rod holder is too far forward and there is only one of them Back scupper holes blast water up your butt if you move around (buy some plugs for them) Extra info: I'm 5' 4'' and 125 lbs",

It moves easy on the water and is very stable. I'm new to kayaks and I felt safe on it. There wasn't a getting used to it period. As soon as I got on it, i felt right at home.",
