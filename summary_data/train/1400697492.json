It is a key component in my business as well, small enough and powerful enough to provide light entertainment, from reading books to Candy Crush (great for passing the time on a plane).

Not the fastest when it comes to surfing the web. I like the added book functions it has, though. Auto adjusting back light for reading and programing to detect if you are looking at the screen are great additions.",
