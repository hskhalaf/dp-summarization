I can now sleep or read in peace while the game sounds are quietly confined to his headset! He says they are comfortable and the mic works great, It has been a win-win for us both. Best for BOTH of us!",

If you were talking with people, the crackling sound was unbearable to them too. I've basically stopped using them. Whoo... Only a couple months of use.",

There's a lot of headphones on Amazon, I would suggest trying your luck with any other brand.",

However, if you\u2019re someone using it for console gaming such as PS4/XB1, the actual audio insert gets staticky* with even the slightest touch of it. Also, if you want to enjoy the cool LED light, you need to insert the USB cord into your console as well as have it attached to your controller (hassle). The mic piece tip is almost impossible to flex/bend as well. There\u2019s just a whole lotta cord and mess that comes with this controller compared to others that have better sound quality with less hassle at this price. This headset is clearly favored for PC gamers.",

So far, they've been dropped, bent, slobbered on (from our baby), and have been sat on, but they've held up. The sound quality is pretty impressive, especially for the price. We've had them for a few months with no issue, so I hope they continue to work well for quite a while!",

His current headset sounded like a CB radio from the 70s and friends on the other end claimed his mic sounded like he was wrestling a narwhal in a vat of jello. We sought to solve this problem by asking ONIKUMA to fill this criminally insane void of audio quality by purchasing this headset for him for Christmas. The verdict? Sunshine and rainbows -- trumpets blaring -- confetti and balloons falling from the ceiling -- that sound you heard Christmas morning was his PS4 social network clapping in unison that he finally conquered the narwhal.

If you look at the bottom of your controller where the headset plugs into and there is a small circular audio jack to the left hand side of where a typical xbox headset would fit then you have a controller that does not need the adapter. This provides game audio as well as chat in one cord. This headset is literally the price of, if not a little cheaper, than the regular branded XBOX headset and is 10000 times better. 5 stars for sure.",

If having lights is important to you you will need an extender for console gaming solely for the USB.",

Noise cancellation is a blessing from chaos going on outside of these and the chord is long, the volume is great and the surround sound for certain games is legit. The USB will need an extension but we do not care to have a headset light up on our ears which you can't see. Its a cosmetic thing but can stay lit with usb extension.

The headsets do a good job of blocking outside noise, allowing our personnel to properly hear the customer on the end of the line. We haven't had any issues with the quality of input, and the output is pretty well done as well. The headsets are light, despite appearing bulky, and are comfortable to wear for extended time.",

Playing games like PUBG and Radical Heights one can determine location in virtual space down to a 5 degree variation. Example, I closed my eyes and had a friend run around me in game. Out to a distance of around 350 m I was able to find him by exact degree plus or minus 2. Playing music or video audio through it is near studio quality. Only slight downside is the length of cord, a full 3.25 meters would be preferable for most gamers i believe, to allow for slack to keep it from entering their gaming field. 5 out of 5",

They\u2019re a bit bulky, but also feel pretty rugged. I wish it didn\u2019t have the usb cable, but if you\u2019re using them with a computer instead of a game console it might be a nice feature. Time will tell on durability, but as of now I highly recommend.",

Sound quality is great across not just gaming apps, but for music as well. Clear, crisp high tones and meaty bass are both rendered with great clarity. I really couldn't ask for anything more from a set of gaming headphones.",

Comfort level is great. Soft large hear pieces. I would call these noise cancelling as once you put them on it cuts so much of the sound out in the environment. The speakers are loud enough with out ever getting ear busting. But the best part is the clear crisp sound is perfect. The kids say they can hear footsteps in FortNite better than any of the other headsets they have used. Basically for the money these are AMAZING Great product for a Great Price!!!!",

Quality is okay, but like most headsets at this price, is made in China with cheap plastic. Definitely don't get this one if you wear glasses because it will cause them to cut into your face.

On top of that, the sound cancellation is amazing. It adds a level of immersion to your gameplay but can honestly suck you in far too easily. And the fit is super comfortable.

It has full surround sound, where the sound moves based on direction, and a BALANCED sound: not overbearing bass or highs while both are still present. -Minasan19\n\nSound quality is awesome, surround soundis great, allows me to hear the animals and foot steps and whatnot in my hunting game. Same with Far Cry 5 when i'm out hunting game to get extra cash, i can tell if they're behind me to the left of right or whatever. -Kormath\n\n * About Microphone\n\n...partner (who lives 700 miles away in Wisconsin), said my voice was the most crystal clear he'd heard it in ages. -Bludingutz\n\nThe outgoing sound is equally as clear, and the mic only pics up what it should pick up. Background noise will not key up your mic, and you will hear no static. -Angie Dennis\n\n * About Comfort Level\n\n...After I received mine, I immediately used it for a 5-hour gaming session. I wear glasses, which sometimes can be annoying while wearing headsets and start to feel painful after a while. I didn't feel any discomfort even after 5 hours. Both the cushioning on the top and the pads around the ears are very comfortable, and they seem durable too. -Joost Op 't Eynde\n\nI wear glasses, and I've usually found that over-the-ear headphones are really painful after a while. As such, I usually default to earbuds, which allow me to listen to music for longer periods of time. However, I saw these headphones and figured I'd give them a try. And you know what? They're really comfortable, even with glasses on! I have them extended, so that they aren't pulling up on my ears at all (so they're just resting on my head and over my ears), and they're very comfortable -David Mortenson\n\n\n\nSpecifications:\n\nDriver diameter: 50mm\n\nImpedance: 16 Ohm\n\nSensitivity: 114dB +/- 3dB at 1KHz\n\nFrequency range: 20Hz-20KHz\n\nMic sensitivity: -36dB +/- 1dB\n\nMic impedance: 2.2k Ohm\n\nHeadset interface: 3.5mm + USB (USB for LED light)\n\n\n\nONIKUMA K5 headset is your best friend in game playing, no matter from the concept of product itself or after-sale customer service.\n\nWear ONIKUMA Headphones, Realize Heroic Dream.\u200b",
