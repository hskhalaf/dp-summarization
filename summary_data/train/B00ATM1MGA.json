It is loaded with so many features, it takes awhile to get familiar with them. I hope nothing happens to this camera because I don't want a DSLR or even a newer mirrorless bridge camera. There are a few specialized shots, such as super macro, that this camera can't do, but it does well enough to have earned me several Explores on Flickr, so it is plenty good enough for me.",

I bought it for action pictures of dogs we get in our rescue organization and it fits the need very well. I originally was leaning toward the Nikon P-530 but when I compared it to the HS50EXR I chose it instead. It's a mite larger and a bit heavier but I view that as a plus.

Really happy with this purchase, and would recommend this to everybody who wants to take great photos with relative ease. Macro and portrait are excellent too. So is the rapid shooting mode.

Lots of practical useful features, and the manual zoom is much quicker than a clunky motorized zoom. Color reproduction is excellent especially in EXR modes. Lightning fast start up and focus. Even the digital zoom functions well. The alligator pic below was taken at 42x full extended manual zoom plus digital zoom. Al the photos were taken from a far distance.",

It's a bit bigger than I had imagined, not having had the opportunity to handle it before ordering, but still worth the extra ounce or two. The zoom is crystal clear even at full length. As a fairly serious bridge camera, I would have a hard time finding something better (and I spent a lot of time comparing).",

    "description": "The New FinePix HS50EXR features a 1/2\" 16M EXR CMOS II for High Image Quality images, Fast autofocus and Quick Response. New Intelligent Hybrid AF auto focuses in as fast as 0.05 sec. thanks EXR CMOS II. Depending on the scene, Hybrid AF instantly switches between high-speed phase detection AF(found in most top-end SLRs), and contrast AF, which is employed when high contrast light is present. Applying the fastest algorithm according to the targeted subject and scene, Hybrid AF guarantees your subject will be in focus as quickly as possible ensuring your shots are captured perfectly. The newly developed Fujinon optical 42x manual zoom lens (24 - 1,000mm) effectively combines a spherical lenses, ED lens, and integrated lenses to achieve a bright aperture rating of f/2.8 - 5.6, and image stabilization. Super Macro mode allows close-up shooting from as near as 1cm and the manual barrel zoom ensures speedy, intuitive control of the camera. Lens shift image stabilization ensures that even hand-held shots are free from blur. And if you are trying to take tricky, close to the ground, macro flower shots or want to capture the band on the main stage above the heads of the crowd, you can switch to the very useful 3.0-inch Vari-Angle LCD screen. Again boasting a detailed 920K-dot, the LCD screen can fold out and flip around so you can see what you are taking - no matter what the angle you're trying to shoot at. The FinePix HS50EXR boasts a high-resolution (920K-dot) electronic viewfinder equipped with an eye sensor, making it easier to frame subjects and check focus in bright daylight conditions. The bright EVF accommodates a traditional shooting style, making it easy to steady the camera, even when shooting with the 42x zoom fully extended. Full HD Movie 1080p/60fps with continuous phase detection AF Phase detection autofocus is active during movie recording for faster focus response.",
