The fabric is fully reflective, so the jacket is great for being seen at night. The chest pocket doesn't open. Why bother to put it on the jacket then? The quality of workmanship was low; stitching is lumpy in places. I found a less expensive fully-reflective jacket with better fit and features, so I'm returning this one.",

It launders well if you turn it inside out and wash with cold water and regular liquid detergent. The zipper chest pocket is odd - barely large enough for a key, but I don\u2019t care.

Good quality, highly reflective, overall good buy. Would appreciate an actual zip pocket somewhere though.

This will definitely catch the bus driver's eye. When I purchased this, only Large was available for prime so in the future hopefully a bigger size will be available because my mother cant zip up the jacket but the sleeves fit her arm perfectly.",
