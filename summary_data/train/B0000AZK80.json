We came to find there was some kind of problem with the Breville thermometers, but Breville refused to support the product even though it was their manufacturing defect. I will NEVER buy Breville again. But the DeLonghi unit is great; looks great, works great, and doesn't completely break the bank. We use ours for Panini's, but you can use it to cook or grill just about anything. Highly recommended!",

Here is what I found out upon using it for about 2 weeks: 1. it has no off switch, and when you plug it in/out of the wall, sparks come flying out of the socket. There is no way to turn this unit off except unplug it, which yields sparks that look very unsafe. The only thing it has is a temperature knob. 2. There is no way to determine the temperature. The readout is \"Low, Medium, High\", but there is no information anywhere on what the actual temperature is, which is necessary to cook stuff. I checked the manual, nothing. 3. It cooks paninis :)",

Sits upright in our kitchen cabinet. 3) Nice grill marks (I use olive oil on the outside of the bread.) Cons: 1) As with all these types of small appliances, if someone could invent a removable grill section, it would make it much easier to wash. As is you just have to be careful when washing so as to not flood the sensative areas. 2) I want to eat Panini's every meal. Would give it 5 stars if it would just have removable grills to make it easier to clean.",

It drains the oil well, which you need to catch in a bowl at the side. It would be better if the grilling plates were detachable for cleaning, but otherwise it's awesome! I like how the grooves are a good distance apart, so they are easy to get a cloth in between when cleaning. And I like the carrying handle and the overall look. Very stylish, and very easy to use.",

Because it angles upwards, the back side of the bread makes better contact with the grill plates and therefore it cooks faster",

      "text": "I just purchased this grill for my wife for Christmas and wish I hadn't. I had read all the reviews an thought this was the best choice on the market, but due to some flaws it was not. The Good: The grill itself is good looking. The Bad: The controls were cheesy plastic. I could have lived with this, but the grill would not heat up enough to grill the pannini, which it is supposed to do. Luke warm is the best it could do. Perhaps it is defective, either way I am returning this grill.",

    "title": "De'Longhi CGH800 Contact Grill and Panini Press",
    "description": "Enjoy contact grilling all year long with the De'Longhi Contact Grill and Panini Press. You will always get consistent and thoroughly grilled and toasted foods with the fully embedded plate and contact cooking, as it distributes heat evenly to avoid any overly hot or cold spots. Impress your family and guests by preparing many different meals, from burgers to steak, to chicken and panini sandwiches; the adjustable hinge accommodates food of any size. For a healthier twist on grilling, the machine is slightly slanted allowing grease and oil to drain away from your food. And ensure precise grilling and toasting with the adjustable thermostat. If you've been grilling for hours, you won't be cleaning for hours, simply wipe off the non-stick grill plate and empty the drain cup. It's that easy! It's safety first with this contact grill -- the cool touch handles allow for easy movement once grilling or toasting is complete. Other highlights include an on/off indicator light and safety locking system for convenient, upright storage. You'll enjoy grilled foods and delicious toasted sandwiches for years to come!",
