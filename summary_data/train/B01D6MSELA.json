So, I logged another complaint and had to ship back that one and finally got another replacement today which is different than the first and second ones - no detachable tailpiece and it appears to be stainless while the others were chromed brass. I like this last one best - stainless and fewer pieces to clean. But, seems a roll of the dice what YOU will get. I eventually need 2 more, but not sure I want to take a chance on this item.",
