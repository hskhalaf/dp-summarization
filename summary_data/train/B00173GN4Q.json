I suppose I could drill them out but that would compromise the galvanization. 2) the plastic part of handle broken in less than a month. It's not required but using the bucket without it will dig into your hand. It should be made from wood or some more substantial the plastic because the weight of the bucket breaks it quickly.",

Only two good things can be said for plastice watering cans: they're lightweight and they can usually be recycled. But this review isn't about the failings of plastic watering cans. I decided this year that I wanted to buy a real watering can. I got one. Because of the pail-type handle, it's precise in its handling. The sprinkler head, while permanently attached, is just right. I've read other reviews complaining of roughness. If you know anything about plating steel, you understand that it isn't always perfect. I cannot imagine a better steel watering can for the price.",

They hold a nice amount of water, and the handle allows for pivoting the can to pour instead of all the wrist pressure. I should have bought these many years ago.

Not really sure how to describe it, but the water spreads out (in different directions) much further than on other watering cans I have had. Having said that, it's not a deal breaker and overall, I like it a lot. Reminds my of a watering can my grandmother had.",
