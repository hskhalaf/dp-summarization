      "text": "The JCase LED Globe Light Bulbs Candelabra Base, 5W (40W Incandescent Equivalent 4000K) are fantastic. They are much brighter than any 40W I have ever used so it took only two of these (at the top of either side of our bathroom mirror) to make a huge difference in our master bathroom. These are very bright white (daylight) bulbs so instead of using more of them in the fixture, we added four of the warm white Albrillo 40W bulbs and the lighting is perfect. After a week of use they are performing just fine but I will update this review in case anything happens.",

When one blew I thought it was odd but I changed it thinking it might have been a dud. When I replaced it the light was warm and exactly what I was trying to get away from but I just let it be. A month or so later another blew so I changed it and to my disappointment it was yellow again. As of today 4/6 have blow. Wont buy from this company again. Bright, perfect size, cool to touch after being on for hours. Just what I needed.",
