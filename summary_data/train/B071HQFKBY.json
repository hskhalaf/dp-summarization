I'm sure there are better options out there and maybe mine might be defective, but it's too loud to use as intended. Too bad the time to return has passed, because I've tried to make it work for months and unfortunately it is a huge disappointment. **Update** The company saw the above review and sent me a replacement. The replacement is much quieter and is in proper working order. Great customer support. Buy with confidence.",

Directions are followable, but funny to read. Easy to swap the skewer if you have a quick release, but directions say it'll work on a bolt axle. I see no reason why it wouldn't. Very very sturdy. Includes the front wheel cup so no need to purchase that separately. I'm not a competitive rider. 58 and ride 10-12 miles/day, 4 or 5 days a week ... spring and summer. Just trying to stay in shape, and this will keep me moving fall and winter. Highly recommended.",

It comes fully assembled, so don't waste your money on the add-on for assembly. It'll take you maybe 2-3 minutes to get your bike mounted. It makes some riding noise with street tires, but it's not terrible. The range of resistance is good, but not that dramatic. A couple things: - yes, it works with bikes that have disc brakes (or it works with mine, anyway) - yes (according to the instructions) it works even if you don't have a quick release rear wheel",

After feeling the rubber it was likely in the range of 140-150 deg F, and was uncomfortable to the touch. If you ride relatively fast, I would recommend spending a bit more on a better mag trainer or a fluid trainer.",

This is exactly what I had been looking for. Living in Las Vegas with summertime heat over a 100 degrees rules out biking outside. I needed something I could train on to keep in shape and lose weight. I bought a trainor before this with rollers that was aweful and difficult to use. My regret is that I didn't buy this originally!! \ud83d\udcaa",

      "text": "Changing my review to 4 stars as the product is very good, the one I got has an issue, and the support has been fantastic. There is something rattling on mine that is causing a secondary noise that is really loud. I emailed support about it, and they had me go through a couple of troubleshooting steps, none of which fixed the issue. They opted to send me a new one. Hopefully the new one won't have the additional sound to it.",

Cycling is probably our favorite, however during the winter months it is tough and have been having a hard time finding workouts that we both enjoy. I found the Sportneer trainer and have to say I was impressed. I just received it and tested it in both of my bicycles. Setup is very easy. It produces sound but not as high as I was expecting after reading some of the reviews. Some of which compared it to a vacuum cleaner and wonder if they received a defective item. Nonetheless, great trainer, foldable, easy to store.",

I loved the resistance levels and the ability to change them easily to mimic a spin class. But unfortunately the sound was deafening. Even though I have a light women\u2019s road bike with hybrid (fairly narrow) tires, the sound was untenable. I had to crank up my TV to the absolute loudest level. Not pleasant for anyone, especially my downstairs neighbor. Unfortunately this is going to have to go back. If not for the sound this would be a great product.",

Don't care tioo miuch about the resistance control that you can attach to the handlebars. I just shift gears if I want more resistance. Totally recommended.",

My only complaint is it does now really work for bolt axels (my old single speed is too narrow to fit in the mechanism).

I saw some comments where few people complained about wearing off the tire but if you inflate the tire to a high enough pressure this is minimal. Since the tire is designed for this I will say this is not a problem.",
