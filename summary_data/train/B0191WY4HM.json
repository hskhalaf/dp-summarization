There's not an over powering or distracting jasmine or peppermint scent. Just enough to sense that it's there so you can relax. The cool, gel-like mask (like all of them) stick to your skin, you can feel the coolness right away. Pulls the redness out of the skin. A slight tingle - I'm guessing from the peppermint. I have sensitive skin and didn't have any problems. After the mask - my skin felt VERY moisturized. Even in the morning. I'll be buying these for gifts in addition for myself!",

      "text": "I recieved this product from a monthly beauty subscription. I love it! I have very fair sensitive skin. Most of the time peppermint burns my skin and makes my eyes cry. Not this!! It's sutle and not over powering. Also, not having to wash your face once the mask is over, means less irritation. I encourage you to give it a try. You won't be disappointed.",

There is a lot of liquid in this mask so be aware when you open the package. Now slide it on your face and you can take your time smoothing it around your eyes, forehead, cheekbones. It stays really well in place which surprised me. This has a light jasmine, peppermint scent and you almost forget you have it on. Over all it felt great and relaxing. I left it on for twenty minutes and rubbed the excess cream into my skin. I thought it was nice.",

The mask is a very big sheet and it completely covered my face. It felt soothing too while I had it on. It comes off easily, but I'm not sure it took off much of the build up or dirt on my skin. It did feel moisturized and refreshed though. I think I'll stick with my usual cleaners to clean my pores and it would be good to follow with this mask.",

It felt good on my skin, and was a refreshing to keep on my face for twenty minutes. After taking it off, I massaged the lotion from the mask into my skin. My skin was glowing the rest of the evening. Definitely a nice treat after a long day.",

      "text": "It was a little confusing how to free the mask from the packaging. It is possible to get confused about which part is the mask and which is packaging. It is a little weird having to keep it on for 20 minutes, it has a strong smell that is a little uncomfortable to breathe in for 20 minutes. The smell is not bad, but it isn't a relaxing spa experience, it is more an ongoing attempt to keep a cold slimy thing on your face. It was not horrible, but we probably won't be purchasing it in the future.",

My only disappointment is that the jasmine peppermint is ...not. The peppermint is very strong and overwhelms whatever jasmine scent might have existed. I thought that was an odd combination anyway since peppermint is generally so dominant. Other than that, great hydrating mask.",
