However, the band tore after one week of owning. It looks like the band was not made to withstand any play sadly. I tried purchasing less expensive replacement bands and they unhook and do not stay locked in. So now we are forced to purchase a $29 replacement \"fitbit\" band in order to use product. Hopefully next one will be more durable and this just was a defect.",
