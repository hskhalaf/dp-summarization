I strongly recommend this drum pad for a beginner who wants to learn how to play drum And people couldn't afford the acoustic drum kit or use this drum pad for rehearsals!",

When I purchased this set I'd had my eyes on a few different models and ultimately settled on this one once a reasonable price surfaced on one. A quick YouTube search will reveal videos which showcase the FULL potential of this set (username \"julianondrumsify\" in particular.) The hi-hat pedal is not super responsive (though this might just be my unit/footswitch) and there's occasionally some vibratory beed-over to adjacent pads when you're hitting them with force, but again, this is a great beginner unit. If you get one and like it, but want more out of your drums - then consider upgrading to a more pro-style e-drums kit.",

Works...but... the foot pads are kinda meek and yes will work sorta. I think for a beginner or even a professional who wants to try things out in a quietish space. This makes sense.
