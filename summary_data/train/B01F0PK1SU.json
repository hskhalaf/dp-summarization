Haven't had problems with streaking thus far. Makes my face too dark if I leave it on my face for too long but that's easily solved. Fades kinda quick, but fades evenly. For the price it can't be beat. I'm veryyyy pale and the dark works great on my skin. I included a before and after pic of my legs",

You'll need to shower after it sets for a few hours, but not because you're sticky or stinky, but because it will \"run\" if you sweat or get wet (pool, ocean, etc.) and you'll be streaky! Overall super pleased with this stuff. Definitely use the application mit to avoid funky colored hands!",
