I decided to just keep using it until it died. It's been over 2 years later and it's still going strong. This is installed on a door in our basement and it gets used many times per day. The only complaint is the knob is a bit larger than a normal knob and it's smooth so it can be hard to open if you have something in your hands, if you have small or weak hands, etc. Other than that, it works great.",

The materials, the sturdiness that feeling of the buttons when you push them, the looks of the lock. Everything feels premium. It is a normal door lock, not a deadlock. And my only con would be that it needs 4 triple A batteries that are NOT included. Either way I recommend this product to everyone.",
