My only complaint is that when it came time to clean them I found dough impacted in a small lip around the rim of the cutters. I was able to get it out but it took a lot of spraying with my sink hose. If it had been a solid lip instead of having a space in it I think it would be much easier to maintain.",

Some have seams that aren't smooth and would make a weird dent in the dough (although some seem to have smooth seams, so not sure why all don't). If you don't need these to be perfect, they are probably okay, but if I don't want perfect circles, I can use a knife instead of a cutter. I bought a different metal set before this, and some of the seams were better in this set, but overall the steel was the same thin-ness and flimsy (thus leading to non-circular circles), and some of seams were funky, so really not worth keeping.",

I use the larger rings to perfectly shape my custom ground burgers.... when you take the time to properly source your ingredients, such as beef, and process/grind it yourself... you want the absolute best option to prepare and cook them. These work flawlessly for that purpose. Also, I use the different size molds with my homemade pasta - ravioli's, tortellini's, ect.... the possibilities are endless. The biggest factor with these rings is not having the lip on the inside. They clean easily and perform multiple tasks, at a great price. What more could you ask for?",
