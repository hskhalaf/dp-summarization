Fits my cargo pant pockets easily. It is a true claw hammer so extracting nails is easy. Weight is about 8 ounces and fits my hand. Love it.",

If you're looking for a solid small hammer to \"knock-out\" daily around-the-house tasks....Look no further because you found it. I recently used this to do some picture hanging and building some IKEA furniture and I couldn't be happier with it's performance.",

It has held up beautifully and is the go-to hammer choice around here. It is tough enough to get the job done, but easy enough for a young child to handle as well. I use it for hanging pictures in the home as well as for wood-working projects. The kids use it to hammer together small pieces of wood or hammer nails into tree stumps. It is a very therapeutic activity for them! Highly recommend this hammer adults and children!",

It was perfect for the job and it's small enough to keep in my pantry. Better yet I no longer have to dig through all the large items in my substantial Husky tool bag to get to the hammer. Did I mention it coordinates well with my Stanley All-in-One screwdriver? That's in the pantry, too. They look good together.",
