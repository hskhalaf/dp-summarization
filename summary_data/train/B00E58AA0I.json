If you purchase for the Canon you will need the mini shoe adapter. The sound quality is awesome. Just don't forget to turn on the battery as this is a powered microphone. The wind buffer that comes with it will muffle small breezes. You will need a different wind buffer for stronger winds. The microphone will pick up to 20 Feet away clearly and the attenuation will pick up another 5 feet away. All in all, this is a quality product and well worth the money.",

But actually, I learned, you need to unplug the mic from the phone when you do the playback, otherwise, your test video looks like the mic didn't work. But if you unplug the mic from the phone, you can hear the sound was recorded. I'm looking forward to using this mic with my next recording!",

One recommendation.... keep the box. The foam is great and the mic fits very nicely and secure.",

The audio captured on the mic is very comparable to all other audio I've collected from expensive mics, and left me wondering why I didn't buy this sooner! If you are working with this mic outside, I would recommend purchasing (separately) a wind sleeve just in case, as the styrofoam around the mic itself isn't too thick.

The significant difference is the sound dampening of the Rode mic's shock mounting system, which is much superior. So if you have camera operators who like to tap the tripod, the Rode handles that better. However, the price of the TAKSTAR SGC-598 is such that we can easily afford to give one to everyone of our videographers.",

I set up this very quickly and it has some shock absorber below the microphone. For nice audio pick up from 10-20 feet straight to camera, we can use this is cameraman also wants to talk ( cardiod pick up ). I am very much satisfied and full value for the money I spent. Its my daily vlogging microphone although I have some Rode Wireless go. I also use this with iphone but with two adapters sold separately.",

Just a reminder, this microphone has a On/Off Button--I myself am not used to turning audio on or off because at work we work with more professional camera equipment that gets its power from the camera itself and doesnt need to be turned on. But because this is used for DSLR cameras then it requires Double AA batteries. Definitely love this microphone with my canon T4i.",

It's made of plastic and metal and isolated by little rubber retainers to the plastic base which mounts onto the camera's flash mount. The audio is 10x better than the DSLR's built-in mic. A good deal for a beginning videographer. Overall, a good buy.",

I almost thought it was a manufacturing defect, however I realized the mount is in two pieces and can be loosened. I used the old rubber band trick around the round piece and plyers on the rectangular mount to get enough grip to unscrew the to from each other. I recommend getting a screwdriver and removing it from the microphone before trying to loosen as all the materials are very plastic-y.",
