I went out and got a patch kit for an easy fix. That solved the problem until it got another hole 3 days later. It now has 5 small holes that render it completely useless. Each time i fix one hole it develops another almost instantly. Very disappointed and would not recommend.",

Don't get this, they haven't perfected the channels and you'll be unhappy very quickly.",

It's been almost a month that I've been using it so I no longer think it's simply just the material stretching, pretty sure it leaks somewhere. That having been said it's not major, I can still use the couch and just top it up with a bit of air every other day or so.",
