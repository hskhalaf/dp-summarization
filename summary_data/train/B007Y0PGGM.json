A huge totes tub full of various items for the beach. A beach chair. Several pieces of luggage, a queen air mattress and much more! We also went through several rainy spots and the items inside stayed dry. This was east to put on the roof of our van and easy to strap down with the provided straps. I can't say enough good things about this carrier! I highly recommend!",

Once on, tie the remaining strap ends together so they don't flap in the wind while driving. It's noisy.",

      "text": "I'm giving this item two stars for one reason: The zipper only opens on two sides so you have to hold it open with one hand and stuff your cargo into the far corner of the carrier hoping that it doesn't slide while you're pushing across the vehicle roof. Also make sure that you pack the stuff you don't need first or you'll have to unload the whole thing to get to what you need. If it had a zipper on the third side you could just flop the lid over and get to whatever you need. So it's hard to pack. Aside from that, the carrier seems to do well at protecting the gear.",
