I set it up my myself and it only took me about an hour. I don't even have to use another dresser because this fits so many clothes and takes up very little space.

Great to hang clothes, also has lots of space to put shoes, handbags or jeans, hats etc. Love the choice of zipping it up to make it look neat or able to keep it open and accessible. Overall I'm very pleased with it better than I expected, definitely recommended this one (:",

All of the connectors that attached to the poles came in one bag and weren't labeled. Had to start over several times. The legs of this product are really cheap plastic, and the poles are cheap too.

You will save time with that because the instructions kind of suck. Took all of 50min to set up. I like the space it saves. It\u2019s not the most sturdiest of closets but again, you get what you pay for. Don\u2019t clobber it with heavy boxes or bulky stuff cause then your asking for trouble.

To assemble pay close attention to directions because it is easy to confuse parts & it never fails you will have to start back from the beginning.

Once completely assembled you will have multiple horizontal and vertical storage shelves. I ended up buying storage totes for this portable closet to better keep clothes organized.",

Some spoke about trouble putting the cover on. I suggest you open all the zippers and roll up the flaps, makes it SO MUCH easier! Assembly overall was easy as long as you follow the instructions.

It's perfect for anyone in a small space or just need the extra closet for lots of clothes. I screwed brackets into the wall over the back poles to make sure it doesn't fall over and it stays sturdy. Really nice product for the price.",

To build them you need to do a few things first. Separate the poles into sizes and then separate the connectors into styles. Look at the instructions and make sure that you have the holes facing up when you need to build a new level. This is a much better quality product than the other one I got. Don't pound the poles tight till it is all built then tap with something with a little weight. Enjoy.",

The clear joint pieces don\u2019t have labeling on the package saying what they are and that would have been nice considering the black bar pieces did. Once assembled it is sturdy and holds quite a bit. There was a spot on the front of my cover that was maybe dirt or glue. It did come off, but it wasn\u2019t pleasant to find on the product.",
