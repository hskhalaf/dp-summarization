These I returned since I still found the tightness to be a bit much (on the sides...the toe area had about .5\" space). I would recommend buying these at your normal shoe size. Maybe going one half-size smaller may work, but if it doesn't, you could always exchange them for another size. Overall, a nice quality shoe but just a bit tight for my enjoyment.",

These are the perfect shoe right in between the two. One negative for some is the sock like lining in the shoe, it doesn\u2019t bother me, but it may bother others.

    "description": "Under Armour TriBase Reign 2 Training Shoes When you hit the gym, you need to feel as connected with the floor as possible. Every lift, rep and WOD starts from the ground up. Under Armour's TriBase technology maximises ground control with three points of contact for a low, stable base that allows natural foot flexibility. Well-constructed upper The TriBase Reign are another in a long-line of well constructed shoes from Under Armour, built using tough ripstop materials and a durable mesh for lightweight support these are the perfect gym shoe. An external heel counter has also been added for increased stability and heel lock-in helping keep your feet in place. This helps reduces the risk of injury in the gym and gives you a more comfortable and tailored fit for your feet. TriBase The outsole contains Under Armour's TriBase technology. This technology has been adapted to maximise ground contact where your foot needs it the most, allowing you to have superior upwards flexibility. This will promote natural motion and ensure downwards flexibility can grip to the ground during lifts. TriBase has been designed to ensure that when you lift, you have maximum support from your shoes and your feet giving you the solid base you need. The low to the ground construction adds to this, allowing you for greater feel and power transfer during dead-lifts. As power transfer is essential during lifts, Under Armour have constructed the shoes with a strategic rubber built under the toe box for an even more powerful floor grip making these the perfect shoes not just for lifting but for all those intense workouts. Cushioned Midsole and Durable Outsole A full-length Micro G foam midsole has been added for ultimate responsive cushioning, this ensures that the TriBase Reign give you the full support you need in the gym during any type of workout. A full-rubber outsole wraps up the lateral and medial sides of the feet providing you with maximum support all around your feet. Adding",
