I was looking for something that was easy for one person to set up for when I take my dogs out by myself but still wanted a big enough tent to fit my husband myself and our two large dogs. We purchased a couple cots to go in as well and it all worked so great together. I told my husband I wanted to set it up by myself for our first use to make sure that it was doable and was surprised with how quickly it went. Loved leaving the rain cover off and getting the amazing views of the stars at night. I would recommend this tent to anyone looking for one.",

And that is coming from a girly girl who cant follow directions at all. Great also inside, you can stand up in it, I'm 5'4 and id say there was maybe 2 inches of room left or more. I fit my Full size mattress in there with no problem and plenty of more space, you can fit up to a Queen in there with some room still to move around. The material is nice, held up in a really bad storm and pouring rain. Great tent for a decent price!",

Also, I could see a small table in the center and having 4 chairs to hang out with people (could make a great mess tent). This is a \u201cfair weather\u201d tent, though. The tops and sides have a LOT of mesh, but when you put the fly on, all your visibility goes away. Very private. The door and front have zip covers for privacy. Floor was sturdy. For the cheap price, it was great.",

If you are camping where it's warm, make sure to stake the rain fly open on the sides. We forgot this step and ended up sweltering in the morning. Our mistake though, if you stake the rain fly properly you should get plenty of air flow. Definitely recommend if you're looking for a medium-large size tent on a budget.",
