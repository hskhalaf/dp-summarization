I could have bought a much more expensive bike for the cost of repairing this new bike. Ugh. Bad choice!",

    "title": "Huffy Panama Jack Beach Cruiser Bike",
    "description": "Color:Pool Blue| Size:20 inch| Style:Single Speed\n\nOnly from Huffy, and only at Amazon! Panama Jack is an inspiration of island paradise, of dreamy relaxation and tropical luxury, and that makes this one easy, breezy cruiser. Ideal for ages 5-9 and a rider height of 44-56 inches, this Panama Jack cruiser has an alloy quick release for easy seat height adjustment and an adjustable handlebar to ensure the right fit. Designed with the Perfect Fit Frame, this single-speed cruiser may be the most comfortable bike she\u2019ll ever ride. The Perfect Fit Frame places the seat farther back, with a lower center of gravity. This design, with swept-back handlebars, enables a more upright, comfortable riding position with full leg extension and that eliminates wrist, arm, neck and leg fatigue. When she is stopped, her feet can rest flat on the ground. That provides better balance and control, and increases riding confidence. This Panama Jack cruiser is simple to ride, and has a lightweight aluminum frame (much lighter than steel) that delivers more rolling momentum so it\u2019s easier to pedal for speed and acceleration. In fact, the frame is backed by our limited 10-year frame warranty (see owner\u2019s manual for details). The rear coaster brake provides dependable control, just pedal back to stop; kickstand included. Lime green splashes on the seat and wheels have combined with the ocean blue frame to promote the feel of riding on the beach. You can almost hear the waves crashing on the sand! The clear coat over the frame\u2019s graphics ensures it will keep its fabulous appearance, year after year. The soft, cork-style grips maintain a light touch, ride after ride. The roomy wicker basket is perfect for carrying lunch and drinks, bouquets of gathered flowers, or just favorite collectibles. The juicy, tropical flowers on the chainguard and frame insert add a luxurious laid-back feel for this beautiful ride. Generously padded for real comfort for the rider, the seat is stitched with lime green piping and printed with the Panama Jack logo in back to accent the plush look; dual springs add additional comfort as they help you glide over light bumps and dips. The wide black tires, with white sidewalls, provide good traction while the splash-resistant fenders block unexpected surprises from puddles. An inspiration from paradise, a design of pure comfort, a beautiful view of the tropics, and a joy to ride \u2013 this Panama Jack cruiser just beckons you to come ride near the shore. Huffy, We Make Fun!",
