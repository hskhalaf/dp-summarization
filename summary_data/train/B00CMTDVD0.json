But when I opened the box, one of the larger containers had a flap that was broken. The rest seem ok (hence 2 stars instead of 1), but I'm not sure how long they'll last. It was only $20 so, I'm not super upset. An 8 set from any other brand are more expensive so you get your money's worth with these.",
