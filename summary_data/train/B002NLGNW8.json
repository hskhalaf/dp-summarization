The immediate problem I recognized with the Mueller Fitted Wrist Braces is the need to thread the velcro straps through the slots when putting them on - very difficult and painful with swollen, stiff finger joints. This problem could have been alleviated with longer velcro straps, allowing the supports to be slipped on without the tedium of dealing with the straps and slots. I ordered the proper Sm/M size (the L/XL would have been far too big), so exchanging for a larger size would not be an option. Very disappointed.",

However, the brace seems to be made more with the upper size range in mind as it does not secure comfortably for smaller wrists/hands. In particular, the strap closest to my palm needs to be stuck to the brace itself, not the velcro strip, for a decent fit. If one stays within the designed velcro areas, the fit is too loose and wearing the brace becomes pointless. The brace does have its pros, though. It is well-made and, when secured to fit properly, does provide good support.",

The Velcro straps are in a perfect spot as to not bother me with anything I do, and since its hand washable, I wash it when I need and it dries very quickly. No complaints here at all, but I will be ordering another just in case I need it and they discontinue this one,,,",

Thank you, chronic auto-immune disease. -_- Anyway, my left wrist started to hurt a lot on Sunday so I've been wearing the brace to keep it sturdy while I worked. Coupled with my pain rub, it really did the trick. It also helped me to hold heavier objects with my left hand without putting pressure on it. I'm not looking forward to when my right wrist decides to join the pain party, but at least I know I made a great decision to buy this brace.",

      "title": "Tiny Thumb Hole",
      "text": "In my search for something to help with an ache in my wrist, I came upon this brace and decided to try it out. So far I like everything about it except the small hole for my thumb. The brace feels good and my wrist feels better after wearing it, but the webbing between my thumb and pointer finger is often sore or red after use. I have tried wearing the brace loose and tight, but the issue persists. I'm tempted to take scissors to it to enlarge the hole, but the material is reinforced and I worry it may gray if cut. :/",

Even so, this brace will be hard to beat. Toss it in the washer with your color load, let it air dry and it's good as new.",

Also, my hands and wrists are small and I needed this to be a bit smaller even though I ordered the smaller size. I had to crisscross the straps in order to make it tighter.",

The small-medium size needs longer straps to keep them within the guides when you're putting them on. The straps slip out of the slots when you're putting them on and when you have the brace on, it's difficult to feed them back through. The green cloth under the straps is too small to do its job and needs to be larger. I bought both left and right hand braces and the brace itself gives excellent support, but the sizing is frustrating because of the difficulty stated above.",
