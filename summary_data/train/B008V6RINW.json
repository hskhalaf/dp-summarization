A well detailed \u201cinstructions to install\u201d would be great for future buyers. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the outcome is worth it! It\u2019s still an awesome product.

Instructions are not the best, but each piece is numbered on the edge in red so you can figure out which piece is needed for each step. Figuring out which way to face was a little bit trickier, but I was still able to put the bar together by myself while my boyfriend watched. I forgot to use glue on the wooden pieces, and remembered on the last few ones for the wine rack rack, but it hasn't faltered yet. Would definitely recommend this for those who are in a tight space and want to utilize space efficiently.",

Then the metal racks you hang the wine glasses from will only hold really small glasses. Most of my wine glasses have to big of a stem base and they won't fit in the track so I just have most of my glasses sitting on that shelf instead of hanging. Other than that I love it!!",
