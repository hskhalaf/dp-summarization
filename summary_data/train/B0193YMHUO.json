An external mouse solves the bad pointer situation, but there appears to be no solution for erratic touch screen. But, it is functional and did not cost too much.",

The only issue is the touchscreen does not always work as expected. Since I do not have any experience with touch screen devices it is probably my lack of experience. I can still get to the things I need. Update: I spoke too soon. This thing locked up and rebooting doesn't help. Tried a reset which never finished. I never loaded any apps, just wanted it to check email on the web. Guess it's true...you get what you pay for.",

If you need a small lap top for work or study - this is not the one. Windows 10 is like other MS products - messy. Android products and OS win hands down. My error buying - will return.",
