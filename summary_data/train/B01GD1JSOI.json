Replacement unit finally arrived. This time, it would sit level with legs deployed, but not with extensions and not with legs flat. Also noteworthy is the spring clip that hold the leg on was not fully screwed allowing the clip to flop around. My previously purchased presto brand griddle lasted my wife and me 23 years until we dropped it and snapped one of the legs. Having been so pleased with the prior purchase, I sought out this brand for a replacement. Garbage.",

One side of my pancake is cooked and the other side of the pancake is still pale and raw. Very disappointed with this product. The cord is extremely short. I have to move things on my counter to use because the cord is short. Wish I hadn't given away my old one for this new griddle. :-(",

Slight heat spot at back left side that subtly cooks a bit more which was only noticeable with pancakes.

      "text": "I love this griddle. It is large and has evenly distributed heat. The only problem I have identified is the oil receptacle is loose. it kept falling out until it was adjusted by bending the metal part of the frame where it entered the bottom of the griddle. The legs fold under the griddle for storage and it is simple to wash and the nonstick surface comes clean easily.",

      "text": "Love the griddle's tilt leg feature ... helps eliminate grease. Love that you can leave it flat for cooking eggs or grilling sandwiches. Griddle is very easy to clean. My favorite feature is the size. I can do bacon, sausage and eggs all at one time, give it a quick wipe and do pancakes. Much better than having 300 pans to clean!",

It can be used flat or tilted (great for draining bacon grease). It's \"fully submersible,\" which makes it easy to wash in the sink. I recommend it.",
