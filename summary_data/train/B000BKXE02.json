Easy to clean, large surface, removable back splash and a breeze to maintain with adjustable rear legs to raise rear of griddle when cooking steak, hamburgers or chicken to drain any grease to the catch tray in the front. Great for morning eggs, hash browns or pancakes. This is in my opinion a 5 star product.",

It recently stopped working so I ordered another one.(Oct 2017) I bought a \"used\" and had to send it back and then bought a new one and had to send it back for the same reasons. The back approximate 1 inch of the griddle was rough to the touch unlike the rest of the surface. The cooking surface was not flat. It was raised from underneath by the heating element. You could see exactly where it was located. I am very sad that I am unable to replace mine and hope they get their quality control better.",

The nonstick surface durabilty I think will be the big test in this. The backsplash has scratched off the nonstick on the sides and back of the griddle.

However, the design of the handles could have been better. Both handles broke off. And since the legs are integrated into the handles, you can't cook on it without them. I fixed them at one point with some JB Weld, but it only lasted a month or so. The point at which they are attached is just too weak. I've tried to see if the mfg would send/sell me some new legs, but no luck so far. I will likely buy another, but just handle it carefully.",

I would buy this again if I needed to, and I have told my daughters to make it there next purchase. Worth every penny. Wish I would have bought this a long time ago.",

      "text": "This is a high quality electric griddle with solid design features and well regulated heating that does not fluctuate. Purchasers should be advised that, much like an actual grill or griddle, there is a heat variation between two sides of the griddle - it has a hot side and a \"cooler\" side. This makes it excellent for foods that benefit from such an arrangement, enabling you to move foods to the lower temperature side to prevent burning/overcooking (e.g, steaks). This is less than ideal, however, for other foods where consistent heat throughout the surface would be preferred (e.g. pancakes).",

      "text": "The nonstick griddle surface is excellent and makes clean-up very easy. The nonstick surface on the PCG-10 is actually double coated which is definitely superior in the long run. The griddle can be washed in an automatic dishwasher, but due to how easy the unit is to clean I have not had any reason to do so. I previously owned a Broil King USG-10 nonstick griddle for years. It performed very well. However, the USG-10 nonstick surface in not double coated as is the model PCG-10, therefore the surface life expectancy is not as long and the nonstick properties are not as good as the professional model. I would highly recommend the PCG-10.",

Very disappointing because of the price. What do I mean by wore out? I'm guessing it's due to gravity, but the plug into the griddle would lose \"contact\" and stop heating the griddle. I would need to prop it up straight with something. This started occurring within a year, and today it just won't heat. It's only 22 months old.",
