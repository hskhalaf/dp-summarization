      "text": "What\u2019s happened to Reebok? These sneakers were a huge disappointment. The quality is low and the sneaker\u2019s insole is basically a flat, uncushioned piece of material. There is zero arch support. I got a good price deal on these sneakers but had to pay another $20 for some decent insoles. I\u2019ve even questioned whether these sneakers are \u201cfakes\u201d since the quality is not right. Definitely not recommended.",
