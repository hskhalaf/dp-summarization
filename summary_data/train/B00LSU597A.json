After tossing these, I was able to scrub most of it off but not completely. Hopefully over the next few weeks, the rest will disappear.",

Not saying this is any worse, just that I decided best to just clean often and not bother with these \"easy\" products as they all have a downside, in this case the odor.",

These things do a good job keeping the bowl clean and prevent the forming of a water residue - you definitely can go longer between scrubbing sessions. You need to pay attention where you hang the thing to regulate how much of the soap it releases. It is very easy to hang, very easy to move around the bowl. Second time I am getting this cleaner value pack, my friend is now hooked as well and will also definitely keep buying and using this.",

The only real benefit was that it's cheap, easy to install, and helps a bit with the poo poo fragrances. Look elsewhere.",

In other words, I found at another vender for a much lower price ( one two pack for $2.99) whereas the six pack I purchased was > $12. So then my rating is about price only as, I really like the product but, my next purchase will be from the other vender.",

There is a nice smell which goes away after a week or so, and it does help keep weird stuff from building up. I disagree with the pricing as well. It is entirely too high for a sub-par- cheap to make product.",
