      "text": "Last week, my horse and I had a violent fall in a ditch, and then she crashed into a steel-railed pipe corral. Witnesses told me I hit it head first and slammed the back of my head again on the ground. Though I'm laid up for several weeks with bruising,a fractured leg, and a mild concussion, I realize things could have been so much worse had I not worn my Tipperary Sportage helmet. Bones heal, but brains, that's a different story. I am very grateful. Thank you, Tipperary!",

The visor is very narrow and flexible so if you do a \"face plant\" your neck willl not be snapped from a large, stiff visor. The air circulation is very good and the color is understated and nice. I feel very comfortable having my one and only daughter wear this helmet. I would NOT recommend this if it was cheaply made, our riding children are too precious too skimp on their safety products.",
