Drinking the water made me gag and was cloudy and horrid. But I couldn't afford or haul big bottles of water constantly, so got this instead and what a lifesaver it is! The water is still not Scottish quality alas, but it is now clear and SO much more drinkable! I feel so much better about drinking tap water here now.",

There is a useful electronic gadget built into the lid which indicates when you need to change the filter cartridge. The filtered water tastes much better that the water from our tap and the coffee tastes noticeably better.",

You can't fill the jug to the top because nearly 1l of the water doesn't pass through the filter but comes straight out of the spout when you pour it. I'd say this is a case for the local weights&measures officials!",

The spout is a narrow compared with my previous Brita jug. Like the Brita jug it has a built in timer that needs resetting every 4 weeks. However it is measuring elapsed time and not measuring volume of water. In my opinion these timers are a waste of time - if timer is reset on day 1, and the jug is not used for 30 days, you are told to change the filter 30 days later which is silly. A good product nonetheless",

The jug fits in our small fridge which is a bonus. However today the indicator is blank. I tried to reset, but nothing happened. I no longer have the packaging to return. Please can you send me a new exchange indicator. Also, is the lid supposed to rest or fit snug as we have to hold it on when we pour, so possibly a whole new jug would be necessary.",
