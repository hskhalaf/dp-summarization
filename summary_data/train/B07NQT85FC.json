I thought that I might have to install the PEK unit, but after a little research on my air handler unit, and I located the C terminal on the air handler control board. I ran the spare blue wire in the thermostat harness to the C terminal on the air handler, and the other end to the C terminal on the ecobee. Viola! It all works flawlessly.

I am really glad I made the jump to the newest version. Forgot to mention I can now yell at my thermostat to change the temp (or just ask it too).

Ecobee was easy to install, but I had more than enough wires present. Had to call ecobee on how to reintegrate my whole home humidifier, and i am still amazed on how helpful they were. They even insisted on staying on the line to make sure my 3 room sensors were installed correctly. They had me email pictures of my install to make sure everything was correct; then reviewed the sent pictures in real time. Very helpful and professional; without being condescending in anyway.",

There was a time when I called support, this is issue was diagnosed and determined to be electrical wires not tightened by another source, not the installers. I recommend this device to others.",

App is easy to navigate, though integration with Samsung's SmartThings app is a little clunky (but improving it feels). My one big complaint is the thermostat will struggle to find WiFi on its own if it power cycled; I have to manually tell it to reconnect to the network.",

The Nest app is slightly better except for the schedule module where I like the Ecobee better. The Ecobee comes with a remote sensor which is very nice if you have another room to monitor.

The apps on iOS iPhone & iPad are very functional, wish they were more in parity, you can't get all the reporting on the iPhone app, but on iPad you do. Remote control on smartphone is easy with all the apps, as well as on the device, glad they don't hide any of it on the device or on the app. Most of all, I like that I can monitor my usage and really fine tune it to save on energy bill, having the remote sensors really help with that aspect.",

Another feature I like is music can be played from the thermostat as well with your amazon music subscription. The Ecobee can also be controlled through the Alexa app as well.

Instead and activity simply is a start time, so you have to duplicate effort to add an end time, and there isn't a way to use a day as a template. On the whole, a nice product.
