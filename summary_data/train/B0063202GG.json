When i found it on amazon i immediately bought it. the watch itself came in perfect condition. the amazon packaging could have been better, it had wiggle room inside the box. still, nothing was broken. the face is hard to see at night and the arms need to be exposed to light in order to glow, normal day exposure wont light them up enough to see at night. its still a fantastic watch, i ordered him a large and he had 1 1/2 links removed. fits perfectly",

I don't like how heavy it is or how difficult it is to see the numbers on it but I'm getting is as a gift for a highschooler--he may not care about these things. Just wish the dial lit up... And the box it comes in isn't great (at all). Had contemplated returning it & getting something different but haven't found anything I like better so I'll probably stick with it. Overall cool watch though and seems to be well made. Chose it for the price point, quality, overall aesthetic and like the matte black.",

Only thing to consider is the size, I'm tall so it doesn't look weird but if you're tall or like watches that are somewhat big go for it.",

I already knew about being careful with the black scratching on the band or casing, so I'm careful with it and haven't had any scratches in it yet. The only thing that is a little annoying is that if you are in a dim lit room or area outside at night, it can be a little difficult to read the time since the numbers and hands are so dark, but the hands are glow in the dark if you let it set in the light long enough. Even with this though, the watch looks sharp and I love it.",

Unfortunately it was a bit too big for my boyfriend's wrist so I am returning it, but over all this was a great product and a great price.",
