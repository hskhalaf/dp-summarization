Going with Petzl was the safe choice, and the rechargeable battery was something I enjoy because I know that I go hiking with a full charge (and use my power bank to charge in case of emergency). But this rechargeable battery never worked. I have tried regular battery it worked, but even after charging the Petzl battery pack, it did not turn on. I tried to fix it but it was on the plastic level that the connection was loose and did not make contact with the battery pins. I have returned the item and I actually don't know which headlamp I am going to buy next.. Any advices?",

Having one more click downward would have been very useful for reading. A blinking white light would be handy but not necessary. There is a blinking red light. The Core rechargeable battery lasts a long time and uses standard USB cables for charging. The lamp is water resistant and has a beautiful design.",

Lightweight but still sturdily-built. Rechargeable battery with AAA backup is a great feature. The whistle is loud, and it's nice to keep these two essentials together.
