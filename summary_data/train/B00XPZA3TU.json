So far worn them only around the house, but they are comfortable and fit well. They are a bit narrow though, but manageable. I wear size 6.5, the color I wanted was not available in that size so I purchased size 7. It fits comfortably. I've had other JS shoes before and they fit well in 6.5. So you aren't too picky half-a-size shouldn't make a big difference in my opinion.",

Wouldn't recommend these if you have bunions, stick to almond toe shoes, or see about stretchingthem, although the color may fade.",

After one day of wearing them in an office environment with mostly desk work there were several marks and scuffs not to mention that my feet were bleeding. These shoes are so cute but unfortunately I had to send them back.",

I've bought maybe 6 or 7 pairs of these shoes. When they're good they're great! The only problem is, the heels are weak. They break within a short time. I love these shoes so much, I just keep buying. Better workmanship on the heel would give these 5 stars!",
