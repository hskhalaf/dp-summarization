Now she is a pro like her siblings. Good starter drone, and durable--she has crashed it multiple times and hasn't lost any parts. Keeps on flying!",

      "text": "I am really surprised how fun this little drone is to fly! It did take me some time to get use to the controls and how to muenover but after a few flights you will get it down. The battery life is actually pretty incredible. You will need 3 AAA batteries for remote but thats all you will need to get it up in the air. It comes with the USB charger for the drone battery. I wish the clear piece for your fingers to go into was bigger. I have large fat finger and its pretty tight getting them in there. But definitely a fun product I recommend for the price.",
