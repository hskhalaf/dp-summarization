This will not stop thing from getting stale This is odd considering the bottom cover does have a seal. 3) when dispensing softer cereal it seems to crush about 1/3 of the cereal being dispensed. (honey nut cheerios for example)",

I find it good looking on the counter, easy to use, good quality and a fair price. Mine is a dark red. It's also packed very well. Perhaps they should have a gasket for the top as they do the stopper but even in Florida summer cereal stays fresh. Highly recommend.",

Most importantly, I wish you could adjust the amount it dispenses with each twist of the handle. Granted, the description didn't say it was adjustable for portion size, but it would be nice to have. You have to be VERY careful when turning the handle or it dumps a large portion quickly, and you have to open the top to dump some back in the canister. Overall, based on my experience, I would recommend this with the above caveats.",

It's also easy to dispense, just rotate right and then left, back and forth until you reach desired amount, then just replace the cap which goes in place easily. HIGHLY RECOMMEND",

I put a bowl underneath them to catch extra (unintended) flow. Then empty it out when getting the next amount out. Think they will work well.

It is very easy to clean but it also keeps the mess to a minimum to almost no mess. It is an awesome buy. I may purchase another set for snacks.",

I'm considering getting more for snacks!",

I was hesitant to buy it due to a review stating that the cereal got stale however it has a a lid where the cereal comes out so it helps with keeping it fresh.

It has the capacity to hold quite a few pounds of each, but we don\u2019t want to risk more than 3lbs. of weight in each dispenser.

    "description": "Color:Red| Size:4.4lbs.| Design:Food DispenserIt\u2019s breakfast time, and you\u2019ve a got a hunch your kids want that crunch. That\u2019s when you dole out the bowls and tell them to serve it up with help from this Double Cereal Dispenser. The dual dispensing technology uses a soft paddle wheel that keeps flakes fluffy as they tumble down and dance into their bowls. While Jake and Emma like turning the easy-twist knob and learning how to serve themselves a standard size portion, you enjoy the removable bottom tray for easy crumb clean-up. And if it\u2019s never a good time for cereal time in your household, use these large cereal containers to dispense nuts, legumes, and more non-cereal consumables.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nCombining contemporary styling with a user-friendly design, this dual portion control dry-food dispenser can hold up to 17.5 ounces of food in each canister. It is suitable for a wide variety of dry foods such as cereal, trail mix, candy, granola to nuts, beans, rice, etc. The unit's as-needed dispensing keeps food sanitary and germ-free, while its airtight seal helps prevent food from going stale and preserves freshness for up to 45 days, which means less food wasted. This food dispenser is ideal for parents as it promotes growing independence as children learn to serve themselves or for people living a healthy or weight conscious lifestyle. To use, simply place a bowl under the spout and twist the knob. The unit's portion-control system uses a soft, flexible paddle wheel that won't crush cereal, reduces messy spills, and dispenses a measured amount with each twist--about an ounce. Kids will enjoy turning the knob and watching cereal fall perfectly into their bowls, and parents can be assured that kids won't be spilling cereal all over the kitchen counter. Other highlights include durable scratch-resistant and shatterproof construction, a removable bottom tray for quick cleanup, and an easy-to-assemble design. Dimensions: 7.5\u201d D x 13\u201d W x 16.3\u201d; Dispenser Opening: 3-Inches from Platform.",
