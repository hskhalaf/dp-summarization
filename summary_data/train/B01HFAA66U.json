This Merrell hiker also receives great acclaim and applause for having excellent longevity and superb overall aesthetic.However, its list of commendable features reveals a couple of setbacks, mainly because of its heel slippage.

      "text": "When I first got these, i would have scored full marks. However, as a previous comment the laces are really stupid, they do not keep tied you have to double knot them which I think looks naff. The second design fault is that they are like walking on ice on some surfaces - anything metal, you could be up in the air. These two design faults are an inconvenience, but the comfort and fit is amazing - they are small fitting, i am 8.5, but a 9 fits perfectly. They are so comfortable you could walk miles. they look great too I cant believe how Merrell - i'm a big fan can get the basics so wrong???",

I have had several pairs of Merrell trainers which were very comfortable and well made but these walking boots were not up to the usual standard. I eventually found a very good pair of Ecco boots that tick all the boxes.",

These are of the usual quality and comfort levels I have come to expect and although Merrells are not cheap IMHO they offer the consistent longevity due to their exceptional design and build.",

I'm past the return date so it looks like these will be used for daytime dry weather and I'll need to splash out on a pair that actually do keep moisture out.
