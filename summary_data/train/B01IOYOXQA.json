So it works for what we need, although I wish there were a few more pockets on the bag. The pockets that are there on the outside are very small, so I am still looking for a good use on the bag. Overall, the quality of the bag has been good, and it has held up great for the first half of the year. If it holds long term, this could become a five star product, since it is doing exactly what I purchased it for.",

We never took it off to monogram, but it just came off and now the zipper won't stay on. We've gotten to the point where we just put everything inside without the flap on and roll it, making sure not to lift it too far upright so nothing falls out. It's also very hard to get bats in the back when the bag is full. It's a great size, and still probably the best we've found, I just wish it was easier to use.",

If it\u2019s not completely stuffed it crumpled and doesn\u2019t quite roll correctly. I suggest showing the bottoms of these bags with wheels. This bag will tear it seems with minimal effort after being dragged around a baseball field and handled as intended. Picture clearly shows catchers gear in the compartment however the details contradict this by saying \u201cNot Intended to hold catchers gear\u201d.
