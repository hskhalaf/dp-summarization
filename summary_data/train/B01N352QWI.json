Similar results with cold water, but it takes longer to release the paint. I also pressure washed lots of mold from timber/studs, floors sheeting ect. I havent tried it on my car or truck yet.",

If the foaming had been better I would have given 5 stars UPDATE This works as expected, but the proprietary connectors severely limit what you can do. There are many aftermarket attachments that cannot be used because of this limitation, and the Realm attachments (especially the soap bottle) cannot compete with foam cannons that use standard quick connects. Look elsewhere if you want a machine with more options",
