The result is a very crinkly bag. If this is cotton, it certainly doesn't feel that way. Unfortunately, the coating does not keep these bags airtight...I stored a rice cake in one and it got stale very quickly. Also, after one wash, the colors on the outside are fading in spots or coming off. I might use these for non-perishable items.",

      "text": "I love that these come in three sizes and are machine washable. I initially bought this product because I felt bad throwing away disposable snack baggies all the time and wanted a reusable option. Buying this product allowed me to do my part of the environment, but it also had the added bonus of supporting and learning about the artist who did the design, Mark Ashkenazi. The designs are all beautiful, but I chose this particular one because the proceeds go to the World Summit organization. Will buy more as gifts!",

The designs are precious and the quality seems great so far. We've been using them for a week now. I'm hoping they maintain their durability because it's clear that these are a hit!",
