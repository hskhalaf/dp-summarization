The dimensions allow me to view three pages simultaneously without a problem, up to four pages if you want to fill the screen. Very happy I opted for this screen. I was looking at a number of different monitors--Dell, Asus, AOC, BenQ. They all had a number of features that I wanted, but none had the right combination. This monitor has a 75hz refresh rate and good enough resolution. Plus the 37.5\" size is fantastic. I don't think a 35\" would have made me as happy.",

I'm not a gamer so I can't tell you what that is like but for productivity this is a game changers. Spreadsheets, programming, music (DAWs look great in full screen!), video, graphic design are all wonderful with this monitor. The only thing that I can say that's bad, is I wish had bought it sooner.",

If you're used to 4k 27\" monitors - the PPI on this monitor will be a little larger than you'd like, but still quite reasonable considering the size. The curve is perfect, not too flat like a lot of other curved ultrawides out there. The lights under the monitor are great at night - when on white, they provide a nice soft/subtle light for your entire desk. 75hz is great, I've read of a lot of people overclocking theirs to upwards of 100, but I wasn't able to with any success. It's a downgrade in hz from my previous predator, but an upgrade in every other aspect.",

Also the dimmable LED under-lights were a nice touch. And finally the monitor stand is 500% better than the LG.",

Acer only has drivers for Win 8 and earlier so you cannot get the refresh rate past 30 - the monitor is capable of 75. After speaking with ACER, they said no plans for that driver. So Windows 10 only see this as a Generic PNP monitor with a 30 refresh rate. This is also not mentioned in the ads for this monitor. Hooking it up was easy, the monitor itself is very sturdy and doesn't wobble at all. The speakers are nice, but a bit muffled being underneath. But noise free and sound great with headphones.",
