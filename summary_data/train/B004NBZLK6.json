I would light one each night at dark and they gave the tent a mice warm glow with just enough light so I could get around any time of night, still burning bright in the morning and still a slight glow 24 hrs later. They made the stay in the tent more convertible and they did not attract bugs.",

The civilian version (SnapLight) is better then the military version (ChemLight) as the civilian version has all the latest composition and chemistry updates allowing for more brightness and shelf life longevity (5 year as compared to 4 for the ChemLights). This is because ChemLights are required to meet a DoD standard that locks them in to an older chemistry configuration. I keep them in my camping and emergency kits.

      "text": "There really is no replacement for Cyalume chem/glow sticks. Many other glow sticks work well, but don't have the brightness or the longevity of this brand. In context to other Cyalume glow sticks, these are not as bright as the green ones, but serves it's purpose well. I normally use green for general use (camping, backpacking, power outages, etc) and yellows more for a \"warning\" or \"caution\", as I did in this case. On a side note, orange or red does not create enough light unless it's really dark. I would highly recommend this particular band. That being said, yellow is not ideal if you're looking for brightness.",

I have used them for night SCUBA diving, cave and cavern exploration to include underwater, and in hazardous atmospheres as a primary light (non-flammable) and they produce light with almost no heat. Easy to initiate after removing the wrapper by simply cracking the vial inside the large vial and shaking. Disposal is also easy as the chemical reaction eventually dissipates and and all that has to be done is throw them in the garbage. Keep in mind that there is no \"ON/OFF\" switch. Once activated they will run their course to depletion.",
