To be honest I'm sure you know why you want this if you're here. I'll admit it runs hot, and can reach fairly high temperatures during heavy use (And chews through electricity like an AMD chip) When it was released, Intel released a semi-official statement saying that anybody could overclock this to 5 GHz given adequate cooling. Not sure what cooling they meant, but it's a damn good processor.",

Perfect for people video editing or with top end graphics cards, but can fall a little short on multiple GPU setups. Apart from that though there really is no knocking this product. One major piece of advice though is that if you don't plan on overclocking, you can buy a Xeon E3-1231 v3. This is the EXACT same processor just with no overclocking or on board graphics (you'll need a graphics card). It can be found for \u00a380 cheaper as it does not carry the i7 badge, but performs the same and is the same inside. It is also rated for 24/7 usage and higher reliability.",
