Long-story-short, they were sold out, so I asked her to shop around, because I wanted her to have one she liked (at 17 it's kind of important to have a really good skin care regimen). She was in target with a friend looking at school supplies and saw this. I found it on Amazon and there was even a check it coupon. My daughter loves it because the head is small enough to get around her nose, which other brushes dont.",

My pores have never been so clean and the only reason I gave this product a 4 star (instead of a 5 star) review for \"how moisturizing is it\" is because it's not really designed to be moisturizing per say. It's an exfoliant/cleanser, and then you moisturize after the use of this product. So the question seemed a bit out of place, but overall I have to say - FANTASTIC!",

The head rotates 360, which I'm not a fan of but again... given the cost, I can't complain too much about it. If you're curious about the facial brushes, this is a great place to start.",
