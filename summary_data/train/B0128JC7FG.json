For proper connection I would suggest new users to follow the instructions strictly (otherwise won't work). You may need to buy additional cables if the standard ones don't work with your laptop. For sound, go to Start>Control Panel>Sound>Playback tab. Select \"Speakers\" as the default audio playback device. We didn't need any additional drivers/applications to run it.",

Impressive piece of kit, it's a good backup for small meetings if no access to a projector.",

So I'm forced to conclude that this product doesn't work with windows 10. Such a shame because it's a great looking pocket sized product",
