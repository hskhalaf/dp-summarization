SAMSUNG, BRING BACK THE SM-140 AND GIVE THEM MORE GAIN IN THE AMBIENT MODE, I NEED THE HEARING ASSISTANCE! THEN THEY WOULD GET THAT FIFTH STAR, AND BE THE VERY BEST BUDS MONEY CAN BUY!",

I was advised by Samsung to keep them clean with alcohol. After a few cleaning, the pair got really glitchy. Lots of noise in the sound. Then parts started falling off, these tiny mesh-screens. And now, they've stopped working. Wow, Samsung really dropped the quality check. Especially for the price. I'll be switching back to my cheaper Bluetooth headphones by Aukey. Which still work and cost 1/5th the price.",
