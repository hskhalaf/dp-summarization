      "text": "Ok, after 2 months of regular use @ the gym, the left side earbud began to crackle at all volumes. Shame, the sound quality was good until then, and there is no way this should have happened so soon. After 3 emails to Sol Republic, they agreed to replace the product and also explained their warranty policy. WARNING to all potential purchasers: A Sol Republic representative said they will not honor the warranty policy if the product is purchased from an \"UNAUTHORIZED\" dealer. Thus, before you buy and get what seems to be a good price, make sure the seller is actually an \"AUTHORIZED\" dealer or you are out of luck!",

Today when I plugged them in, sound was only coming out of the left earphone. I am bummed because I thought the L-shaped headphone plug would last longer than a straight one, but the iLuv iep515 earphones I bought at the same time with a straight plug are still working. So I got 17 months out of them. $57 is more than I want to pay for a product that breaks in less than two years, but I would buy them again at a lower price.",

From my experience with many types of earbuds, as a dj and not into exercise, you cannot beat the secure fit that these provide.

Volume needs to be cranked a little more than halfway up to experience the good sound it produces. Shuts out ambient noise largely and the buds don't ever fall of. Treat it as robustly you may, nothing happens to it! Super comfortable while running, sweat-proof so far!",

They came with four size options for the ear pads which are easy to change and the stability and comfort of them during heavy cycling or gym days is what you expect from a highly rated pair. I've had them a couple months so...so far so good",
