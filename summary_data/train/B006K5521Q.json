Their aftermarket battery policies just suck. Yes, I get that they want you to buy THEIR batteries, but disabling aftermarket batteries is just bad, all around.",

Only con with the camera is that it doesn't have a quick-easy manual and the flash is located in a bad spot (it's right where I hold the camera).",

I did buy the premium memory card that supposedly writes 45GB/sec, but the camera does not seem to be able to keep up anywhere near that speed. Otherwise, the camera has outstanding features, and takes beautiful shots. The GPS is an added bonus, though it did not always capture a strong enough signal to get a proper fix. I was disappointed at some of the manual settings, but then if that's what you're after, you really should be looking at SLRs, not these smaller units. All in all, highly recommend this camera.",

It's 16x optical/32x Clear Image zoom gets you closer for detailed 18.2 MP pictures, while optical stabilization provides for smooth Full HD videos and high speed AF. Enjoy features such as Photo Creativity, which lets you preview exposure, white balance, and Picture Effects before you shoot.\n\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n18.2 MEGAPIXEL EXMOR R CMOS IMAGE SENSOR\nThe 18.2MP Exmor R CMOS sensor captures ultra-high definition images that take full advantage of the camera\u2019s sharp Sony G lens. The sensor enables advanced processing that reduces noise levels, resulting in stunning low light images with incredible details.\n\n\nHIGH SPEED AF\n\nTo improve focusing speed and sensitivity, the Exmor R CMOS sensor uses its rapid throughput to deliver high-quality image signals to the camera\u2019s BIONZ processor. The result is fast, DSLR-like focusing speeds, even in low light.\n\n\nOPTICAL ZOOM PLUS CLEAR IMAGE ZOOM\n\nMost digital zooms use electronic cropping to get closer to the subject, resulting in unsharp images. With Clear Image Zoom the powerful processor compares patterns found in adjacent pixels and creates new pixels to match selected patterns, resulting in more realistic, higher-quality images. Clear Image Zoom doubles optical zoom for closer photos.\n\nFULL HD 1080/60I\n\nRecord crystal clear movies at the highest resolution available with capabilities for 60i in 1080 AVCHD video.1 This provides stunning, fast motion video with less distortion for playback on your HD TV.2 With dual record of stills and movies, you can shoot both at the same time.\n\nCAPTURE THE DECISIVE MOMENT WITH UP TO 10FPS\n\nCapture full 18.2 megapixel resolution images at up to 10 frames per second, helping to ensure that the decisive moment is captured such as the soccer ball flying into the goal. In addition, a mechanical shutter helps reduce distortion when continuously shooting moving subjects. \nOPTICAL STEADYSHOT WITH ACTIVE MODE\n\nOptical SteadyShot with Active Mode for blur-free movies even while walking.4 Camera-shake compensation using Optical SteadyShot/Active Mode has been improved with the addition of new electronic image stabilization.Now it\u2019s easier than ever to obtain sharp, blur-free movies even when zooming in unsteady situations, such as shooting with one hand while walking. \n\n3D STILL IMAGE AND 3D SWEEP PANORAMA MODE3\n\nProduce awe-inspiring images with 3D still image and 3D Sweep Panorama capabilities.3 Photos will take on a new dimension of creative capabilities for viewing the world in a whole new way.\n\nBACKGROUND DEFOCUS\n\nDSLR photographs are often beautiful because they blur the background, putting the emphasis on the subject. Now our point-and-shoot cameras can deliver this signature DSLR benefit. The system takes two shots, identifies the background and applies a defocused background keeping the subject crisp and clear.\n\nPICTURE EFFECT FOR MORE EXPRESSIVE PHOTOS \n\nPicture Effect adds a new level of expression to photos, making ordinary landscapes and portraits come to life by heightening mood and emphasizing certain attributes. Select camera models have up to nine different effects. \nPHOTO CREATIVITY\nPhoto Creativity allows you to fine-tune your exposure settings, such as brightness, color, and vividness, and quickly choose the right enhancement for your subject. Now you can view Picture Effects and Photo Creativity effects in real time on the camera\u2019s monitor or in the viewfinder before shooting. \nSUPERIOR AUTO MODE\n\nGet cleaner, more dynamic pictures and fewer missed shots. The DSC-HX10V automatically recognizes the correct scene mode, then quickly shoots and combines up to six shots to produce images with greater clarity, optimum dynamic range using backlight correction HDR technology and lower image noise using 6 shots layering technology. Superior Auto intelligently detects 33 scenes for still images and movies, making it easy to get the best shot. \n\nFACE DETECTION TECHNOLOGY \n\nFace Detection technology recognizes faces and optimizes camera settings for both video and still images, so faces are captured more clearly and skin tones look more natural.\n\n\nSMILE SHUTTER TECHNOLOGY \n\n\nSmile Shutter technology captures a smile the moment it happens. Simply press the Smile Shutter button and the camera does the rest. You can also select adult and child priority andindicate the degree of Smile Detection sensitivity. Intelligent Scene Recognition can now be used together with Smile Shutter mode when the Intelligent Auto mode is on. This means that beautiful smiles can be captured with settings optimized for the particular scene, even in difficult conditions such as twilight and backlighting. \n\n\nGPS AND COMPASS\n\nGPS and compass record location data and camera direction as you shoot movies and photos. GPS Log lets users track a photographic journey and later view the path and images on a map. Map View in \u201cPlayMemories Home\u201d software, allows users to view images on a map showing where they were taken. The logged path and images can also be displayed on Google Earth. \nANTI-BLINK FUNCTION \n\nIt\u2019s frustrating to capture the perfect shot, only to review it later and discover subjects blinked during the photo. The Anti-blink function works to help counter blinking and squinting. When the camera is set to Soft Snap, the Anti-blink function captures two images, recording only the photo with less squinting. If a blink is detected in other shooting modes, a warning will be displayed after you take the shot.\n\nSOFT SKIN MODE\n\nPortrait subjects will love the results. Soft Skin mode recognizes skin tones and reduces the appearance of blemishes and wrinkles without affecting the rest of the shot.\n\nINTELLIGENT SCENE RECOGNITION (ISCN) MODE\n\nIntelligent Scene Recognition (iSCN) Mode automatically detects 33 different types of scenes and, within just 1/30th of a second, selects the appropriate camera settings. iSCN has two modes: Auto and Advanced. In Auto Mode, the camera takes a single shot using the optimal settings. In Advanced Mode, the camera takes a photo with the optimal settings and, if in difficult lighting (low light or back light) immediately takes a second photo with another optimized setting so you can choose which to keep.\n\nNATURAL FLASH\n\nConventional point-and-shoot camera flash shots just don't capture colors the way the eye sees them. Natural Flash mode takes a reference shot without flash and then uses that reference to correct the color, for far more lifelike images.\n\nMOTION DETECTION\n\nMotion Detection, along with Face Motion Detection adjusts ISO sensitivity and increases the shutter speed when movement is detected, reducing blur in moving subjects and faces.\n\nSWEEP MULTI ANGLE MODE\n\nIn Sweep Multi Angle mode, the DSC-HX10V takes 15 images at different angles as it sweeps across the scene. By tilting the camera during playback, the camera\u2019s Gyro Sensor detects motion and displays the image in a 3D-like view on the camera\u2019s LCD.\n\n * \n * \n\n1. Records in 29 minute segments \n2. Requires HDTV and HDMI cable sold separately\n3. Requires 3D HDTV, HDMI cable (at least 10.2 Gbps) and active 3D glasses sold separately.\n4.
