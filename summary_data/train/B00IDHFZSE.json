I am constantly pulling them up. I will NOT be ordering again. You need to make a new product number when you change a product dramatically. Incredibly disappointed.",

I\u2019m mostly posting to show other customers what the \u201cAegean Sea\u201d color actually looks like, as it\u2019s nothing like the photo. Which is a disappointment, as I really fell in love with the color in the photo. The photo shows a deep blue-teal, a peacock sort of color. The actual product is more of a muted medium green-teal. Definitely green, not blue at all. I kept it anyway because they are comfortable, but the color was not what I was expecting.",

The material isn't the softest, but it's definitely comfortable enough to spend the day in, and also passes the squat test. Fits me quite well, only very slightly baggy around the ankles. Also love the pockets on either side. My phone fits in there perfectly! No more digging around in my purse when I go out :) happy with this product, may invest in other colors too.",
