I got the rose gold and the color coating is solid all around. I placed an ice water cup before going to bed and it was pretty much melted by morning but without any condensation on the outside. The water was still cold but not ice cold. I use it for wine picnics out with the hubby and this definitely feels fancier than those plastic disposable wine cups.",

Another person posted pic of rose gold without the trim. So I ordered and it came with the trim. I am returning and buying another color without trim. Just bummed because I really wanted this color with no silver trim. Other color is the dark red. Its very dark but nice color. It also has some sparkle in the sunlight. Nice cups though! Works great-everyone loved them!",

      "text": "I got the rose gold cup and it looks pretty in the light. It is well-made, smooth, stainless steel and painted on the outside. It is a vacuum insulated cup so it has been great keeping my coffee warm. The lid on top is a hard plastic and has a rubber ring so it fits securely in the cup and doesn\u2019t leak. There is a typical drinking \u2018hole\u2019 on the lid and my wish is that it had a shutter/cover on so the beverage doesn\u2019t spill when I am moving around with it.",

Sometimes it doesn\u2019t take me long tondrunk a glass of wine, other times it may take me a few hours because of distractions, chores, etc. The seal to the lid is very tight, which is nice. It\u2019s easy to use. Unfortunately, it did not keep my wine chilled at all. I\u2019d stick to using it for iced drinks.",

This looks the same, but using side by side, Corkcicle product kept drink with ice cold for 6 hours, i.e. still had ice pieces after 6 hours. This glass went for about 2. As well the mouthpiece on lid does not seal...but then Corkcicle's does but not tightly so pretty worthless.",
