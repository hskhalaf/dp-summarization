They \"swirl\" nicely too and aerate the wine as it should be done.n Stem is a little more robust than what the picture looks like. An elegant stemware! I'll be back for other sizes. I am very glad I purchased these glasses.",

The one thing is that even though the angle at the bottom of the bowl looks great, it does not allow swirling of the wine very well.",
