I was excited to try, unfortunately I was very disappointed the mess the sifter made all over the surface I was using. It can sift well, but the problem is when you are sifting and rotating/cranking the handle it gets stuck and once it turns pass where it is stuck, it pops and your flour or confectioners sugar pops out and sprays your surface causing a mess. I should have tested it out to make sure it worked, but now it is to late to return.",

At first I was wondering if the bail would not work its way through the very last bits of flour and would leave a bunch unsifted. Nope. It worked very effectively getting all but a very small number of grains through the screen. Then, a quick tap on the side cleaned it up. A nice, simple design. The one my mother had years ago was spring-powered where you squeezed the handle to move the bail. This is a much simpler, more effective design.",

Sifter has handle for turning and two round metal strips that go over the mesh bottom screen. One rubs too hard on bottom and actually throws flour and sugar out the top. Not smooth at all. Defective or very poor design. I shook and used a spoon to get sifting done. Cookies were great but i can not use this sifter. I have ordered from Amazon for years and been pleased.

This Bellemain Stainless Steel 3 Cup Sifter is a God-send!! It is much easier to turn the handle to sift my flour. I'm so pleased that I ordered it. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting a good sifter.",

The one I had bought recently like that broke the third time I used it. I was so pleased to get this model, complete with the easy-to-turn wooden knob-style handle. Just like my mother used to have! It's easy to use, doesn't hurt my hand, and makes me think of \"the old days\" when I helped Mom. Thanks for bringing a smile to my face!",

It was a fortuitous loss because now I have this one, and it is clearly superior.",

We didn't do anything unusual to it, simply rinsed it and left it to air dry, and now it's difficult to use and makes a huge mess. Please let me know if I can return it or get a refund.",
