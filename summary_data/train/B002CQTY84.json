      "text": "My daughters have been wearing this type of ballet shoe for years with no complaints. They're comfortable and reasonably good quality. I want to comment on the sizing issue, though. If you're buying for a child who wears a youth size 1 to 4.5 you must convert the size to an adult women's size by going up 2 sizes, otherwise it will be too small. So, for example, my older daughter wears a youth size 4 so she wears a size 6 in these shoes. My younger daughter wears a youth size 3 street shoe, so we order an adult women size 5 for her ballet shoes. Hope this helps someone :)",

There\u2019s a bit of room to grow. Just need to pull the laces tight to stay on the foot. Typically you know and cut the laces short. Since she will be growing in to these, Just going to knot them and trim them so they can be loosened as her feet grow.",

These shoes are close to my toes and not too tight. They really help me find my balance and turn out when I practice with them. The shipping was seedy and the inside lining is so adorable. :)",

    "description": "You'll love every minute of wearing Capezio's Daisy ballet shoe. The leather shoe features a lightly padded footbed, a split-suede sole for ultimate flexibility, and a pre-attached elastic strap keeps your foot snug and in place.\n\nSalvatore Capezio was born in 1871 in Muro Lucano, Italy. Uninterested in following in his father's footsteps as a construction engineer, he became an artist of his own right, a cobbler. In 1887, at the age of 17, he opened his shop on Broadway and 39th Street, diagonally across from the old Metropolitan Opera House in New York City. Soon, the shop became a meeting place for dancers who would stop by to discuss their needs and to get a pair of his shoes. As Capezio's popularity grew, dancers from around the world made it a point to visit him and purchase his shoes. The innovation of the products that Salvatore Capezio created and the camaraderie he shared with the dancers molded the direction that his company would follow. In this image, the Capezio brand was established to promote and recognize ongoing achievements and participation in dance. Capezio products remain in the forefront in quality and in technological advances with innovations like the split-sole, the stretch-insert, the Dansneaker and the Tapsneaker. Capezio believes that their success is dependent upon the individual commitment of each customer to continually set new standards of creativity and performance, while preserving a reputation for dependability and distinction. Capezio pledges their support and dedication to the advancement of dance, theater and recreation in communities worldwide. Begin 1 - 1 1/2 sizes up from street shoe size",
