Picked this one because Amazon's tech support told me in a recorded chat, that it would connect to a TV with a cord like the earlier versions - which is how he looks at the pictures we email and someone downloads for him at the library with their WiFi. Long story short - the tech service was wrong - \"casting\" Amazon devices have required in-house WiFi since the 2nd generation model. I was disappointed by both the incorrect information, and by Amazon's decision to eliminate the option of hard-wire connection to a television.",

There is no reason that this should be broke after only 2 years! This is not a quality product, that we all think it is. Be aware and don't over spend the money, like I did. Do your research first. There are many other products around, which are of much better quality. will never buy this brand ever again.",

I have purchased 3 kindles total and 2 have stopped working shortly after the warranty has expired (no longer will charge or turn on).

For those of you contemplating the purchase of a new Kindle, I'd think twice about doing so. There is little point in spending money on a device that Amazon won't even support for a full year.

I've had it only for a couple of weeks and it was disappointing at first; those \"free\" Wi-Fi hotspots --- at least in my area --- aren't so free, for one thing. For another the total lack of any kind of manual, even a downloadable one, made the Kindle a beautiful mystery. I've since acquired a \"Mi-Fi\" device and can now connect anywhere at 4G speeds. Good enough. I'm still a bit mystified but it's beginning to come together. This is a good buy, but access to a manual would make it much better.",

      "text": "The Kindle Fire HDX 7\" features great hardware (snappy CPU, lots of RAM), a gorgeous screen, and a price that undercuts competitors. At the right price, it's a downright steal. Everything integrates perfectly with Amazon's ecosystem (Prime, Instant Video, Kindle). Unfortunately, everything else about it is decidedly mediocre. The Fire OS is clunky and obtuse, and prone to random crashes fixed only by powering down. The app selection is pathetic compared to everything except maybe the Windows App Store, making its useful very limited beyond simple web surfing, email, and Amazon movies or books. It's not really an Android-based tablet, and Amazon can't compete on the software side with Apple, putting the great hardware in the Fire HDX to waste.",

Additionally, I tried using the Mayday feature of the device, which is neat in concept but in practice, terrible. The support agent was difficult to understand and seemed interested in going through her script as fast as possible. Maybe there are better reps, but I was certainly disappointed with the one assigned to me.",

Most MP3 players fixed this problem ten years ago. That means the Kindle Fire HDX is only caught up to pre-2003 iPods. That's disgraceful. 3. Ads, ads, and more ads. There's one thing this device EXCELS at, and that's throwing advertisements at you. I wish Amazon worked as hard at making a good device as they do advertising to you once you've bought the device",
