A bit disappointing on top of random issues with internet continuously cutting out for no obvious evident reason. Gave this up due to battery and choosing to update and get more RAM, or buy new laptop - I'm a college student (and I did the math), but I did not have the time to wait for a new updated and improved laptop on top of a new battery purchase.",

Only complaint is that it was advertised to have 4Gb RAM, but there was only 3Gb. I bought 8Gb of RAM online for $55 to replace the 3Gb. Graphics are somewhat slow, but all components are working flawlessly. I partitioned this computer to dual boot Windows 7 and Ubuntu Mate Linux. This was a good purchase for the money paid (~$150) to get a used computer that was in good condition.",
