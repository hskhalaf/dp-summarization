On the plus side, it was easy to install out of the box, and I was very pleased with its performance. The picture was sharp, the color vibrant and correct, and the sound excellent. I didn't buy it for other features and don't know if it does anything else, but it's an excellent TV for watching movies, news and TV shows; provided you\u2019re not looking for durability.",

I am totally happy with this purchase and would buy again.",

The only complaint I have is that the built-in speaker sounds a little cheesy and I'm not crazy about legs that come with it but, other than that, it's not a bad tv at a bargain price.",
