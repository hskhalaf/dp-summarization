      "text": "I got it yesterday, but I already love it! It came exactly like the specs I chose, and honestly, it's a lot lighter than I expected, I feel like it's less than 12 pounds. The computer itself is big though. The foot of the computer is great and has rubber feet which really help prevent it from moving around the table. It also has really decent sound, I was shocked because it was only at 50% and it was loud. It's a great computer to watch movies on. My only problem is all the preloaded Lenovo apps which haven't been a problem, but I just don't like how it's installed already.",

Lenovo techs are too busy trying to read a script and pass the problem to another department. I'm fairly certain Lenovo farms their tech service off overseas, so good luck!!",

With the AMD processor it at best crawls, it has poor video switching, the HD access is slow (probably why they hide the HD activity light where you can not see it. It is no stable and prone to tipping over, which can end up with a cracked screen and since LeNOvo refuses to offer their Accidental Damage Warranty on it, they no it is unstable too. Say NO to this system and find something better.",
