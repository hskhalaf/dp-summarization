This was my first WOD with this rope and members were impressed with my Double Unders saying I was really whipping the rope like it was nothing. I didn\u2019t get the typical arm/shoulder fatigue like I usually do. For the price you can\u2019t beat this. I can\u2019t speak to its durability yet, but I hope it lasts forever. I do already have some paint chipping off the handle after my first workout. That\u2019s not a concern for me, though. Very happy customer.",

The cable is easily adjustable, but you'll need wire cutters to snip off the excess. Its very nice to move up from box store jump ropes, but this kind of rope can take some getting used to if you tend to rotate or spin the handles when you jump.",

I must say that I was surprised how quickly jumping rope elevates your heart rate and although I as fit from running and other workouts, I had to adjust to the intensity of jumping a rope. I love how a 5 - 10 min routine is challenging and yields the same results as a much longer run or cardio machine workout. I have also noticed a difference in my energy levels and physique after only a few weeks of jumping 3-4 days a week. I highly recommend to those looking to complement or change up a stale workout routine.",

I really would give this rope rave reviews, but it was worthless after a month since I couldn't find the missing parts that snapped off :(",

Slightly dangerous, slightly inconvenient, not what I was expecting after having paid a little more for a better built jump rope. The three stars is because this happened within a year of use. That being said, I fixed this with a pair of pliers and duct tape, we\u2019ll see how long that lasts. Still usable, just don\u2019t want to risk poking myself.",

Rope is metal core, won't tangle up, and has no memory. Makes double unders easy and even have done a couple of triple unders. Highly recommend this product.",

Going back to Rogue long handle. I will say they do have great customer service.",
