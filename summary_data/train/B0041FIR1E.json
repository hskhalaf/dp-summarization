Sometimes you can't tell when a screw has dirt, rust, and something else in the hole where you're tighting it in. Well....these handly little tools erases your mistake! This cute little box is an excellent addition to go in your tool box and well worth the money for the hassles in finding the right size drill bit and tap bit. You have both in one! I strongly recommend it to anyone who constantly deals with screws in the construction trade. Excellent quality.",
