The pair has the best of bluetooth and wired technology with long lasting battery life. I own many pairs of headphones for various use cases, ranging from monitoring music production in the studio to noise cancellation for travel, so having these MW60 complete my collection of the best headphones out there. And they are better than Beats!!!! I wish they had noise cancellation for the. Nonetheless, the isolation works well. This purchase was definitely a splurge as the price is too steep in my opinion.",

Yes, they don\u2019t sound as good as the MH40, but the difference is extremely small. People need to also remember these are wireless; you won\u2019t get the same quality when wired up. Worth the price for the look alone, the sound is just a plus.",

Sound quality is good, other than the issue described above - these reproduce bass frequencies fairly well, but they'll never be thumpers.

But I can wear the P5s for hours without discomfort. The fit of the HW60s seems unnatural from the moment they are put on and after a couple of hours relief is needed. A couple of hours is usually long enough for me when listening to music. When listening to recorded books however, it is a regrettably short time.",
