They don't have the reel slot like most other rod tubes do so your long rod handles don't go all the way to the deck. 2. They are the same width as a milk crate, so they are the perfect size. So, yak fishermen these will work well on your fishing rig.",

      "text": "These are very affordable, which is nice - their construction seems decent enough, however as other reviews have mentioned, the foam is too firm, and rods have to be SHOVED in. They are also pretty tightly packed, so if you have reels on while storing, you're unlikely to get 5, let alone 6 full rods into the shelving. I'm able to get 4 rods with reels in, plus one rod without. Due to the extra-stiff foam, there's some additional tension on the unit if you're pulling rods off, and I've had issues with them coming out of the wall and ripping the drywall (screws included are too short to reach the studs).",

Any rod thicker than an average light-weight or mid-weight fresh water rod will be a very tight fit, and might not fit at all. For example, my surf fishing rod won't fit. The included screws are troublesome for two reasons. First, they are flatheads instead of philips heads. Flathead screws are just harder to install. Second, even though I screwed directly into wall studs, they didn't grip very well because they are too short. They barely grabbed solid wood after accounting for the drywall thickness. Use longer wood screws.",

Reason 2: the second reason has to do with the spaces. It doesn\u2019t seem like you can fit all of your fishing rods with the reel comfortably without them getting tangled together.

The setup is a bit \"tight\" (all 5 spaces will be accessible if reels/handles line up correctly) but it's not designed to be anything else. I believe the screws that are supplied could be a bit longer as users should show some care when removing rods so as not to pull screws from drywall, etc. I'd recommend using anchors if you anticipate significant use or hard pulling will take place. For the price, the rack system is fine.",

The best use for this is if you don\u2019t take your poles out that often. We live on a lake and I\u2019m finding that the foam inserts which hold the poles are starting to wear and tear in some places due to regular loading and unloading of fishing poles. For my situation, a floor rack would have suited us better. I can\u2019t see this lasting much past a year before all the foam starts to break apart.",

I had to use my own anchors and screws to make it hold and not rip out the drywall. Makes no sense to exclude anchors.",
