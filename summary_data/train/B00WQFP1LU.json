My main complaint is that the color is not consistent across reels. I've purchased 3 reels (1 as a tester, and then 2 more). Of the second two one matches the first reel, and the other is way more yellow (the packaging was all marked as warm white, none were marked as yellow). See the attached picture of our pantry, the 3rd shelf down is definitely a different color. I'm ordering a 4th reel and hoping it is closer to the original two.",

I ended up cutting that back to about 1/3 the amount I used initially as it was too bright for sleeping. Cutting them is very easy as well. I put the rest of them in the kitchen under the cabinets for an inexpensive solution to under-cabinet lighting. Make sure you order a power supply to go with them. I am ordering another set to backlight one of my televisions. For the price, I don't think you can beat these.",

Advice: clean the surface with alcohol. The attached picture shows a single strip under each cabinet. And an extra 2 strips over the stove and sink. Plenty of light. I used a total of 24 feet. (The old light above the stove is there, but turned off. The new tile was not installed yet.)",

Second issue: I thought one of the LEDs was bad. It wasn't. It was backwards. Reverse the polarity on the strip and that LED came on. For 1 in 5 meters of strip, I guess that's not bad, but I can't give 5 stars after seeing that.",

      "text": "I bought this string of warm white led lights for under-cabinet illumination. I used spots of hot melt glue to help hold it as the cabinets are 65+ years old so the adhesive might need a bit of help. I am VERY PLEASED with the illumination and quality of the light these give. I don't care much for the harshness of the blue-white LEDs and was concerned that these would be too similar, but they are much better than hoped. So much so I've purchased another couple strings for in-closet lighting.",

I would order these again.",

      "text": "Four stars only because the tape doesn't stick well when hanging under cabinet for lighting up counters. Had to add super glue and plastic staples so often. I've purchased pricier brands from the orange big box store and those also say 3M. Those stayed down perfectly. These must come from China and probably aren't really 3M tape. Cheap though! Right price. The above mention is fine for price. Just wish I didn't have to tinker to figure it out.",

      "text": "I used these for under cabinet lighting in the kitchen. I love LED strips and these are as good as any I have used. I did find it hard to get solder to stick to the contacts on the strip. I would suggest using the connectors as solder joints did break on me and it is a pain to solder upside down. Solder doesn't like to flow up. I would suggest something with a higher density of LEDs for anything where you are lighting a larger area, but these are the perfect brightness for under cabinet or under shelf lighting.",

When connecting two strands together where you have cut one to fit a given location it is a real pain in the neck to get the entire strand to work. Ended up using soldering iron to resolve. When connecting two full strands end to end they work fine. I think the real issue are the connectors not the light strips.",

      "text": "The lights work wonderfully. Good color and consistency throughout the strip, though color between two strips was noticeably different. Two stars knocked off because of the poor plastic connectors. If you cut the strip you need to use the included connectors to add a power connector or splice on another strip. For the two rolls I purchased, both power connectors were wired incorrectly. They also would not securely clip onto the strip, causing the lights to flicker. Splicing the two strips together also resulted in flickering. An hour with a pair of pliers and some plastic shims fixed the issue, but if you need to connect these strips I would recommend soldering instead.",
