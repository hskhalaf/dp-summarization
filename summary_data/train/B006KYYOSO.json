Granted a lot of characters are the \"twin\" versions of core characters (like Baek and Hwoarang), but they are different enough that it pisses me off that they aren't included in Tekken 7. In my opinion, put Tekken 7's rage meter near death thing into TTT2 and re-release it for PS4 and I will buy that s***. I wish I had more friends that loved Tekken to play this game with me. I played TTT1 back in the day like a fiend. This did not disappoint; only my friends' skill level and dedication did.",

      "text": "Game plays perfectly, and is a strong addition to the Tekken franchise. But even with that in its favor, the game itself is overrated. It discourages true co-op play, as only one or two modes feature the option to play with a partner. Tag team \"dream match\" games are meant to be fun, not frustrating. As a casual gamer, this game is something I'd only pick up if (A) I was really bored and felt like playing to get all 60+ characters' endings, and (B) I didn't have to work all week, every day.",

I prefer playing with friends over at the house or just playing offline. Super fun game indeed I greatly enjoy it.",

And it is not uncommon for fighters to have more than 100 moves at their disposal!! Tekken may host the King of Iron Fist Tournament, but finding victory requires more than a heavy hand. Knowledge of your opponent's arsenal, precise execution, and quick reflexes get you further than simply knowing the strongest attacks. Like its predecessor, Tekken Tag Tournament 2 takes the 3D combat mechanics of the Tekken series and doubles the number of combatants, allowing for more complex and dynamic matches.",

I must say although Tekken 6 was pretty fun, TTT2 is a big step up! The new tag combos are Siiiiick!!! They take alot of thinking & some time to get used to, but it gets easier once you figure out how to master them! Overall great fun, awesome graphics & gameplay! If your a Tekken fan, this game is a definite buy!",
