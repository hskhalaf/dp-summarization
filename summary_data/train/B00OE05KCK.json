      "text": "I was excited about this projector. When I received it, I loved the 90 minute battery and bright image. HOWEVER, the power switch (on/off rocker) seems to be faulty by design. The first time I turned it on, it didn't turn on. I had to wiggle the switch. Then, it turned off by itself. I had to wiggle the switch to get it back on. I can imagine that it could easily turn itself on in a carrying bag as well. BE WARNED: this doesn't seem like an issue with just my unit but an inherent design problem.",

    "description": "Style:With BatteryThe AAXA M4 is the World's Brightest Battery Powered Projector. It revolutionizes mobile projection by mating a lithium ion battery with LED Projection technology.

This optical power house enables the M4 to deliver vivid 150\" displays in dark areas and usable displays in brightly lit areas - a first for mobile projection. The AAXA M4 revolutionizes mobile projection with it's 28-watt lithium ion battery onboard that supports a 90 minute operating time (in eco brightness mode) and produces over 3 times the brightness of other battery powered projectors for anywhere-anytime projection. This onboard battery is known as a \"premium grade\" battery that is designed to retain 85% of it's charge over 1000 charge cycles. The AAXA M4 is the ultimate portable projector for business and professional users.

This feature allows users to leave the laptop and power cords at home by delivering presentations and videos directly from the projector while fully cordless. Finally, the array of inputs includes HDMI, VGA, and Composite video and enables users to connect an array of data sources including smart-phones directly to the projector. With the AAXA M4 professional users can deliver presentations, play videos, and watch digital TV all from a single self-powered device.",
