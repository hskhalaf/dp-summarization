But with few apps--thus far--that take advantage of the screen in a meaningful way, the G19's potential remains largely untapped. Until the community software effort gets rolling, we can't recommend spending this much on a keyboard that, while flashy, has yet to realize its full potential.",

For the price of this keyboard do you really need a LCD screen? Not really, I would suggest putting your hard earned money towards a simpler designed keyboard made with more durable parts. There are some DIY logs of opening up the keyboard and re-soldering the connections....why does that have to fall on the customer and not the producer?",

The LCD display is functional and adequate, but mostly is a distraction when gaming, with the exception of monitoring the CPU and RAM usage. The 2 powered usb ports are amazing and convenient, especially to plug in a high res gaming mouse near the keyboard. The functionality of the light up keys is a nice touch, as well as the macro keys and the media keys. Overall, I have had minimal problems with the keyboard, and would highly recommend it for people interested in a high quality interactive gaming keyboard.",

There was one nuisance out of box with the menu button by the LCD registering multiple presses after only one, which just requires a heavy push when navigating the menus. The only real downside is that the LCD screen has lost the ability to show solid black. The whole screen has a faded blue tone where there was black originally. I noticed it about a month after installing. Everything is still legible on the screen though, so it really isn't interfering with gameplay info. I'm debating whether it's worth the effort to return/replace.",

Control everything from your fingertips, with a endless supply of customizable keys for shortcuts/macros etc. Yes, it is on the pricy side but this is not a keyboard you should be looking to buy unless you're sure you can make full use of its features either. Overall, its the best gaming keyboard to date on the market, and with good reason.",

      "text": "Great keybord except for the fact is has rubber dome keys instead of mechanical ones. Some reviews on the web talk about poor key response or tactile feel. I had one key on my G19 that had almost no tactile feedback. I found the problem to be a mis-alignment of the rubber dome membrane when the keyboard was assembled. A portion of the rubber dome for the key in question was slightly pinched under the plastic webbing of the keyboard top (revealed by popping off the key cap). Used a small screw driver to carefully free the ruber material from under the plastic webbing and the key was fine.",
