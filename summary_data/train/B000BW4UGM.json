The stitching doesn't hold, and eventually, the two separate entirely. This is distinctly inferior workmanship on an otherwise fine product, but until/unless Propet acknowledges and addresses this problem, I cannot recommend these to anyone. Too bad, too.

This shoe is TIGHT in the toe box even in my bare feet; with socks it just would NEVER be comfortable. Added to that, the very front of the shoe looks to be of minimal construction, not at all as robust as my last pair of New Balance, which I was looking to replace with this, supposedly BETTER, shoe.

It takes a bit to get them broken in, this is still happening. Easy to put on, and the straps make the shoe vary as needed in width and tightness around the ankles. Soles are quite thick and seems like would last a good long time and protects the sensitive bottoms of the feet from stepping on something that your feet would not like.",

The heels and soles are fairly soft and the wear is primarily on the heels and the toe area. I would definitely recommend them for casual use.",

So, I decided to keep the original pair with the expectation that adjusting the closure will help to compensate for the lack of extra width.
