I've played one full season, did all the crap to get extra XP points. I didn't like it. It took 3 times longer to go through a season. The draft process definately took a step backwards. The whole progressing the players has some potential, but I don't understand how it seems like each player has two different ratings. One for the depth chart, and the other for connected careers. Confusing and just plain terrible to someone who has been paying EA's light bill for years. Trading this garbage in today.",

In other words, it is virtually impossible to customize your own team - you must play with official EA rosters. If you are an online player, enjoy the slight upgrade to the gameplay. If you are a franchise mode player, don't buy, as it is gone and there is no playable substitute.",

Madden 12 did it. Madden 13 did not. It seemed as if the 2013 design made the game a little sloppier, and a little bit more convoluted. The worst is the redesigned kick options (like punts or field goals) where on the XBOX, you need to use the right-stick. What happened to just the simple A button huh? All in all, I traded the sucker in, and feel bad for even pre-ordering this game in the first place. I won't make the same mistake next year.",

Also, no more Madden Moments, which was a Game Mode I always really enjoyed. Yes, the graphics, and overall game play is pretty decent, but if this is the direction that EA/Microsoft is going to take this game, I'll never buy another year of Madden again.",

Learning how to manage a team is cool. When play calling just being able to know the right play to call is fun sometimes you win and sometimes you lose, but that's how the game goes and good luck!",

It seems like the Madden series is regressing instead of progressing. The graphics look worse, and the game play doesn't seem as real (just watch the extremely fake-looking player interactions and tackles.) The game isn't as user friendly or \"organic\" as past games. More technical and difficult to operate than it should be. Overall, it just seems like this one was given a much smaller budget or wasn't put as much effort in. A decent game, but definitely not worth $60 and arguably not worth the Madden title.",

I was stunned and shocked to see that the feature was simply, and without warning, removed! They may have finally caught up to NFL 2k5 with tackling physics, but I'm now looking to return this game as quickly as possible. I feel better off with 12, and it's outdated rosters.",

I don't know anything about the game since I'm the grandma but this time the service was not good at all.",
