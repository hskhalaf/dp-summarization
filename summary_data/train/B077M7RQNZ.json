He loves them, saying they have a nice but comfortable snug fit initially that \u201cwears\u201d into the size of his wider feet. UGG is known for it\u2019s reliability and comfort. The black suede exterior is handsome and he wears them constantly around the house winter through fall, and for the brief moments stepping outside on the stone patio walkway.",

If it were a little thicker on the sole, I'd a given it 5 stars but it's a generous 4 stars considering it's still a little overpriced. Should be not a penny more than $50 imo.
