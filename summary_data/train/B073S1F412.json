This system fixes all of that nonsense. I have a lot of ties and want to be able to see all of them, so I can make the appropriate selection for my suit and shirt combination. I don\u2019t have to fumble with replacing the tie in the rack at the end of the day. This tie rack is simple and looks good! Must buy for anyone with a large tie collection!",

It appears someone saved a few cents by buying cheap parts. I followed written instructions exactly. The mounting holes are 20 inches apart. Given wall studs in the USA are normally on 16 inch centers, you are virtually guaranteed to need to use at least one drywall anchor, and many folks will need two. Don't bother with the ones provided by the manufacturer. Run to your local home center and buy some that actually work.",
