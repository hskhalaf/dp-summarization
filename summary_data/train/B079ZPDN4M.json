If you have easy access to plugs (like a vacuum) get the regular one with 22ft cable.

It does leave my floors a lot cleaner and with less effort than regular spray mop. GET ONE BUT SAVE THE $50 AND GET THE REGULAR VERSION. Also, use hot tap water and I'll try cleaning vinegar instead of solution next time. I'd also get an extra set of scrubbers with rough scrubbers for bathroom tile.",

Was thrilled how quiet the mopping is yet a beep everytime you use the spray??? So annoying and not needed. Was only able to clean 4 1/4 rooms before battery ran out. Overall happy.",

Which brings me to my second point, excellent customer service! I contacted them and they were able to solve my issue immediately.",

The floors dry quickly and look fantastic. It is heavier than I thought and does require two hands to steer, but it\u2019s the only way I\u2019ll ever mop again.",
