We anchored it to the deck as we have pretty high winds. It really makes a difference as far as getting out of the sun and having some shade. I purchased the curtains separately to help when the sun is setting and to provide privacy.",

A week later no response. I have sent emails to company with no response. Very unhappy with Sunjoy not the seller we bought from.
