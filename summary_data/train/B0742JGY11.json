After doing a great deal of research and wading through hundreds of reviews, I decide to gamble $49 on this Pyle Pro Pinpointer. I could not be happier! It works beautifully and saves tons of time. The only thing I wish it had is an audible tone but for the price I'm not complaining. Great item at a reasonable price!",
