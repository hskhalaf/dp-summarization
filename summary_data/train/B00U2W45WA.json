We have both been using the Nikon D7000 but didn't upgrade when the D7100 came out because it seemed to be an incremental upgrade and not worth the cost, at least at that time. The D7200 on the other hand was quite a jump from our D7000 and we decided to pull the trigger and get one after hearing of the product release. The D7200 has performed perfectly and the jump in low light capabilities helps tremendously. We may not upgrade our second D7000 this year but will definitely be getting another D7200 when we do.",

      "text": "Product really suffers from terrible kit lenses. Low light performance is very poor, worse than my Moto 6. It is medium heavy, so inappropriate for carrying around for long periods of time. The manuals are thick, the controls are complicated, and the learning curve is huge. Nikon simply does not know how to design cameras anymore. They are building severely overcomplicated operating systems comparable to Linux. The entry level models like the D5600 and D3500 are just as bad. This camera is inly appropriate for people who want to dedicate lots of time to education and lots of money to decent lenses.",

I used the D7200 matched with a Nikkor 85mm f:/1.8 lens on a First Friday Art Walk in low, less than optimal light without flash, taking over 300 shots. Quite an impressive camera, especially considering the affordable price point. As the body includes the focus drive motor, I can still use older Nikkor auto focus lenses or modern AF-S lenses.",

I only wish that it had the tilt screen like the D7500. This purchase through Amazon resulted in a clean model with 15k actuations.

It has the cropped frame size, for lower cost and a more-telephoto vision rather than wide-angle, which suits my style. The lens is wide enough and more than long enough for general-purpose use. It would be nice if it focused to a little higher magnification.",

What a fantastic rig, and most definitely a step up from the D5300. I love the size, the battery life, the solid feel of the metal body, and of course, the quality of the images.",

If you are in the price range and want a really good camera, than this is for you.",

Double memory card, battery grip, etc. I purchased for video and it will record for about 30 mins before needing to pause. This is due to a sensor overheat protection. Cons: You can't charge the camera from USB/AC power. Only will operate off a battery. Also of note: I got a used, open box that I purchased as new. It was missing the charger for the battery. Amazon offered a discount and gc towards a charger. It was pretty clear the box was opened and used for a wedding/event and returned.",

    "description": "Style:Body Only| Configuration:Base24.2MP DX-Format CMOS Sensor EXPEED 4 Image Processor No Optical Low-Pass Filter 3.2\" 1,229k-Dot LCD Monitor Full HD 1080p Video Recording at 60 fps Multi-CAM 3500 II DX 51-Point AF Sensor Native ISO 25600, B&W to ISO 102400\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n\nShare your creative vision in stunning definition with Nikon's first DSLR to feature built-in Wi-Fi and Near Field Communication (NFC; NFC feature for Android v 4.0 or later smart devices only). A 24.2 megapixel DX-format CMOS image sensor with no optical low-pass filter captures remarkably pure, sharp photos and videos all the way up to ISO 25,600, while EXPEED 4 image processing and Nikon's 51-point autofocus system helps deliver the speed to capture up to 6 fps. Add versatile video features, in-camera time-lapse and creative effects plus outstanding compatibility with the Nikon imaging system, and it's easy to see why the D7200 is the new star of Nikon's DX-format line-up.\n\n\nFor the first time, the exhilarating image quality, low-light capabilities and speed of a Nikon DSLR are available with the convenience of built-in Wi-Fi and Near Field Communication (NFC). Introducing the D7200, the new star of Nikon's DX-format line-up. Bring your creative vision to life with photos and videos that shine with sharpness and clarity. Shoot in nearly any light, from dawn until after dusk, and capture everything from sports and action to wildlife and everyday moments. Then share your beautiful images easier than ever with a compatible smart device. Whether you're a passionate photographer or videographer looking for a tool to ignite your creativity, a pro in need of a nimble second camera or someone looking for an ideal blend of versatility and convenience, the D7200 is ready for your challenge.\n\nTRANSFORM THE ORDINARY\nYOUR VISION IN STUNNING DEFINITION\nFree of an optical low-pass filter, the D7200 produces remarkably pure, sharp photos and videos. Its 24.2 MP DX-format CMOS image sensor works together with EXPEED 4 image processing and NIKKOR lenses to enhance detail and tonality. This outstanding image quality is maintained all the way up to ISO 25,600 (two full stops higher than the D7200's predecessor) for amazing low-light images. You can also now expand the ISO range up to BW1 (51,200) and BW2 (102,400) to shoot monochromatic photos in even more challenging lighting situations. Whether shooting stills or video, selecting the 1.3x crop mode extends the reach of NIKKOR DX and FX-format lenses, getting you closer to sports, action, wildlife and more.\n\nSHARE EVERY THRILLING CREATION\nNIKON'S FIRST DSLR WITH BUILT-IN WI-FI & NFC\nShare your outstanding D7200 photos with no hassle, even when on the go. Just touch your compatible* smartphone or tablet with NFC to the D7200 to establish a Wi-Fi connection. Once connected, you can use your smart device to browse photos on the D7200 and then share your favorites by text message, email or posting online. You can also use your smart device as a remote for the D7200; see what the camera sees and take pictures!\n\nCATCH SHOTS OTHERS MIGHT MISS\nHIGH-SPEED FRAME RATE AND INCREASED BUFFER\nWith its 6 fps* shooting capacity, the D7200 is an outstanding choice for sports, wildlife and other fast action. It has a large buffer capacity that can handle up to approx. 100 shots of continuous shooting when in JPEG/fine/large; up to approx. 27 shots in 12-bit lossless compressed RAW or up to approx. 18 shots when using 14-bit lossless compressed RAW and DX-format image size. Switch to 1.3x image size and capture approx. 7 fps* in continuous high-speed mode.\n*When using live view, the maximum frame rate will be approx. 3.7 fps.\n\nBEAUTIFULLY RENDERED TIME-LAPSE MOVIES\nRecord daily life in stunning quality or experiment with new forms of creative expression. Create beautifully rendered time-lapse movies with smooth exposure variations entirely in-camera - a first for Nikon DX-format cameras. Make smooth exposure transitions with Auto ISO while monitoring with Highlight Display (Zebra Stripes). Apply Flat Picture Control for easier color grading in post. Transfer uncompressed footage onto an external recorder with the optional HC-E1 HDMI Cable while recording simultaneously to the internal SD memory card. Use the optional ME-W1 Wireless Microphone and record clear monaural audio from subjects as far as 164ft/50m away, or attach the optional ME-1 Stereo Microphone to the ME-W1 Wireless Microphone's remote unit for stereo recording.\n\nFOCUS ON CHALLENGING SITUATIONS\nWhether you're capturing images in daylight or after dusk, the D7200's superb AF system will keep up. Its Advanced Multi-CAM 3500 II autofocus sensor module achieves outstanding focus detection, even at a very dim -3 EV (ISO 100, 20C/68F). Its high-density 51 focus points cover a wide area of the frame in DX format and most of the frame in 1.3x Crop Mode, while 15 cross-type sensors in the center provide higher detection strength. One center AF point even works all the way to f/8, for greater focusing performance when using teleconverters.\n\n\n\nSUPPLIED ACCESSORIES\n *  D7200 Body Only \n *  EN-EL15 Rechargeable Li-ion Battery \n *  MH-25A Battery Charger \n *  UC-E17 USB Cable \n *  AN-DC1 Neck Strap \n *  DK-5 Eyepiece Cap \n *  DK-23 Rubber Eyecup \n *  BF-1B Body Cap",
