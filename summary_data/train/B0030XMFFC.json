All boards required cutting and this one blade cut them all with ease. Even after all that cutting it cut just as smooth and clean as the first cut. See picture...lots of cuts needed.

Using the circular saw, and cutting from the back, and cleaning any metal shavings right away seems to have worked. It has been months with no rust pitting nor observable finish damage.

I have this old Delta compound miter that holds more sentimental attachment that woodworking functionality. I have no experience with Irwin Industrial Tool products and purchased this one based on specs and price. Installation was easy enough. The blade appears finely milled and crafted. I guess proof is in the cutting. It cuts well and makes the 25 year old Delta saw operate like new again. Nice blade. Nice price.",

Then went on to cut various +- 20 single sheets throughout the day. Only on my last 3 rake cuts did I have to switch to my abrasive blade. It was well worth the cost in the time and effort it saved. Not sure what it would cost to resharpen. Will definitely use this type of blade when or if I need to do another large metal project.",
