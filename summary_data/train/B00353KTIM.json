No issues with the dogs skin, smell is very gentle and easy on the nose (after diluted), dogs fur is soft and shiney. If any adverse effects happen I will update this review.",

I'd like to have at least a little scent. And no, diluting it as directed did not work for me. I made it significantly stronger and have been spraying it, but am thinking about reducing the dilution even more and pouring it on. I get tired of breathing it in when spraying as it's a bit irritating. Recommended dilution is about like water with a little soap. Will not be ordering again.",

The only difference is, if you don\u2019t dilute it, it\u2019s pretty thick so it sticks to the fur better when you need to eat it soak.",
