Very little or no bass but you can't expect much from a small unit like this. Good battery life and can get wet so that's a plus. Probably best option for price. Not sure if it's worth $65 when the previous model is $35 and doesn't sound or function any better",

I can barely hear the music even when riding my bike at a medium pace. It looks good and has a more convenient shape than the Mifa, but what does it matter if it's basically dead weight?
