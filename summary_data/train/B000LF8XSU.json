This sled doesn't have a flat base bottom, instead it has a cut out space and snow stuck underneath and you can't pull with baby on top and so much snow stuck on the bottom. Eventually baby falls to the side. It can be god only on icy flat snow",

It's thin and cuts your hands. Which isn't too much of a problem when you're wearing gloves but barehanded is not advised.

Keeping it clean and dry for next year, and future toddlers after that.",

The pull string was too short (probably done for liability purposes). It worked just fine though and our 2 yr old enjoyed pulling it around as well.",

I was disappointed. :(",
