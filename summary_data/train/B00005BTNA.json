They answered the phone & my question immediately. Call to confirm - 1-888-310-4290. Also, both of my children have love these bottles!",

I've only been using these about 3 weeks and I've already had to throw away nipples because they collapse under the suction pressure.

I like that shorter, fatter bottle shape, because they are easier to clean than the taller, thinner bottles. However, the nipple issue is a really big deal and watching my daughter struggle to feed is frustrating. I am very disappointed.",

I don't find there is consistency in the other nipples you can purchase.

You won't have an issue with leaks if you take the bottle apart to wash it every single time (Which you should be doing anyways). There is a small rubber seal when you unscrew the bottom piece, make sure that is put back in and you're good to go!",

Imagine drinking a drink out of a plastic bottle and not letting air in, this is what other bottles we had did. This allow the milk/formula to keep flowing. We actually bought 20 of them with different flow tops so we have enough. I also really like that they come apart, I feel like it gets cleaned better that way.",

These are also beneficial when you go from nursing to bottles because you hold the bottle in front of the baby instead of tilting their head back and giving it to them from above, its a little more work for them so they don't get too lazy about feeding. Breastfeeding is harder work for them than a bottle, so this helps. Make sure to thoroughly clean, can be a little tricky by the bend",
