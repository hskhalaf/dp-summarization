However, it takes the edge off the black coffee taste and gives you a smooth luscious texture and taste. I have been on a quest for a healthy dairy and soy free creamer and I finally found it. Give it a chance! Yes it clumps at first but all you have to do is mix it up with your spoon. It blends beautifully without the blender or mixer. This product is delicious and anti inflammatory! It doesn't get better than that.",

I didn\u2019t think it was good at all and kind of a waste of money for me. Was hoping it would be good. Also, it stains if spilled, the oil leaves a mark.

I had to throw out the remaining liquid. I tried to add rice milk to the next cup and spooned in less powder, but it still tasted like coconut. Unlike other reviewers, I had no problem dissolving the fine powder in hot coffee. Maybe it is just an issue at lower temperatures.",

I don't mind the coconut flavor. The coarseness of the grind reminds me very much of little more than ground coconut \"flour\" -- which is far less expensive.

Maybe a tiny bit in 12 ounces of the cheapest drip coffee grind you can buy to give a hint of flavor because after adding this the choice of coffee beans is irrelevant.

Anyways, Laird is obviously the man so I found this product. Taste great and blends very well. I just put creamer in first, then coffee then a spoon. No clumps at all. Lastly, I think this creamer is to be credited for better BM. Sorry, but I think it\u2019s true. Anyways, I\u2019ll remain a customer. Hope to try the other flavors some day.",

I have tried the other \"natural\" creamers from the grocery store that are almond milk, soy milk, coconut milk based but they seem to give my coffee a watered down taste or the consistency isn't great. I like this one because it has a good flavor and does give a creaminess to my coffee that the others didn't. This also only has 1gram of sugar per serving! I found if you add it in hot coffee and immediately stir it generally does not get clumpy.",

The only issue is they really need a better sealing option. For the price, a thicker strip seal should be used or a slider, because the powder keeps tge thin strip from closing. I put it inside a larger plastic baggie with a slider.",

I have it coming on autoship with 5+ other items, so I save 15% on the price, which is great!",

Not really a big deal in the grand scheme of things. I'll still buy it again.",

I looked for organic creamer and came across this brands. The girls love it. They finally are experiencing the coffee with cream instead of cream in coffee. We paired it up with raw sugar. We don't use as much. Now we feel we are drinking coffee more healthy. Thanks for this creamer. Will signing for subscription.",
