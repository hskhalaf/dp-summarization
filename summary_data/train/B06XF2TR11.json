The pictures are with two coats. I have worn it all day on multiple occasions with no flaking. I have purposely left it on overnight and there was the smallest amount of flaking but still looked amazing even after a full 24 hours of wear.",

I have to curl them then I have to use a waterproof mascara so that it doesn\u2019t uncurl my lashes. Found out about this accidentally. One day I bought a waterproof masacra not knowing. Then went back to regular. Noticed that the waterproof formule didn't uncurl my lashes. Amazing hack I discovered. I was pretty lucky that I found it when I still was very young. I\u2019m always asked what mascara do you use. Your lashes look amazing.",

The mascara went on great and was still on after my 12 hour shift at work which is a must for me. It stayed so good in place, that i had to remove it with makeup remover x2. It seems like a pretty good product, however there is one thing that bothered me with this mascara. It looked more like a lengthening mascara when applied rather theN the volumizing mascara it is advertised as. For that, I\u2019m giving it 4 stars but it seems like a good product when compared to other mascaras that I have used.",
