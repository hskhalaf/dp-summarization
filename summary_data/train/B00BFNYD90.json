They're noise-canceling, so when I go somewhere and I just want to listen to my music or audiobook, I don't have to worry about outside noise mixing. also they get tangled really easily and they're hard to un-tangle because of the plastic coating on the cords, but really, all headphones get tangled, so I can't really complain about that. That being said: don't use these while driving. The last thing you want is to not hear a horn or a siren. Other than that, I love them.",

Another downside is that the remote doesn't work with my Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge which is a bummer since I use these for work. It can at least pause/play/ skip songs and the mic does work fine I've talked on the phone and there have been no problems. The earpiece is not made to fit everyone so buy at your own discrestion.",

Well that keeps the earbud from going into the ear enough for them to ACTUALLY WORK. The result is they are hideously uncomfortable AND they sound bad! If the earbud was extended another few milometers, it might be fine, but they totally screwed the design, so they're pretty much useless. I don't really understand what could possibly be in that huge zeppelin on the end anyway!",

On the other hand, neither multi-function button nor volume button would work with most phones I had - couple of Androids, Windows Phones and an iPhone 6s. Unfortunately, they aren't as resistant as I expected as the cord cover began to dry-out peel off and eventually broke down about two weeks ago. Having had several Jabra/GN Netcon devices over the years many of them still fully functional I'm overall disappointed",
