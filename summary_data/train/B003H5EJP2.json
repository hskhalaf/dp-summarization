      "text": "Great product so far! I looked around trying to justify some of the prices of the steel cart produced domestically. While the build quality of this cart might suffer slightly, it is well made and very vibrant looking out of the box. After initial use(1 month) This product has maintained its appearance and usability. i like the rubber brake option and it keeps steel from unspooling like previous models i have used. I only ranked it four stars because the little metal piece that the strapping guides on, keeps coming out of its slot. Not a huge deal, doesnt affect usability. If you have Amazon Prime, this is a great deal!",
