The top and bottom don\u2019t stay attached, so you have to hold both together WHILE grinding, which by the way, takes about 50 cranks to get enough grinds for one cup of coffee. The real reason I\u2019m upset with this product is that the black plastic piece that adjusts the size of the grinds fell off when it was on the largest setting and is now gone. I\u2019ve reached out to javapresse, but they don\u2019t offer this replacement part even though this is the only product they make.",

It's also small and compact so it's perfect for storing in your kitchen.

It takes a minute or two to grind enough for a single large pour-over cup-- no problem. I haven't had any problems, so haven't needed any customer service.

The video was useful, but didn't answer the only question I had. How do you hold the shaft still while adjusting grind? I found that I had to attach the handle to hold the shaft in place while adjusting the grind. The demonstrator didn't appear to do this or anything, he just spun the black adjustment knob.",
