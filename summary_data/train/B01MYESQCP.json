I wish the water bucket was a little bigger, even though, you can make 3 cups of coffee each time you fill it up. It\u2019s a nice/compact design, easy to clean, easy to use, and makes a great taste coffee. It\u2019s good for a small household use, I don\u2019t recommend it for an office 5 + people.",

Not nearly as great as an older Jura I had previously. Not sure what happened to Jura, but can not recommend this machine at all.",

Our neighbor was in the market for one and after trying one cup she said \u201cthis is the flavor I was looking for every morning!\u201d. She just bought one :) The only negative, which is not bad, is that you have to empty the drip tray more than expected because the machine cleans itself periodically throughout the day if it\u2019s left on and will spray a little water in the tray each time. A must have! Enjoy",

It will pump the whole tank out of the machine onto the counter and on to the floor. \"All machines pretested\" BS! Called the 800 number, put on hold, then told to leave a message.
