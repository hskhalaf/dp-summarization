I have amazon prime so the rod arrived in 2 days, everything was great no damages or anything out of the ordinary. It comes in 2 pieces for easy travel. Although its great for fishing the silver with the green lining makes it a great looking rod all around. Definitely would recommend this for anyone who fishes for Walleye, Small mouth, trout or any finesse small bite fishing!!!",

Testing the 7\u2019, it will cast small plugs like a rocket. Can\u2019t wait to try it when the weather warms some. Great rods.

      "text": "I was skeptical about a two-piece rod. However, I had time to throw a few casts and WOW. I couldn't believe how light the rod was. I paired it up with a 1000 size reel and it feels great! I love the open reel housing! Grip is comfortable and the guides look great. The spigot connection feels very strong. Remember DO NOT try to force the two pieces all the way together, there will be a small gap by design. Overall very happy with this Ultralight!",
