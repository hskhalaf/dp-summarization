Wait for 24 hours and then turn the angle to adjust the blind spot mirror so You can see the blind spot. Very important to have for defensive driving.",

These mirrors are perfect: they fit well into the side view mirrors, blend into the design, and cover that all-important rear corner outwards view that is impossible to see unless you angle the mirrors a certain way, which while it works, also limits the field you can cover with the side view mirrors. These beauties overcome that at a very attractive price point.",

I ended up putting them horizontally on the bottom outside edge. They work great!

Lastly, I would be leery of mounting them vertically - when I did the trial positioning - they did not cover enough side-ways range for my liking. However, your vehicle may be different.",
