They just put some nice stained wood tops on them for seats but they are not sanded smooth or anything. I only picked one up to place it near the table and noticed how rough the tops are. If you have shorts on I guarantee you will end up with splinters. If wearing slacks or some sweats they will pull your threads out. Only jeans are safe for these wooden tops. I hope I can get a partial refund because now I have to sand these down on my own just to be able to use them.",
