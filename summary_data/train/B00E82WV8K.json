It's OK for my application, but the quality just seems a bit cheap for the dollars spent.",

      "text": "Its a nice big laundry tub. It's not as sturdy as I thought it would be. I can push down firmly at the center of the tub and the bottom will move a little. In other words I wouldn't put too much weight in it. Otherwise it works fine as a discharge for the washing machine and cleaning bulky items, washing the dog, etc.",

I did fasten it securely to the wall with two \"L\" brackets but I don't think you it would be necessary if you used it occasionally. It sure beats spending $800 or $900 for a metal one that will rust eventually.",
