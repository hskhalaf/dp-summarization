Still leaves enough room for medium socks (more cushion). Found the tongue lighter/thinner than the low top. No idea if this is to reduce bunching or a price point.

Waterproof hikers are way too hot for my feet in summer and these breathe much better than ones with a waterproof liner. Well made and very durable. The shoelaces even stay tied!

Not sure why they are so long as there is nowhere to wrap them around your ankle or anything like that. I really like the design of the shoelaces however, as they are bumpy which helps them stay tied. You will just need to talk the shoe tie bows in really well as they can catch the highest plastic grommet on the other shoe and trip you up.",

No need to break them in, they're good to go from the get go. Very comfy, nice spring to the step.... Etc.",
