      "text": "I've used Otterbox Defenders on my iPhone for years, and this iPad Pro 10.5 case was exactly what I expected. It fit the iPad perfectly, so there is no movement in the case. I like how there's four positions for the stand (slightly tilted and very tilted for both portrait and landscape). If you're not familiar with the Defender series of products, know this is a thick case, and you will definitely notice a difference in the size and weight of your iPad. Personally, I found the iPad too thin for my grip, so I appreciate the thickness of this case.",

After adding this case it now feels indestructible! It is not near as bulky as I thought it would be but it does add some weight. The screen is very clear and there are no \"bubbles\" like I found with the Lifeproof case on my old iPad. I like the bonus face protector that doubles as a stand! Other than not being waterproof, this case has it all! It is on the pricey side. You get what you pay for.",

First there is the armor that fits directly onto the Ipad. Second, there is a snap-on cover which protects the screen when not in use. The armor part came with a plastic screen protector which was very cheap. It was a plastic film with adhesive that attached it to the armor. I removed the plastic and put some Gorilla Glass directly onto the screen instead. Hey, it works and the price was right, but I am really not impressed.

The new plastic encasing is not as soft and is more durable, its a bit stiffer than the previous, but is an excellent upgrade to the defender series. I recommend the Defender series for those active or like myself clumsy individuals.",
