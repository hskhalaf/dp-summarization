It is not only a nuisance, but it gets all over the ace bandages I use and gets messy. What do you think?",

      "text": "Fairly happy with this ice pack as it does the job and stays cold for as long as I need it to during therapy. No leaks have been experienced so far, and it gets ice cold quickly in the freezer. Size is great for a medium to large back and can cover anywhere from a third to half of it. I don't advise using a thick towel between your skin and the pack as I noticed the cooling effect is significantly reduced that way. I found it was effective enough just to use your shirt as a barrier, though of course adhere to any advice given to you by your medical professional (if applicable).",
