It worked GREAT! The nozzle adapter fit my inflatable pool perfectly and within minutes I had everything inflated. It was pretty loud, but it did its job quickly for such a small looking pump.

There is a hole by the nozzle where air comes out, this is probably a precaution to stop the pump from over inflating the pool or float. 4. The motor gets really hot which means the plastic case gets hot too. Otherwise it works fine.",
