      "title": "Nice basic sun hat to which I can easily add a scarf for extra flair",
      "text": "I bought two of these Betmar Gossamer sun hats, white and cobalt, because I appreciate having a basic well designed sun hat in different colors. The soft brim is four inches all around and the diameter of the total hat is about fourteen inches. The Texas sun is strong and it is nice to have the extra UPF 50 protection that this hat provides. The fact that this is a plain hat makes it ideal for me to personalize by tying silk scarfs around the brim. I love to coordinate my sun hat with my outfits and this style hat in so many color choices makes that easy.",

      "text": "Cute hat and good quality, but too large for my head. I'm an average sized woman, so I don't think my head is particularly smaller than most?! The fit cannot be adjusted so it just didn't work for me because it slipped down too low on my forehead and would have blown off very easily. Also, I found the brim to be too wide for my taste, but it would work well to shield from sun if you like this style. Deserves four stars because it is well made and attractive, just not right for me. I'll try another style - this one is going back.",
