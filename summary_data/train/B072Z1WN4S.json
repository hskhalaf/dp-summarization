The head requires a phillips bit and the nut is a lock nut. But a phillips bolt head? Anyway, the bench is so nice and packed so we'll, I gave it all the stars for that. I will eventually change out the 4 base bolts to something better. For the price, it's an awesome bench!",

If you are on the taller side (5'10+) I would probably go with something different. The foam inside holds up pretty well, my fiance\u0301 will do step up every now and then on it, and it still has its original shape.",
