I will update after more uses and after I've tried a wider variety of items .",

Not worth time and effort to return it under warranty. Then another. Last month (about 15 months after purchase) the heating tape developed a \"bubble\" and that caused a gap in the seal. Then about a week later it just quit. They should mention in the description that you're actually buying a disposable appliance. Junk. I now have an Avid Armor ( and love it.

Instead, clamp your bag in, hold it over the edge of a counter or table, start your vacuum seal on normal and pull the bag under the ledge while holding your sealer on the top. Basically cut off the liquids from reaching the inside of your vacuum sealer!!

Only negative thing is the bag tends to have a long area at the top that is unusable because of the length that needs to be inserted into the vacuum chamber.

When the other end was placed, as directed, into the machine it sealed the end of the bag. OK, good! When, however, the other end was placed, as per the instructions in the machine, it would NOT vacuum seal. The bottom line....this appliance is a waste of money! Buy a different brand.",

Ideal for baby food preparation too, especially for working parents with limited time.\nEasy To Clean\nLightweight and compact, this vacuum sealing system can be placed on any counter top. Its stain resistant housing will not absorb accidental spills, and it is easy to wipe it clean.\nSuitable For Lots Of Other Uses Too!\nUse it to reseal wine, oil and vinegar too.
