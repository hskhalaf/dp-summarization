Did not get or expand, just got a bit slimy and lumped on the bottom of the container. Tried setting in water for 2 days, even tried boiling water -same results. Useless for chia pudding or smoothies. Don't know if it's a bad batch, or if this is an underperforming strain of chia, but I wouldn't buy these again.",

      "text": "Breakfast is very important - and I'm never hungry so decided to eat something healthy to keep me full until snack time. Just over 1/4 cup of Non-Fat Plain Greek Yogurt, 1 tablespoon of these chia seeds, 1 tablespoon of slivered almonds - mixed by spoon and topped with blueberries. With this, I look forward to breakfast! Introduced chia seeds to my diet about a year ago after losing about 20 lbs. The object is to maintain my current weight with healthy eating (non processed foods) I believe this is an integral part of starting my days off right! Enjoy!",
