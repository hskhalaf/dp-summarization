I have very long hair and find that if I use shampoo with no sulfates, and only put the color on the roots as my hair grows out (skip the last step of putting the color through the rest of your hair), that the color stays true for literally years, and my hair stays healthy (it also helps that I do not use heat for styling).",

Directions are very straight forward and the box has everything you need from gloves, bottle, coloring tube, cream protector for ends & conditioner.

      "text": "My natural hair color is as shown on the box. I have started to get a few gray hairs here and there that were annoying me whenever I looked closely in the mirror, so I decided to try and color my hair. Unfortunately after coloring my hair is both darker and now has a reddish/orangeish tint to it. Nothing particularly artificial-looking, but certainly not what I was going for with an ash color. It did cover the grays, though. Maybe the darkness will fade a bit but I imagine I'm stuck with the orange. Would have preferred to stick with my grays!",

I see a lot of the reviews on here saying they had the same problem. So don\u2019t purchase the dark ash brown unless you want black hair.",
