I've owned several printers since My first PC, an Apple ][+ purchased in the summer of 1978, and this printer is far and away the best.

The automatic setup did not work for me with Windows 8, but using the Installation CD was perfect. Fast and painless. The networking function worked instantly and perfectly. Some have complained about the small cartridge. Replacement cartridges from other manufacturers (including refills) are available for about $15 (sometimes 2 for fifteen) so this isn't as much of a problem as one might think.

I dinged it one star for the flimsy brittle plastic extension that holds the printouts and keeps them from falling on the floor. Also it would have been nice if it closed up completely.

The only downside (as others have mentioned) is that it is a bit noisy, but it doesn't really bother me. In fact I really don't know how noisy it is in relation to other laser printers as there is no way I can make a comparison.",

After speaking to me new friend Faraj from New Delhi at HP I learned that this printer was not capable of printing in booklet form, where you could simply turn the page over from right to left to read the back side. Something was said about this being a feature of laser printers, but I did not catch that. This was also news to Faraj as he attempted a number of driver fixes and downloads. This is my first laser printer, but I remain puzzled by this answer from HP.",
