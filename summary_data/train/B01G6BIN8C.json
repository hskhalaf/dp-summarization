I love the feature of tracking movement and doing close ups of the person who's talking. Why not 5 stars? The full screen static shot does give a slightly curved \"go pro\" looking shot.

It allows you to host a \"multi-camera\" live event without the need for multiple cameras. The image quality, however, is NOT great. In good lighting, you still get a LOT of noise. Much like a digital zoom, because that's what it is. I knew this going in but I was hoping for better. There is no way that I am aware of to superimpose a logo of any kind. This may be a great low-cost solution for podcasting, but professionals...keep looking.",

Another feature I like is that if I ever need to record for over an hour I can plug the camera USB power in. Overall \u2014 perfect for my needs. Work and family celebrations.
