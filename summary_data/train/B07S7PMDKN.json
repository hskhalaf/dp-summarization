This turf baseball shoe also proves itself to be more than skin-deep as its comfort, traction, and fit checks out. The price does not leave the wallet bruised as well. Overall, if you\u2019re a sneakerhead looking for baseball cleat, this one is one to consider.",

      "text": "I have been wearing size 9 for many years reliably across all brands of shoes so I ordered my normal size 9. I was very reluctant to buy these based on all the comments about not being able to put them on. The opening does not have as much room or flexibility as typical shoes with a tongue. I had a shoehorn in my closet unused for about 20 years. It came in handy for putting these on. Using a shoehorn, these shoes slid right on and fit great! It's almost like wearing another pair of socks. I wear them for softball. I am very pleased with this purchase.",
