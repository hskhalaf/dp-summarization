I believe it\u2019s helping his mental stimulation as well as slowing the rate he grazes.

They can get close but ultimately neither of them (1.5 year male and 11 year female) can fully empty any of the cups which means we have to dump that for them or continue to add more at a quicker rate than it seems like we should have to.",

It does seem to make her a bit frantic during the process. To combat that we give her some on the device and some in the tubes. Seems to work out better. We also pick it up and put it away when it is empty as the kitten thinks if it is out, there is food in it.",

    "description": "Size:1-PackThe Catit Senses 2.0 Digger Cat Toy encourages cats to work for their dry food/treats in a fun and natural manner. As cats are true hunters, they need to be able to search and locate food in different locations around the house; our cat feeder toy incorporates this idea with a smart design that activates your cat's natural foraging behavior during playtime. Hiding dry kibble or treats in the Digger's multiple tubes plays on a cat's instincts to sniff and paw, while also acting as a cat slow feeder so they eat smaller portions. An interactive cat toy or feeder is a great way to stimulate activity while reducing binge eating! The slow feeder cat bowl comes equipped with 3 short-narrow tubes, 2 long-wide tubes, a stable base and a rubber mat to lock the product in place. This cat puzzle feeder is also super easy to disassemble and clean; simply remove the green tubes from the food bowl and handwash. We recommend that you handwash this item with natural soap (free of abrasive materials and water). Catit is focused on creating cat enrichment activities for all cats especially indoor cats. Cat toys for indoor cats should encourage a cat\u2019s natural foraging and hunting behaviors. Our Catit Senses 2.0 line has created a wide variety of cat toys, with this in mind. To keep your cat interested, you need to change their cat toys set-up often, Catit Senses 2.0 is the only cat toy series that allows you to create new and exciting setups for your cat, quickly and easily! Each toy was designed to activate and stimulate your cat's unique senses, all in one fresh, green style to match any home interior, no matter the arrangement.",
