My 4-star rating is based on that purchase price, otherwise I would probably reduce it by one star. The quality of the construction is just OK. The metal tubing is fine quality but the plastic wing nuts seem to get a little loose over time. The bumpers that rest on the floor are a pretty hard plastic and tend to slip a little bit on hard surfaces. Had they used rubber or silicone that would have been a better solution.",

The bars allow my wrists to stay straight, sure is a big difference when you swap back and forth. Very noticeable the strain push ups put on your wrists, I am very glad I have these. These are pretty good, but the knob used to put these together comes loose slowly. The foam wrap also slides around a little, but easy enough to put back in place. I will definitely use these for years to come.",

This allows me to do many more than I normally would have with floor pushups. I know bang out about 300 or more every other day (not consecutively, though--I'm not that strong). 3) Foam grips have lasted a long time--no deterioration. CONS 1) All these pushups have made me far too hot. It's a real problem.",

If I hold them such that my weight is being put on the bones at the bottom part of my palm, that place starts hurting after enough pushups. I really wish the foam were thicker and more comfortable.",

      "text": "I weigh 290 with no strength. Couldn't do 5 regular pushups prior to getting these a couple months ago. Now I don't use these anymore and it's actually now easier to do regular pushups. I can do 25 straight on my own now. So they served their purpose. Only reason I give 4 stars is because I had to tighten them up with each use. But I'd recommend this to anyone looking to build muscle but struggles with pushups.",

I got these because my wrists tend to hurt in normal pushup position, the loaded while flat on the floor position. Beyond that, I also had wrist surgery recently and now especially can't do regular pushups right now. Hammer position works well for me. These allow me to perform pushups comfortably, as well as to target all kinds of arm, shoulder, and chest muscles by positioning them differently. HIGHLY recommend them for that purpose.",

      "text": "These Push Up Bars are light weight but sturdy! They are easy to assemble right out of the box....just screw the feet into the stem with the wing-nuts provided. The rubber feet on the bottom are excellent for gripping any surface without slipping around. My only gripe is the handle foam is light weight and compresses quickly. You pretty much feel the metal bar drilling into your hand after a while. If they could beef up that handle with some thick dense foam then these would be unstoppable.",
