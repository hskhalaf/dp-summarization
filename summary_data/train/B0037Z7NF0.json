      "text": "I placed it in the middle of a 35 foot long pool. I had my 30 pound grandson jump in on one end and the alarm did not go off. I set it to the most sensitive setting (according to the instructions) and tried it again. It still didn't go off. When I make a wave right beside it with my hand the alarm blasts and the remote receiver works. Unfortunately, this device does me no good if it won't detect the waves made when my grandchildren jump in.",
