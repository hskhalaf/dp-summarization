Thankfully I was able to salvage most of it and after a few additional decorations and 3hrs of work we did pretty good. I wouldnt recommend buying this type of product online again. Anyone who has trouble assembling my advice is to use a hot glue gun, worked great for us!",

      "text": "The kit came with several of the pieces broken in multiple pieces. With some panels coming broken into as many as 5 pieces it was especially difficult to assemble the kit. In addition to the icing not gluing the panels together quickly or securely, we also had to worry about the glued-together broken pieces falling apart with any degree of pressure put in the wrong place. It was more stressful than it needed to be. I understand gingerbread houses are more difficult than they seem when it comes to construction, but the fact that they came with broken parts made me less than excited I'd spent this much money on a themed kit.",
