Not the soft, fine sand I have experienced other places. Because of this, the sand doesn\u2019t go through the mat like the pictures/videos show. Instead, it stays on the mat until it is shaken off. I also don\u2019t like how there is no way to hold the mat together once you fold it up. If there was a strap or carrying case, it would make it much easier to carry and store.",

I've used the mat for only a few months and have to say the stitching quality is lacking. The edges of the mat are separating from the body and there are long threads hanging off that I have to cut. The D-rings that are on the separated edges have fallen off because of the poor stitching. The D-rings are also rusted from being in the rain. If the stitching was improved and the metal on the rings was rust-proof, this would be the perfect mat.",

Overall I'd recommend this if your wanting a tarp to set your things on, because it is really durable and we will use it again. Just set your expectations realistically. Also other reviews mentioned if the sand is wet it doesn't filter through at all and this is 100% accurate. So set this up where the sand is dry and it will be more effective.",

I did think though, that as soon as the sand gets on, it'll go straight through but it doesn't. You have to actually rub the sand in order for it to fall through. Otherwise I would have given it a 5. Wet sand is a little different. It'll clog the holes but after 20-30 min, it'll dry off and then fall off once you rub it through. BUT, it's 97% Bette than using a towel or anything that you can't brush off. I'd definitely recommend.",

    "title": "CGEAR The Original Sand-Free Outdoor Camping Mat \u2013 Patented Technology, Water-Resistant and Anti-Fade Material, Military-Grade Construction \u2013 Multi Use Outdoor Blanket",
    "description": "The Original Mat is the only outdoor mat on the market that features patented sand-free technology, and we only make it one way: to standards that reflect our military roots. CGEAR\u2019s patented technology is a system of precisely engineered layers of high-density weave that allows particles of sand, dirt, and dust to fall through the fabric without being able to come back up. This was originally developed for military helicopters in desert warzones. Later, it was used for military drones before expanding to the civilian market. The Original Mat is UV stabilized to prevent fading, is fast drying, and resistant to water and mold. It features reinforced seams as well as double-reinforced, heavy-duty corner D rings, which allow it to be affixed to the ground quickly, easily, and securely, even in adverse conditions. The Original Mat is perfect for true outdoors people who demand durability and versatility in everything they own. It works great as a ground mat when camping, backpacking, and RVing. It\u2019s also useful as a picnic, camp, and beach blanket. Whether it\u2019s protecting your cameras during an outdoor shoot, or providing a sand-free pad for you and your friends to enjoy at a concert, the Original Mat will serve all your needs for years to come. For your convenience, it comes in 2 color options and 4 sizes. SMALL (6\u2019 x 6\u2019) is designed for 3 persons and small tent applications. It is also great for taking to the beach. MEDIUM (8\u2019 x 8\u2019) can accommodate 6 persons and larger tents. It\u2019s great for families and/or those who travel with friends. LARGE (10\u2019 x 10\u2019) is designed for 10 persons and offers significant ground coverage, providing an impressive sandless space for bigger camps. XLARGE (12\u2019 x 12\u2019) is the biggest mat we make. It offers room for up to 14 people, meaning it can be used for outdoor banquets and other events.",
