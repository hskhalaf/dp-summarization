I use Fotospeed Cotton Etching 305 paper on Epson A1 printer with a custom profile and the results are outstanding. Using the same paper on the XP-8500, again with a custom profile from Fotospeed (FOC if you buy paper from them) produces excellent results. For 90-odd quid this printer is superb. Yes, Epson inks cost but if you want quality prints this works.",

The XP960 fits the bill perfectly, it does all the regular tasks with ease and prints stunning quality images without changing the print settings to high quality settings. Just make sure you use a good quality photo paper. Remember - you buy cheap you will get cheap results. One other thing check around for replacement cartridges there are plenty of cheap alternatives to buying Epson O.E. and the results are just as good",

This setup was an absolute breeze, I'm hopeless with computers yet this took next to no time at all. Printing is fast enough for a domestic device and on colour glossy paper the results are the best yet by far. I honestly cannot find a negative term to use in this rushed review, it literally almost worked straight out of the box. A fail to understand the gripes and the one star reviews relating to this product, it shines! Not to mention exceptional value it offers for the hard earned cash. BRILLIANT!",

I wasn't aware that it came with ink, so I bought the bundle that comes with an ink multipack, which I'm sure will come in handy later. However, for \u00a382 it's a solid printer that prints very quickly. Another nice feature is that a tray will pop out to deliver your printed goods!

Slow printing photos - do not believe the print speeds advertised. Absolutely not worth the money - my \u00a350 2 year old Canon Pixma was miles better than this!",
