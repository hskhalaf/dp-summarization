I used on my first wheel, no problem worked well after agitating and scrubbing...however normal soap with slight degreaser would have worked about the same. My problem came when using on my other wheels where the clear coat apparently was coming off and I didn't notice it. The acid in this solution cause the unprotected wheel parts to turn black and cloudy. Not really the products fault I guess since that is a big no no anyway, but don't say it's great for all types of wheels when it's not.",

      "text": "This cleaner works incredibly well on both tires and rims! Just a few sprays per wheel, let it soak for a few minutes, and then wash it down. I prefer to agitate the dirt and brake dust with a wheel brush after using the spray and then washing it down; this is sort of critical if you plan on using a tire shine spray as a follow-up for a longer lasting and deeper shine. I HIGHLY recommend this product for the price! You also really don't need to go crazy with the spray, so it will definitely last longer whilst still being very effective!",
