I bought this because I was looking for a light weight router with more gumption than a laminate trimmer but something smaller than a full size router. Color me impressed. This kit has almost every possible base, guide, and attachment you could want. Very smooth operation. Well made machine, easily adjusted. Nice bag to keep things organized. I'm not usually a big fan of Makita, but this really blew me away.",

This part enabled the use of the included straight guide or to just use the part itself as a guide. Now in order to use a straight guide with the plunge base you have to PURCHASE a straight guide which is junk for the money, (look at the Makita euro straight guides for the RT0701C, Makita Micro Adjustable Straight Guide Fence 193312-9 ) and you will realize the JUNK we are offered here. Alternatively you can purchase Rocky 30 plunge base which includes the mystery part shown in the photo.",

It is well made, the machining is tight, and adjustments are easy and accurate. I just finished routing 8 signs in fir with a hundred letters and edge work. I used mostly the plunge base...and achieved great, repeatable results. The motor never got hot nor did the router bog down when cutting full 1 inch quarter-round profiles in a single pass. Dust collection is decent...about what you'd expect with chips flying all over. Visibility of the cutting is good. Highly recommend this Makita router!!
