      "text": "These saw horses are a great value. The set up is very simple, like a card table. The rubberized surface grips the material you are working with well and keeps them from sliding around. They heavy construction of the saw horses keeps them stable when they are loaded. The metal looks more professional than plastic saw horses. So far, they are very durable. They fold up compactly for easy storage and are a space saver. Also, there is a handle on top that makes it easy to transport them. These are much easier to take with me to job sites. I would consider buying another pair for my brother in law for his birthday.",

I was a bit hesitant because folding sawhorses tend to not be as sturdy as a permanent structure. These work just fine and are just the right height to make whatever project you're doing comfortable. I had a bit of an issue folding them back up the first time. If you aren't careful you can damage the legs. But after a few aggravating moments I was able to figure it out. Great sawhorses for smaller jobs.",
