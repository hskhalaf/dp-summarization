Maybe I just got a bad batch, but it doesn't rub onto the fruit easily after spraying it on; I give up after about 5 seconds. It feels waxy, almost sticky. I know it is not residue from the fruit because it is this way right out of the bottle, whether I spray an apple, a strawberry, or a stalk of celery - and that after thoroughly washing my hands. I've used other fruit washes before, and they have all been soapy and easy to use. I don't like this product, or at least the batch I received.",

Maybe a coincidence the first time, but it was a week apart with two different types of fruit. I ended up throwing away all 3 bottles tonight.",
