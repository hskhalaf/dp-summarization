It has a Matcha scent to it, but isn't strong and does not taste like anything. It looks like it's going to last me a while, even when I use a thick layer of it. I used it mostly for night time, but due to the results, I even implemented it during my daily routing as a balm. This product is worth the money and because it helped me with the dry lips issue. It's a must buy product for me.",

I purchased this product to not only provide temporary moisture to my lips which I could have achieved from the countless jars of Vaseline or chapsticks lying around the house, but for long term moisture resulting in pinker and softer lips. After using this product daytime and overnight (twice daily) for several days, or even weeks, I have not noticed a drastic change. Yes it will provide with great moisture like a good lip balm should - but if you are expecting a significant and long term change that is highly noticeable then you may be slightly disappointed.",

I used to reapply chapstick every two hours or so on a normal day, and while I still use chapstick it is very infrequent. A small amount goes a long way so I imagine it will be some time before I have to reorder.",

I love matte lip sticks but they can be so incredibly drying to the lips, so this lip mask is the key to getting my lips soft again every day. Love it!! Green tea matcha is my favorite out of the two.",
