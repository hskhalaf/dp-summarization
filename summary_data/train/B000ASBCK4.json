Otherwise, the blade guard will hit the wood first. Seems like a dubious specification if you have to manually intervene with the blade guard. The Dewalt manual is a bit lame and wish Dewalt would have more instructional videos for newbies. The instructions to mount the work stand mounts were especially kludgy.

I've used them to cut just about everything under the sun, from small trim work to siding to fencing to larger framing pieces. While Dewalt (and other brands) offer dual-bevel saws and sliding compound miter saws, I'm still fond of this simpler compound miter saw without the sliding rails. In the rare moments when I need to cut a very wide board -- and this doesn't happen to me that often -- I simply flip it. Same thing with miter cuts -- I just move my work around to work with the saw. Again, this saw is a workhorse. Great product!",

Now I have a line of neighbors wanting to borrow it. Easy to set up and attach to your stand. Easy to operate. I love the 5-second brake feature and it comes with a little bag you can place over the exhaust to help control dust.",
