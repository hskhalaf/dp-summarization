I\u2019m not sure what the big difference is between the Original vs the Classics but they Classics I guess are supposed to have more cushion. They could use a bit more cushion in general but I love these boots.",

I went on a 3 mile walk the first day with no issues. The quality is excellent and the finish will only get better as they age and are scuffed up. I have ordered a woman's pair for a close friend.",
