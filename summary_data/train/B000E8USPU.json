      "text": "I have a very small Japanese garden setting in one corner of my backyard. and wanted to add a water feature there. I bought a planter from TJ Maxx for 14.99 (what would I do without them!) and put this fountain kit on top. I also plugged this to a timer so it runs from around 6:30 AM and stops at midnight. It's been running regularly without a problem since I set it up. I cleaned the pump once. Water shouldn't be too full so you can hear the sound of water trickling in and the sound of it also reverb from the bowl itself. It looks and sounds very relaxing. It's a very simple setup but it works well.",

Anyway, this fountain is just a piece of wood ( picture is misleading) plus the tip which connects the tube from pump to this piece of bamboo is so short, so it always falling off or leaking along the wood. Once whole bowl leaked out on the carpet so I had to remove whole carpet lining to dry to prevent mold. For $40 they could make at least 1 inch longer tip to prevent leakage.
