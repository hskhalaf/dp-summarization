Other than this issue, they are useful. Especially for my project to help fix some \"light spots\" in a \"black out light\" curtains that were a bit loose on their sides. And yes, I was nicely surprised to see that the self adhesive side of those magnets will actually stick to the fabric of those curtain.",
