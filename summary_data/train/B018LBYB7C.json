We purchased the premium small version and right out of the box the fresh water tank leaked. The valve opens on the side so you are limited to where you can use this and my biggest peave the black water tank won't stand on its end. I realize the Thetford 345 is more than twice the money but I can assure you its worth every penny. Its more comfortable to sit on, easier to clean and much easier to live with overall.",

The side O ring blew due to pressure. NOTE: Purchasing the model with the front flush lever since the side lever requires more space. Use in a limited space van.",

    "description": "The Camco Camping Toilet is a durable, comfortable option for camping, hunting, road trips and boat trips. The top features a larger seat size than most competitors, with an increased bowl size. The fresh water holding tank utilizes a pump flush action to effectively rinse the bowl of the toilet. The 2. 6 gallon detachable holding tank seals firmly to prevent escaping leaks and odors. The interior of the holding tank has a slick surface to make waste removal easier and more efficient. Remove the flush tank one handed by toggling a single locking latch. The latch is spring-loaded for automatic re-attachment. The Camco Camping Toilet features a lid that can be latched closed for easier transport or completely removed for cleaning. It is made of durable ABS resin and will seal in unpleasant odors for an overall better camping toilet experience. Measures 12. 5\"H x 16\" W x 17\"D and weighs 11lbs when empty and 42. 5 lbs when full. The outside width of the seat measures 12. 6\" the inside width is 8. 4\". Patented.",
