So far so good with no problems or shortcomings to report other than certain pictures on web not displaying but no big deal given it's main purpose and the profile of the user.",

I have not found a single thing that I don't like, everything works well, the touch screen is very responsive, the processor is fast and has coped well with every app I have used. Well done Amazon for producing an excellent product at a very reasonable price!!!",

The only downside is that it is too heavy for me to read books on in bed, so I use my basic kindle for that. I would definitely recommend getting the 8.9 size as it is great for internet use.

At one point the whole kindle crashed and not knowing how to restart the tablet I spent several minutes trying to figure out what to do. Since looking at reviews on how to increase the kindles performance it has worked and performed a lot better. It still has moments where it will crash and the screen will go black and won't respond. But overall it's a good product and enjoy it very much.",

Very easy to get started and for me to set up for her, she loves the carousel idea as she can return there easily if she gets confused. I have set up the parental lock so she can't buy things by accident. Quality of the screen and sound is excellent, she was able to watch TV/Films, read books, browse the internet, and look at photographs within hours of getting it. We bought the case and stand which made it easier to watch and use, and were glad that we went for the larger screen and HD Would recommend to anyone, and plan to buy one myself.",

This is a logical interpretation or the product description. All I can do with the camera is skype which I don't do and take self portraits - at age 76 this is not a nice thing to do! This was a disappointment. Apart from this the HD Fire 9.9 works fine but it is not as described. I am thinking of returning it but perhaps there is a solution.",

If you do buy this device, DON'T BUY IT WITH SPECIAL OFFERS, as you will be bombarded with adverts, which just appear on your home screen !! and it costs \u00a310 to have them removed",
