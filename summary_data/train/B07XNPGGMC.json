My daughter likes it so much that she keeps it next to her bed and opens a door as soon as she awakes. The calendar has a nice balance of slime containers and add-ins. The only downside, in my daughter's opinion, is that over time the slime stiffens up a bit. It's still good to play with, though. I don't mind at all, since she still gets to enjoy it for a week or two, and I don't want it hanging around the house forever anyway.",

The mix ins are fun, and it has some fun colors. This is a fun option!",

It's still worth the purchase, it kept my daughter busy, gave her something that she likes for her advent calendar, and we used the charms and other added extras with our other slime kits. The containers that the slime comes in with this kit, are good to use with other slime kits. We use them to store her slime that came with other kits and toys. So this was a good addition to my daughter's slime 'collection'. We are happy with this purchase.",
