Since it's past the return date I can't return the product, so I'm stuck -$60 and without a vacuum. I'd like to send it in for a repair somehow, or at least warn anyone who buys it that they shouldn't leave it charging for more than a few hours so this doesn't happen to you. Incredibly disappointed as I rely on this to keep my car looking nice for clients.",

I disassembled the unit to see if any hair had become tangled in the parts. Nothing. No hair. I honestly haven't a clue as to how or why this thing stopped working. Probably a faulty battery unit.",

If the beater bar was on a pivoting heat it would have worked better. The suction was fair. If the unit had at least 25% more power I may have been able to get more hair up without the pivoting head. The flat-sided tool that was sent only works if the entire opening of the attachment can remain in contact with the surface. It worked okay for dirt and other trash.

Definitely is no longer in a useable condition after a few months",

      "text": "Wife says it works quite well with two dogs that shed on furniture, and as a \"dustbuster\" for our cars' interiors. She is a clean fanatic, so also cleans or replaces filters regularly on all devices. I ordered this vacuum from Amazon 2 Sep 2017, and today she insisted that I order replacement pleated filters for it. Be aware those are $10.49 apiece from Bissell plus shipping; you can't just order a pleated filter without the housing to which it attaches. Part # is 1608653",
