      "text": "Great value. I use these for sleeping and shooting (in the ranges that allow earplugs). In the shooting range I find that when properly inserted these are more effective than muffs, and they don't get in the way. I've probably purchased 5 of these boxes in the last several years and I've had no issues with defects. I'm not sure what the official position is on re-using them, but I'll frequently use a pair for sleeping for 1-3 nights. If they fall on the floor or otherwise get dirty, I replace them. They start to lose their \"spring\" after the first use, so if you're using these for shooting it's probably best to go with a fresh pair.",
