I have been doing my own manicure with gel nail polish since 2011. I have tried all brands, expensive and inexpensive and then I found Gellen. This brand is extremely inexpensive, great quality, keeps the shine and of course, does not chip. The picture taken is a manicure that I did almost three weeks ago. As you can see still looks good even though the color is dark. I have bought more colors and if I need more I will buy this brand for sure. Highly recommended!",

So far, I\u2019ve used three of the 12 colors and noticed they mostly require three coats of polish to completely cover the nail. But that\u2019s not a bad thing! I prefer it, as it seems to make the nail stronger and more chip resistant. I will definitely be purchasing more sets in the future. I already have a few picked out.",

So I guess if you are just looking for more colors this is a great set but if looking for specifics then maybe it's a toss up",

They aren\u2019t in the biggest containers but honestly it\u2019s more than enough if you\u2019re ordering for just one person.
