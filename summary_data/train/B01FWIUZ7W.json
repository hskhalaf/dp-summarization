I downloaded W10 PRO direct to USB from the Microsoft download site.I also copied the Intel network drivers to the same USB stick. Installation was a no BIOS affair. However, I did need the already downloaded network drivers to to get the Windows update process started. The NUC6i7KYK links to my LG 4k TV by HDMI cable and effortlessly outputs the full 4k while also extending to the ASUS monitor in 2k using DP cable.",

    "description": "NUC Kit NUC6i7KYK,The typical NUC was a 4- or 5-inch square, and ultimately Intel was able to get Core i5 and i7 mobile-grade CPUs into the tiny confines of these machines. Beyond the NUC, Intel took things to another level of small with the 2015 Compute Stick That's what Intel has done with its new-for-2016 flagship NUC Kit. Code-named the much catchier \"Skull Canyon\" in the run-up to its launch, the NUC Kit NUC6i7KYK takes the form factor of the typical Intel NUC and runs a steamroller over it, widening and flattening the body to allow for more-potent component possibilities inside. \"Skylake\" 6th-Generation processors are the order of the day\u2014there was a whopper in our $650 review unit\u2014and Intel also foregoes 2.5-inch hard drives and solid-state drives (SSDs) altogether, instead opting for a pair of slots for gum stick-size M.2 SSDs to save space,NUCs are astounding for the technology they pack into their small bodies, but to date they have admittedly looked bland. Intel did allow for some of its last-generation NUCs to be bulk-ordered with custom corporate or other logos on top, but this is the first NUC that comes out of the box with a real sense of attitude. Intel's enthusiast-minded skull logo takes up half the lid, and the overall shape is sportier than any NUC before,On the whole, the \"Skull Canyon\" NUC kit is the state of the art in mini-PCs that rely on integrated graphics. It's not cheap\u2014once you factor in the parts you need to get our review unit up and running, there's likely a $1,000 hole in your credit card, in total. But if you're looking for the rare mini-PC that can accept video cards and video-card upgrades without being big enough to house one, it's worth serious consideration, thanks to its Thunderbolt 3 port and its support for emerging external-graphics-card solutions. Indeed, this NUC has been demonstrated in recent months working with Razer's new Core external-graphics box.\n\nBOX CONTAINS\n1 x NUC/BOXNUC6i7KYK3 i7-6770HQ UK",
