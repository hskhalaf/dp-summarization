It arrived yesterday and just unpacking it from the box this morning... the cooling pack liquid had leaked everywhere.

I didn't even open three of the containers for the first few weeks of using this as my lunch box everyday. It's great for meal prepping several small meals throughout your workday. The included ice pack started leaking after not much use, but the company sent me a new one immediately when requested, and no problems since. I did just crack a food container, and was disappointed to see that I had to order a pack of 6 for replacement rather than just one or two, but I have no doubt if I emailed the company they'd accommodate my request.",
