I had heard of these shoes from people I've trained with but just never got around to getting a pair until a few months ago. After several months of use I can say these are the best shoes I've ever owned. They are durable, despite their lightness and they really help your feet if your on them for a long period of time. Had my first pair for working out and just got another pair to wear day to day. Great shoes!",

That Saturday I decided to roll the dice and with limited wear I put in 25 miles going rim-to-rim in the Grand Canyon. Super, super comfortable and minimal blisters despite being more-or-less brand new. I may never go back to my Salomon boots which are heavier. Granted, these don't have the ankle support and durable leather to protect, but for a well trafficked trail like the Grand Canyon offers they were beyond perfect. Highly recommended.",

This time I bought a 10 and they're much more comfortable. I especially like the lacing system, they stay tied, unlike some other trail shoes that always come loose or are too long. I'd suggest buying your normal size, then a 1/2 size larger. You can always return the ones that don't quite fit right. Very aggressive treads and stable in soft dirt. Also works well as a golf shoe.",

If I had to find a weakness, it\u2019s that the the treat is a little aggressive, almost cleat-like, so I imagine it will wear down fairly quick. But who cares?

I paid 2 times more than I normally spend on my Adidas trail shoes that lasted 2 years... Very disappointed to say the least.",
