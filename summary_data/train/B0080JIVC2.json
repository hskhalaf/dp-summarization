      "title": "WARNING: It Eats Batteries",
      "text": "This is a sensitive, nicely laid out and sturdy radio that does a fine job of picking up signals on all bands. HOWEVER, it eats batteries alive! I put it on standby to monitor for weather emergency alerts and the Eneloop batteries discharge within a day! This is poor design electronically. Monitoring for the weather alerts shouldn't take that much power. The speaker, the big energy hog in these kinds of radios, is muted; the light is off. I even tried the high-end lithium batteries, and they were gone in a few days. So unless you have a six volt wall wart that fits this unit, be prepared to constantly replace/recharge batteries if you are in weather alert standby mode....",

I'll keep the radio just for the weather band, but I wouldn't buy it again if it dies, and I wouldn't recommend it to others.

If you plug it in to an external, powered, speaker the volume is really low even when you have the volume on both devices cranked to maximum. My 3.5 mm cable is top quality and the speaker I am plugging it in to can normally get fairly loud. So it's a limitation of the radio.",
