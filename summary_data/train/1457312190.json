Also practice tests in Khan academy are the same, too. There's no benefit to buy this book. Another thing, It does not have tool to figure out to score so I had to download app after searching in website. It is terribly inconvenient to figure out the score compare to ACT test. I would not recommend to buy this book. You can do it online for free.",

Do yourself a favor and don\u2019t buy this book or any books issued by Collegeboard. The only thing good about this book are the practice tests.",
