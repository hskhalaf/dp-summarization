      "text": "Excellent product, bought with some trepidation as I am not an IT guru. Also purchased 4 x 4TB WD Red disks which fitted without issues. This unit is sturdily built using mainly sheet metal and once fitted with disks weighs a significant amount. Shouldn't have worried about the set-up as using the UI and My Cloud software made setting the RAID configuration and loading my files very easy. Now running as a home NAS with several TB's of Movies plus more TB's of photo's and music all served up to my Amazon Fire TV using the Plex media server. Usage to date (2wks): so far has proven unobtrusive, fast, reliable and quiet.",

Remote access to the EX4100 is easy & straight forward to setup, well done WD. Update: It's now December 2018 and I have not had a problem. (Just incase you were wondering about durability)",

The fact that there are public folders on the drive that can't be removed is very annoying, as is the auto-categorisation of all media that gets added to the drive. The NAS works, so I will keep it, but were I to do this again I definitely won't buy a WD NAS, which is a pity as I exclusively buy WD hard drives and am very happy with them.",

The excellent web interface made it easy to set up, including an FTP job to transfer the files from the TerraStation across whilst I sleep or working on the PC. So much quicker than previous attempts via Windows file copying. Being able to spread across 5 monthly payments also helps me to pay for it, without a massive lump going out the account in one go.",

A quick search online shows that MANY users are experiencing exactly the same thing, and have been for some three years.. the response from WD - Nothing! I would seriously recommend you do some research before parting with your money on this one.",
