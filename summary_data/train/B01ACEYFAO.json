It does require assembly which is why I gave it two stars in easy to assemble category This is good for two reasons first you won\u2019t mess it up trying to put it together yourself. Second it has high end parts which do require a professional to assemble and adjust. The shifting is butter smooth and the bike is ultra light. I bought it because my mountain bike was just too slow on the concrete walkways I ride. You will not be disappointed with this road bike.",

When looking for a bike most were either way too expensive to justify for my experience level, or too cheap and poor quality to be dependable. This bike gives me a great ride and I've been loving it. My only complaint would be the I ordered the black version and got the white one instead, which is a little more difficult to keep clean, but since it has no bearing on the functionality it's not the worst. Overall I would completely recommend this bike for those getting into the cycling sport.",

So they came and just fixed minor things for his and it has worked great since. He did have to buy the little toe grabber part, but that was a person preference.

This bike is a lot more comfortable than my old 10 speed, and had a good range of gears for speed and big hills. My only suggestion is to replace the cheap but functional pedals with clip-less pedals, or better yet, pedals with cages if you regularly ride in heavy traffic. You'll get a lot more power on hills.",

      "YOU DON\u2019T NEED TO SPEND MORE: Because Tommaso is a direct to the consumer brand you can now get a bike with 100% Shimano gears, super lightweight aluminum frame, and lightweight wheels for an amazing value. Tommaso gives you value like no other brand. We provide a lifetime frame warranty and great service through our U.S. based customer service team.",
      "THE IMOLA IS AFFORDABLE PERFORMANCE, NOT ENTRY LEVEL: If you are just getting into cycling or returning after a long hiatus, this is your bike. New and returning cyclists don\u2019t need \u201cbeginner bikes\u201d, that won\u2019t meet your needs or last. You deserve affordable performance! The Imola embodies the idea of affordable performance with a full Shimano groupset you hope is on bikes costing $100\u2019s more. Compare the Imola\u2019s specs with any bike, and you will see the difference between us and the competition",
      "STEP UP TO THE BRAND NEW SHIMANO CLARIS R2000: The Shifters, Derailleurs, Crank, and Brakes are all new 2018 Claris. R2000 Claris STI shifters now mimic 105 and Tiagra components up the line. Cables are routed under the bar for a clean look that shifts perfectly. Only bikes with integrated shifters and brake levers will perform at optimal levels. Don\u2019t be fooled by imitators using off-brand cranks or shifters, they aren\u2019t optimized for Shimano gearing and can\u2019t deliver precision shifting.",
      "YOU DESERVE A COMFORTABLE RIDE: Our compact frame geometry offers a more relaxed position for all riding styles, with a shallow handlebar drop so that you can still be comfortable when riding in the lower handlebar position. We even added extra control on turns by equipping the Imola with wider 25mm, 700c road bike tires. Every part of the Imola is designed for maximum comfort and efficiency, so that you can get the most out of every ride",
      "BUILT TO LAST: All too often things are made cheaply and break before their time. We believe that bikes should be reliable and built to last. This is why we use the highest quality aluminum in our bikes, and back it with our industry leading lifetime warranty. We also use only Shimano components, which are backed up with Shimano\u2019s two year warranty and are designed function better and last longer than anything else on the market. Ride with confidence, knowing your new bike was built to last!"
