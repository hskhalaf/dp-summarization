Once it separates, the magnets fall out. The rivets are only on one side, the second side has cutouts for the rivet holes. It's very deceptive - they are not any safer.",

They are much more practical - manipulatable. Unlike Legos, they don't require great find motor, and the possible creations are quicker to form, so that they don't become bored or frustrated due to their developmental level.

Some of the magnet alignment was also not great, so that not all of the pieces fit together as well as they should.

I\u2019m unfortunately throwing them all in the trash because with a 6 month old now in the home I can\u2019t risk a magnet falling out and her accidentally ingesting one. \ud83d\ude41.",

Way better than magnatiles since the magnetism always lines up in them, except the small rectangles. Those have to be flipped to line up. The gate pieces are weaker magnets but still good for creativity. He loves the train pieces too, those don\u2019t leave the table. The 12x12 and 6x6s are also key to being able to build.

They even use this brand at our local Childrens Museum - the museum rarely replaces things (sadly) but in this case I am sure they haven't had to - these probably have gotten played with 8 hours a day 7 days a week for years and they are still in fantastic condition! I got this set for my daughter and she loves them so much. Extremely happy with my purchase.",
