This thing with it's so-called glide technology is, near as I can tell, all hype. Why some product recommendation sites are recommending this grater is a mystery to me. Grating hard cheeses on this thing is markedly more difficult and far more dangerous as the flat blades tend to lock against the cheese causing greater friction and resistance such that your hand tends to buckle in towards the blades. Not good. With any hard cheese it was the same result. The curved blades of a traditional model don't cause this problem. Sent the thing back.",

It\u2019s virtually impossible to grate anything on it without scraping your fingernails on the blades, which really rips your nails. Second, as several other reviewers mentioned, this grater is made of very thin metal that bends when you press something against it to grate, which means you have to press really hard to grate things. Frankly, I prefer my cheap Ikea grater to this expensive unit.",

But it grates cheese and veggies so well, I would not want it any other way. Only taking off one star since the smaller grating side is not small enough to make parmesan cheese like dust. It creates more of a thin, small strip than a grated cheese. Works well for most applications other than having to melt parmesan in to sauces/pasta. Pretty easy to rinse off and the waves really do help glide the object you are grating with a lot of ease. I would not want another box grater after using this one. Well worth the money!",

There is no small grater, so if you are used to grating carrots for a salad, or grating onions instead of chopping them, you will be disappointed by the size options. There is only one slicer, as shown, and I find that with the small width, it is somewhat limiting with oversized cukes or asian radishes. I love that this is dishwasher safe. However, if you use it to grate ginger on the fine micrograter, you will need to scrub it anyway. The bottom cap is a nice feature, but allows juices to run out when grating watery veggies like tomatoes.",

    "description": "Color:Stainless Steel\n\n WHY CHOOSE THE CUISIPRO SURFACE GLIDE TECHNOLOGY GRATERS?\nCOMPETITION\nThere are an abundance of stamped and etched graters available in the market, but not all graters are created equal. Only Cuisipro's graters take etched graters to the next level with a special Surface Glide Technology, exclusive to Cuisipro. \n\nIn addition to razor sharp etched blades the Surface Glide Technology creates the perfect balance between ease of grating and maximum efficiency for the ultimate grating experience that etched graters alone cannot compete with. \n\nIn addition to the exclusive Cuisipro Surface Glide Technology, the entire line of Cuisipro graters and shavers possess well-applied ergonomics.\n\nFEATURES\nGRATE MORE WITH LESS EFFORT WITH SURFACE GLIDE TECHNOLOGY:\nThe science behind Super Glide Technology is based in the repeated grooved pattern that is spread evenly across the face of the grating surface. The grooves provide 2 distinct benefits beyond other graters. First, the groove reduces resistance, making grating effortless. Secondly the groove elongates the length of each individual blade, so it has a larger cutting surface that comes in contact with food, therefore producing more gratings per stroke. Combined these features to create a perfect surface for outstanding uninterrupted grating performance where food glides through blades.\n\nPROTECTIVE COVER DOUBLES AS A MEASURING TOOL: \nThe Rasps and Flat grater collection feature a snap on, clear protective cover with US and metric measurements. Not only does the cover provide safe storage, but is a container to catch grated ingredients for measuring.\n\nVery few graters offer protective covers and no other grater in the market provides a cover with the added benefit of measuring or catching the grated ingredient.\n\nSECURE GRIP FOR SAFETY: \nThe entire line of graters feature ergonomic handles with non-slip finish designed to protect your hands while providing the best grip possible for safe grating. Similar rasps graters don't have handles and other graters don't have the same attention to non-slip grip and ergonomic handles. \n\nNON SLIP END FOR STABILITY: \nThe Rasps, Flat and Dual graters have non\ufffdslip ends and box grater a non-slip base that keep the graters in place and steady while resting on the cutting board. No chance of grater slipping or sliding around the surface.\n\nMajority of graters do not include non-slip ends \ufffd especially for rasps and dual graters.\n\nAll Cuisipro products are backed by a 25 year warranty.",
