To put it simply, if done right, it will not come off on its own no matter how recklessly you drive. The mount itself is pretty big and clunky. It has a very cheap feel even for a 10 dollar mount. The one touch feature is not very impressive and is kind of annoying. Summary: If you want a cheap mount that does the job and you don't care what it looks like then this is the mount for you.",

Perhaps I'm a little picky on asking for more longevity, but you be the judge as to whether it's worth it for you to replace this holder every 2 years. I bought it again, so until I see a better holder, I'll probably keep buying this one as long as the price stays low.",

It was very easy to install, and feels very sturdy once on. I have a Note5 and it's perfect size for it. The little knob on the bottom that hold the phone up can be move to either side if you need your phone to be plugged for charging or Aux cable. Overall happy with my purchase",

They've cheaped out on the suction cup, and the current incarnation (same one according to Amazon) no longer has the \"octopus\" feature that enables it to stick to the textured dash, or anything else for that matter. My 2 previous Iotties were amazing - In fact the first one went with that vehicle when I traded it because I couldn't remove it! The suction cup is now smooth-surfaced, and no longer the stand-out amazing feature that made Iottie the only name I would consider. I won't return this one - I accidentally destroyed the box - but I am not a fan of Iottie any longer.",

If you place the phone so as to avoid this situation it rides higher in the holder an is not as secure as it should be.

The mounting adhesive has excellent staying power without damaging your dashboard, or wherever you decide to place it. They only downside is if your surface is textured or heavily angled, the weight of the holder and phone won't hold for very long and will likely fall off. I had this problem in one of my work vehicles, but considered it a flaw on the vehicle, not the product itself (the angle was more than 45-degress and was a VERY bumpy surface).",
