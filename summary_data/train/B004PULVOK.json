Most kohler toilets have marked under their name on the toilet the GPF and this one does not (it actually looks like the kohler writing is going to rub off). And the handle is very cheap and looks like it will break anyway now. My plumber was very confused by the whole thing but I wasn\u2019t home when it was installed, and so I\u2019m keeping it until it breaks. Definitely do not make my mistake- go to a plumbing store if you are looking for an actual Kohler toilet",

The 18 inch height with seat is hard to find, so this purchase is highly recommended.",
