      "text": "Brilliant bit of kit, had no issues in the year or so I've had it. The screen is excellent, as is the battery life. Has enough power for the odd bit of HD video editing and photo editing, but I don't do much of that really. I also love the size (I forget the exact size but its between 14\" and 15\" I think?)... a 13.5\" would feel too small and a 15\" would start feeling too big to me. Perfect size for carrying around and the narrow screen bezel makes it feel larger than it really is. Great bit of kit overall and I often get questions about it. Always recommend it.",

I hold my finger down on the power button and whilst it boots up it reads my fingerprint and logs me in. The screen is stunning and at 100% brightness is unbelievably bright! It comes with an adapter so you can use external monitors and provides an extra usb port. Keyboard is very satisfying to type on. Overall a great laptop with everything you would need.",

The display is amazing especially because it has very slim bezzles. I never hear the fans when using it which is always good especially when studying at a quiet place like a library. The battery life lasts me all day and it charges very quickly. The build of the laptop is top tier too, there really isn't much that's bad about it. :)",
