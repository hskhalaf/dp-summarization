But an understanding of the video game isn't required to play the card game. Its a game my husband & I can play with the kids, or by ourselves. Our son loves it! And its a good strategy game to make him think.",

The game play is a tad complex and instructions for some things aren't entirely clear so we improvised a little bit. I don't recommend for kids under 7 or 8. Child should definitely be able to read well to play it.",
