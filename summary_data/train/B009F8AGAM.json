However, after reading the reviews about these being true to size, I went ahead and ordered the usual size that I wear in other shoes, which is a 6.5, but I wish I would have ordered a half a size larger because my toe hits the boot very harshly. I ordered these boots for rigorous hiking and buying your usual size in shoes is not a good idea. I will be exchanging for a size 7 and I would recommend going up a half size in order to accommodate comfortable socks and have enough room for swollen feet after 10 mile hikes.",

Laces have to be snug or blisters would be a concern for loose fit, movement, and rubbing. That has subsided after wearing several more times. They are comfortable and no more ankle pain.

The problem with scaling up in these boots is that the toe box opens up with too much interior space. For me, the the space beginning at the bottom of the laces to the front was too high and wide, and the crease was awkward in how and where it spread across the foot. I'm not keeping the boots because of this, am not looking at Timberland anymore, and I have found some good alternative boots!",
