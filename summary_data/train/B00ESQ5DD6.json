And im not talking about rinsing between uses or tossing it in the dishwasher but over time water and gunk starts forming up in the bottom. The slots in the bottom where it sits on the blender are un reachable unless you take the black handle off and you can see the grime through the plastic of the blender. I would reccommend not ever letting the outside of the bottom get wet of at all possible. Just keep washing the inside out as soon as you use it!",

I am enjoying a super easy morning smoothie-yogurt, frozen fruits and a touch of milk. It is done in seconds and smooth as anything you've ever tried, no lumps or chunks. It is a dream to clean also. I put a bit of water in it, maybe 1-2cups, and a drop of dishwashing liquid and run for a few seconds...it whips it everywhere and you're left with just rinsing all those suds out and letting it air dry. It is loud, all those horses ;) but no complaints.",

I was left starving until lunch time. Then, my Ninja arrived. I didn't even know what I had been missing! The difference in smoothie quality was REMARKABLE. This thing makes truly Jamba Juice quality smoothies. Yes, as one reviewer pointed out, it's loud. But guess what? So are lawn mowers, and many of them have weaker motors than this blender. You could probably turn bricks into a drinkable smoothie in the Ninja. Worth every penny. So glad I didn't get a Blend-tec or Vitamix.",

I do think the sipping hole is a bit cumbersome. I sold it and bought a Vitamix again.",

The base has suction cup feet, so even though the base is quite light, the feet grip very well, even on less than smooth surfaces. I store the blender in a cupboard when not in use, so the lightness of it is a real asset.",

One tip is to wash the blades and jug right after use as there are nooks and crannies that become hard to clean if it's left out and becomes dry.",

      "text": "Locking Lid is a problem that ruins the entire blender. We enjoyed the blender for making fruit smoothies. But when the tiny locking pin in the lid snapped off, the blender would not turn on. We feel the locking pin is a definite design flaw. We have asked for a replacement lid from the maker and are hoping they will seriously consider replacing the lid with something not so easily broken. We still have not figured out how it broke.",

I called 877-646-5288 and they immediately answered and sent me a new pitcher and blade, even though I hadn't even registered my product 6 months ago! If I could give 6 stars, I would! Great customer service Karen!! This baby is very loud, and very tall. it doesn't fit under my countertop like most reviewers said, but it's so awesome I don't even care.",

      "text": "Changing my review because ours is now smoking. I got this to make fruit and veggie smoothies. Most of the time I don't use anything frozen. if I do, it's usually the fruit. But I was just in the kitchen making a smoothie and I poured more water in and it had smoke coming out. This isn't the first time I've noticed this. When it goes off, you can hear this squeeling sound. It gets the job done, but it looks like I may have to replace it soon and I haven't had it very long. Not even 2 months.",

My favorite so far is to take the single serve cup and stick 1/2 banana, 1 cup frozen peaches, 1/4 avocado, 2 ice cubes, and 3/4 cup of fresh not from concentrate orange juice. Clean up has been pretty easy, i always rinse it out with hot water after use to prevent any sticky residue from the fruit.",

I purchased the larger one because I always over filled the smaller on. Now I can make a larger amount which will last me longer. No package or delivery complaints!",

      "text": "I just thought I previously owned a blender. The most annoying things about past blenders was getting them jammed on too many ice cubes or frozen items when making smoothies or just overloading it in general. That has yet to happen after using this heavily for 2-3 months. It isn't a food processor and when we tried sweet potatoes, carrots, and nuts just to see what it would do it seems to just sling them to the outside of the pitcher. I figure there is a trick to doing items like that but haven't tried to find one yet.",
