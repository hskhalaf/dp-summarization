The sleek, simple, all-black design is a lot more chic than the other heated eyelash curlers out there, and this one is half the price.",

For a more noticeable look I recommended curling your lash with a mechanical curler, apply one coat of mascara, curl with heated curler and then apply more mascara.

Most of the negative reviews were in regards to the battery life being short so I figured I'd just take it out after each use. The battery is not the problem. The problem is it DOESNT DO ANYTHING!! No curl, no lift, nothing! Seriously...save your money!!",

I use this after I put mascara on and the only thing I don't like is that it takes off some of my mascara when I curl. This does make it less clumpy though, I just reapply after. With traditional curlers though, my lashes will un-curl if I reapply after the curl...but this one actually held. I love it!",
