They mixed up the numbers in the assembly diagram for the longer bolts. They obviously are for the glass sides, so it was an easy fix by switching to the short bolts. Not a problem enough to ding a star for it. We even stole the idea of matching flower arrangement with a Picture to match in our entry.",

      "text": "This table certainly turned out how it looks in the photos. Assembly was easy and only took a couple of minutes. I purchased this table for a hallway and it does the job perfectly. My only concern about this table is that it's not very sturdy if you touch it/bump into it from an angle. It wont break, but it certainly feels flimsy sometimes. Considering I used it as a decorative hallway table, sturdiness isn't much of a concern, but I do want to express that one concern. Would not recommend this table if you are wanting to actively use it, but for decoration, absolutely! I enjoy it and I've received many compliments on it!",
