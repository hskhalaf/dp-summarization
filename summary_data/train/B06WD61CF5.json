If you have a hardware issue with your purchase when you receive it, do not let them dupe you into spending wasted time on technical support. Insist on sending the computer in for a repair if necessary. Be persistent, and you may reach somebody helpful. DO NOT LET THEM convince you that you need to pay for the repair. That said, sound quality was terrible on arrival. I have been wrestling with their phone support to get this thing sent in for repairs. We've had it less than 24 hours. I may be returning this instead of getting it repaired, as it seems to be less of a hassle.",

When I tried to get it repaired through ACER they told me it would be $450 to send it in...which is over 50% of the cost that I bought the laptop for.

      "text": "I can't believe that I'm writing a review but I just wanted to say that I like this computer a lot. It's quiet, fast, runs cool. I just write emails, shop and watch HBO NOW on it. I love the back lit keyboard and the touch screen. Also the computer boots up in under 5 seconds every time. So glad I found this computer. It does what I need it to do and I've not had any problems with it in the 5 or 6 months that I've owned it.",
