For me, it is mostly an e-reader, but the other options are rather handy, especially the car audio options. Today I listened to several stories on Pocket using the text to speech feature on Pocket.",

After several exchanges with the seller, thinking mine was defective, it turns out that I misinterpreted the description. This is a reader for e-books (multiple formats), it is a bit sluggish (45 secondes to wake from sleep), and although it includes a web browser and other paraphernalia, it's functionality for those other apps/software is VERY limited and no less buggy. As an e-reader it is OK (not as good as Kindle and not waterproof); as anything more, it is rather useless. The wonderful hand sketches that appear on the screen are very misleading since this unit CANNOT WORK WITH A STYLUS of any kind.",

The only other nitpick is the speed of the keypress is a bit fast. That means if you hold a key down long enough, it displays the other character the key supports, not the one you wanted. It took me a minute to figure it out. Just type quickly and it works fine.",
