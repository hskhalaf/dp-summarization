A few months ago, I opened up the replacement roll (still vacuum sealed!) and it seemed just fine. Unfortunately, after a few hours of printing, this one turned out to be super brittle as well. I'm absolutely done with Hatchbox. Do yourself the favor and spend a little more on premium, US manufactured filament.",

I ended up buying this, and honestly in the beginning, I didn't exactly like this stuff. So, after fiddling with it for a bit, I realized that with my Monoprice Maker Select plus, it likes 210-215 degrees of hot end, and the printer bed to be 55-60. I usually just spray some hairspray or honestly just some blue painters tape makes this stuff stick pretty well. So, if you're wondering if this is good or not, it is. Don't be put off by the price. It's worth it, if you ask me...",

Basically the black filament is way more finicky than the white or red I've tried in pla.

I just had to chuck half a roll because it was so brittle it couldn't even be loaded without breaking. I have three other rolls that are at least as old if not older from other brands and none of them snap when I bend the filament. I was going to build a dry box but I live in a dry climate and so far Hatchbox seems to be the only filament I've ever used that turns to junk just sitting around for a couple weeks. Easier and cheaper to just not by Hatchbox.",

Because it competes with other filaments for usage, I have about a quarter of the spool left; I have kept it in a gallon bag with a pack of silica gels, so there has been next to no reduction in flexibility. While reliability is important to me, I also recommend it for its beauty; the silkiness it takes on (in some prints more than others) is almost hypnotic. Will not hesitate to buy this filament again in the future.",
