It has many different parts and its fun to put together and make different types of personalities for Mr. Potato Head. Its a great price and has more to offer than the basic one most stores carry. Its easy to clean and Mr. Potato head can store most of the items inside of him, but the carrying case is a big bonus for keeping everything together.",

I was psyched for the suitcase but was dismayed to find that the suitcase does not shut at all. So all of the components end up falling out and into my toy bag. And there are too many of them to fit into a gallon zip lock bag which is what I use for most of games/toys. For now I'll just use an elastic band around the suitcase.",

I've given this 4 stars because some of the pieces are incredibly hard to put in the potato all the way, and likewise very difficult to get out. I hope they'll loosen up with time.",

The pieces will not all fit unless you put the bigger pieces (feet and body) in first then surround them with the smaller pieces. The pieces are also stiff so it is hard for younger kids to push and pull them in and out but I think that will lessen over time.
