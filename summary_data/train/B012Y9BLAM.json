      "text": "I used this to carry my Phantom 3 on Delta flights from FL to CA and back with no issues. The backpack i received has 2 compartments instead of the one large compartment shown in some of the other reviews, but this was fine. The only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the depth of the backpack is about an inch less than would have been ideal for the legs on the phantom. They press pretty hard against the front of the backpack, so i was careful to never put pressure on that area. All in all though, a good backpack.",

I would definitely recommend this to others but would recommend that an instruction diagram be included.",

You need to adjust while sliding the P4 in unlike a hard case/backpack where you can just drop the craft in. Positives are extremely light weight and much more space to put other things unlike the P3 hardshell backpack from DJi",

Design was not too bad and the raincover gives the backpack a nice touch for rainy days. My only concern was the lack of cushion. If you put your drone into this backpack and accidentally throw the backpack down quickly, there is a very high chance of the drone/accessories being damaged. The reason I give this backpack a 3 stars is because I know that this backpack will be able to cover the basic needs of transporting the drone without carrying everything.",
