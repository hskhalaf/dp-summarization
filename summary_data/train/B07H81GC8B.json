I only bought one because of the some of the reviews earlier said N95 masks as well as how they advertised this.

I will supplement it with identification, some money, a pocket knife, waterproof pen and paper, leather gloves, water purification tablets, and probably a few other small items. I am an emergency management volunteer and do search and rescue and feel this is a great little beginning emergency kit for my college bound daughter.",
