We typically put it on her when we know there will be thunder or fireworks and it does a really good job of keeping her calm.

However, in this case, I used it to cover parts of my 12-year-old terrier's body when she had a surgical procedure which resulted in stitches on her side. I hate those clunky plastic cones, so I decided to just \"COVER\" the incision safely and cleanly. The garment keeps her from chewing her stitches, is easy to get on and off, and could be washed (I have several of them for her) quickly and easily. In addition, the \"comforting\" aspect of the garment is an added plus. The use of the Thundershirt has been a great tool in aiding her comfort, safety, and recovery.",
