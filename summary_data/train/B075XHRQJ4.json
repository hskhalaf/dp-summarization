Then, suddenly my watch (series 3) started having issues with the microphone being slow and when I would twist my wrist the screen wouldn't light up at all. I restarted the watch and that didn't work so later that night I took the case off instead. The case was definitely inhibiting the microphone usage and the device wasn't registering my movements. I'm giving it two stars because it's super protective and survived a week in Disneyland, I'm sad to be returning it.",

The front part of the bumper is somewhat hard and the back part is softer. I think it would be better if the front part is softer too since the harder front part makes it more difficult to put the case on. I accidentally scraped the screen protector of my apple watch when putting on the case. Overall, it's a good buy, but I will like the slimmer and softer version more.",

Unfortunately, upon putting this case on, it lifted the edges of my screen protector. I tried to let it go for a bit and would attempt to push down the edges but any movement of the case made it worse. Eventually I had to take off the protector which cost more than the case itself.
