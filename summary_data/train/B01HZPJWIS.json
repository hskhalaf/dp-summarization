That idea was gone when I received the watch. It is really big and bulky and I ordered the small one. It wasn't comfortable to wear at all. I tried to look past this because again, the music was a good idea. I found that I could not. The buttons where hard to push, not easy to navigate while working out and back light was a continued issue. Had to send it back.",
