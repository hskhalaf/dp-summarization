Our dog had been experiencing skin allergies as is common with many breeds of dogs. After only using for a short time, I'm already noticing a difference! This is a quality product, and purchasing from Amazon was half the price of purchasing through the Vet. My dog requires 1.5 scoops which is approx 3/4 tbsp. This large bottle will last for quite some time. The only negative so far is his fishy smelling breath! Thank you for reading and rating my review.",

I ended up returning this bottle and getting another (better quality) brand from a local pet store that focuses on pet nutrition. My new bottle says refrigerate after opening.

Based on several vet recommendations I've been giving him omega 3s which are reported to help skin conditions but I haven't really noticed much of a difference.
