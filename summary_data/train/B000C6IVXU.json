In case you are not aware.... it is not as important to keep engine air filters as clean as it once was. Before engine computers, dirty filters increased the engine vacuum thus drawing in more fuel than needed (reduced mileage) but today's engines automatically adjust the fuel to match whatever air its getting. So, a really clean filter is now needed mostly for maximum power not maximum fuel mileage. I can never tell a difference in gas mileage because of a dirty filter.",
