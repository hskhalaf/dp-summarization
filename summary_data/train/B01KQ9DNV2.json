When you're in that restaurant and hunger strikes your baby, take out your go-to miracle powder transporter, poor it into that water filled bottle, look that judgy witch straight in the eye and shake that bottle like you mean it! Sometimes, breastfeeding doesn't work out, so do the next best thing and get this stuff. My baby is on a mixture of this and breast milk since I can't seem to pump enough for him. He has no gas issues and is never fussy. Great product!",

But we never had a problem with the aluminum. The expire date is 2020. Our son refuses to eat it and we have had to stop giving this one to him. That is a waste for a $30 container.
