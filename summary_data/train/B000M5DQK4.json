It would always dry back out withing a couple hours though. This weleda wash did not make my skin feel soft right after a shower, hence the skepticism. After this past month, however, I don't even have to use lotion anymore. My skin doesn't dry out. I swear by this stuff now. I couldn't be happier",

Last Halloween, I dressed up as a skeleton with full black/white theatrical face paint (Mehron CreamBlend Stick). At the end of the night when it was time to wash my face and go to bed, none of my regular facial cleansers could clean my face. The only thing that worked was the sea buckthorn body wash. It was unbelievable how well it worked and how completely gentle it was. I had scrubbed and scrubbed with multiple facial cleansers and gotten nowhere but with just a few drops of sea buckthorn body wash I removed all the face paint with almost no effort. Total life-saver.",

Not sure if I misread the description but this has a very faint smell in the bottle, nothing like any almond I've even smelled. Does not leave a fragrance on the skin. I can tell it's very healthy for my skin so no complaints there, it just doesn't lather very well either so I tend to use a lot more than average. Overall it's good, best for someone looking for a gentle pH balanced cleanser rather than someone looking for scent.",

      "text": "I\u2019m trying to only use natural skin care products. I have used Weleda for years. Their prices are great. Most well crafted organic items r VERY expensive. I love that there is no artificial fragrance. It has a slight lemony scent & give a mild exfoliation but u can increase it by using on dry skin. Leaves you very soft & I think even a man would enjoy using it.",
