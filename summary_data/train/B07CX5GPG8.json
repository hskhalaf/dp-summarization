The app has a ton of great recipes (I especially appreciate the \"For Kids\" section) and I'm also loving the gourmet meal delivery service a few nights a week. Huge step-up from the greasy delivery and microwaved meals that I was eating before. I can't wait to learn more ways to put this genius little oven to work. Highly recommend!",

Very efficient use of space - we live in an apartment and don't have a large kitchen, but the oven fits perfectly on our counter top. Pretty remarkable how versatile this thing is given its size. Honestly we'll probably replace our microwave outright in the next few weeks with the Tovala. We're two working professionals with a young child at home so the meal delivery service is a HUGE added bonus too.",

I use it to reheat leftovers and cook small items that wouldn't make sense in my full-sized oven. No surprise there. But what I think sets it apart from being just another toaster oven is simply how it cooks these things. Specifically, the steam function is a game changer. When you cook food in this, it goes through a cycle of baking, broiling, and steaming, meaning your food comes out crisp and moist, not dry as jerky. I love this thing.",

I was so anxious and couldn\u2019t wait to set it up however no one ever said that it would not work on the 5G network and most homes now have 5G. I thought I had both a 2.4 and 5G network but unfortunately the oven and the app on the phone would not even recognize the 2.4. So beware if you have 5 g the oven will not connect.",
