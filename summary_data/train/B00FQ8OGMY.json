So I'm at work and my wife, Who is nine months pregnant by the way, sends me a photo of a massive pile of branches. Apparently, my Porter cable 20 V Max saw all came in and she decided to destroy the shrub in the backyard... Needless to say, there is no longer a shrub in our backyard. The pregnant wife is very happy! And I am happy that the saw did a fabulous job at destroying the shrub. If my nine month pregnant wife can operate this thing anybody can!",

But I did know from reading multiple reviews on and away from Amazon sites, how this Sawzall performs and its intended use. I do own multiple PC power tools and plastic design and light maybe moderate is the normal expectation.

Therefore, I beat the B&D bean counters and market guys (who also own Porter-Cable) at their attempt to force me to buy PC batteries for this one tool. I feel like a winner here!

While building a new fence, we discovered that a tree had actually grown through the old fence and needed to be removed. After cutting it down (trunk was too large for anything but a chainsaw), this saw with a 9 inch pruning blade made short work of cutting the tree into manageable pieces. I would recommend that you have a 4 Ah battery for this saw if you're doing more than a few short cuts, as it does use more energy than the other tools in the PC 20V line.",

Not allowed a machine gun but this thing should be useful around the house and property and fits nicely between a saber saw and a circular saw. Note in passing, I did not read closely enough so received the bare tool with no battery. Works great with a battery. Did I mention, no cord?",
