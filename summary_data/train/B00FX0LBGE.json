      "text": "I've owned several fry cutters in my life and this is by far the worst. I felt comfortable buying it because the picture looks much like other fry cutters I have used that work well. The big problem with this one is how tiny it is! The vast majority of russett potatoes I can't fit in there without manually cutting off all the sides, quite defeating the point of the cutter in the first place. It is almost comical how tiny it is compared to other ones. I've included a picture of the smallest potato I have, not fitting into the cutter, next to my old broken cutter that is about 30% bigger.",

I just simply wrap the peeled sweet potato in a wet paper towel and microwave it for a minute or so, depending on the size of the sweet potato, and it is then the perfect consistency to work in this little gadget. It did take some trial and error, as if you microwave it too long, the sweet potato turns to mush, making it impossible to work with. If you do not microwave the sweet potato before trying to put it through this gadget, it is too hard and impossible to do.",

This model will only hold a 3-1/2\" potato or smaller. If I was going to keep it I would have to be cutting most of my potatoes in half to make them fit and then the fries would be very short. The potatoes we purchase in Oregon are mostly 4-1/2\" or longer. This is going back and I will check the size on the next one I order.",

The tab that holds the blade in place is on the inward side of the blade so when you close the handle and the potato pushes against the blade, it also pushes the tab away from the body of the cutter. if it was designed with the tab on the outside of the blade, it would push into the body and hold in place when pressure is applied.",

Really easy to use with small potatoes and if you have larger potatoes, just cut them down into halves, thirds or quarters (whichever fits better). There are 2 sizes of cutting blades and both give great results. You don't need to have superhuman strength to push the lever down, as the suction seal onto the counter helps balance the force from pushing the potato through the cutter. Only 1 possible downside - the cut potato usually scatters on the counter when it goes through the cutter. Not a huge deal for me, but I imagine some folks may not like that.",

Sometimes the potato is too hard for a single thrust and you have to back off and push again. This has been the best cutter for the price that I have found. There are better and easier cutters out there, but not for this price.",

The fries still come out to be a little bigger than fries from fast food places like In N Out, though. I only give this cutter 4 stars because it's too small to fit a large potato in. Sadly, you can't make long french fries using big potatoes in here. You'll have to get a commercial grade potato slicer for that.",

The suction base is great and works well to hold the cutter in place while in use. Blades are sharp. You may have to cut your potatoes to fit in the chute but so what? that is worth keeping the size of this cutter compact. It's plastic so don't force to potato thru too hard.. cut it smaller instead. Makes great fries, especially if you use an ActiFry.. I like the larger grid cutting plate.",

      "text": "This does a really nice job cutting potatoes into fries. I have two major quibbles: 1) I wish the feed area was longer and wider, as I've had potatoes that were just a little too wide for it get stuck, requiring creative knife work to get them free, and longer potatoes have to be trimmed to fit; and 2) I wish the cutting plates were a little sharper, as I like skin-on fries, and the skin often gets hung up on the grids. It works well for Yukon Gold potatoes, skin-on, but Russets have to be at least partially peeled to keep them from getting stuck. Other than that, it's a lovely cutter. I use it frequently.",

You need to put a little muscle behind it to get the potato to cut, but once it gets started it's really easy. I make fries all the time and this will definitely save on time! You may need to cut the ends off of the potatoes so that it will fit in the slot, but that's minor :) I really enjoy it so far!",
