Connection to my Wifi router (ASUS RT-N66U) was a bit tricky and required multiple reboots of the modem and the router before it would finally connect. For the five days, everything seemed fine but after that initial period the modem started loosing it's cable signal and required 1-2 reboots per day. I have subsequently switched to the Motorola MB7621, The Wirecutter's alternate choice.",

      "text": "Works great with Xfinity/Comcast and is saving me > $13 per month; it will recoup the cost in less than a year. The modem is much newer than the one that it replaced and is getting the same or better speeds (I only have the basic tier). I had a little trouble connecting the phone, but that was the Xfinity support persons fault. Once corrected, phone worked flawlessly. One thing I like most is that Xfinity cannot screw with it like they can their own equipment and the configuration/settings are not exposed through their \"app\" (which does not sound like a desirable feature to me). I do not like having my data exposed like that.",

Consequently, I purchased the Net Gear cm600 cable modem. I have this modem paired with a Net Gear R7000 Night Hawk Router. All the devices in my house now stay on line and do not get bumped off. The speed has increased as well. Very happy with this modem. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.",
