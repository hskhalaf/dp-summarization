It did hold up pretty well in rainy weather with only a little water coming in through the seams. I did add additional waterproofing before I went camping with it. However, I had a problem like some of of the other reviewers where the tent was extraordinarily difficult to put together. It appeared the poles were too long for the tent, and it took three people, struggling, to get them in the pockets. I exchanged it for another tent from Wenzel. They provided excellent customer service.",

Setting up alone is a little tough. And the poles require some muscle to bend and stick in the sockets. But once set up, it's strong and sturdy. I'm trying to find some cons, but for the price, there really aren't any.",

I'd return the thing if I hadn't waited so long to use it and still could.

This one, for $50, will keep you dry in a light rain, and withstands the wind very well. It also breathes well, making it an excellent tent nearly year round for the southern US. I've used it 75 degrees and I've used it in 30 degrees. Works fine as a tent either way.",

Our air mattress didn't fit well and we couldn't close the zipper when it was sticking out of one side. It was a bit too short and didn't feel so big and comfy on the inside. What I liked about it was the entrance way with the shoe place. I also liked the ceiling net where we put light, fan and small things. Very helpful \"shelve\". It's also light and easy to build.",

I have done a lot of camping and I have never had such a struggle to get the pole in the final pocket. It seems to be good quality. I like that there is a small overhang over the door.

The Alpine includes such features as a three-pole pentadome design that creates a vestibule for gear storage and weather protection, a shock-corded fiberglass frame (with pole pockets) that sets up and disassembles quickly, and an integrated mud mat with a drainage strip to keep the tent clean. Campers will also appreciate the Weather Armor polyester fabric and sonic-sealed polyethylene tub-style floor, which are reliably rugged and resist leaks of all kinds. The closeable mesh windows and D-style front door, meanwhile, do a nice job of ventilating the tent and controlling morning moisture. Additional details include double-stitched seams, a gear loft for smaller items, a hanging pocket, and a duffel bag for storage. \n\n Specifications\n\n * Base: 8.5 by 8 feet \n * Center height: 48 inches \n * Interior space: 49 square feet \n * Sleeps: 3 \n * Windows 2 \n * Door: Dutch D-style \n * Floor: Welded polyethylene \n * Frame: Fiberglass \n * Carrying weight: 8 pounds \n\n Amazon.com Tent Guide \nSelecting a Tent\nFortunately, there are all kinds of tents for weekend car campers, Everest expeditions, and everything in-between. Here are a few things to keep in mind: \n\n Expect the Worst\nIn general, it's wise to choose a tent that's designed to withstand the worst possible conditions you think you'll face. For instance, if you're a summer car camper in a region where weather is predictable, an inexpensive family or all-purpose tent will likely do the trick--especially if a vehicle is nearby and you can make a mad dash for safety when bad weather swoops in. If you're a backpacker, alpine climber, or bike explorer, or if you like to car camp in all seasons, you'll want to buy something designed to handle more adversity. \n\n Three- and Four-Season Tents\nFor summer, early fall, and late spring outings, choose a three-season tent. At minimum, a quality three-season tent will have lightweight aluminum poles, a reinforced floor, durable stitching, and a quality rain fly. Some three-season tents offer more open-air netting and are specifically designed for summer backpacking or other activities. Many premium tents will also feature pre-sealed, taped seams and a silicone-impregnated rain fly for enhanced waterproofing. \n\n For winter camping or alpine travel, go with a four-season model. Because they typically feature more durable fabric coatings, as well as more poles, four-season tents are designed to handle heavy snowfall and high winds without collapsing. Of course, four-season tents exact a weight penalty of about 10 to 20 percent in trade for their strength and durability. They also tend to be more expensive. \n\n Domes and Tunnels\nTents are broadly categorized into two types: freestanding, which can stand up on their own, and tents that must be staked down in order to stand upright. Freestanding tents often incorporate a dome-shaped design, and most four-season tents are constructed this way because a dome leaves no flat spots on the outer surface where snow can collect. Domes are also inherently stronger than any other design. Meanwhile, many three-season models employ a modified dome configuration called a tunnel. These are still freestanding, but they require fewer poles than a dome, use less fabric, and typically have a rectangular floorplan that offers less storage space than a dome configuration. Many one and two-person tents are not freestanding, but they make up for it by being lighter. Because they use fewer poles, they can also be quicker to set up than a dome. \n\n Size Matters\nAsk yourself how many people you'd like to fit in your fabric hotel now and in the future. For soloists and minimalists, check out one-person tents. If you're a mega-minimalist, or if you have your eye on doing some big wall climbs, a waterproof-breathable bivy sack is the ticket. Some bivy sacks feature poles and stake points to give you a little more breathing room. Also, if you don't need bug protection and you want to save weight, check out open-air shelters. \n\n Families who plan on car camping in good weather can choose from a wide range of jumbo-sized tents that will accommodate all your little ones with room to spare. A wide range of capacities is available for three- and four-season backpacking and expedition tents. Remember, though, the bigger the tent you buy, the heavier it will be, although it's easy to break up the tent components among several people in your group. It's also helpful to compare the volume and floor-space measurements of models you're considering.",
