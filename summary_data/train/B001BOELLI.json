      "text": "This cake lifter is truly indispensable for me. After I decorate cakes on a turntable I need to transfer them to a plate or cake stand. Prior to getting this cake lifter I was having to use a large spatula, which was an accident waiting to happen because it was neither large nor sturdy enough to safely lift the cake, even though my cake was on a cake board. The cake lifter is strong and comfortable to use and easy to clean. Considering the cost and time involved in making and decorating a cake and the fact that you're usually doing it for a special occasion, this cake lifter in my opinion is worth every penny.",

This is sturdy stainless steel with a nice soft handle of ABS (Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) over TPE (Thermoplastic elastomers) or in less scientific terms plastic and rubberized plastic. It's plenty big enough for a counter full of chopped veggies and is dishwasher safe.",

It\u2019s definitely a necessary tool if your cakes aren\u2019t firm enough to hold with your bare hands or get stuck on the cake boards.",

It has a tapered edge that gives it a sharpness that could probably be enhanced, but it might just make it dangerous. I'm sure it's great for dough cutting, although I have yet to use it for that.",
