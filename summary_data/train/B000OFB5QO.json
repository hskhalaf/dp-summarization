But this does wonders! I never got burnt from this (the few times I burnt was probably from not reapplying sunblock, not from the Maui babe). I have a side by side picture of my sister and I who have very similar skin tones. I used Maui babe all summer and she didn\u2019t and you can definitely see the difference. I will use this forever!",

This is not something you want to put on in public. You stay home, slather it on and go do your thing. If you sweat, its going to drip off brown but its okay because the tan you quickly get is 10/10. Completely worth smelling like BBQ chicken for an hour.",

Also, ABSOLUTELY not a pleasant smell as we hoped would also be a false accusation.

Because it is a bit thick and oily after tanning with the mixture of sweat, I recommend wiping out your tanning bed after use so it doesn't leave residue.

It does smell kinda funky - like a combo of soy sauce and coffee - but it helps me get brown quickly! I use it every time I\u2019m going outside to lay in the sun to get a nice, long lasting and deep tan! I used to use olive oil to tan, but I had to keep applying it every 15 minutes or so because it would soak right in to my skin, but Maui Babe doesn\u2019t soak in, making it superior for tanning!",
