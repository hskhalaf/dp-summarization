The tracks are very imaginative and the music is stellar. The new anti-gravity feature really is worked in fantastically, making for some unique viewpoints and course design.",

The graphics look cleaner, the gameplay feels more intense, the character rosters are all fantastic, and the unlockables are larger than before. The multiplayer stays true to its roots, and the online play is lag-free and spectacular. As of this time, the additional DLC is phenomenal and worthy for its good price. This iteration is among the best racing game for the Wii U. It is a highly recommended to pick up and play if you are a Wii U owner.",

My only gripe is that the character/kart selection screen is poorly designed. There are too many options and choosing between items when there are many with the same effect is annoying and frustrating. It does not encourage switching out and trying different things - I find myself wrestling a bit to try to get a build that I like and then resigning to playing that build until I can't progress further. It's a small problem with an otherwise excellent game, but Nintendo tends to get those points right.",

The higher difficulties (150CC-200CC) provide a challenge even for someone that might consider themselves a pro gamer. I would say the difficulties are very well balanced so that anyone can play, I highly recommend it to anyone wanting a fun game!",

For the more serious player, as they race and finish in first place across a number of tracks, new tracks are opened up. There's lots to keep everyone entertained and the graphics are really pretty good, with a lot going on, but not so cluttered as to confuse people.

The DLC adds fun new courses, characters, and karts as well from Nintendo's popular Zelda and Animal Crossing franchises, both of which are presented very well in the game. There's also a 200 cc mode that downloads for free after installation, which is insanely hectic but really fun as well. My only complaint would be the lack of additional modes, since there is only Balloon Battle and not the Coin Battle that came with several previous games; the courses for Balloon Battle are also very limited and not that great in my opinion.",

The main thing i love about this version is that it has upgraded a few tracks from some of the older generation mario karts. The balance seems pretty smooth so far, not like some of the rediculous cheating it did back in the 64 days, lol. This game deserves a spot on the shelf for your home collection!",

Mario Kart 8 is a complete game changer. You don't have to be a professional to have fun with this game (that doesn't mean you'll always win, but you will have fun). I built my skill up to finally unlock the golden tires, and am close (2 grand prix's away from earning the gold kart). Overall I've been excited for Nintendo's line-up of Super Smash Bros. Next and Legend of Zelda Wii-U; but Mario Kart 8 made the wait bearable.",

The only other red game case I can think of at this time is Super Mario 3D World and this only applies to select copies.",

Some small things that may be off-putting to buyers is that two player split screen is always portrait view, some characters are repetitive like 5+ baby versions of the characters, and the interface in game does not show a mini map anymore. BUT blue shell can be countered with the new horn item so less friendships are now ruined because of this game.",
