We paid $11. It was totally worth it. It was a little smaller than expepected, but that wasn't a problem. Generic Preemie diapers do still fit, so you do NOT have to keep paying for Baby Alive diapers. The wings come off and the face paint is subtle. She has two other dolls that drink and wet-- a \"Water Baby\" and a \"Baby Born\". Both were way more expensive and both LEAK! This one doesn't leak at all!",

Fill her wand with ice cold water and drag it along her face like a paint brush to reveal a beautiful design -- it looks like face paint! Wipe her face with a warm hand and her face paint magically disappears to repeat the reveal play again and again. She drinks her bottle -- fill it up with water to feed her. After her bottle, she wets! Mommies and daddies can clean her up and change her diaper. Her enchanting dress comes with detachable fairy wings for dress-up and fantasy play, making mommy and daddy moments with the Face Paint Fairy doll magical, too!
