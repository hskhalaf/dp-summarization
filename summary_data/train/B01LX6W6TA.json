      "text": "Overall this bag is great. That being said, all the zippers and sewing seem to be high quality yet they've used plastic hooks for the shoulder straps. 1 year in and one of them has broken rendering the bag useless for the way I use it, which is daily. I travel frequently and don't intend to carry it like a briefcase. Pretty disappointed after spending over $100 and only getting a year from it. I've spent less and gotten years of service from other laptop computer bags. I give it 3 stars because other than this quality issue it's a great bag and well constructed. Still puzzled about the cheap plastic considering the way the rest was constructed.",

I really like the bag - the look, size, pockets, ability to stow the backpack straps, etc. My only complaint (until now) has been that the zippered water bottle pocket is not well designed, as it does not zip and unzip easily (it\u2019s a chore). Consequently, I don\u2019t use it often. Last week I opened it up to use and noticed the webbing coming apart. ;-( Since I bought it through Amazon and not E-Bags directly, I don\u2019t know how to get a replacement. Thoughts???",

The front pocket, with all its zippered pouches is great because you can easily see what is there.

Easily fits under the seat but is sturdy enough that I felt OK putting it in the overhead bin.",

      "title": "Great backpack for college",
      "text": "This is great for college students needing to lug around a laptop for class or those who travel a lot and need to be able to quickly remove their laptop while going through security. It is fairly spacious with more than enough pockets for all of the little odds and ends that you may need, e.g. pencils, erasers, charging cords, etc. My only real complaints are that the main pocket is a little smaller than I had originally expected, I can only fit about four or so standard-sized spiral bound notebooks in there and that the external zippered pocket for holding a drink container is not very expandable.",

      "text": "If you want a thin, quick trip travel bag, this is probably great for you. I work in IT and thought the front organization would be amazing. And it is. But the more you put in the front pocket, the more this main pocket shrinks. To the point where the top or the main compartment can't hold much more than a shirt or two with the front pocket packed with cables, mouse, external hard drive, ect. The quality and durability of the pack seems good. But if you actually want to load it up, look elsewhere. It could use a Velcro strap on the laptop pocket as well, but that's a minor concern.",

And it\u2019s big enough that I can fit everything I need in it but not overly bulky. Great design, great backpack.",
