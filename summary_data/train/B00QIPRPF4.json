I do love the red neon lighted keyboard aswell. Would definitely recommend",

I had an issue with the windows 8 because it was new to me but Cyberfang customer support were great and responded immediately to my query which is good. I would definitely recommend this laptop for gaming if you look after your tech.",

The GTX 860M graphics card does its job in bringing you the best graphics and performance for playing games on such a subtle, beautiful laptop. NOTE: There is a cooling fan button on the very top left of the keyboard above the ESC key and I would advise using it when playing high performance games. The internal fan booster does a decent job as long as you turn it on as soon as you start up a game but I would recommend buying a seperate cooling fan in aid of this which you can attatch to the side vent just to be safe.",
