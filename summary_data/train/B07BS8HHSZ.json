So far this little reel has performed well with twenty pound braid on it. It is light and well balanced on my Browning rod. For the price this reel has satisfied my needs here so far. I will by this product again.",

I hooked a very big fish and the drag was solid. Too bad the fish wrapped up in the Powerpole and the line broke. I was using 15# line. I'm going to respool with 20# line next time I go out.",
