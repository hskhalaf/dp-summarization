It hasn't poked through the fabric yet, but based on how it looks and the location, I think it's just a matter of time until it rips thru.",

One tip I can give is to have an electronic drill handy because you will need to attach the feet but easy to do. Also, you will need two people to carry it into your house. It comes in 3 parts that are each pretty big. Just telling you so you're prepared, I'm not complaining in any way! I love it so much!",

      "text": "I bought my Jessa Place sectional directly from Ashley Furniture, the chocolate color. It goes very well with my beige carpet. It's very comfortable and decent looking. One of the sears sinks in lower than expected when you sit on it, but I'm okay with that. I love my purchase and I think I got it at a reasonable price. (I paid $999 + delivery)",
