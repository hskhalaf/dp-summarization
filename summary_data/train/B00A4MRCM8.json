To use this on salad, as was recommended, is a waste AND too sweet; probably better with bread on a sandwich, though Costco's brand will do fine at that as well. We are not Costco members - friends pick a few bottles up for us every year - so no reason to shill for Costco! Amazon prices normally the best; in this case, shouldn't even bother offering this product. Highway robbery.",
