This fan is weak, loud, and worst of all, expensive. It claims to circulate air around even a large room. But it doesn't, at all. It creates a weak breeze in a small room. It's fine if its blowing directly at you, but it doesn't impact the rest of the room or help cool it. Given how weak its air flow is, it makes an astounding amount of noise. Enough that I had to increase the TV volume by a significant amount. I will likely return this purchase, and would not recommend it to others.",

High settings provides a lot of air, and can get a little noisy. It also looks nice and performs well smoothly. These fans have a good warranty, and I don't expect any major issues.",

This one and the last one I bought...the housing over the blades comes off constantly! The plastic prongs holding it together break too easily. Super dangerous. Will not buy again.",

Great for small room but I found I have to have it directly on me to feel the affect I want out of it. There are 3 settings and all are kinda loud but not annoying. Don't expect to be able to hear the TV on the med or high setting. I use daily and sleep fine with it on.",

I can't speak to the longevity as of yet, but the fan seems very durable, though with the all-plastic construction, it's kind of cheap feeling. However, it does the intended job, pushes a lot of air. Very neutral sound on low setting, medium makes a bit of noise, though I can still sleep through it, and high power makes a bedroom feel like it's in the middle of a wind tunnel.",
