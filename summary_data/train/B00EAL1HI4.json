I went on a fishing trip recently and this knife did everything I was looking for it to do. It comes super sharp and ready to fillet any fish. Compared to other Morakniv knives, this was a bit more pricey, but as a brand-loyal shopper, it was more than justified to purchase this fillet knife. I will provide updates as I continue to use this knife, but so far, so good. Morakniv is definitely the budget/high enough quality knife for me.",

The difference between the real Swedish steel and so called steel fillet knife made in China was immediately visible. This is a really sharp fillet knife made in Sweden with Swedish steel. Works like a charm. Will update about durability, but as of now fantastic. Highly recommend.",

When I'm done, I just run the blade across a steel a few times and it's ready for the next time. I didn't think I'd like the plastic sheath but it totally makes sense. It dosen't trap water in it causing problems. It lets water drain out while protecting the blade when I pack it in my backpack.",

    "description": "Morakniv Fishing Comfort Fillet knives are available in either a versatile 6.1-inch length for cleaning and filleting most sizes of fish or in a 3.5-inch length for removing bones and for smaller pan fish. Both Morakniv Fishing Comfort Fillet knife options come with patterned, high-friction grip handles that allow users to maintain a steady grip even when slimy from cleaning fish. The plastic sheath is simple, rugged, cleans easily, and it does not absorb odors. The 6.1-inch knife comes with two interchangeable belt clips so that users can either clip to or loop it through a belt. The sheath on the 3.5-inch knife includes a single belt clip. The Sandvik 12C27 stainless steel used for Morakniv fillet knives is known for its razor sharpness, high hardness, exceptional toughness, and excellent corrosion resistance. Morakniv has been manufacturing the highest-quality knives in Mora, Sweden since 1891. Professionals worldwide trust the quality materials and fine craftsmanship of Morakniv knives.
