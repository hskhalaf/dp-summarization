Polarized lenses are vivid and clear even in inclimate rainy weather. Big plus on long interstate drives and daily commute.",

Honestly could not tell if they were glass or plastic, but just had to take the manufacturer's word for it. Oddly, the more expensive Ray Ban polarized glasses (in to 200-300 range) feel much heftier and the glass looks and feels thicker. But seriously, for over 100 bucks, I expect better.",
