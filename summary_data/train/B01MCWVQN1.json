I'm talking enough for two kids. That's like 10 diapers, two change of clothes for each, pacifiers, toys, wipes (10 million count) no typo, changing mats, bottles, ice packs, flame thrower, spare tire (although she doesn't know how to change one), snacks (enough to feed a small army) first aid kit, and poop bags. I might have forgot like 20 things so you will have to excuse me.",

I can easily fit 6-8 pocket diapers in the main section, which is plenty for a day trip. We also took it on a trip across the country and it worked as a great carry on, fitting plenty of snacks, toys, and outfits for the long flight.",

Gender neutral coloring also made this a good choice for my wife and I. However, giving this 3 stars because shortly after use, maybe about less than 3 months in, one of the stroller straps started fraying, pictures attached. It has held up so far but looks like it can go at any time.",

It has a bunch of pockets for stashing all the essentials for traveling around with tiny people. We live in the city and take public transportation, so fair warning, if you fill the bag, you will not be popular on a busy train. It does stick out quite a bit when full.",

There is plenty of room for changing items- diapers, wipes, pad, extra clothes. It has plenty of pockets for extras too likr snacks for my older son, pacifiers, wallet, keys etc... I have had no problems with zippers or quality of the bag. We have been using it for 6 weeks now.",

I didn't intend to use it daily, but it's so functional that I haven't switched back to my very expensive designer diaper bag. Highly recommend this bag. The overall scoop - large, comfortable to carry, lots of compartments, water resistant fabric, plenty of separation for cold stuff/wet stuff to stay away from clean stuff. LOTS of pockets and zipper pouches. Great price. So glad I read other reviews and chose this bag!",
