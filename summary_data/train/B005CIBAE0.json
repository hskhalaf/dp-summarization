Most yeasts have a shelf life of about 6-8 months. This yeast was already 10 months old. I even tried after 24 hrs with original must to make a yeast starter. I added it and still no fermentation. It's been well over a week now and nothing. My fruit is wasted and must go in the trash. The kit itself is a good starter kit, but I should have known that these kits could possibly sit on a shelf for some time. I will start anew with fresh yeast and new fruit.",

It would be nice also if the tube had a few more inches long, it is very short to go from a table to the floor. But overall I am very happy. Oh and try the banana wine, it is just awesome!",

      "text": "Pretty much a waste of money. Syphon doesn't work. About got drunk trying to make it work. My husband said it needs a check valve. Talks about SG testing in recipe, but doesn't include a tester. Pretty disapointed. Lots of money for a plastic bucket, glass bottle, yeast and a few other chemicles.",
