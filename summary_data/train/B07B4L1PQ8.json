      "text": "I really admire Sony for releasing such a product which, even though is marketed as a basic camera, it has more features than some of the competition's pro cameras. One might think that Sony is not all about profit, like most companies are, and actually gives a damn about its clients. Sure, its menu system is a bit all over the place, but if you spend the time in the beginning to customize it to match your needs, then you don't ever need to go through the menu again. I love it and I highly recommend it!",
