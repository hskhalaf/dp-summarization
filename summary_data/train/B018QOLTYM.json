I even used it to grate cold butter over a cooked dish to make it melt faster and more evenly, that was fun, but not fun to clean. Just run really hot water over it, both sides, don't even think of trying to use your kitchen brush to get the bits out. It will eat it. Don't use your fingers either. get a tooth pick or a skewer if something doesn't rinse out.",

The reason I am giving a four star is the curve design along the edges of this thin long grater. It ends up housing lots of the grated food, you end up poking out. So for my ginger I tend to use the larger grater, and for a quick grate on the pot, I use this thin versatile long one. Having said that, I would highly recommend getting both graters, they are super sharp, like of which you rarely can find.",

Since my favorite one hasn't shown up yet, I'll continue to use this one. It's not bad, I'm just used to something a little different.",

You have to keep rotating the fruit to keep it even. But be careful because I zested my finger the 1st time I used it. Keep those fingers out of the way!",
