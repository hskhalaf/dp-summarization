They told me that based on the purchase date, they would give me one session of courtesy support, but after that they tried to sell me a new router to replace my old, out of warranty one! Save yourself problems and don't buy something that comes out of the box expired!!",

      "text": "This router is great. I won't go into the gritty details as other already have, however I previously had the E3000, and I tried both this and the Netgear N900 and for my money this Linksys wins hands down. I have my Xbox hard wired to the router, and my desktop connected wirelessly I frequently stream content from my desktop with no problems using this router. With the other 2 routers mentioned, the quality is spotty at best.",

With cell phones, game systems, laptops, etc all hooked up wirelessly in my house, the old router just couldn't keep up and had to be replaced. I am not a very serious gamer or anything but I do like having a decent wireless connection without having cords strung around my house. This router did the trick. I can still play games and other things at a much better connection speed without losing packets and games freezing. I am pleased so far with this router and the only knock I have on it is the high price.",
