This was a wonderful experience for the children and a great way for them to see the life cycle of butterflies for themselves. We will definitely be purchasing more caterpillars next year because we have decided to make this a summer tradition!",

So incredibly simple, they arrive in their food. They build some webs and then climb to the top of container lid to hang as chrysalis.

Update: we had a 100% success rate with our caterpillars! All of them became butterflies and we set them free today! My kids absolutely Loved caring for them. One thing that\u2019s not mentioned in the instructions, that we found on the web, is to spray the chrysalis with water twice a day to prevent dehydration. So we did that. After all, in the wild they do get exposed to rain and dew. It was so much fun! We are ordering more caterpillars! \ud83d\udc1b \ud83d\udd1c\ud83e\udd8b",

I quickly realized how much I looked forward seeing these insects daily. It was something that my husband and I really enjoyed. I documented most days with a video movie for the students and it turned out great. Most of all though I had never seen this before and I was awestruck by nature and the miracle that these caterpillars to butterflies transformed right before my eyes. I really recommend this for classrooms or as gifts to the insect or nature lover.",

The whole process is kind of gross and messy, but that\u2019s no big deal. Nothing that you\u2019ll have to clean up. Letting them go and having them sit on our hands for a while was the best part. I would suggest that you have fresh flowers to feed them when they emerge from their cocoons. Mine wanted nothing to do with the plastic flower sponge and homemade nectar, but they were very into the daisies offered them.",

When we let them go they unfortunately quickly flew away and did not linger, but our son had fun seeing them off anyway.

Bought this to keep learning fun for my 4 year old now that school is out. So worth it. Every single caterpillar lived. I definitely wasn't sure at first, but now, 3 days later I can see the tremendous growth. I honestly can't stop watching them wiggle around. They haven't turned into butterfly's just yet, but like I said it's only a few days. Worth buying! Highly recommend!",
