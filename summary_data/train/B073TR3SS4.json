The material on these is not only substantially thinner (such that cold rooms still feel quite risky), the fact that the nipple portion has no adhesive makes them feel generally more precarious. I originally thought this was a good design feature, but in retrospect I'm realizing it means these will simply lose their stickiness sooner. Finally, quite disappointed that the carrying case is such a tight squeeze. Seems like it would have been simple to make it just a centimeter wider in diameter.",

One of the flower shaped petals had a lump in it. Like it was made as one of those tumor/lump demo products for cancer awareness. You can see the lump through clothing. Plain as day.

They stick during a 1 hour HIIT workout without any issues. I remove them slowly as some people said they pulled skin but I haven't found that to be true. I wear each shape (flower or circle)at least twice a week (4 workouts/week) and have had them for a couple weeks now and I have not noticed the stickiness coming off. I would highly suggest purchase. There is no lift to these - just plain ol nipples covers so don't expect lift.",

At least then the shape would look natural. I have not worn them again since that first time.",
