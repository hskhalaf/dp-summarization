It comes unassembled but it is fairly easy to put together. The bigger the wheel the harder it is to learn, but in the end it is far more rewarding and faster and more fun in my opinion. I went with the 28 inch one myself. But be warned if you are not tall you should get a smaller size, I am 6'2\" tall.",

Took me about a week to get the hang of it, but now I can ride as far and as long as my quads will survive. t looks very well put together but it is super tall. I\u2019m 5\u20199\u201d and can\u2019t comfortably reach the pedals with the seat post all the way down. I will have to chop the seat post or get a different size wheel.",

Unfortunately, these parts were the pieces that hold the bottom part of the bearings onto the frame. Those parts are hard to find! Once I found them, the total I spent saved me many moneys. I had to also get a shorter seat post/cut it, because it was way too long (I'm 5'9\"). They large wheel size is very difficult to learn on. Once I got it, this thing is a blast! I highly recommend.",
