Nevertheless, we sterilize our Iphones constantly, the result of Covid-19. Unfortunately, this stopped working within 2 months of use. Amazon immediately replaced - thanks to great customer service. We received this in no time and sterilizing our phones ever day since my husband has to go to his job site. We don't know how we know our phones have been sterilized, but since we put it in the case to be sterilized, we accept the fact that it is. Great little gadget to own and affordable too!",

It is very thin so the only thing that would fit in it is a thin phone and very little else. Not your eyeglasses or mask etc. Be sure to see how deep the one you order is. The plus was that it really was a beautiful color. The other problem was that it was very hard to open. Don't want to break a nail every time I sanitize. It did talk to me with a woman's voice but I found that annoying. I could return it easily with just printing a label so that was good.",

On the questionable side: the new one does not beep when you press the button for sanitizing and it does not not beep when it is finished. Also, sanitizing only take 2 minutes instead of 6 minutes. Do I have a lemon?",
