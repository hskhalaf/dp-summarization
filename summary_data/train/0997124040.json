      "text": "We love these! My husband speaks French only with our kids and I was looking for a way to help our 7yo start reading French and to expand our 19mo's vocab. These were perfect on both counts. Only complaint is at $25 was a little pricey for paperback but the quality is there in another way I suppose.",

      "text": "It has been fun to use these to learn a bit of French with my children as we study France together. The pictures and books are nice, and I am thankful for the site where you can read along with an actual French speaker so that you don\u2019t have to guess what the pronunciation is like. Warning, however, sometimes you will hear a word said one way by one reader, then another way by another reader. I think it\u2019s a matter of accent, though. Like City girl vs. Country girl, if you know what I mean. Same language, different intonations.",

I like how each book cover has the translation for the main words you'll be reading along with the translation per page. The only reason I removed a star is because one of our books has the wrong book cover attached so the translations don't match up with the story. That was disappointing. I would like to have this corrected so my little one can have the translations attached to the book.",
