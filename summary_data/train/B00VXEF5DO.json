      "text": "An all-over good brace for wrist tendonitis. It provides for hand flexibility when playing various musical instruments. I am placing a second order to have extra on hand (no pun intended). While the wrist velcro is massive the palm strap velcro is much smaller and can wear out from overuse. I learned that it's best to use the palm strap only for adjustment and insert/remove the hand using just the wrist strap.",

You can use it with our without the metal support and the support can be adjusted to meet your needs. I have a big wrist and it fits well and can be adjusted as needed. The thumb hole is comfortable, no complaints and I am considering a second one to use when this one is washed.",

The wrist can feel slightly sweaty when you take the brace off, hence the four starts rather than five. A nice breathable lining would help tremendously.",

It smells like sweat and it has my wrist smelling as well. I thought it would be something like the waist belt I use when working out, but that doesn't smell like this wrist brace does. If you purchase, be sure to wash your wrist really good or else it will continue to smell after removing the brace.",
