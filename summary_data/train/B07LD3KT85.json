It\u2019s still a little crooked, but I haven\u2019t got the energy to do it again! \ud83e\udd23 Highly recommended, just make sure you\u2019re ready to put some sweat equity into installing it if you have a larger steering wheel.",

Even so, it took me some time to get it on the wheel. It's was a tight fit, which is a good thing in a steering wheel cover, in my opinion. Otherwise, it looks great! Comfort wise, I found the seams from the pattern on the cover bothersome at first, but don't notice it too much now. All in all, I'm happy I bought it.",
