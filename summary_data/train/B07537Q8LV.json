I had the evo 212 and I would overclock my i7-4790k to 4.5mhz/ 1.23v and the temp would range between 68c to 80c. Now, my temperature don't even get past 60c at full load when idle it hits as low as 27c. I didn't go with the corsair for two reason, price and I've had a bad experience with their H100i. The installation is quite simple, it does come with a installation guide, which is very helpful even for beginners. The only bad thing I can say about this product is the logo on it, looks a bit unattractive.",

The construction and material workmanship leave nothing to be desired, just outstanding. Nearly all of the cables have a premium rubber coated sleeve for protection against abrasion. And the rubber hoses between the pump and rad are sleeved with quality braiding. Fans and pump are quiet, effective as well keeping my FX6300 at 18c idle/ 34c maxed. This is the same result achieved using a Hyper212 Evo air cooler. Two annoyances. Fans use proprietary connectors that resemble usb2 headers. The software to control everything is lacking refinement, compared to Corsair's implementation anyway.",

Cons: One observation that I have, al;so first one by my client too, can we see the liquid in the tubes :( So I will suggest Thermaltak to make the tubes maybe longer, transparent, and would be killer, if we could add our choice of color dye to it. I know this is why they stayed away from transparent in the first place, but, come on guys, do it",

After unplugging the culprit fan which LEDs has burned out, everything works well and the controller did not heat up dangerously again. I plan to replace the fan, as it will be much easier than replacing the whole system, but now the new PC I built isn\u2019t quite as perfect as I had hoped with the defective fan and the melted controller.",

      "text": "Good priced product with quality material. Bought 2 for same kind of pc build. Works well. I love cooking fans with good app. Fan does not make noise but pump make weired noise. One is more than the other one. So it is all by your luck. I may listen more noise because I use open case. Pipes(hoses) between pump(cpu) and cooler(fan) is pretty short. So you need to measure length before installation. That is y I took off one star. But as you use regular case. It is great AOI cooler.",
