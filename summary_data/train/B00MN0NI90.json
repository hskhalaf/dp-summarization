The buttons almost sense when your finger is close and upon the slightest touch, the numbers on the scale fluctuate wildly. To have any confidence in the actual weight I have the urge to re-measure everything more than twice. When resetting the weight (of say a bowl), it's difficult to know if your finger changed the weight that was measured or not. The unfortunate placement of the unit selector is also a major detraction. If you're completely broke and need something that'll get you close - this one is for you. If you want accuracy and confidence in what you're measuring, stay away.",

I've noticed within the last week there was a slight glitch here and there but I thought it was just me due to rushing in the mornings. Only reason im giving two stars is.because after turning it off for for a couple mins it was fine again.
