I don't use any gloves or hand wraps but Bob is well padded and much easier on my hands than my old canvas and leather bags. I highly recommend Bob XL for a great punching and striking workout. Just remember, it's not like a real fight. Bob doesn't punch back...",

One down thing is that it cannot stand judo entries. I put a gi on it and it feels good to practice, but puling the sleeves put a lot of torque on the rubber part that is only attached to the axis with few screws. Youll rip them off with regular practice. That was a big disappointment because being able to do entries would be a big extra to the intended use",

I do have to pull BOB back to center after each round since the unit does inch backward with each straight power punch and rotates slightly with each hook. Any floor based unit will have this action but only BOB simulates a real human target. Jab, cross, hooks head and body, uppercuts chin and body, overhand right to head and shovel hook to jaw, neck or ribs are all realistic. I'm very happy with this purchase.",

I would give 5 stars except, as with most of these, filling with sand makes drainage tedious, and filling with water leaves enough room for slight movement when you get into a strong body-shot rhythm.",

Another review on here suggested wearing gloves, Very good advice . A very good product overall !",

    "description": "Get realistic training with BOB, the Body Opponent Bag. BOB XL has a longer torso than the original BOB, giving you more striking surface for body shots and kicks. Base fills with water or sand and is rounded for easy relocation.\n\nHave you ever seen a more punchable face? Probably not, since you\u2019ve seen this face get punched, kicked, shot, and stabbed on any number of movies and TV shows. John Wick uses it to home his wetwork and the heroes of the Arrowverse have tested their superpowered might against it. BOB is everywhere.\n\nBOB is resilient and reliable. A training partner that\u2019s always there and can take it on the chin. Literally. A heavy bag will do wonders for your workout, but sometimes you need to know that your cross will land where it needs to. That your uppercut is accurate. That your shots to the ribs hit hard and are well placed.\n\nBOB\u2019s versatility is fully realized as the quintessential freestanding system. Move it around the gym or keep one in the garage. Any environment, BOB\u2019s available. Plus, he\u2019s a good listener.\n\nFeatures height adjustments from 60 inches to 82 inches tall.\nMannequin - 40\" x 15.5\" x 10.5\" \nBase - 24\" Diameter x 19.5\" Tall\nApprox. 270 lbs. when filled with water\n\nAMAZON.COM\nWork the entire upper body with the extra-large Century Body Opponent freestanding heavy bag. Unlike most heavy bags, the Body Opponent looks like an actual person, with a life-like face, shoulders, chest, and stomach. As a result, it's easier than ever to get motivated for your sparring session, with a long torso creating more striking surface for body shot training. The bag is made of high-strength plastisol filled with urethane foam, making it extremely durable over time. It's also stable, with a polyethylene base that fills with approximately 270 pounds of sand or water. Despite the weight, you can still move the bag fairly easily by flipping it to the side and rolling the round base. Equipped with multiple height settings, the Body Opponent bag is ideal for home, apartment, school, or gym use.",
