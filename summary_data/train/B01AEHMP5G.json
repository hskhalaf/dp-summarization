I took this carryon to Asia and 5 business trips in US, so far no problem. I bought the white color, so far little scuff marks here and there, I was able to wipe it off. What sold me was the front zip pocket for easy access documents and iPad etc.. this would have been even better if it could expand. I hope one day they will come out with the expendable version, even higher cost I would totally buy it again.",

I also used the front for my laptop. Held everything perfectly!!! If you're having second thoughts, you should definitely buy it.

The best has been when the flight attendant said, \"That case is too big, it won't fit overhead.\"...and then it fits, to which she replied, \"Wow!

After trying several hard cases, this one was definitely the best. It is super sturdy, the locking mechanism is great - you don't have to zip a big long zipper all along the outside of the case. And the laptop pocket is roomy enough for my 13\" Macbook and an ipad. Also plenty of organizers and belting inside the case to keep all your clothes tidy. Very thoughtfully made. I'm getting 2 more like this, so our family can have a matching set!",
