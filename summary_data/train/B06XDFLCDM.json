So lightweight, but has a strong enough fan speed to make it worthwhile. I\u2019m giving it 5 stars because it\u2019s exactly as the description says. One of the best purchases I've made! Would definitely buy again or recommend to a friend.",

It's quiet and small, but puts out some good airflow. The light is perfect for a night light. I love the portability of the fan. Super convenient, lightweight, and functional - battery life is alright. Thanks for a great product.",

      "text": "We love the solar fan. We have a cabin that occasionally loses power in the summer and to have something that can cool us down a bit was a must have. This is a great addition to other backup power products we have up there. It's small and light enough that I take it with me when we go camping as well. The flashlight is great but we really like the ring of LEDs. Put that up on the camping table and family dinners are no longer a battle of headlamps and the fan can deter bugs that might be interested in your food. We will see how it performs over time but we are very happy with it.",

      "text": "I bought this for being outdoors in the summer. I was disappointed that the fan isn't as strong as I'd hoped, and it's fairly noisy. I haven't figured out how to get the radio to work since there's no tuner. I haven't tried an MP3 yet. The lights work fine. The instructions were obviously written by someone whose native language is not English, but one can get the gist. I did have to figure out on my own that to operate any part of this, you have to push the power button that's down by the radio; wasn't obvious that it applied to the whole device.",
