I use it for twist out and my everyday styling needs. As I started earlier I have 4c hair. I use to apply oils and hair grease to moisturize my hair. My hair was oily, but not hydrated. Sometimes my hair would still feel hard despite all the oils and hair grease. But with better braids my hair feels so soft and It brings out my curl pattern. My hair has grown since I started using the product this way.",

I use it and I don't even wear braids just to freshen up my hair and give it a nice sheen. Love this product and will continue to use it always. I have tried other products that just seem to ruin my hair, but as soon as I use this again it's like my hair says, \"YES, THANK YOU\"! I would recommend this to anyone who is natural, texlaxed, or transitioning. It will be your hairs best friend.",
