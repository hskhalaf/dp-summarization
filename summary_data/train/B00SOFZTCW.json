There is a mechanism under the jaw area that makes pre-recorded Wookie sounds when you speak or move your jaw. The eyes are not shielded like the Kylo Ren mask, but there is a rubber nose rest that helps keep the mask secure and in place during use. The included batteries (2x AAA 1.5v Duracell alkaline) are cleverly hidden behind an easily accessible plastic panel at the top of the mask (only a Phillip's Screwdriver required to change them).",

It probably fits a five years old the most. If anyone older tries to wear it, it will cut either the chin or the forehead (your choice) due to its small size. I would have given it a five stars if it is bigger. Or, just avoid buying it knowing it is for very small children.",

It is a cool mask with good sound effects, but my son was unable to make it work while wearing it. The sound functions when the person wearing it moves their chin by opening their mouth. Adjusting it to the smallest setting, the distance from the top of his head to his chin was not long enough to enable him to operate the mask to make noise. Cool mask but I would say ages 8 and up is more appropriate for functionality.",

One downside is that it does not fit all heads like mine. I had to take out the chin guard in the mouth and even then it was a little too small. But that's nothing a few pieces of foam can't fix. It did fit my younger sister's face which is much smaller than mine though. So if you have a taller head then expect to do a bit of modification to it. But if not this still makes a great addition to any Star Wars collection.",

It's a little small so it probably fits better on children without much discomfort. It would be great if they made different sizes. The length between the eye holes and mouth are fixed so for some with longer faces would be uncomfortable.",
