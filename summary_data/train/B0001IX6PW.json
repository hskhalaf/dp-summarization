Perfect for opening canning jars without punching a hole in the lid with a pointed opener. Even though you are not to re-can with a used lid, if the lids are not damaged they can still be used with a vac. seal. This handy device helps with that. Also works well with Weck plastic lids for Weck glass canning jars. I love this thing!!!",
