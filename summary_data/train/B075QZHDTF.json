After conditioning it several times, she used it to chop cabbage, and the wood looked horrible after just one use, not to mention it also splintered and a chunk peeled off. That is utterly ridiculous, as we have had incredibly cheap cutting boards for years, and this has never happened. EDIT: 1/25/19 The sellers contacted me, very apologetic that we had this experience, and were gracious enough to explain that it may have just been that particular piece of wood and gave us the opportunity to try out another board, which ended up being great quality and exactly what we needed.",

On a similar note, the board is exceptionally easy to clean. Food just slides right off it when I run water over. Much better than my other wood boards. Since it's all one piece (no metal handles on the side), it should also be less prone to cracking over time at the handle insertion point (since there is none), unless some of my other boards.",
