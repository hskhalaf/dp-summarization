However, I wouldn't put too many items in it, my clasp broke off that evening, which could have been a result of me over-stuffing the purse. I reached out to the company about it asking if there was any way they could fix it for me since I just purchased it. Their customer service was top notch! Responded right away and took care of the issue for me. It seems like more and more venues are beginning to require clear bags at events, so I highly suggest grabbing this one.",

Plus, I bought a t-shirt at the concert for which I purchased the bag, and there was room for me to store the shirt (rolling it up, of course.) I also got several compliments from people and one of the security girls fell in love with the bag, asking where she could get one, too.",
