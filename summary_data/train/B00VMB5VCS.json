As an adult I can connect more to the movies/tv licences that Lego brings to the table as oppose to Disney more kid focus themes.

I like that they are adding level packs so you can keep going in the game with nothing but expansions in sight I think it was a great investment. I love the Lego video games and I think this is definitely my favorite because I can expand it so easily and get way more playtime out of it.",

Disney Infinity 3.0 (sold it off on ebay. just no fun) So, if you're new to toys to life products, go with Lego Dimensions or Skylanders Superchargers. The latter maybe more appropriate for younger kids than Lego Dimensions. My suggestion would be age 5~9 (Skylanders) and age 7~99 (Lego Dimensions).",

I had the luck of finding it on a convenient sale. The game does have its problems, but most of them involve actual building (specially fear for lost parts). Once that bump is over, the game is magnificent. The story is really good at involving all different franchises and offering an introduction to all of them. Playing this is actually quite fun, and famous franchises (eg. The Simpsons, or Doctor Who) have their own references to the actual series that people can enjoy regardless of the age.",
