E recipes emailed. Made some basic white bread and tossed the cornmeal inside to do final proofing. After proofing stenciled with white flour and baked. The only thing I would've done differently, put the seam of the bread on side, dust with cocoa powder (sellers advice) and brush off the cornmeal (excess took away from the decoration stencil) Thank you for this new chapter in my bread making journey.",

So light due to being made with wood reed, it has a liner too which hangs just above the bottom of the bowl.Now i feel like a pro! i used a very sticky dough to test it out with some oil spray and a good dusting with brown rise flour. The dough fell out so easily i almost dropped it. The rings of flour on the loaf looked fantastic. Well worth the investment! I took a loaf to friends dinner party last night, it was the talk of the meal, with everyone taking pictures of it!!!",

My daughter-in-law asked for the Romertopf roaster and I was thrilled to oblige as she will shyly ask for things for her children but never for her. So when she requested this clay baking pot, I knew she really wanted it. This review is based mostly on what she told me after getting her Romertopf. She's enjoyed using these accessories with her Romertopf, depending on the recipe. I'm not sure they'd be useful with any other kind of roasting pan. The food the Romertopf produces is delicious, and the accessories make cooking with it easier.",

As a note of caution for novice bread makers like me who hadn\u2019t a clue what a lame was. I thought it was an item for scraping gooey dough off one\u2019s fingers. So, be very careful when opening it and get your fingers well out of the way! As a side note, this seller provides excellent, prompt, and caring customer service. I highly recommend them and their products!",

Just fyi--I saw a similar basket of the same size and composition but without the cover, stencils, or e-book at Sur La Table for $35.

I also liked the way it does wick out any excess moisture from the dough while proofing, something that a nonporous bowl will not do. I have not used the dinner since I prefer the markings that the basket leaves on the bread. Don't wash it; just shake out the excess flour and store it. A valuable tool for bread making, and I would highly recommend this product.",

The linen liner is a great touch to stop dough getting stuck (along with a sprinkling of flour of course). The linen liner is made out of a linen that is finer than my much older couche and does it's job admirably. If you want top notch and consistent loaves I highly recommend this banneton. The included ebook has some great recipes I'm slowly working through too and the included stencils made for some super cute Christmas breaks and cakes.",
