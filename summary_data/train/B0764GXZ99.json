I was really worried that it\u2019d be too big, but it\u2019s close to the size of a jansport which is a relief. It has 2 pockets, but lots of space for little things as well. The side pockets aren\u2019t as generous as I thought they\u2019d be. They barely fit my 21oz hydro flask. But overall the backpack is sooo nice and I\u2019ll be using it for a long time.",

I suppose I could buy a tech bag. The large compartment feels like a pit for a travel pillow and blanket plus the MacBook Pro and iPad you are traveling with.

I was also very surprised at how well fitting the bag was. At 6'5\" and 325 pounds it's not easy finding bags that don't look 8 sizes too small, or that have straps fit for a child.

The colored part of the bag looks lighter in the picture while it's rather dark. The NF logo looks also pretty dark compared to the lighter color in the picture. Everything else looks the same, but I don't know if I like it TBH. I wish the pictures were more reliable in contrast to the real product.",
