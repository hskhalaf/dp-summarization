YES this product is strong that\u2019s why they say use a limited time a week. But it\u2019s good to clean the face, that\u2019s all. It leaves your pores open for to long. You have to sleep on a fresh pillow case/bedding because tour pores are open. And use a great moisturizer after. Because it DEEp cleans tour face good. If you use it everyday you WILL break out",

It\u2019s pricey but I bought five products like this one trying to find one that works and by the time I was done, I\u2019d spent triple what the product that does work costs. Plus a tube of it lasts forever. If you\u2019re specifically looking to reduce the visibility of your pores, don\u2019t waste your money on this product. If you just like the idea of a charcoal cleanser, go for it. I still use it in the shower as a cleanser (since I bought it)",

    "title": "Bior\u00e9 Charcoal Pore Minimizing Skin Polisher, 3.11 Ounce, for Large Pore Treatment on Oily Skin with Natural Micro-crystals for Smoother Skin",
    "description": "Product Description:\n\nThe truth is that clogged pores can magnify their appearance, making them look larger and more noticeable. Luckily for you, Biore Charcoal Pore Minimizer for Oily Skin instantly diminishes the appearance of large pores. With charcoal, known for its abilities to draw out and trap impurities, and natural micro-crystals (fancy for exfoliants), this innovative polisher deep cleans pores and gently sweeps away dead skin cells and debris. When you activate it with water and massage it over your skin for 30 seconds, it smoothes skin and leaves pores visibly smaller in just one use. \n\nHow to Use Biore Charcoal Pore Minimizer: \n\nWet hands and face with warm water.
