Money well spent we are using this tub frequently and it is very comfortable and powerful for its size. We already had one dedicated circuit do to the previous tub wiring but did have to run power to ensure that the air pump and jet pump are running off of two separate circuits. The color changing LED lights are also a nice touch. We have been using it for 3 weeks only so we will update to see how it holds up over time but very impressed so far. One of the best purchases we have made for our home.",

Unsure if it\u2019s easy to install as we hired someone to install it. Unsure about ease of cleaning the jets. We\u2019ve only used the tub once since it was installed. It still looks very clean.
