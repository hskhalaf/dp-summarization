I'm sick of all the rivalry between, Oculus, Hive and PSVR they are all good in their own right, I chose the Rift as I wasn't really bothered much about 'Roomspace' although the Rift is almost able to do this with the addition of a third sensor, I hear.",

Play Robo Recall for more than 5 minutes and you'll be gun slinging, dual wielding pistols, catching and throwing back bullets from mid-air, rippling limbs off robots ... omg its insane! Beat saber has won my heart. Think Guitar Hero but in VR ... but with light sabers!! 11/10 - absolutely needed beyond words! They change VR like nothing you'll ever buy!",

Only changed the batteries once after 50 hours of play. Great addon for the Oculus",
