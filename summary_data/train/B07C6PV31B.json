I'm NEVER going back!! I can put whatever oils I like in the bottle (and I'm picky), and it sprays just like a spray can. To get the pressure, I have to pump it before every spray but it's easy. Just a note, it took a few pump and sprays to get it to flow smoothly, so don't give up if it seems weak at first.",

In my last sprayer, I didn't do that, and after a while the seal breached and it wouldn't hold pressure. The glass body is great for cleaning; my last one was a plastic body, which is much harder to clean. Only nit perhaps is that the spray dispersion is so wide that it ends up greasing itself a little bit right below the nozzle, but that's not a big issue.",

It's not big deal so it takes me 2-3 times to get a good even coat on some chicken. It's not a steady one time your done thing. But we are talking mins. Nothing to time consuming.

Its awkward trying to pull the pump nozzle back to spray. I really would like for it to work. I know I'm a few days beyond the return window. Any suggestions ? I also unscrew it to let off pressure after use. I really don't know if it's me or the sprayer!",

I\u2019d have returned it if I thought I could now that\u2019s it\u2019s been washed and filled with oil and used. It feels very high quality though, when you hold it - it just doesn\u2019t work.",

Just an excellent product and the seller is awesome! Had a slight problem but the issue was resolved immediately to my complete satisfaction.",
