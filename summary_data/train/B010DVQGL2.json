Otherwise, as with all of these types of shoes, just know that they have very little support or cushion. I can wear them all day, but they'd be a problem for some people. Apart from fit, I love the style and texture, and they're very well constructed. One thing to know, for those people with a good eye for color... these are NOT a neutral grey; they have a greenish hue to them.",

They don't fit like my vans and i guess maybe that's why they're a little uncomfortable, I've been wearing vans everyday for like 2 months but once i break these in more they should be 5 star worthy. They're a little big by the toes but nothing that will make you look like a duck.",
