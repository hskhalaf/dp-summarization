It was the toy that he wanted to play with most at the birthday party. When he fell, it was easy for him to pick the bike back up. The next morning he woke his parents up early wanting to ride the bike. It is definitely one of his very favorite toys. When the family goes out of town, it is easy for them to take on the trip. The bike is sturdy and comes with a life time warranty. We are very happy with the purchase.",

    "description": "Times are changing and that includes the one thing they say you\u2019ll never forget - learning to ride a bike. Forget how it was done when we were young - tricycles and training wheels are a thing of the past. Today, the best way to learn to ride a bicycle is on a no-pedal balance bike. The Cruzee Ultralite is the lightest, easiest and safest balance bike to teach children to ride. If your child can walk, they can ride a Cruzee. At just 4.4 lbs (2kg), little riders safely develop balance, steering and motor skills as they explore the world on their first bike. The Cruzee Ultralite fits boys and girls from 18 months to 5 years old and will grow with your child. Our rust-free anodized finish, maintenance-free sealed bearings, flat-free composite tires and tool-free adjustment clamps offer kids (and their parents) years of carefree outdoor bike riding adventures. Low profile axle bolts protect riders from painful ankle strikes and make the Cruzee Ultralite the perfect training bike and ride-on toy for indoor fun. It will not damage floor surfaces and your toddler can blow off steam while it is cold and snowy outside. Unlike other balance bikes, Cruzees come in nine Sparkle Sapphire Anodized colors that will mesmerize children and adults alike. With an 11.5 inch minimum seat heigh, the Cruzee Ultralite also includes an extra long seat post that results in wide push bike adjustability. With the Cruzee Ultralite your child will be riding like a pro in no time - order today!",
