Once on, it is fairly secure but can come off if bumped. The Fotasy does work well as a diffuser. Not clear from the picture is that one side is black and the inside surfaceis shiny so it puts more light forwards. The Sto-Fen style diffusers are 360 degrees, so in a small room, the results are softer, but with more light loss. Since it crushes flat, it is handier than an OmnBounce, so I will always take it along.",

I will definitely buy a few more once as I update my older flashes. People continually comment on my use of soft lighting and how can they do the same thing. Imitation is flattery.",

That's not shocking since the diffusion surface area in front of the flash head is pretty small. Still, I hoped it would be more useful. I think one of those milky plastic diffusers that look like an oversized ice cube would probably do as well or better.",
