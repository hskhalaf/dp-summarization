I purchased this case for my new Samsung S8+ knowing full well Otter had not yet released a protective screen for it yet (although Otter's website does show a screen @ $44.00). However, that wasn't my main issue. When I placed the S8+ into the OtterBox case, as directed, none of the Samsung buttons would function! I repeated this process for two days and still nothing would work. Finally, in frustration I resolved to return this product, sadly disappointed in Otter and ordered a different product.",

I have no idea why they would choose to eliminate the built-in screen protector for their Defender Series for the Galaxy S8+ but I know that it is causing me a lot of time and effort to remedy. I ended-up purchasing an \"off brand\" case that was surprisingly nice AND has a built-in screen protector. Color choices for this case are hideous and uninspired, it's like they aren't even trying anymore. If I didn't need a case that will holster I would have never purchased this.",

This phone is pretty slippery as it is so this was a great upgrade to an amazing device already. And, they're based out of Colorado, so there's that too.",

I love the slim design! It had both a hard plastic case and a rubber like outer case for double protection and fits in my pocket without the bulkiness of some of the other Otterbox cases.

      "text": "I've had to replace 2 different 8+ at $99 a piece because the back spiderwebbed right over the fingerprint sensor both times. I jumped on buying 8+ before OtterBox had a cover and regretted it as I've always sworn by their products. Even using this cover screenless has been a great improvement. 2 active dogs mean that I drop my phone pretty regularly. After almost 2 months not a scratch on it!",

The rubber outer bit will stretch over time so you'll have to keep an eye on it and the plastic will eventually crack but it will protect your phone. Just don't be crazy and throw your phone into the floor/wall and it'll do its job for a long time.",

I will always used a tempered screen protector so at least it adds a layer of protection in that area. I guess they have to leave the sides like that for the side swiping features on this phone. Other than that, would buy again!",
