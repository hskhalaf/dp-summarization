After my cat had vomited a few too many times after being on this food, I took him to the vet and they suggested switching to a food that is tested to meet AAFCO standards. My vet discussed with me the high incidence of heart disease in dogs on grain-free diets and how the issues went away after switching off a grain-free diet. Even though the research is still ongoing in cats, why risk it when there are vet and PhD nutritionist approved, formulated, and tested diets for your pets.",

I buy this food because its healthy for my cat and grain free but it's not worth the price if its not giving my cat everything he needs. I switched to Beyond Grain Free cat food since they reached those suggested amounts of nutrients.",
