It\u2019s also very easy to apply and keeps my skin moisturized. I live in a very dry climate, this product relieves the skin itchiness and keeps it smooth",

It doesn't smell anything like almonds, I think it smells very artificial. It is so artificially smelling, that I thought I put one of my cleaning products on my skin. Almost the same sent. It does feel wonderful and skin, but it's not for me.",
