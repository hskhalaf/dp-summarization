      "text": "Strong enough to remove the lug nuts on an International dump truck. Recommended torque of 475 to 600 ft lbs. It will also tighten the same nuts to within specs. but that takes a lot of impacts. I did not purchase this impact to remove truck wheels but had to try due to the advertised rating and it did the job. I have used it on tie-rod ends, pickup wheels, farm equipment etc and am very impressed. Much more convenient than hauling a compressor around and has enough power for many jobs. I purchased a pair of batteries at the local farm supply for $50 on a special and recommend having extras on hand.",

I recommend this impact to anyone especially someone who doesn't have a huge air compressor in their garage.",

What I absolutely hate is the direction button location, you know to put it into reverse to loosen or forward to tighten, yeah well it's located right above the trigger and your hand will constantly end up switching it when trying to get those awkwardly placed nuts loose. Not sure why they placed it where they did, should be moved somewhere out of the way. If not for that, 5 stars all the way!",

Cannot comment on battery life as I haven't run a battery down far enough... But it pulled 2 wheels off and 2 shocks off and put it all back in just fine. Battery still read full. Which I'd hope it would... Weighs about what it looks like it should, nothing crazy there. Overall good piece.",

It is a very powerful gun on 3, Id say just as strong if not more than the Snap On it replaced (2014 lithium) 5ah batteries will take on and off about 200 lugs with ease, probably more, worth the slight price increase. Has fallen off the lift from around 4 feet and suffered no damage, well see how easy parts are to find and replace.",
