I'm a 8 1/2 but I ordered a size 9 since I read on the reviews to go a size up. I did and they fit and feel amazing! My last Reef Stargazer sandals lasted for 5 years and still looked like new and always felt comfortable. So I decided to buy another pair because I love these shoes so much! it's definitely cheaper to buy on Amazon than in Dick's Sporting Goods.",

I wore them at the beach, in water, camping, pools, etc... They're comfy enough, though not nearly as squishy as some Roxy's I bought at Ross for $7.99. They're pretty sturdy. The strap actually just broke on my last pair, and that's why I bought the replacements. The thong piece didn't come up through the sole like most flip flops that inevitably break. They do run a little small. I normally wear a 7 1/2 and the 8s are perfect and more snug than my other flip flops that are size 8.",

The usual shoe size worn is a 6.5 (US). The black plastic of the sole is very comfortable and is the primary reason I purchase these shoes. The strap of the shoe is covered in glitter, which does wear off over time, especially in sand. I would not say these flip flops provide arch support but most flip flops do not. The tread of the shoe is not slippery like some flip flops but provides traction on most surfaces. I would recommend these shoes.",

Luckily these flips seem super sturdy on the bottom as they're made with a harder plastic sole and a very soft insole. The glitter doesn't seem like the type to chip either so all in all I think this was a greay buy!",

These wear really well too - I have a pair that I've worn for three summers and although the glitter has worn at the edges of the straps, the soles are still in great shape!",

Not overt and in your face, but more of a casual lightly bright gold tone, which looks lovely on tanned feet in the summer. I love my Reefs and order several pairs every summer. They never disappoint. They are a must have summer item for me. Super comfy and light. Not recommended for long walks, but perfect for short walks. Love them!",

I've some close calls with falling while wearing them in Tahiti around wet surroundings, so be mindful of where you wear them to.
