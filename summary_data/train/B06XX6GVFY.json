This cup is great at allowing my toddler to eat her cereal and at the same time practice her fine motor skills. I also like that it has a lid so left over cereal doesn\u2019t get soggy or spill in the bag. So far it seems to be resistant and good quality but I will update once she\u2019s used it for a little while. Hope this helps! If it does give me a helpful vote :)",

I don't know why, the food is warm but not boiling when I pack it in the morning, but we've since thrown it out. Additionally, the lid is very difficult to get on properly so leaking happened frequently (although at least then the pressure wouldn't build up as much) and the design on the side was already rubbing away. Overall, not at all impressed.",

I was disheartened recently, however, when I saw that the bottom of the thermos had cracked. I do not think this is due to user error. The thermos has not been dropped, is always handwashed and air dried, so has not been exposed to harsh conditions. For so little use, I was disappointed that the exterior is starting to fall apart.",

But my twins love the puppy face and enjoy lifting and closing the lid. And I also worry that the hinge will break one of these times they drop it, but so far so good.",

She has dropped their and thrown it on our hardwood floors and it has held up perfectly. UPDATE: Snack but still going strong and I bought another one for her! I got the bumble bee this time and it's so cute! No issues with either of them and yes she still throws them occasionally haha",

If she tips up the cup upside down and grab her cereal, when she pulls out her hand, it does make a slight mess but that usually happens when she is in her car seat.

I purchased these because I love that the lid closes so that their snacks don't go stale (like the toddlers care anyway). The opening to put their hands into is designed in a way that makes it difficult for them to put their hands in. My toddlers are not large by any means and do not possess man hands - they simply could not get their snacks out. It caused chaos while I was trying to make them breakfast as endless screaming ensued whilst trying to get their precious puffs from the container. I will be returning these.",

Once I received them I automatically fell in love with the lid- it\u2019s easy to use and so convenient! The designs are cute and both of my children find them easy to use! These now travel everywhere with us.",

I guess we will have to do this one only as needed. It is adorable though.",
