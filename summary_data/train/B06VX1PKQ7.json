If everything was on the same side, you could have the cables all pointing away and the control buttons on the front. But that's not possible. So it looks awful aesthetically. The second problem was that when I plugged a Roku into one of the inputs, it acted very sluggish. Remote would not consistently control it. I finally unhooked the whole thing.",

When I broke my first one, I bought a new one of a different brand and It didn't work as well. It would automatically switch inputs often. For example, I had my computer plugged into port one and a Nintendo Switch plugged into port two with port one selected. If the switch was turned on at any point, the connector would automatically switch inputs, something I really didn't like. This connector doesn't do that however. It will stay on the input you have selected, regardless of what power changes in the receiving devices.",

I can only assume this is because it uses the HDMI signal itself as a power source and sometimes it needs an extra \"kick\" to wake up.

      "text": "My father has a TV with one HDMI port. He had multiple devices, DVD, cable set top box, etc. When I bought him a Chromecast to use YouTube I needed a splitter like this. It was simple for him to switch between devices. There's one button that cycles through each port. Very straight forward. Future proof yourself and buy the 4k version, I can't attest to its ability though since he didnt have a 4k TV.",

A KVM would be better, but they cost a lot more and once the Pi has remote control software installed I can use the desktop, so this was to get me started with Pi's. A good unit at a good price.",

      "text": "The switch is plug and play. It's great if you're plugging in things like a bluray player and chromecast. It's terrible for game consoles because it delays video transmission. So if you input a command on the controller, the console will read it but you won't see the result until 1.5-3 seconds later on the TV. Auto detection of chromecast works when game console is turned off. And it will skip empty ports when using the button to switch. Two stars because I purchased this for use with game consoles. If your application doesn't involve timing of inputs this product will work fine.",

You have to press it multiple, MULTIPLE, times to have it switch. Pressing it firmly doesn't help either. You just have to press it numerous times to make the switch.
