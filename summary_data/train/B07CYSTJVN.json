If you buy from a 3rd party seller EGO won't honor their warranties on either the mower or battery.",

I opened the package yesterday and found one of the wheels to be completely broken. It made me very sad because of all the positive reviews about EGO self propelled lawn mower. I registered my product and filed a complaint with EGO Customer service with regards to defective product. If I get a proper response for their customer service to fix this issue, I will update this review after get a chance to use the lawn mower. Otherwise, I intend to file a Customer Complaint in the Virginia Court.",

If you have a big yard or a yard with hills you will need at least two 7.5ah batteries. The biggest drawback with it is any kind of heavy workload drains the battery extremely fast. Also forget about using the bag. The weight of a half-full bag will again deplete your battery. Other than that it works as well or better than any gas mower I've had.",
