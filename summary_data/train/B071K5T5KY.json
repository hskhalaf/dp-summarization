It was also appreciated with its provision of comfort, protection, and traction.However, it still was not able to please everyone. All in all, the KEEN Saltzman WP is a good pair of hiking shoes for those who do not mind having extra weight on their foot.",

I had bought a similar pair two years ago that lasted a solid two years before becoming my \"construction\" shoes (retired from regular use but still ok for cutting the grass and anything else that destroys shoes). These shoes, however, lasted less than a year before the toe became unglued, and the wear on the footpad is pretty heavy. The waterproofing worked well, and other than falling apart way too early they were a good shoe, but I've since gone to a competitors shoe, and will see how they fare. Bye Keen.",

They are well built and everything else about them is perfect.",

Where the sole meets the shoe, in the bend, pulled away from the material and water pours in even in wet grass. Disappointed. Will try another model.",

Things like walking on a gravel driveway became bothersome then because there was not much of a barrier between my feet and the rocks. Water resistance went out the window at that point as well. These were good shoes originally but they simply failed long before they should have.",
