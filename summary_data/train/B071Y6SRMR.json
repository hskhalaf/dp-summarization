Pros: \u2022 easy to dismantle and reassemble \u2022 chair is comfortable \u2022 everything comes as advertised Cons: So for starters it was a good chair however I would have gave it 5 stars if it had...... \u2022 extendable armrest \u2022 the wheels on the chair need to be more stable rather then clipping them on because it was hard to move around the chair from place to place",
