The back of the laptop become extremely hot when you trying to do multiple tasks , even hotter when the charger is plugged. When i try to access C:/ drive it froze for 20 sec and after that allow me to explore the drive. Kind of disappointed about this laptop which have great configuration for this amount of money cost, i`m still thinking to return or not , if problems persist definitely i will return it.",

Minimal bloatware. My only criticisms are a power button that is overly easy to activate (would prefer having to hold it down for a second) and a fairly dim display even on full brightness. Would recommend, if it fits your budget. UPDATE....... Still happy a year later. System is stable trouble-free.",

But my concerns about Asus' quality control remain: the computer has a noticeable coil whine emanating from the top left corner of the base (near where the escape key is), and the notebook has a serious chassis flex problem. The unit I have got delivered with a keyboard that is somewhat (by atleast 1 mm) recessed into the chassis near the D-F-G-V keys owing to the aluminum chassis having bent. The coil whine problem is not that serious on my unit, but to pay a $1,000 to have a notebook delivered with a bent chassis has been disappointing to say the least.",

I took a chance and couldn\u2019t be happier. If you place your ear against the computer and free yourself from even the slightest ambient noise, then yeah... perhaps you MIGHT hear the computer function. To me, 100% normal. I have yet to hear any fan noises either. This computer is super fast and very much worth the purchase. Any negative reviews is simply someone being way too critical. I whole heartily recommend this laptop.",

If we use the full potential however the battery drains very fast and it can get hot - but this is something I was expecting. Device is perfect if you need high performance from time to time. If you just do web browsing, 8-9h on battery is achievable. Aluminium body looks and feels very solid. Screen is also very good. It has warranty which actually works in Poland where I live.
