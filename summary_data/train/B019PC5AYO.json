Honestly the float was so cool I was way more bummed I couldn't play with it anymore rather than upset about my money. I did contact the company with a picture and they immediately responded. refunding me in full without even receiving the product back. Worth buying this floaty especially knowing if anything happens the company has great customer service!",

The cooler in the center is a great idea but doesn\u2019t keep it cold very long. The only thing I didn\u2019t remember to do is purchase cups to play, but other than that you are good to get it out of the box, inflate, and play! We had a cookout with friends and we\u2019ve already recommended it to two other families. Our kids play pong too so we\u2019ve had family competitions and it really gets everyone together and having fun. You won\u2019t be sorry!",
