When I place a straight edge across the 29 1/2\" width of the table, the gap is a 1/2\" dip. Not a flat surface, if that is what you're after. You are not able to return table after 30 days, so if sagging develops over time, too bad, you own the table.",

If the weight was evenly distributed, this table might hold a few hundred pounds, but in real world conditions where you want to use it for a computer desk or set anything heavy and compact on it, there are better tables. It was cheap and it works, therefore three stars.",

The plastic is good quality plastic and not cheap, holds up alot of weight and legs are super sturdy and strong. The table doesnt wobble, it's very stable, theres alot of leg room underneath if you wanna store bins underneath or stretch your legs out. Table is high enough to where if a basement flooded it'd be ok, it to me is pretty high off the floor. On the same side of the table, you can seat about almost 3 people sitting in chairs.

      "text": "We purchased this table for our son to use as a computer desk. With a 1000lb capacity, that shouldn't be a problem right? Unfortunately this table sags very drastically toward the center. To the point that it's worthless as a desk now. Anything requiring a flat surface is out, as it wobbles around the sink hole that the tabletop has become. The sagging wasn't evident at first sight and became worse over time, but a 1000lb capacity, steel framed table should last much longer and certainly shouldn't just start sagging or what's the point? Would not recommend this to anyone.",

I'll look into reinforcing them with a 2\"x4\" or similar.

I don't regret going this route, as they don't really take up any extra space to store up against a wall, and I've actually stood on them several times already working on projects around the house. Definitely nice that they're so sturdy, if you don't have to transport your tables in a small car these are the way to go.",

The legs are sturdy and easy to open, close. My kitchen is currently being remodeled and this is holding items moved from the counters. Amazingly it holds a lot and the weight limit helps.",

    "description": "Size:30\" X 72\"\n\n The National Public Seating BT3000 Series steel frame rectangular blow molded plastic top folding table has a speckled gray, 72\" long, 1-3/4\" thick, UV protected, blow molded plastic table top, a steel frame that can support 1,000 lb. of evenly distributed weight, and folds for compact storage when not in use. The blow molded plastic top has a better strength-to-weight ratio than solid plastic or wood tables, is UV protected to withstand sunlight during outdoor use, and can withstand heat up to 212 degrees F so it won't be damaged by hot plates or coffee cups. The surface is lightly textured to increase scratch resistance, but is still smooth enough to write on. The gray steel legs are powder coated for corrosion resistance. When the legs are opened, gravity lock rings engage to keep table legs open when upright, and slide out of the way for folding. When folded, the legs nest flush into indentations in the bottom of the table, making a flat surface suitable for stacking multiple tables for compact storage. Plastic glides on the feet help protect floor surfaces. \n\n The table is Materials Analytical Services (MAS) certified as low volatile organic compound (VOC) emitting furniture according to the criteria defined by U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design (LEED) 2009 for Schools, LEED 2009 for Commercial Interiors, ANSI/BIFMA X7.1-2011, ANSI/BIFMA e3-2011e Furniture Sustainability Standard - Section 7.6.1 and 7.6.2, Collaborative for High Performance Schools (CHPS) EQ2.2.5, and the MAS Certified Green program.
