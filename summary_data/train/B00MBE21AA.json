I bought it on a whim and it has greatly surpassed my expectations. I have it projecting directly on my wall (no screen) and connected to an amazon fire box and a nice speaker. It really makes everything more fun.",

You will have to click on the source and choose which outlet you are using, ie. Computer 1, Computer 2...Once you do that your image will be displayed. However, it isn't able to search for the source automatically. Will update once we have used for our business meetings.",

This projector has been nothing but a delight. the image is super clear and extremely bright, the only thing that would have made it better is if the sound would have been a little better. Running the sound through the projector i get a slight hum.",
