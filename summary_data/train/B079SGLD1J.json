I got this backpack to wear at Bonnaroo because the event implemented a new security policy banning all backpacks except for clear ones. This backpack was large enough to fit a change of clothes, a beach towel and other miscellaneous items. I now use it frequently while camping and hiking. It's size makes it work well for carrying water or Gatorade, bug spray, a small blanket or towel, a change of clothes and a snack or three.",

I work in a government setting where everything goes through an X-ray machine (hence, the need for a CLEAR backpack) and this has been a GREAT purchase. If it ever wears out, I'm buying another one, same brand and company. I can't believe it's only $20 bucks.",
