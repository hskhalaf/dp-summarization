It was been one of the best investments we purchased for our food storage. It has withstood the test of time and is in pristine condition still after nearly 4 years. It arrived timely as I remember and was in great condition; no problems with shipping or the quality. I would definitely recommend it to others. We recently purchased another cabinet by the same company to match the other one because we were so very pleased with our first purchase.",

They are easy to assemble and look nice, but this time 2 of the doors and one of the side panels have foam stuck to them. Not easy to remove, either. It's like it either melted on or is stuck with some kind of glue. I tried scraping it, but can't get it all off. It's odd, because I don't know where the foam came from. It seems different than the packing foam. More like white spray foam in consistency. Outside of that problem, I like them. Hoping I can somehow clean the foam off. Will try a few things.",

I was actually surprised at how fast the build went this morning. For a simple cabinet for clothing and such, i recommend this cabinet.",

There is no mounting hardware and no predrilled holes into the back to attach the cabinet to a wall. 2. >1/4 gap between the doors. I tried releasing and tightening the hinges to no avail along with switching out the door panels. Lastly, you can\u2019t \u201ceasily\u201d install the door handles without drilling holes through the panels. Maybe the company forgot? Overall, a let down",

Light enough to be move into place by oneself. About 5'6 in height in case one is wondering how tall. Bought 2 units and none came with any problems. The back is just a piece of cardboard, wish it a bit bigger to actually cover the whole back. It a few cm short in all. Somehow I missed the complete unit photos. Oh well. For the price definitely good",

Still looks nicer than a free standing closet rack and seems plenty roomy for our stuff.",

Other than that it serves the purpose for which I purchased it -- for my air fryer and storage of its accessories. I also purchased this because it has a melamine top which is good for the air fryer.",

Moving them results in the pressed wood flaking and breaking off - MOVED THESE EMPTY ONLY A FEW INCHES. 2) Transportation and delivery method is not kind to this type of cheap pressed wood....you WILL have visual dings. The back of the unit is cardboard and contributes to the flimsy feel of the cabinets. I simply don't see these lasting very long at all - so if you are looking for a cheap, temporary disposable storage, this is for you. I you are looking for quality, look elsewhere.",
