She loves to move it around while the stars are shining, and she has dropped it on the floor several times and it didn't break. She's under 2 years old but quickly learned how to activate her \"stars\". She can work it better than Daddy can, even in the dark. We've been using it for over a month and the first batteries are still going strong. We are so happy with it, we bought two more as gifts.",

This product was exactly what I had in mind. It has multiple colors you can choose from - orange, blue, green, and rotating colors. My kids like the blue because they are brighter, but the rotating option is pretty cool too. It has a timer that turns it off after 45 minutes. We bought it in December for Christmas Eve, and the batteries just ran out. If you are looking for a small, portable and whimsical star lamp this is it.",
