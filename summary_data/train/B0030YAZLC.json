I started my musical journey in 1965 as a pop/rock drummer until the late 60's. Over the years I've learned to play guitars, keyboards and bass as well but this year, 47 years later I've decided to resume playing drums again. This cymbal I purchased from Amazon is one of the best I've ever played.",
