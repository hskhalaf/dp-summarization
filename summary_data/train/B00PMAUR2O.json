So the picture shows it in a curbless shower, which is what we just installed. BUT if you are 6 feet tall, you have to duck under the rail. SO disappointed. The final touch on our new bathroom, and we blew it. It is a great door, and I love it's appearance, but it needs to be 4\"inches taller to compensate for the hardware (rail).",

We have to use rubber door stops to place under the rollers so that it will stay closed while showering. Also, the steel bar that the door rolls on is not stiff or strong enough and tends to sage from the heavy weight of the shower door.",

I would not want to have to deal with a return. Your expense to mail it back plus 20% restocking fee. Overall a nice looking shower door and I like its adjustability. The directions are pretty terrible but I figured it out. I installed it myself. It would be easier with 2 but is doable alone.",

Be aware that when it's delivered it comes in two boxes attached to a pallet, so you'll need two strong men to carry the boxes inside once they remove them from the pallet. Once it was installed what I did notice is that the moving side (one side is stationary) doesn't stay open, not that it needs to, but it's strange as you're getting out of the shower that the door closes behind you! It must be the weight of the door! Don't hesitate though it's nice - a custom look for an Amazon price!",
