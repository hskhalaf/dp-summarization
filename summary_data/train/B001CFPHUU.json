OK, one of them just got a soccer ball to the crotch so that took roughly 25 seconds. Great ball and I'm sure it will withstand a lot of kicks and impacts until they leave it outside and I accidentally run it over with the riding mower.",

Pretty much any ball from any brand in this price range will have a cheap covering, so I don't have an issue with that. These were intended to be kicked and they have worked without issue. I've been thinking of maybe getting a few more if these hold up. I wouldn't get this ball if you wanted a good game ball, but for practicing your shots, they should work well.",

I purchased 24 balls last year and they ALL have remained inflated and are great practice balls. Two of them have tears due to hitting sharp edges like the top of a metal fence and the corner of a brick wall. But by far, these have been the best balls that I have ever purchased for our teams. In fact, I am posting this today because I planning on buying more for our team.",
