      "text": "It is great and does exactly what I need it to do. I have two minor complaints: 1) The material that the handles are made of causes an unwanted amount of friction and makes the rolling slightly more difficult. 2) The string is a bit long and therefore the bottom sits on the floor when the string is fully unraveled. However, I have tried out the authentic Wrist Ripper and, although it doesn't have these problems, it is definitely not worth paying 5x the price to get the authentic Wrist Ripper.",

      "text": "I've owned several forearm rolllers in the past, and I'm mostly happy with this one. Pros: 1) lightweight 2) durable 3) cable is sufficiently long. I'm 5'10\" and can stand on a small platform for longer pulls. With most of the rollers I end up swapping out the cable for a longer one. 4) I've gone up to 30 pounds with no issue. Cons: 1) only complaint: One foam handle came off (otherwise I'd give 5 stars). The exposed metal however is fine for gripping though.",
