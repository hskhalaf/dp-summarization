Transpack is more rugged and optimum for plane travel but much more expensive.",

She loves this bag and is so excited to use it for this ski season and many ski seasons to come. Overall amazing purchase, would buy again for my older daughter.",

I can see my son being able to carry a days plus worth of gear and his helmet in the pocket of this bag. I was very surprised how much could be put into this bag.

A big con, however, is that there is a very strong chemical smell to the bag which hasn't gone away even after months of letting it air out. I'm afraid at this point that it won't go away. I would give it 4 starts except for the smell.",

And with Prime I got it in two days, which was perfect for my upcoming ski trip to Colorado. This bag has a great color, which means you won't mistake it for the countless other \"black\" ski bags out there. Plus so many pockets for stashing lots of stuff. It holds boots, helmet, gloves, pants, socks, protein bars, key clips... I can't say enough good things about this bag. It is also made really well, which means you can take it on many a ski trip. Thank you, Athalon!!!",

Really like the back pack straps too makes it very easy to carry.",

It's great that it has backpack straps that can easily be zipped away for the flight. The bag offers a surprising large amount of storage space. The bag appears to be quite durable, but I've only used it for one trip so I don't have enough history with it to say for sure.",

The only knock I have, and it is minor, is that that straps are shapes suck that once you put one on, it is kind of hard to reach the other. This ergonomic shape also makes it feel better while wearing, so I can't really complain too much. I can't see getting any other boot bag.",

The ONLY reason for not giving 5-starts... I would have liked some kind of mesh or net on top of the bag to hold a helmet.

Expanding section for helmet. Waterproof bottom. Top and front carry handles. Front MP3 pocket w/ earphone outlet. The most comfortable, organized, and useful boot bag on the market, the Athalon Everything boot pack offers space for just about all your ski gear save your skis themselves.

You also have plenty of room for other items thanks to the large expandable pocket, which can hold a ski helmet or jacket, and the bungee cords on the front for maps, goggles, and other accessories. Perhaps the most convenient feature for frequent skiers, however, is the pair of hidden, reinforced backpack straps, which make it easy to carry the boot pack to and from the parking lot. Other features include a waterproof tarp along the bottom to keep the bag and its contents from getting wet; a vented boot section with bottom drainage grommets; clips in each pocket for gloves, keys, and other small items; a front MP3 player pocket with an exterior earphone port; top and front carrying handles; matte chrome hardware; and a contoured shape that fits your boots perfectly.
