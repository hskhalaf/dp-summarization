Very sturdy (held 2 bottles of wine and goceries for dinner). I no longer have to grab the hand baskets and stuff my bags into it which takes up room. I highly recommend as a better alternative to reusable bags. Even great to take to a potluck, work, or other activities.",

If there are only a few, and pretty small, the sides want to sink back down. It's ok when you're carrying it but put it down and down go the sides and things can spill/roll out of it. It's not a deal breaker though because it's roomy, sturdy and easily stored. Just a suggestion for the manufacturer.",
