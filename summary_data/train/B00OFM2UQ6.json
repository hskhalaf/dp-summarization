It autoconects to the paired device (in this case my smartphone), and if you've got a music player which autoplays your music from where you left off, then you save yourself the hassle of opening up your music player. It's great for indoor use (loud volume for a small gathering of friends having drinks at the table) and it's acceptable for outdoor use (you can hear it while bbqing but it's not as good as when inside). All and all it's a great speaker. And taking into consideration the price, it's an excellent portable bt speaker.",

If you go a tad above half way on volume it gets distorted.I want to return it but can't find a option for just not what I expected for what I payed. For the money go with a archeer.",

In other words, the music sounds a tiny bit echoey. This comes with the territory of being a small speaker pumping out a ton of sound When playing songs with heavy bass at 90% volume, if you don't have the speaker on a grippy surface it will walk Overall: The best 30 Watts speaker I tried!",

In a shop there is constant air tools and engines going so the enviroment isnt very speaker friendly. device performed well. battery is great. if you are looking for a booming loud speaker this isnt it, ANY THING ELSE AND THIS IS YOUR SPEAKER",
