However, the only downside is that the water runs out pretty quickly so its frustrating to be elbow deep in a \"job\" only to have to go refill it. A plus was the several different attachments that were included.",

Also, you have to wait for it to cool some before you can fill it, the cap has a safety mechanism built in that will not allow you to open it when hot. My only complaint, and its minor because its kind of common sense, is it gets hot. I could not hold the button down because it was so hot, but putting on a glove took care of that problem.",

I had to wait for a \"recharge\" so that the steam was back at the normal pressure. Water was also dripping out of the handle. I gave this machine another couple opportunities to prove its worth, but haven't had much success. Certainly considering returning this at some point.",
