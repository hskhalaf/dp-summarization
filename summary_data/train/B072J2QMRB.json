      "text": "I was super excited go get this mat strap that I bought two. One for me and one for my son. We both needed something to transport our mats easier, but I really didn't want another netted bag like I had before. It was always an extra work out to stuff that bad boy in there. So this strap is perfect. It slides right on both sides and adjusts seamlessly. My son's mat is slightly bigger than mine and it fits his perfect too. Plus you cannot beat the small purse that comes with it to hold your phone and essentials. D rings right to the strap and is manly enough for you guys. Great product!",

I was nervous because the price was so reasonable, but this is my favorite strap I have ever owned. Also, my iPhone 8 plus fits tightly in the pouch due to a thick case, but I can still sip it up and attach my key with the clip. It is perfect for a daily yoga practicer like myself.",
