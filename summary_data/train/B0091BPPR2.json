It is a tad bulky at first, but it does not affect my ability to go semi-western, continental or backhand instantly. My one concern is that one of the seams has split a few stitches. That won't deter me from getting another though.",

Hand wash only? But Do Not Wash? Woolite in the sink, I think. Sizing: I have big hands and always order XL. These were actually felt a little big in XL. I tried the L and it's a bit tight.

Bought because hand always sweats and feels wet on pickleball bat handle/grip, feels like it could slip tho usually doesn't.

Your hand can breathe thanks to the mesh top, and the material is quick dry with no leather to get funky. Highly recommended; I only wish I could find this glove in several colors in case I ever change out of my red racket :-)",

My hands sweat quite a bit during the game and this glove plays its role perfectly while maintaining the right feel for racquet grip. The mesh structure offers good air flow. The good part is - it also dries very quickly and ready for use again within a day.",
