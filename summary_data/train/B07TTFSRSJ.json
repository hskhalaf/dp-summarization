The screen feels like glass, keyboard has a really nice feeling, very sturdy and high quality built. It comes with Win 10, once you turn it on it will prompt you to activate or setup your Win 10 account, (language, location etc). Camera quality is not that great but still usable. Speakers quality is between medium and high quality. I highly recommend it, good for teleworking, working on projects, watch movies. Communication with seller (Chuwi representative) was great!",

With 8 GB ram and 256 gb it has plenty of space/speed for word, YouTube (will play 4k with no stuttering), and web browsing. The only problem I have with the .machine is that you cannot use any USBC to charge the device. Only the provided usbc will charge it. Bummer. Otherwise its great. If you're on the fence just do it.

I never tried it while running Windows so I can\u2019t comment on how it performed on windows but on Ubuntu it\u2019s snappy and responsive. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for intense applications. I use it mostly for day to day use: excel (libreoffice), web browsing, movies and some python scripting. Super slim and sleek. Cons: a little awkward to open, the power supply is super cheap feeling, only 1 usb3 port & 1 usb c port. The power button is a key.",

Battery holds 8-9 hours of office use. Processor and RAM is sufficient to run two IDEs, three docker services and 30 chrome tabs without lagging or reloading pages if you are on Linux. Perfect keyboard layout. Downsides: lid magnet is too strong and camera not the best quality, but both aren't big deal. At first i wanted to put a sticker on a Chuwi brand, but now I am actually proud of it. Great job. Great deal for frontenders, pythonistas and so on who cares about their eyes.",

Viewing angles are great and the brightness is up to par with the $1000 laptops. Performance is also great everything runs very smooth and not lag. The build is also Amazing, the metal body makes it feel way more expensive than it actually is. The only things that I can find wrong with it is that it\u2019s kinda hard to open when it\u2019s closed and it gets a bit warm. Other than that I completely recommend this laptop to anyone who is looking for an absolute deal.",
