We've cleaned it on a weekly basis, but the mold gets such a foothold in the plastic that it now can't be cleaned. It's now part of the landfill where it can continue to fester unabated.",

Not sure what kind of lighting they used to photograph it, but in general lighting it's very dark so be warned. It did cover the entire tub basin however, which was what I was looking for, but I sent it back because the color was so different in person than the photo, I'd advise the clear version!",
