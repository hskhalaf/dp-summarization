For the 0.7 cf safe, using boxes of 50 rounds of 9mm ammo, you can fit 4 high x 2 deep x 5 wide = 40 boxes of ammo (or 2000 rounds). The safe would be pretty full at that point -- not jammed tight but you couldn't fit much else. May be able to squeeze a small handgun in there.",

To disable the beeping: - remove the batteries - remove two screws holding the cover on the back of the door - pinch the sides of both the anchors holding the board and remove the board (refer to pic) - while holding the button, carefully heat the solder of the two connections and gently pull the button until it's off (refer to pic) - reassemble the board/cover Note: in case I wanted to put it back on, I taped the freed button to the inside of the cover with electrical tape.

It also comes with 2 keys which are being held by my brother and the security chief at her complex. It's a nice size, and the shelf allows even more room.

      "text": "Of course, everyone wants the best safe money can buy, but the reality is if we bought the best safe we wouldn't have anything left to lock up. This safe is roomy, and when mounted correctly, a very effective unit. I used lag bolts to secure the safe into the wall studs instead of using the provided anchors. The provided anchors are good if mounting into concrete. As I installed it, it would probably take someone an hour or more to get it out of the wall. Likely that is more time than a burgler wants to be in someone's house making a lot of noise.",
