      "text": "So the quick story is this mixer is ok for limited crossfader use. The crossfader feels cheap and would wear fast if seriously used . So remove a star for that .. and remove one more star for placement of the headphone and microphone jack.. on top / on both sides of the cross fader. But I give it a solid three stars for its works , has a metal construction, has Bluetooth / usb input and 4 other RCA inputs that can be controlled by a switch quickly. Really a good value priced 2 Channel mixer for light use and Cocktail hours . Really light the Bluetooth feature as well.",

      "text": "Great for the price. A little glitchy at first with the knobs and faders switching their functions but a simple reset fixed it. Bluetooth plays your music from a Device only on right channel. They should alllow each channel imo. Then again it is a $60 mixer so no complaints. UPDATE ** Audio quality is distorted BAAAD. I used the same speakers and bypassed it directly from the device to the audio input of the same speaker and it\u2019s crystal clear. Haven\u2019t reached out to Rockville yet but I barely used the mixer and it has this pro problem.",

For DJ needing to play a song from the groom's phone I'm sure it works great, but for a guest BlueTooth port by my pool it was terrible! I fixed it by replacing (through drilling, cutting, and soldering) the on-board folded F antenna with an external 2.4 GHz antenna. The range increased to the point where I could use it. Who builds a 2.4 GHz radio and puts it side a steel box? These guys did!",
