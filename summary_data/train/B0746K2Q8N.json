The bottom portion will fit two full size bottles (shown in picture), which I think is a nice added bonus. Love that this bag includes a hook.

I love that it has two compartments so I can put the items that might leak (shampoo, etc) in the bottom so if they do leak it won\u2019t ruin everything else in my bag. I also love the interior straps for holding things in place so it\u2019s not just rolling around. I use essential oils and I can stick them under the straps and be good to go. Would totally recommend to my friends!",

However, it does a good enough job so that my pump bottles and perfume bottles don't completely fall over or the pump gets pushed by mistake. The drawback is that because of the height of some of my bottles it does not zip that well.",

When you hang it results heavy and impractical the space on the bottom literally you can\u2019t open without your things finish on the floor.. Interior is not deep enough for large items and is difficult to close if you have already complete the space on top... I don\u2019t know not perfect for me..",
