      "text": "I purchase 2 of these in blue for my 7 year old son. He has autism and adhd. He has one for school and one for home. It is used as a \"wiggle seat\". He gets sensory input and can wiggle in his seat when he feels the urge to move around. One side has small bumps and the other the bumps are a little bigger and higher so he can choose which side is best for him that day. We also use it when he wants the sensation of standing on something to wiggle around. I think this would be great for all children. My son is always saying that his friends in class want his wiggle seat.",

I can't believe it was so cheap given the amount of relief it gives me and all the ridiculous expensive products they have out there that could have wasted my money on instead. Not only that, it's far more discreet and easier to keep \"stable\" on than one of those weird giant balls my office-mate sits on! :)",

I think the people who are complaining that they cannot get it 'filled' may not get the point of what this product is for. In any case, the cushion is holding air, comfortable and does what I expected it to do.",

A tip for inflating: mine was not filled with much air when it arrived. You can press down on the side of the disk to form a larger internal area around the needle for the pump so that you can avoid puncturing the opposite side and doing this allows you to press firmly enough to get the needle all the way in without issue. I intend to update this review later re: pain relief, after I've had an opportunity to use the cushion for awhile.",

Sitting on an exercise ball is too low, and the movement is distracting. Using a kneeling chair is too restrictive and uncomfortable for my knees. When I alternate between sitting and standing in front of the computer, it's hard to achieve the right keyboard/screen height. Taking frequent \"stretching\" breaks disrupts my train of thought. In contrast, the Wobble Cushion allows just enough movement of the core and lower back while sitting, and does not distract attention from my work. So grateful to my friend who recommended this!",
