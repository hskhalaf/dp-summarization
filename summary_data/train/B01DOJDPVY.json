My friend warned me before the race to turn off the features because his watch died at 12 hours in an Ironman the previous year.

I downloaded the directions they are terrible, for the price that Garmin charges for this watch I think that well written concise operating instructions should not be too much to ask. If you are looking for a watch that is easy to use and intuitive this is not the watch.",

I do wish it had or a download is available for thing like rower, row machine, elliptical and weight training. I do miss those features from the vivo active, but i also went ahead and purchased the speed / cadence sensor and the foot pod and the data that it shows is unbelievable, run contact time, foot speed, etc. For the price this is a piece of equipment that i count on, on a daily basis. Keeps my training focused and gives me tons of data.",

The heart rate monitor strap serves to assist in tracking various benchmarks such as VO2 Max, etc. Great package deal. (Two critical observations - 1) hard to see the illuminated numbers on dial if wearing inside - it seems the illumination shows up much stronger outside, especially in sunlight. 2) there is a bit of learning curve to use all the bells and whistles. Not necessarily intuitive - it takes some reading on the Garmin website.)",
