Yes now it can\u2019t float up next to you but I wanna meet the guy/girl that can open this while sitting in there boat get stuff out then twist this lid back on.

I have yet to use it in very hot temperatures, but it worked great in 60's-70's and the ice lasted for the entire three day trip. It floats very well even when its fully stocked. You will feel it slightly when pulling behind your canoe or kayak. but if you tie it close it will prevent it from swinging around too much behind you.",

Also, the lid can be difficult to thread correctly but once properly sealed it did keep the river water out. When I paddled too fast it would become a little bit of a submarine and go under the water. I knew it would be noticeable towing it definitely not as bad as pulling another boat even when it was full to the top.",
