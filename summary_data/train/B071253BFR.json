It nice have to a real ac cord that powers the radio, The ac cord. Does not introduce noise on the am band, Radio reception on fm is very good even the internal antenna. Come with a external antenna if you need it. Am reception is amazing!! I highly recommend this Radio, Don\u2019t think about it, Just buy it.",

This model has a higher bass response but also has a digital tuner maintaining channel lock in eliminating Station drift the Tevoli analog tuner does not allowing for station drift ,should your preference lean to the treble side of your taste for sound qualities you might be happier with the Tivoli at a higher price range . personally I love the radio in a price range I would consider a great buy",

I like to listen to AM sports talk radio and this radio has a bit too much bass for deep voices, but it's better than being too tinny. FM music sounds much better. It also has a green light signifying the strongest station signals so tuning in is easy to get the best reception. I also specifically wanted an analog radio so I could put a auto timer on the radio so it can off and on at specific times. Can't do that with a digital radio. Very happy I bought this more expensive radio.",

(The built-in antennas work fine for local stations). My one quibble is the tuning dial. The old-fashioned dial seems hard to read in an age of digital \"exactness\". For example, where exactly is 98.7 on the dial? You will probably just listen to a couple of favorite stations, and you will learn where they are on the dial. I wish I had the exact-same radio with digital tuning. But then it wouldn't look retro!",

But if it's not true, it should be. Regardless, I suspect no one will regret purchasing one of these radio gems.",

Fortunately, I purchased an antenna with the radio. I hooked up the radio and it was initially difficult to find a location on the dial that would hold the signal and be static-free. When I hooked up the antenna, the radio could hold the signal and be static-free. It's worth a few extra bucks to buy the antenna with this radio.",
