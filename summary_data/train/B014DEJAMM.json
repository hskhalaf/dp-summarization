Two stars because the hair is super frizzy, frazzled and uneven! Really not sure who did your hair this time, Barbie, but you need a new stylist. Also, the hair is much more sparse than the classic Barbie that I remember having. These pics show the condition just after opening the package. I braided the hair to make it a little more presentable but I was really disappointed with the condition.",
