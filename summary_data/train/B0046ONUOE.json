The first time I used these snowshoes, I trekked 12 miles (ish) in deep, wet snow and camped on the top of a mountain. The snowshoes held up nicely. They are easy on and off even with cold, numb hands. I wouldn't recommend them for serious backcountry enthusiasts...I'm not sure how much abuse they will take, but for leisurely snowshoeing, I say it's a good buy.",
