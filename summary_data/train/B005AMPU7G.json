I'm back. Love the Hurricane line; good, stable, shoe. 8mm drop seems to be perfect for me. Took the neonness out of the box and wore them the next day on a 25 mile run. No issues. I've gotten ~100 miles on them so far without a problem. I don't anticipate any, but will update the review if anything unexpected happens (other than needing sunglasses when I tie 'em <grin>)",

The Brooks shoes are just as supportive, but a little heavier than the Saucony. And more expensive. You won't be disappointed with these shoes.",

Then tried the Adidas Supernova Glide, which just didnt have enough support for me. Back to the Hurricane line with the 16 and the support is just hard to match.

    "title": "Saucony Hurricane 16 Running Shoes - 11 Grey",
    "description": "The Hurricane 16 takes premium stability and cushioning to another level with a full length PowerGrid and Dual Density SSL EVA for a more efficient transition through the gait cycle. Upper A revolution in upper construction, the Hurricane 16 features intelligent upper engineering, incorporating 'Sauc'Fit' within the design specification. A unique fit system fused within the upper locks the midfoot onto the platform, whilst simultaneously keeping the heel secure and comfortable. Teamed with a HydraMax Collar Lining, a plush hand feel combined with excellent moisture-wicking properties creates a supreme duo. Midsole Creating a truly unique feel and experience Saucony have re engineered their PowerGrid technology, creating PWRGRID+. By adding a Powerfoam material and integrating it with GRID technology, Saucony have created a system that effectively centres the foot, absorbs impact and distributes pressure. The PWRGRID+ platform\u2019s increased stack heights deliver over 20% more cushioning and 15% more resiliency than the previous version, increasing versatility and prolonging the longevity of the shoes capabilities. Working in concert with the re-engineered PWRGRID+ technology, SRC impact zone provides durable shock absorption at impact, creating a smoother transition from heel to toe. Outsole The traditional shank has been removed to save weight, replaced with foam for a cleaner transition. Complimenting the outsole design iBR+ is a supremely lightweight (33% more lightweight), yet highly durable outsole rubber that enhances the already formidable cushioning capabilities of the shoe. Completing the shoe XT-900 has been moulded to the outsole, offering exceptional traction capabilities and high wear properties. The 16th edition features new updates all centred around improving running efficiency and comfort. Designed especially for the over-pronator, re-align your run in the Hurricane 16s.",
