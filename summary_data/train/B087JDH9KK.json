Its cushy footbed, spot-on fit and sizing, and versatility received admiration and commendation.

Note: I typically wear size 10-10.5 in regular shoes, but the 10s of these chacos were a little big on me. Had to order 9s and they fit great. Just a heads up if one is wondering.",

NOTE: the \"2\" version Chaco sandals have the toe ring, but this can also be tightened down flat if you want to wear without the toe ring...

They fitted my exact foot size and were very comfortable to use in the warm 81 degrees weather. I wore these shoes for the entire time of our trip which was 7 days and I have no complaints at all.",

My husbands ( this pair) ran small and it took a while for him to get the straps exactly right, but once he got the straps right he loved them. It takes a while to break them in. He loves to camp and hike so these have came in handy for his trips! When he got them wet they didnt rub blisters on his feet like other sandals have. Over all these are perfect for outdoors.",
