One thing to note: I have the 14 oz. and my hands are medium sized, the thumb enclosure is exactly at the tip of my thumb. If I had large hands I don't think these would fit. Go for the 16 oz. if you have larger hands.",

Gloves are very comfortable with great padding but not too much padding where it feels like you're punching with a pillow. They are also the most inexpensive gloves I have bought. My Rival R11 gloves were amazing. The only difference is I can buy 3 of these for every 1 pair of the Rival gloves and these are just as good. Very happy so far and can't wait until they are truly broken in. That's when the fun really starts.",

My only complaint is the thumb is a bit tight. Other than that definitely worth the money. I got 16 Oz gloves in blue. The quality is superb for the price point. Definitely recommend these, especially for the money.",
