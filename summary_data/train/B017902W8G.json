When I checked the other side to run another strap, the strap had ripped from the strain on the door edge. This is a new, high end door, well finished and certainly an easier edge than a 2x4. I ran another strap and the same thing happened. Maybe I got a bad batch but I am disappointed. I used rope to secure the door.",

That released them. The straps are narrow, and are of too course a weave for the clasp (my interpretation of the problem). But, they are cheap, so you can't expect great quality.",

I have not had them under heavy load to know if they can slip worse, but the material is extremely strong. I am using them to tie down 10'4\"x31\" kayaks on j bars. 12' is a good length to easily get them over and have enough of a tail to tie off. The original 8' straps that came with my j bars were too short. The carry bag is nice to have too and has space for even more straps. I am very happy with this purchase.",
