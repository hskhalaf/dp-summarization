Programming it was easy - it automatically works with Xbox, so it was just a matter of following the instructions to set the volume/power buttons for the actual tv. My one complaint is that there aren\u2019t any \u201cspare\u201d buttons; I used the \u201cstop\u201d button as the power button for the tv, but it\u2019s not that big of a deal since there\u2019s still a working pause button.",

Make no mistake, the X Box is not the most convenient of interfaces for Blu Ray, but it makes no sense to buy a Blu Ray player when this does it just fine. So the remote is well worth the money. The only downside is we have a Fire TV that is more Bluetooth controlled, not IR, so this remote can't be programmed to raise and lower the volume. But that is a TV not a remote issue.",

It takes a lot of time to get the buttons from the tv remote to program on this remote, but once it's on there it works. Also, there is no TV power button, I couldn't overwrite another button for this feature either which is annoying.",

There were no markings indicating where or how to open the case. That's the first time a product has simply been a total failure for me. So i'm out about 15 USD, I tossed it in the trash and got on with my life.",
