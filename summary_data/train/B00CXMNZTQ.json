I fit 4 decent sized catfish filets in there without over doing it. Checked the thermostat with a grease thermometer and it seems to be about 15*F cooler than the actual temp. Overall very pleased. One minor complaint, but not enough to deduct a star, the unit can come unplugged very easily. It's a safety thing so I get it, but still aggravating. ***If this review helped you out in any way, please let me know buy clicking below!!!",
