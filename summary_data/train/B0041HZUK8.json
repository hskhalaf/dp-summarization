Very fortunate to have stumbled upon it.",

I do have to say, I mix this in with another chocolate meal replacement shake, so I can't speak to its taste on it's own, but I will say it really enhances the chocolate richness of my regular shake. This is one of the only ways I get protein and I'm glad I ordered it. I will definitely be sticking with it.",

The price is reasonable, but I stretch my budget by mixing Naturade Pea Protein with cheaper, worst-tasting brands to improve the flavor of my smoothies. I can pronounce all the ingredients and it is made in the U.S.A. It has more sugar (fructose) than other brands; another reason I combine it with other brands.

    "description": "Flavor:Vanilla\n\n \u2022 The Naturade research and development team is proud to introduce Naturade Pea Protein. Pea Protein is a natural plant-based protein that is derived from yellow peas (Pisum sativum), also known as \u201csplit peas.\u201d This product is highly soluble, easy to digest, hypoallergenic \u2013 and it tastes great! Naturade Pea Protein is formulated using only the highest quality pea protein isolate available. Its phenomenal amino acid profile includes nine essential amino acids. Since essential amino acids cannot be synthesized by the human body, they must be supplied by our diets. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and are used by our bodies to support our bones, muscles and connective tissues.\n\u2022 Naturade Pea Protein is all natural and contains no animal by-products, no artificial flavors, no artificial sweeteners and no artificial colors. We use non-GMO pea protein that is 100% gluten-free, cholesterol-free, soy-free and dairy-free. Each great tasting vanilla shake provides an excellent source of vegetable-based protein and is suitable for low-carbohydrate dieters, vegetarians, vegans, children, athletes and anyone needing extra protein in their daily diet.",
