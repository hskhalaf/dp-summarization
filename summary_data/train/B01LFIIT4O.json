I bought this after reading the reviews and tought it I'd give it a try. I wish I hadn't. I have never given a one star review before but I am so disappointed with this scanner. My advice, if you want soemthing quick and easy forget the Doxie. I bitterly regret buting it.",

I don't see that problem at all in the future with the Doxie Q.
