They fit really well, don't move around at all on my foot, the non-slip part gives great traction which is a must for stability if you've had a c-section.",

I wear them almost every night when I'm lounging or cleaning (the only nights I don't are when they're in the wash). I don't actually use them for their intended Barre/Yoga/Pilates purpose, but I'd recommend them to anyone for anything that they need comfort & traction!",

The small dot grips are tightly applied to the outside of the sock rather than being stitched into the interior of the sock that your foot steps into. This is the only sock I have found that does not transmit cold into the interior of the sock via the grips. In cold weather, especially if you wear socks to warm your feet in bed on cold nights, these socks keep your feet warm. The only non-slip socks to wear in winter.",
