      "title": "Disappointing",
      "text": "The noise cancellation is just not on the level of Bose QCs or NC 700 , and the sound is not as good as on the Bose or on Sony 1000XM3. I don't get a seal around my ears (possibly because I wear glasses, but the headphones couldn't answer the question, why pick this over the alternatives? I also had issues pairing with more than one device, and then whilst connected to the one phone, I could listen to music, but when I received a phone call, the headphones couldn't pick it up. Poor tbh, which is a shame because I really wanted to like them.",

      "text": "I was looking forward to the updated model of the pxc 550 which I very much enjoyed wearing. Unfortunately on receipt the hinges on the headphones seemed to creak and made worse when wearing glasses, had to return in the end as the creaking sound overpowered the music! Also seems more plasticky than the previous editions. Save yourself over a hundred pounds and buy the original Model",

      "text": "I returned these because there were two many bugs. A slight move of my head put calls on hold and dropped them. You cannot turn off the \u2018cup\u2019 for calls and so gently brushing it immediately drops calls. I tried various different methods of resetting them via the app but my frustration remained. For such an expensive set of headphones I expected much more. Very disappointed as I really would find a wireless headset useful. I\u2019ve some B&O wired headphones and they are great but not wireless. Maybe it was just my headphones that were buggy but it dropped some important calls so I didn\u2019t have time for it.",

Settings can be adjusted with iPhone\u2019s equaliser in Music so above is not a massive negative. Case is a bit flimsy but is compact - not hard shell. Includes mini USB charging cable and plane cable connector/adaptor. Ear cups feel premium. Light on ears. The extendable arms could have been 2-3 notches longer but personally ok.",

I bought these to replace my aging MM 550-X headphones and I'm not disappointed. Battery life is great and with Bluetooth, USB and \"normal\" audio cable there's plenty of connection options available. I'd prefer a proper on/off switch rather than the ear-piece rotation these use, and after a couple of hours wear with glasses they can be a little uncomfortable. Maybe this will change over time. Overall, can't recommend these enough, already trying to persuade my wife she needs a pair.",

For the price, they aren't that comfy either. They may look it, but the headband pushes through the support and aches a bit on the head. This is the second pair of Bluetooth headphones I've attempted with Sennheiser after using them for decades. Unfortunately, I've now given up with the brand. Time to shop around again. Very disappointing.",

This is a well-documented issue, with seemingly hundreds of buyers complaining about the same problem. The manufacturer seems unable to fix the matter, so the only working recommendation is to use the headphones with the USB cable - when indeed they work. For the price, you can get a lot better than wireless headphones having to be cable-wired into your computer.",

I even bought a hard shell case to carry them protected (the case for the MB 660 fits these perfectly).
