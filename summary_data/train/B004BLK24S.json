There is a little delay time for loading of ejecting that is corrected on a firmware update. Since the player is wireless you get updates and even DLNA over the air! GREAT with also fantastic quality! It's not region free from factory but if you just type oppo bdp-83 region free you'll find a software to download or buy the cable, open the unit and easily install it in 5 minutes to make region free.

Fulfilling the features and attributes which a machine is suppose to have, is why we buy them. Thus the Samsung is worthless, and this OPPO is invaluable. The other reviews pointed out its build quality, packaging, features, included items as great attributes and I can only agree. Thus far there is no fault with this product, and I am a proud owner. I also look forward to taking advantage of the expanded compatible formats avaialble with this machine such as SACD, etc. Enjoy yours.",

I not only use this player for DVD's and Bluray's but also as a player for CD's and SACD's and the upgrade soundwise was dramatic, I could hear a cleaner fuller sound. The picture quality is as good as I've seen anywhere and the look and quality feel of this player is superb. My LCD TV is not 3D so I can't comment on that aspect. I use it to download Netflix movies over my wireless system using the wireless dongle that accompanies the player, and it works beautifully. Highly recommended!",

At first I thought the sound of the 5400ES distinctly superior, but when I connected the audio from the BDP-93 directly to the 11a, bypassing a video processor, the sound was equally excellent. The sound from the BDP-93 seems a bit warmer, the XA5400ES a bit drier. But the BDP-93 plays nearly everything, and I've discovered the joy of HDCD recordings. Operas on Blu-ray can be a delight with the BDP-93.",

Oppo tech support says that's the way it is and will stay until they can get the firmware updated from the Netflix 2.1 interface protocol to the 3.0 version, which supports subtitles and different audio programs.

The player is easy to operate; works seamlessly with the Samsung HT-C7530W surround sound; plays all the movies and audio CDs that the Samsung device could not read. One of the great things about Oppo is that the company has thought about all the small details by even including batteries for the remote control, a wireless adapter, and an HDMI cable.",

Areas for improvements: Need to add Amazon Instant Video, boot time could be a little faster (mostly with blu-ray movies), power-up and startup times could be a little faster as well. These are all minor as I see the same issues with the newer models from Panasonic and Samsung (I like to test these things at Best Buy and Sears).",

This is un-scientific however, I didn't do blind testing or switching to come up with my findings, I just listened to audio I'm very familiar with. I am using the 7.1 analog out instead of the HDMI since my pre-amp is not HDMI capable. Video is great although I'm more an audio buff than video, I'll leave the video to someone else. This player is rock solid and should last many years,",

      "text": "Purchased several months ago from Amazon. Usual terrific service from order through delivery. Amazon always a pleasure. Can't say enough about the 93. All the accolades apply from packing to set-up and use. I have had several other quality players over the years but none can hold a candle to the OPPO! From construction craftmanship, professional feel, and downright \"eye-candy\" great appearence, it is a beauty. Did I mention the audio/video performance? Wow, top notch video and sound that are noticably ahead of the competition. The solid \"thunk\" of the door/tray and the whisper quiet operation also let you know you have something special. If you can find a better machine at any reasonable price, buy it!",

The netflix and youtube are not easy to navigate. Reminds me of computing on MS-Dos. If you don't type exactly the right thing their is no hope. And the typing is slow and difficult.

To help you get a great 3D experience, use our checklist below to ensure that you have everything you need. If you have any questions or want to learn more about 3D, we invite you to visit 3D 101--our center for everything 3D. To get started with 3D, please ensure that you have:\n\nA DISPLAY\nThe first--and most important--item you'll need is a 3D-ready display--whether it be a 3D HDTV, 3D projector, or 3D computer monitor. These displays usually have a higher processing power than older models as they need to display one image for each eye to create a 3D effect. \n\n\nA SOURCE\nWhile your display is ready for 3D playback, you still need a device to read 3D content (i.e., a movie or a show). This source can be a cable box with a subscription to a 3D channel, a 3D Blu-ray Disc player, or a PlayStation 3. \n\n\nCONTENT\nIn order to watch 3D, you will need to get some 3D content. This 3D content will come from the source mentioned above in the form of a 3D program, movie, or game. Please ensure that your 3D movies are in the Blu-ray 3D format, as this new format will provide the best 3D experience. \n\n\n3D GLASSES\nAll 3D HDTVs on the market require Active Shutter glasses to create the 3D effect. You will need to buy one pair of glasses for each viewer. Also make sure that the Active Shutter glasses you buy are compatible with your display--for example, buy the glasses from the same brand as your 3D HDTV. \n\n\nHDMI CABLE\nTo connect your source (such as a 3D Blu-ray Disc player) to your display, you'll need a hgh-speed HDMI cable. Cables with this designation--with bandwidth speeds up to 10.2 Gbps (gigabits per second)--will be able to carry the 3D signal without any loss of quality. If you want to get more information about 3D, shop our 3D products, watch videos, or interact with other customers, visit 3D 101, our customer center about everything 3D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nOppo's BDP-93 gives you universal playback of Blu-ray, DVD, CD, SACD, DVD-Audio, and a wealth of digital files, with solid picture and sound quality no matter the format. With access to streaming content from Netflix on Demand, USB and eSATA ports for your external drives, and wide connectivity including dual HDMI 1.4, this player defines versatility.Manufacturer Warranty:1 year warranty\n\nSee more",
