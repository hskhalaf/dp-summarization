It is the ultimate pain in the butt to replace the bulbs as you have to remove the intake air box on the passenger side and the battery, battery tray and windshield wiper fluid reservoir on the driver side of the truck to get to the bulbs. Also, the more expensive the incandescent bulb, the shorter the life... I installed the Glowteck LED replacements for hopefully the last time for 40,000 hours of use. I'm impressed with the brightness compared to the previous incandescent bulbs. Thanks guys. The quality looks great.",
