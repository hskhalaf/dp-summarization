I had no choice but to sent it back for a refund. It's a great idea, and maybe there's a way to make it work, but without real people that you can talk to to work through problems, it's useless.",

Previous review: I've tried for 3 hours to connect this toy to the wifi thru my phone. I have an iPhone 6 and I watched all the videos, followed all the steps, read the manual, took the phone out of the case, made the screen as bright as possible, turned all background apps off. There is nothing else I can think to do. I'm very disappointed. I'm waiting for support to connect me since I've emailed them. I'll update whatever happens.",

They should have an easier way to set this up, I don't get that you need to changer your router channel, you need 2.4 gHz not 5gHz. Why they don't create a software easy to connect to any wifi. I am going to try from another WiFi network, if it doesn't work I am going to return it. So disappointed.",

    "description": "Talkies by Toymail are a breakthrough simple way to let kids voice chat with friends and family, without putting them in front of a screen. With Talkies, kids as young as 3 yrs old can send voice messages just by pushing a button. Messages are immediately sent to parent-approved contacts. Grownups use the the free Toymail app for IOS/Android/Kindle to send messages to Talkies. Kids can message their friends Talkie-to-Talkie, too!\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\n\n\nTalk with your kids, without giving them a cell phone Using Talkies is a cinch! Grownups download the free app onto their cell phone, and pair the app with the Talkie. Enter in contacts - parents, grandparents, cousins, etc. From there, kids simply press the smiley face on the back of the Talkie to cycle through their contacts and choose one. Then they press the talk bubble to send a message - it's that simple! It's not only great for parents, but grandparents, friends, cousins, military deployments, and so much more.\n\nTalkies grow and and expand with cloud features The new Toymail Cloud expands your Talkie into so much more than just voice chat. With the cloud, your Talkie can play games like hide and seek, send daily songs and jokes, help your child learn words and numbers, and even help them get to bed, or wake up in the morning. You can also unlock physical play so the Talkie will do things like laugh, snore and say \u2018weee!'\n\n\n\n\nSimple, Safe 2-Way Chat  \n\n2-way voice chat with your friends and family. Toys check for new messages on a timed schedule, more often when they\u2019re being played with frequently. Kids can force check messages at any time by pressing a button.\n\n\n\nWorks Over WIFI  \n\nThe free Toymail app for IOS, Android and Kindle lets grownups send messages to WIFI-enabled Talkies right from their phone, and approve friends and family to chat with their child.\n\n\n\nAward Winning!  \n\nThe press loves Toymail too (and we\u2019re enjoying the spotlight of being a media darling)!\n\n * Hailed as \"genius\" by Parents Magazine.\n * \u201cThese might be the coolest toys we've ever seen.\" Brit + Co.\n * USAToday: \"One of this year's top tech toys!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe safe way to chat with kids! Toymail is all about bringing families together. We connect parents to kids, and kids to their friends, in the simplest way possible, without putting kids in front of another screen. Toymail tech goes beyond messaging into expandable content to keep the toys evolving as a child grows and their interest\u2019s change. Our tech is made for physical toys that encourage open-ended, imaginative play.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Startup Describe your product in 3 words.\n\nSimple, Safe, Communication\n\nHow did you come up with the idea for this product?\n\nKids spend 8 hours a day in front of screens. Parents don\u2019t want to give their children phones when they are young because of safety and security concerns. We intentionally built Toymail to be screen-free for health and safety. Kids can use it on their own, with multiple friends and family members, without the distraction of the smartphone screen.\n\nWhat makes your product special?\n\nTalkies are the only product on the market that allow kids to send messages back and forth with their family without using a screen. Our tech is made for physical toys that encourage open-ended, imaginative play. We\u2019ve gotten feedback from working parents, divorced parents, parents on military travel, parents who are either in hospitals or have a child in a hospital, grandparents, aunts, uncles, etc. \u2013 they all say Toymail was made for them.\n\nWhat has been the best part of your startup experience?\n\nNothing is better than watching kids smile as they use our product, and giving parents the opportunity to connect with their children while they\u2019re at work. Nothing is more gratifying and humbling than knowing we are making a difference in the lives of so many families.",
