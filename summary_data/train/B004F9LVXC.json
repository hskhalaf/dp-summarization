      "text": "As of November 2019 purchased from J&R Galaxies, this item can indeed strip/bypass the HDCP from a PS3 console. Some reviews said it can, some it can't, but it definitely did. I had tried a handful (roughly 4) different products to strip the HDCP so I could stream PS3 games and none worked. I am completely happy that this one did the trick. I'm not even using it as an actual splitter. I only use one output so it's essentially an inline filter to remove HDCP. No noticeable impact on picture quality or lag. Does the job I wanted it to.",

For some reason, Spectrum fails to realize that home theaters route audio AND video through a receiver. Their cable box installation guide shows the HDMI routed to the TV directly, with the digital audio going from the cable box to the receiver separately. Yes, this will work, but complicates source switching unnecessarily with home theater set-ups. Installation was a breeze, literally plug and play. Re-boot the receiver and life is good again!!!",

I tried shorter HDMI cables with no luck. I had temporary success by moving the Roku to a different input of the switch, but streaming was choppy and the HDCP Error would usually reoccur. If I hooked Roku directly to the TV it was fine, but my older TV has only two HDMI inputs, so it was not a permanent option for me. BOTTOM LINE: I installed this box between the Roku and the switch and no more streaming choppiness and no more HDCP error.",

A problem with that is, if you wish to record from your cable later on, you must be there to turn it on again, so you must leave it on all day (or night). The problem is that it gets very hot thereby causing failure of the splitter. Here is the easy solution: remove the circuit board from the enclosure, keeping it away from anything metal (short-circuit). To protect from touching metal and keep out dust, drape a cheesecloth over it. That's it! It becomes cool enough to cause no failure. I leave mine on almost 24/7 without any problems.",

I would get an HDCP error as soon as the video started, and I'd have to unplug the HDMI cable briefly from the back of the Roku. I found from searching Google that others had this problem and that Roku support was useless, but someone suggested using this device, and it works beautifully now.",

I'm not sure what the other reviewers are talking about, but mine works fine; I have one HDMI cable going to my TV and the other going to my ElGato. I used it to stream for about 4 hours yesterday without issue. Like the other 1x2 HDMI splitters I've tried this one tends to get pretty warm while in operation, but it didn't get quite as hot as other models I tried. If it had some kind of cooling system I'd rate it 5/5.",

Within a year the splitter stopped working and would no longer power on even after swapping the power cord. While it seems ViewHD's splitters do work for splitting a signal two ways and for stripping HDCP copy protection, (if that's what you're primarily looking for) they don't work as long term solutions. From my experience with these splitters, they will fail within a few months.",

      "text": "I had problems with HDCP preventing me viewing paid for HD content on my computer, even though I am using an HDCP compliant monitor, cable and video card. So I connected this HDMI splitter between the computer and screen, using 2 AmazonBasics HDMI cables, and I can again watch the HD movies I have paid for, all in glorious HD! What the hell are they doing with HDCP...? All it does is make it difficult for honest people who paid good money for HD content unable to watch the movies and TV shows they have paid for. HDCP does nothing to stop dishonest people copying content. I see a class action lawsuit in the future. :-)",
