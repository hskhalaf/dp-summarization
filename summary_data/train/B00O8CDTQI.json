Great price, arrived on time, good packaging. Easy to set up. Makes a fairly loud humming noise when it first starts and then settles down. Very pleased.",

I think I have been more than patient enough with them",

This charger I paid $200 is nothing but junk . Thanks Amazon for helping my throw $200 of hard earned money out the window .",
