It's been rained on a few times, but has not been used to an extreme extent. For a $400 stroller I would have expected stainless steel rivets and grommets to be used and to come with some level customer service. Recommending to all of our friends that they go with the competitive Thule model instead.",

I also find it hard to fold and lock up. My husband has an easier time than me but I struggle with it. Still the best for jogging.",

The BOB pushes so much easier than the Graco $99 from Target I had before this. No comparison at all. The only negative to me is lack of included drink/snack tray and also no handlebar console. For such an expensive stroller these should be included. I bought the handlebar console and it is fine for what it is.",
