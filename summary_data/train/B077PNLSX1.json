The other ones I have go through batteries atleast once a week, and they really only work good for 2 uses, then they just barely curl. This one is a lot hotter, and it stays hot for about 5 days. I have natural lashes and they are pretty long, it's hard to keep a good curl to them, but this curler seems to help keep a curl all day. If you are considering a heated lash curler, you will not be disappointed if you get this one.",

Downside is that it takes a long time to heat up and a long time to actually get a curve in your lashes. I've defaulted to a regular crimper that I heat up for 2 seconds with my hair dryer. Tried and true, and fast. I might use this one for special occasions when I have lots of prep time.",

The lashes are kinda too far apart and makes the spider legs look. Japonesque had more curl less decision of lashes. I\u2019m does work tho. And I do like that it\u2019s rechargeable and looks very sturdy. I will keep it as I don\u2019t want to go throu the hassle. But wished it didn\u2019t separate the lashes so much. Thanks",

My lashes are thick and straight, so I found the \"green\" light (hotter rod) curl better and faster. It definitely works better with mascara, but the down side is the mascara tends to stick on the rod after awhile and is difficult to clean - a problem with any curler though. Overall, I love it!",

Honestly though? Go get yourself an eyelash lift and tint. It will change your world.",

The temp is warm not too hot so there is no real damage on your lashes. It takes up to 1 min to warm up to the lower temp setting. You have to put mascara before applying the heating device. and it takes around 1 min for each eye to make it curly.
