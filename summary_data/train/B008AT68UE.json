My game also had a propensity to freeze certain visitors (and sometimes household members!) on my lot during the full moons, not letting them be reset. Overall, it's an enjoyable expansion.

The Sims 3 has always been known for it's mix of both quasi-realistic life simulation and a heavy sprinkling of the absurd. This expansion lives up to that in spades. It's about the time you're trying to make sure both the vampires and fairies at your child's birthday party are enjoying yourself that you forget the ridiculousness of the expansion and just sort of learn to accept it's quirkiness. Highly recommended. That being said, I would get World Adventure, Late Night, and Ambitions first, as they expand the base game more naturally (pun intended).",

Finally, on my laptop I ran a system reboot to see if that would fix the problem. After I re-loaded the game, it stopped freezing.

One thing I like is that, if you choose to make your Sim a ghost or fairy, you can design the look of the ghost or the fairy's wings. Werewolves are also fun because you can design what they look like in their beast form. So there's a lot of choice in creating your supernatural Sim which is loads of fun if you enjoy getting creative before you play. I'll never tire of this expansion because I keep discovering new features within each supernatural's abilities and traits.",

I can spend hours playing this game,I don't know if that's a good thing, but i guess it means this game is entertaining. I would suggest it to any one who loves the Sims, obviously, but also to any one who likes slower games that include real life play and time. If you have a short attention span and love games where there is a constant boom Sims may not be for you.",
