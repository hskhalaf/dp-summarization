It's very comfortable and lightweight, and offers great protection. I would highly recommend it. In fact, it impressed me so much I purchased one for my wife.",

A few more rides and I'm sure I'll get used to it. I really do like the helmet a lot and for the price I was skeptical. Great purchase I couldn't be happier.

Pros: Value Construction Chin strap location is perfect Adjustable visor Cons: Fit I ordered an XL based on the measurements I took from the Demon website. My big head measured 62cm and the XL seemed tight. I'm guessing after a few rides the padding may settle. I would recommend getting the next larger size.

It's not significantly heavier than my Giro Montaro helmet. I got it because I'm an old guy that has busted my face up mountain bike riding and have been perfectly happy with it so far.
