The pan I just received no longer has the metal handle so you can't put it in the oven. It is MUCH lighter than the pan I am replacing. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PAN. It is a cheap substitute for the former pan and it's performance",

We haven't been babying the pan either, and the quality seems evident compared to another faberware skillet we purchased around the same time. The faberware pan has a bit of flaking all over the rim of the pan, this t-fal does not. And while the central surface of the faberware isn't peeling, it's much more prone to bonding to foods than the tfal. Overall, it's not perfect, but it's not expensive and has performed better than all my previous pans at higher and lower price points.",

I'll find a small nonstick for eggs somewhere else, and stick to cast iron/stainless steel for regular cooking (I can almost nail a classic french omelette every time on a stainless steel pan anyway, so the nonstick might not be in my future).",

Haven't run into any issues with gunk building up around the rivets inside the pan, which is a nice change from a previous set that were good other than that flaw.

Subsequently I find myself turning the heating element up higher to achieve the same result. I don't know what prompted the design change (cheaper to manufacture?) but they've gone backwards in heat transfer efficiency. So, overall, I'd say I'm disappointed.",
