      "text": "I really like this book, some very interesting recipes. To be clear - this book is vegetarian, not vegan. As a result, eggs are used in some dishes. So, it isn't completely plant based and they may need to re-examine the title. I knew what I was getting, so I wasn't disappointed in that. However, if you are vegan - not all recipes will work for you. But, there were some interesting and new takes and simple dishes and so far things have worked well that I tried. Again - know what you are getting. This is NOT a vegan cookbook. But, if you are trying to make a transition, it is a great book for your journey.",

The recipes are boring and quite bland. I tried a few and always end up having to double, triple the amount of spice listed and add my own. I collect cookbooks, but this is something I can do without and you probably can too. The glowing reviews are confusing. The recipes are not innovative or inspiring. That tends to be the case with vegan/vegetarian books, maybe because the pickings are slim. I suggest taking a look at 22 Day nutrition by Marco Borges instead.",

The pictures are gorgeous and every dish looks delicious, YUM! I'm super proud of Jessica and Wendy and I love how they make healthy eating fun since it's somehow seen as being boring and weird. Can't wait to see what else they have in store for the future!",
