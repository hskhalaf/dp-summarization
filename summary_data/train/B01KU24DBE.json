I break that into little bits and feed them whenever she's just \"good\" outside or of she runs up to her food cabinet in the kitchen and taps on it to let me know its treat time. They smell delicious too, but I know I'd be in trouble if I started eating them in front of her! One other thing: Annie has a very sensitive stomach but she's never had any problem with these for the years she's been getting them. Every dog is different, but I'd highly recommend trying these based on our experience with them.",

Most jerky type treats are too hard in texture for him. This is the only treat that he consistently enjoys. Hope Full Moon continues to make these treats forever!",
