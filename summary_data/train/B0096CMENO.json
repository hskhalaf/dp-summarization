I was and still am very happy with this purchase months later. The unit can be a bit loud on a hot day if the fans really kick in it's a bit much but I have it in my bedroom. If it were in another room I don't think this would be an issue at all.",

It's running a bit slow with 7 Windows VM running but at one point I had 15 Linux Lubuntu VMs with no issues. I will be purchasing higher RAMs in the near future just to accommodate the my 7 Windows. I will definitely be purchasing another one! Customer service was great too. I had a question and they quickly answered it.",
