Added some water to drip tray to prevent burning/smoking. Note: The fastener for the glass lid handle is \"hidden' in the cardboard/carton packaging. You have to look for it.",

Surface areas, ok, but in the hard-to-reach places, not so ok. I'm not sure DeLonghi could improve the design to overcome difficult cleaning issues.

      "text": "I decided to include more lean protein in my diet and grilling fish and chicken with minimal use of oil seemed like a healthy option that was tasty as well. The DeLonghi indoor grill has exceeded my expectations. It does take a bit of time to heat up, but once it does reach the temperature, it maintains it quite well. I have never had uncooked or undercooked meat/fish issues. The clean up isn't too much of a mess either. The construction is remarkably good for the price and it is modular enough for cleaning all the parts. I'll not think twice about buying this again or recommending it to friends.",
