When his old belt sander fell off the table and bent the rollers, it was panic time as he needs a belt sander every single day. We considered a battery powered unit but opted for the plug in for more power and reliability. He says the cord is extra long so not a problem in the shop. Bottom line this is highly recommended tool from a high quality Japanese company, do not hesitate.",

After going through two torn belts, I finally was able to keep the belt on track, but noticed that after just very little use, the sanding belt was off track again. For an item this expensive, and coming from Makita, I guess I expected too much. I have a $65.00 craftsman belt sander that does a much better in keeping the sanding belt aligned. If you happen to have the same experience I did, I'd recommend you return, and look for a better product...I wish I did.",

      "text": "This belt sander is awesome. Belt tracks very good plenty of power. Pay attention or it'll sand a hole right through your project before you can say shoot! Only thing I didn't like 5 stars worth is the dust bag. But I brought this to rough sand glue ups and dirty rough sawn boards before I run them through my planner. So the dust bag doesn't bother me for that.",

      "text": "This Makita sander is a real work horse , tracks fine, belt changing a cinch, with only one negative comment. Makita you folks really need to relocate the dust bag ! At first I liked the location, and it felt pretty comfortable . But when I use the sander its like an extension of my hand, in other words I'm all over the place and the dust bag keeps falling off! Better yet instead of relocating the bag find a better way to secure it that's all thanks",

I used it on a huge teak swim platform and did a good job; With any other sander I would still be there sanding !! not a happy thought in freezing weather !!",
