Most triple strollers are joggers with no turntable wheels or your toddler rides on a platform. With this stroller, everyone has a seat. It's perfect for neighborhood walks.",

Maybe a mall is best for a stroller like this. Not good for outside use.",

We did notice the breaks began to rub against the wheels, so we just took those off and that was also a real simply fix (the break bar on the rear wheels still functions without these). This was a great stroller for the cost and fit in our van and wasn't overly heavy. Unfortunately the rear axle broke after 3 months of use. Thankfully it had a 1-year warranty and so we returned it.",
