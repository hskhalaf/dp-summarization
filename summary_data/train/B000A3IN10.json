The thermometer works reasonably well, although one of the bubbles dropped to the bottom and has just stayed there.

Thermometer is clear and easy to read, and it\u2019s fun to watch the bulbs lower and rise with the temperature (which has been pretty accurate). I love the globe barometer - it is beautiful and functional. Both items are a great conversation piece, and they are a visually engaging way to keep track of the weather. The glass is fragile, though, so make sure you put it somewhere it isn\u2019t likely to be bumped into.",

The globe barometer is impressive as well. We have it near a window and in the time that we have owned it, it has been very accurate in predicting poor weather. I would love if the base came in different finishes.",

While this item requires some assembly, including the purchase of food additive and distilled water for the barometer, is is a beautifully designed piece that relatively accurately responds to temperature and pressure changes. Unlike some other 'innovative' decorative products that employ elementary physics, this item is made with quality and certainly makes a great gift.",

The thermometer seems to work perfectly. The barometer; however, has not worked as well as we hoped. It's possible that because we filled it a day or so before a storm came in that it started at the wrong level. It's been three weeks and we are not yet able to establish a pattern between what the barometer does and what weather comes.",

    "description": "Style Name:Barometer SetThis attractive set features a Galileo thermometer, which reads 64-80 degrees F. When the temperature rises, the liquid inside the glass tube becomes less dense and the liquid-filled bulbs sink. When the temperature cools, the process is reversed and the bulbs rise from the bottom. -- Variations in barometric pressure associated with weather systems are immediately revealed by the water level in the spout of the glass barometer globe printed with a frosted world map. A low level of liquid in the spout indicates high-pressure and fair weather can be expected. A high water level is associated with bad weather. -- In cases of severe weather and major storms, the water may even run out of the spout. Both the thermometer and the globe are mounted on a sturdy wooden base.",
