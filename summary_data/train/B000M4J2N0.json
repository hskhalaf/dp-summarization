I love the fact that you can see the speed and f.stop when the shutter button is partially depressed. This tells me what sort of focusing (f.stop function) I can expect and I can decide if the f.stop need to be adjusted a little. The battery life is great too. It survived several road trips. I haven't taken very many flash pics, so not sure what to expect here, but so far, great camera. Big screen is nice too, pics are sharp on it.",

Wonderful pics that I upload to my pc and send to my local store to print on their laser printer. The software that came with it is very easy as well for editing and turning into close-ups. Only bad thing is I didn't get a case for it right away and let it rub against my cell phone in my bag and sort of scratched up the LED screen - but it's completely unnoticable when shooting. However, I recommend some sort of case for it...",

Anywho, these cameras have gotten high marks by all concerned for their ease of use, diminutive size, and excellent pictures. I highly recommended these cameras for the pedestrian shutter bug.",

The menu is great too, when you scroll thru things, it tells you what it does so you don't have to memorize it all. Takes fast pictures, but not one after another, like I was hoping. But it does open fast. Don't be fooled by the big memory, you will still need a larger card. Depending on the size pic you want, you can take about 30 to 50 pics on the memory alone. But all in all I love this camera and it was a great buy!",

My one complaint with it though, is that when you hold down the button to take a picture it shines this red lazer light into the eyes of the people getting their picture taken and then it goes off...and then it snaps. So not only do they have to squint and hold their pose but then the red light tricks them when it goes off and they start moving about just as the snap actually happens.",

The one thing that this camera lacks is capturing in dark situations. When it is dark the pictures often become blurry with wierd streaks of light. Besides that I love this camera...it is tiny so it fits anywhere...it is durable (trust me i have dropped it several times)...and the battery stays charged for long periods of time.",
