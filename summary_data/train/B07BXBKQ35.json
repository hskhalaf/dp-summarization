The light turns on 30 minutes before the alarm itself goes off, and the light becomes successively brighter. I don't usually wake up from the light, but having the light in my face when I first open my eyes has worked wonders in helping me get out of bed. Save your money, and buy this model.",

So it has to get very loud before it gets quiet again.",

If you hit the snooze the light stays on so it\u2019s really hard to actually snooze but that\u2019s a good thing. I have mine set to music and that starts out low and also gradually increases like the light. The only thing I don\u2019t like is seeming the time/alarm. Buttons are hard to use. This clock has been a life changer. No more being shocked awake. I wake up feeling refreshed and happy. Love this alarm clock. Definitely recommend",

To do this, I expected it to gradually start at 1% brightness and build to full brightness at wake up time. Unfortunately this does not happen. 30 minutes prior to wake up it jumps straight to a very bright level, maybe 60% and then slowly builds from 60-100 over the next half hour. This is a problem because it wakes me up every time since 60% is still really bright! My other complain would be the user interface is very old and inefficient. It certainly is manageable, but if you're not technically included you might be frustrated with it.",

      "text": "I was excited about this clock at first. The light was a great way to wake up, nice and gradual, felt much more natural than a blaring alarm. The sounds are poor quality and functionality is a little old, but the clock was cheap and I only really cared about the light. It was bigger than I expected. It worked great for about a month and a half, but now the light doesn't come on at all at the set alarm time. I logged on here to return it, but it looks like it's too late. I wish I could get my money back.",

Now it does not work anymore. First the snooze button stopped working and the alarm wouldn\u2019t go off a second time. Then the alarm didn\u2019t sound at all. Now the lights and the alarm sound do not work. I am VERY disappointed as I really liked this at the beginning.",
