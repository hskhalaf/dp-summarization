As a novice climber, it is difficult to get a good feel as to what feels \"ideal\" for a new shoe. I am certain they will stretch once I wear them a few times on the wall, but as of right now, when I stand, my toes are pretty uncomfortable. Other than that, the arch support and grip are wonderful! Every climber will tell you how uncomfortable a good climbing shoe can be at first. Therefore, I am giving these a bit to break in before I panic and purchase a larger size.",

I know climbing shoes are supposed to be tighter, but these were basically an entire size off compared to the chart. I am normally a W 6.5 maybe a 7 in normal shoes but when I ordered the 38, the US size on the tag in the shoe was a size 6. I just reordered according to the men\u2019s sizing and I am hoping the 39 or men\u2019s 6.5+ will be just right. I feel like just ignoring the woman\u2019s size on the chart and just going off of the men\u2019s and EU sizes will give you a more accurate size for the women\u2019s shoes.",

I wear an 8 1/2 shoe, and I intentionally ordered a larger size that I can even wear with socks (size 40.5). I know this is not ideal for rock climbing, but at least my feet are comfortable. Had I ordered according to the size chart, I think they would be true to size without socks. I would only recommend these for a beginner rock climber. A stiffer shoe would definitely be needed for more advanced climbing.",

I personally appreciate the velcro strap style; it allows for more adjustability in the overall tightness of the shoe. I am new to climbing and am no expert at how these sorts of shoes are supposed to fit for the professional, but I am very comfortable in them and they seem like a perfect starting shoe. They also look pretty cool! I have used them twice now and suspect they won't take too long to break. Climbing is awesome!",
