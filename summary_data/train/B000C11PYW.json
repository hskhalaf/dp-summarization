I added some slime, and it slowed the leak down to about 2-3 psi per week, which since I have a 2 hp compressor in the garage is no problem. Most interesting is that the leak has become slower as time progresses and that when first getting up to highway speed there is a noticeable imbalance in that tire, but only for a few miles.",

      "text": "I had a slow-leaking tire that had gotten to the point where it needed to be filled with air once every week. Order the Slime, put the whole 16oz into the tire when it was deflated (the tire is on a Lexus ES300 sedan), filled it back up, and haven't had to put any air in it since. It's been about 2 months and the slime is still doing it's job, so I couldn't ask for anything more.",

    "title": "Slime 10011 Emergency Tire Repair Sealant, 16 oz. (Car/Trailer)",
    "description": "No more flats! Slime's Emergency Tire Sealant seeks out and instantly seals tread area punctures in automotive tires up to 1/4\" (6mm). When a puncture occurs, Slime\u2019s patented sealant is carried directly to the source. The pressure of the escaping air forces the particles into the opening, where they build up and intertwine to form a long-lasting, flexible plug. Instantly, air loss is blocked and a flat tire is prevented. No jack is needed to repair your flat tire, and the sealant is safe and easy to use. Don\u2019t rely on roadside assistance (which can take up to an hour to arrive, leaving you in a dangerous situation) or on your spare tire (which is usually cracked or flat from lack of use). Instead install Slime in any of your highway vehicles (including cars, trucks, SUVs, RVs, trailers and much more) when you get an emergency flat tire to get back on the road quickly and safely.",
