Just lift the cover, remove the thin protective tab, turn the small switch to ON and close the lid. **For best results, lights should be in direct sunlight a full 8 hours. Great thing about these is that they have two features: as hanging lanterns (with a side clip) and as pathway lights. My backyard is very dark. So for starters, I placed them 5ft apart just to see how much light they give off... perfect :) I'm very happy with these little guys and I will purchase some more for the front yard.",

They charge quickly and give light until the wee hours of the morning. We have them hanging on shepherd's hooks between plants. A perfect touch at a price much less than others I looked at.",
