It's durable and there's no tearing at all and I'm not particularly gentle with it.,",

Spacious inside for folio, laptop, accessories and one night's clothing if needed (I even fit a pair of dress shoes in for one trip!). Two negative comments; one, it's tall - taller than it needs to be for any 15\" or 17\" laptop. Two, small items like USB drives get lost in the outside zipper pocket, which has a welt seam along the bottom and deep corners.",

It does fit in the compartment in the bottom/back near where the handle follows down the back; unfortunately though that section is not padded and so I am not comfortable placing the laptop in that area.",
