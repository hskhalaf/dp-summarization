      "text": "Gave this cute playground to our two granddaughters aged 1 year and 3 years. The 3 year old absolutely loves the trampoline and the bar to hold on to while jumping is perfect and she feels very comfortable jumping. The little one likes to sit on the trampoline while big sister jumps. Since she has to hold on to the bar still to jump, it is safe for the 1 year old to sit behind her while mommy is closely watching. It has been a big hit. Happy Grandmother!!",

Total junk at this point! If they were offer a refund, I would gladly take it apart and send it back! Hopefully Royal Blue Shipping Corp helps me with at least a replacement part..",
