What they should also mention is that you should get really high grit sandpaper (3000 and above) to make your life easier. I did a wet sanding with WetorDry 600 sandpaper, and wish I had bought a higher grit. It doesn't look bad, but at certain angles you can tell that it's not how it originally looked. Coating it with the spray is also pretty difficult to do evenly. I have purchased the heavy duty one for my family's car, and will try that one to see if rubbing the clear coat is better than spraying it on.",

The second step is the one that makes your light covers clear as glass. 2. There's enough here for at least two pairs of headlights. I used less than half to do both front lights on my Toyota. 3. Yellowed light covers is only reason for dimmer lights. The bulbs themselves begin to fade. Don't expect miracles from this product. It's certainly cheaper than replacing your lights.

Take you time, when you finish, it should look 'frosted' from edge to edge. Again, clean it up very well, let it dry. When the spray hits the headlight, you will not believe how great it works.

I recently read about this stuff and finally pulled the trigger to get it done. This worked great, really impressed. Just taped off my headlights, applied the compound and rubbed it all over the lens for a few minutes. Wiped it off, let it dry, and then sprayed a couple of coats of the protectant. Bam. Clear as glass again! Will it last a year as promised? Don\u2019t really care since it was so easy to fix. Good stuff.",

I finished up with the Meguires spray and it took it up a notch. May have looked the same using step one of Meguires but I was hesitant. I\u2019ll stick with 3M",

My son has an old mustang n I will give this a go on his headlights but I\u2019m suspicious I may need to use the extra strength product . If you make a mistake you have to smooth the surface out to then reapply but this is such an easy process nothing overwhelming! Good product and at a great price",

Previous owner used a scouring pad on the bezel leaving annoying scuff and scratches. Tried several cleaners without any improvement.
