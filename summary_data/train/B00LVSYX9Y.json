      "verdict": "With its great display, brilliant camera and attractive, colourful design, the Nokia Lumia 930 has most of what you'd expect from a top-end Windows Phone device. It's battery lets it down though and with an unimpressive selection of apps still available from the Windows Phone store, a high-end Android device with a good camera will likely be a better option for many of you.",
      "pros": [
        "The Nokia Lumia 930 has a crisp, bold display that makes Netflix shows look great, its camera is up there with the best and its metal and colourful plastic body will turn at least a few heads"

      "cons": [
        "Its battery life doesn't impress, it's quite a chunky beast, Windows Phone 8.1 doesn't come with the Cortana voice assistant outside of the US and the platform still suffers from a mediocre app selection"

      "text": "This is the best Windows Phone out there! Plus, at least in my opinion, Windows 8.1 is better than ios and android. It is much easier to sync with your PC and you can actually do more with the windows phones. The camera is awesome, diffidently one of the best. This phone has top notch hardware which it doesn't even need sense the os is so efficient. If you're looking for a Windows Phone, this is the one to go to, as long as you have the money to spend. Otherwise I'd highly suggest going with a mid range Windows Phone. It will still seem pretty fast and fluid.",

Easily holding it's own against the best Samsung and Apple has to offer. I've had zero problems using this foreign phone on AT&T (internet, SMS/MMS messages, Internet Sharing, Visual Voicemail, etc.) It all works. I don't miss the LTE in the US at all (HSPA+ is faster than my home internet... so not a problem.)",
