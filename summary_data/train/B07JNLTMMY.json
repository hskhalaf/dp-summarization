The cooking surfaces are very easy to clean, but make sure not to use any utensils or cleaning products that may scratch them.

My husband, who said we didn't need it as we had an outside grill, was the first to open and use it. He now insists we store it out on the counter. He cooked something that wasn't very fatty so haven't fully tested it yet, but my S-I-L, who has tested it, says that as long as you remember to put in the required water, it works beautifully. We're looking forward to some pork chops this weekend - and we won't have to worry about it raining!",

      "text": "Made our family bbq activities easier. We use it a lot in daily life. My kids love it. It does what it is supposed to do. I had some concerns before I buy but, after testing I concluded that it functions very well. The small pans are also cooking nicely. We are very much satisfied as a family with this product. Just a suggestion, if the edges are made a bit higher it would be better to cook very oily stuff. The addition of a drip tray would make it perfect.",

I was skeptical about it being smokeless, but it is actually smokeless, even when we popped in a piece of marinated pork. The heat is strong enough to grill anything eatable. Great product and absolutely love it. Highly recommend.",

Hamburgers are delicious! Steaks were not as delish as outdoor grilling, but I didn't expect them to be. But, they were good and I will use a thinner cut steak next time. Chicken breasts were delish also. I use a lot of lemon pepper, Tony's Creole Seasoning, and garlic which makes everything even better!",
