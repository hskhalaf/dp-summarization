Tool description says 210 ft lbs, which seems a good margin for lugs that are mostly at 90 to remove. I should have got the next size up at 720lf lbs. If I could return this, Id buy the bigger version, but alas I tossed the box out of excitement of finally owning a battery impact wrench!",

The impact wrench was loose in the box and the tool had rub marks on it that makes it look either used or beat up during delivery. It seems to work fine, but one would think that a \"new\" Makita tool would be packaged properly like a \"new\" tool. It wasn't advertised as a refurbished item, but that is the feeling I get when I look at this thing. I don't mind refurbished, but I like knowing that up front.",
