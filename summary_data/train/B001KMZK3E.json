      "text": "I love my Electric Patriot Chipper/Leaf Shredder. It is quite powerful - there are no stinky gas fumes. I have used it a lot over about a year and I really don't have a complaint. It uses every bit of the 14 amps as it chips through limbs. I use up to about 2\" limbs. It likes hard wood versus soft, spongy wood like live willow branches, but that is true for all chippers that I have used. I would definitely recommend this chipper as part of your gardening supplies.",

And when I re-fed the chipped materials through the shredder, it reduced the time necessary to turn the materials into compost. Some of the reviews made me hesitate to buy this shredder, but now that I've used it I can't imagine why those reviewers had problems (except the guy who had problems feeding branches through the top hopper - they go in the side cone).",
