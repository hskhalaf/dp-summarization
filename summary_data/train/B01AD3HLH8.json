I set up this beautiful table only to embarrass myself because the thing did not heat up enough To cook anything. Thank God I had my barbecue so I took all the meats and I threw it on the grill. This machine was useless and I\u2019m so disappointed because it\u2019s been so long since I bought it and I\u2019m sure I can I get my money back. Waste of money. I have used our raclette machine before, and I know how it supposed to work. This thing did not warm up enough not even to cook One side of the meat.",

      "text": "Overall: 4.5/5, would buy again. Pros: - The whole system is easy to clean. - The variable heating is pretty neat; I think it's worth the extra cost. - Wood finish isn't real, but it looks nice. Cons: - The cord is a little short. Raclette is best served at the table, and you'd have a hard time connecting the grill to a wall outlet without an extension cord. Having said that, I think most other brands have the same issue - The stone took a little while to heat up, like other reviews have mentioned, but that's to be expected. I haven't tried the aluminum cooktop, but I imagine it's faster",

So disappointing, but I wanted to give them a chance to make things right.

We went with the stone, which takes some time to warm up, but once ready, does a good job of searing and cooking. The heating element also does a great job of melting cheese below the main surface. Only negative I would say is that there are a lot of parts to clean and storing of the product is a problem, as the box it comes in is pretty flimsy. Overall, I would recommend this as a fun way of entertaining guests.",

We took the griddle off the top and it\u2019s easy to clean surface washed right off in the sink. What a great way to entertain a 4-8 group of people.
