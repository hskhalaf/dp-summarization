The installer has a number of non-inuative things, such as pop-ups that cover required entries, warnings that don't appear as warnings, and status bars that aren't a status, they are a warning that you made an illegal entry. I did not rate tech support because I never got hold of them. The hours (4PM to 6AM Pacific) aren't user friendly for someone on the East Coast. BUT .... once you get it set up right - it's a very good repeater. The speed and signal quality, even across different floors of the house, are very very good. I've had it up and running for several weeks now and it just humms along.",

Very Easy Setup. Using with an ASUS RT-N66U router (one of the \"older\" ones). Really like the signal-strength indication on the front - makes it easy to determine proper placement.

A few days ago, the outlet that connected to the current due to a bad welding was taken out and I had to repair it. I do not recommend it at all.",

After I went to the D-Link Website and downloaded the July 2017 firmware and installed it on the extender, though, everything worked properly. In our house, our master bedroom is too far from the main Wi-Fi router to for the signal -- particularly the 5 GHz AC signal -- to be strong enough for our phones or Echo devices to connect to it, and this has resolved that issue.",
