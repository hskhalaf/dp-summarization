If you are in a position where your wrist or arm is in constant contact with the edge or outside it doesn't take long to see what I mean. I ended up with lines on my arm and even once a scratch on my wrist. I generally order more expensive mouse pads with smooth sewn edges, guess I will go back to that!",
