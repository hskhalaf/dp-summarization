Got 10 nests today and nothing got me but they sure tried. I wore jeans, sweatshirt, and rubber boots with it just in case. It was 100 degrees and I did sweat. Sprayed them, knocked down nests, and swept them up with no problems. I'm 5'9\", 135 lbs. and I'm wearing a men's large. Again, these were hornets, not bees, and it worked fine. I thought the price was great.",

I'm tall (6' 5\") but the fit was ok. The netting on the hat goes all the way around... Good for air flow but the fit caused the netting to lay against the back of my neck. Was just waiting for a bee to land back there and decide that was a good target. Solved that issue by laying a towel across the back of my neck inside the suit. So far, good value for the price. Will very likely purchase another.",

I am 6'1\" and 200 lbs., it was plenty large enough. The material is a heavy canvas, so I would advise wearing a sweat shirt or sweater underneath in situations where bees are in attack mode. The veil had good visibility. I wear a ball cap underneath it and it helps keep it from shifting around - anyway probably not a problem. The pocket on the front is useless as every time one bends over, whatever is in the pocket falls out.",

I would advise using the suit in the early morning hours anyway, as checking the bees is a little easier in the morning before they go foraging for nectar and pollen. After a season, the suit will be covered in bee frass (poop) and be discolored, but this is to be expected.",

I have had this this pull over for around 3 months, and the veil screen ripped, while I was pulling it off, rendering it useless. The screen on the hood is not well constructed, and the built in hat sits on either the front part or back part of your head, allowing bees closer access to either your neck or head. It is less than $25 for a reason.",

Pros: Thin / light weight material makes it good for hot temperatures. Cons: 1. When you sweat the veil sticks to you, a potential risk for stings. 2. The elastic at your wrist allows bees to get in if one doesn't wear gloves. 3. The head gear doesn't fit around the crown of my head but I guess one could wear a cap underneath.",
