      "text": "If you're looking for a double stroller for running, parks or any other outdoor activities then this is the stroller for you! I've got three kiddos (4, 2 & 10 mo) and needed something to go on runs/walks because my CitySelect was just not maneuverable on the paths. The jogger is so easy to steer and use and allows my larger 4 year old to sit comfortably when she gets tired. If you're looking for an indoors stroller (malls) then the CitySelect is preferred because it can fit through smaller areas whereas the Jogger will not. Our front door is larger so the stroller fits right through. Definitely look at measurements and what you want with the stroller before buying!!",

Just go ahead and save yourself, buy a baby Jogger over the cheap one you already have in your cart. Your welcome.",

This is heavy and difficult to lug out of the trunk and unfold without practically dropping it. Overall compared to cheaper basic strollers, this is well made and I'm happy with the purchase.",

When you fold the stroller there is lots of potential to scraping and scratching up so many different places of the stroller, it drives me crazy that this thing doesn\u2019t fold inward, and can\u2019t stand up on its own. Had I known these things I probably wouldn\u2019t have bought it.",

Also the back tire was going flat right away so baby jogger overnighted us a replacement which we appreciated a lot and it was super quick and easy to change the tire. The missing star is for those little things and also it's not always as quick and easy to fold and unfold it sticks sometimes- and lastly the stroller doesn't fit easily through all normal size doors it feels like if they made it half an inch narrower it would!! But still we are very happy with it and our babies seem to be too.",
