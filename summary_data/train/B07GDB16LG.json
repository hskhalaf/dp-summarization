Really really recommend this drone. its my first ever drone and i am over the moon. You will need 2 extra batteries, you think you wont but you will, just to keep flying whilst other charges. 1/2 hour battery life goes quick if your learning. Im still learning controls but have picked up speed now, next to master the camera.",

Dji were great and said sent it to amazon for replacement. Amazon said fine. We\u2019ll let you know in 48 hours regarding the replacement. After waiting and then chasing they said no we can\u2019t replace just return. But having used this drone. When it works it\u2019s awesome.",

Easy to fly, quality build and excellent software. Flew for the first time last night, got 27 minutes flying time on one battery. Took some superb RAW images. Will test the video on the next non stormy day. Highly recommended if you can justify the price.",

It is clear that they are not demos and that they were taken by a private citizen while in his house and in his garden. Since images of people are covered by the Data Protection Act, there is a clear privacy issue here related to those photos and videos. I have seen private contents that, of course, I am not responsible for. I am going to return it.",
