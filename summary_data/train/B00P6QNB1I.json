After the first use of this shampoo and matching conditioner, her hair is soft and healthy looking. Her hair doesn\u2019t look the least bit greasy. She recently had to go to a camp with no showers. Even after 3 days of not washing her hair, it was still healthy looking. This is a keeper. It\u2019s helping my daughter\u2019s confidence not to have greasy hair. Scent is pleasant too.",
