I fear its going to break sooner than it could if the proper connector was used. **Update** 2/25/2015 The right ear bud is now not working well. The general volume is slightly lower than the left, and it hisses and is scratchy at times. Time to send them back... I've only used them for a few weeks! **Update** 3/1/2015 I continued using them before sending them back, and the right bud is not working again. I don't know what to do with myself now...",

I use them for talking on the phone hands-free, listening to the television through the remote control so my husband doesn't need to hear the tv on, and listening to music on my iPhone when I'm going for long walks. The only down side is that the microphone needs to be held away from my shirt when I'm talking on the phone, so it isn't very \"hands-free\" when I'm walking around with it (not a problem when I'm driving). But I would definitely recommend these earphones.",

Love that the earbuds come with options to make sure you get that good, comfortable fit. Recommended for exercising, traveling, etc. I have a wireless pair that I love for the convenience, but the sound and ear fit aren't quite there yet.",
