Was really excited with how the app allowed me to integrate the fan with my thermostats to control the temperature in my bedroom. BUT THEN....they removed those features from the app. I contacted customer support and was notified that \"The haiku L-Series Fan does not support SenseMe capabilities.\" Lovely, advertised a feature that I bought the fan based on, and then took it away. Downright theft! Just get a decent regular fan with a remote because the smart capabilities of this fan are limited to telling alexa to turn it on and off. Big whoop! RIP Haiku Smart Fan Dreams",

BAF must have been impacted by China tariffs, but they have a dumb pricing model. They can still be a premium product but you can\u2019t tell me this much plastic is worth the same as a new iPad Pro....",

After 4 years and multiple routers, it's the worst smart thing in the house. Haiku should fire every single software engineer that write this smart software.",

It also has variable light settings, good thing cuz the high setting is pretty bright. Best of all it seamlessly integrates with Alexa.",

The Haiku is incredibly quiet and the installer did not have to spend time trying to balance the blades. Absolutely gorgeous. To be able to control it from an app via wifi is a bonus.",

The fan's app is not user friendly, constantly updates for no reason, and the settings have to be reset. Now it won't even recognize the fan! It is now either on or off and won't connect to wi fi.
