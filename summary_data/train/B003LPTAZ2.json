Bad: I bought my pair in November of 2013. The vinyl foam cups are already starting to fall apart into pieces. Plus, when I bought these new and took them out of their packaging, the smell of the vinyl was absolutely overwhelming. It had a very bad chemical smell to it that smelled up the whole apartment. After about a week, it finally started to clear up. Please start using better quality (and non-toxic) vinyl with this product, Sennheiser.",

I'm a Dj and fortunately for me, I won't be wearing them over the top of my head but will have just the left one up next to my left ear so the design won't really cause me any problems. For someone buying these to actually wear for long periods of time, get something from Sennheiser that's an over the ear and you'll be much happier. The sound quality is awesome for the price point but the design is poor.",

Stretch them out, put them on a ball overnight a few times and you will be fine. Only people with the biggest heads will complain and mine isn't small. Also, pull out the extender on the head band a bit and they wont hug your head as tight. Overall sound quality is good. I would say they are failry balanced with the highs, mids and lows. Bass is there, but nothing deep or textured. With a decent audio source, these are definitely good for the $50 price range.",

I think the best thing about these is that the closed design is great if you dont want anyone else to hear what you are listening to. They are tight and the cans are smaller than most Sennheisers, and they can cause your ears to become sore after a couple hours of use, but after you get used to them and break them in they are not so bad.

Overall a great pair of headphones and i would recommend these for anyone on a smallish budget.",

The ear cups do not seal in the front and the cups only pivot about 10 degrees. Only one side has the pivot hinge. Very disappointed and will be returning these.",

Worst though is that they came with a defective swivel joint on the left phone. Even without that defect, the joint seems very flimsy. I'd recommend getting one of the solid strap models. HD 202-II is a much better pair of headphones for ~ half the price.",
