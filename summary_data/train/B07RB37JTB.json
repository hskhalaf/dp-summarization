      "text": "At first, I was very impressed by the sound quality considering these are \"budget\" earbuds. I didn't mind then and now disconnection issues as well, this is a new technology. But I have three problems: 1. It is a pain for a person on the other end a phone call. Microphone takes every sound available... 2. If the volume is a bit high and you are in someplace relatively quiet, people will hear what you are listening. 3. After a while, you cannot ignore the buzz sound coming from them.",
