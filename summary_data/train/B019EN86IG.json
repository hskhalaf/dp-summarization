Would like to see a swing out ruler to replace the serrated blade and a small 1/8\u201d or less wide straight screwdriver blade to replace the stupid bottle opener nobody uses. Hope somebody at leatherman reads this, swing out ruler and small straight screwdriver would make this and awesome tool.",

Doesn't feel to small or big. Definitely purchase this if you're thinking about it.",

To press the safety release button you need to grip the tool in a way where your fingers or thumb are in the way of the blade/tool's path. The lack of grips looks clean but is hard to handle. The metal edges hurt your fingers. The wire cutters blades are replaceable parts that are bolted on inside the pliers. This would be a really cool feature, but they aren't a snug fit so the blades move a bit and don't cut clean.",
