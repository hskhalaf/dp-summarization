At this stage is worth zero stars because after the update it simply does not work, it's been more than two months now, so it's safe to say Playground Games and Microsoft would not bother to fix it.",

The only design flaw of the tracks is that it makes it easy for bad driving on-line players to get a really fast car without any grip and smash into you on the corners and make you miss going through the check points.",
