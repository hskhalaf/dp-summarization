We set it up on Saturday morning and now four days its still only 9 1/2\" tall, and even less on the corners. The corners didn't expand fully on the top and bottom and offer NO support. It's also more firm than medium firm as advertised. Maybe if it actually expanded to 12\" inches it would be softer. It does have an odor, but it's not terrible and hopefully will dissipate. I've contacted the company by email to see about having it replaced, but haven't heard anything yet. Will update this review once resolved.",

My husband and I are certain it helped her a little bit with the move. She LOVES the bed. She is 88 years old & not techy at all. This was the best bed for her. My sister in-law slept on it when she came to visit her & she was very impressed with the bed. I was expecting the bed to be more costly but it was a great price & was easy to set up when it arrived.",

      "text": "After a year+ of owning, I still like this mattress, but I have some issues with it. It does not break in uniformly is my biggest complaint. One side of the bed sinks in, while the other side is still pretty firm. The edges stay nice and firm compared to the rest of the bed, so you will find yourself migrating to the middle of the bed. I would also suggest getting a mattress pad as the mattress itself now has a smell from absorbing sweat. I expect to be purchasing another mattress in a couple years based on current condition.",

      "text": "We have been trying to find the perfect mattress and finally we found it in this one! We previously had a pillow top which was uncomfortable and so we added a memory foam topper. With both of those it was so heavy and tall we couldn't enjoy it. We got rid of both of those and got the Lucid and love it. Ordering, delivery and set up was easy. We opened it and let it expand in our living room for a couple of days. It was easy to move into the bedroom using the plastic that came with it and the smell was very faint and gone after a couple of days. Would order this again in a heartbeat",

Although it said to open it and wait 48 hrs for it to expand and air out, it only took about 3 hrs to expand with no odor and my wife and I slept on it that night.",

The reason we wanted to replace it is it breaks down and after around 2 years of use the thing is overly soft and at about 5 years you are left with a very indented unconformable bed.

The bed wasn't bad until recently and I personally think they should disclose in their information that no warranty replacement until there is a sag greater than 1.5 inches. That basically means they expect you bed to sage at least 1.5 inches and they know it will happen. With only the top 4 inches of the bed being actual memory foam they expect almost a 50% sage in the most important part of the mattress.",

    "title": "LUCID 12 Inch Gel Infused Memory Foam Mattress - CertiPUR-US Certified - 10-Year Warranty - Queen",
    "description": "Size:Queen| Style:2019 Model Medium MattressThe LUCID 12 Inch Memory Foam Mattress has a medium feel that combines a soft comfort layer and the support of high-density base foam. The 3 inch ventilated gel memory foam top layer is softer and lighter than other memory foams. LUCID foam adjusts to your individual pressure points to relieve shoulder, neck, and back pain. Memory foam also helps to isolate motion transfer between sleep partners. The bottom layer is 9 inches of high-density base foam that offers deep support. The soft TENCEL blend cover creates a breathable air layer at the top of the mattress. Our foam is CertiPUR-US certified, which means it has been independently tested for safety of materials used, physical performance, and environmental stewardship. Careful construction guarantees no prohibited phthalates, no ozone depleters, no CFCs, no mercury, no formaldehyde, no PBDEs, and low emission (VOCs) for indoor air quality. All our products are shipped vacuum-packed, so your mattress is easy to transport and setup. After your mattress arrives, simply take the package into the right room, remove it from the box and protective wrap, and then watch as it expands. Mattress cover may vary from picture in pattern and color",
