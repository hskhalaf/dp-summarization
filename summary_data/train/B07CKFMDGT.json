Because of that I have tried several different testosterone boosters and estrogen blockers and out of all of them I noticed the least difference in this particular one. Energy levels did not change. Did not increase desire to exercise. The horny goat weed herb levels must be particularly low because no difference whatsoever there. I have found that if you buy the $12 bottle of horny goat weed extract. And a $10 bottle of the cheap testosterone booster here on Amazon , take it separately, makes a world of difference. Hope this helps",

The FDA estimates that 5 million American men may suffer from Low T, but only a fraction are treated.\n\nSymptoms may include:\n\nLow sex drive\n\nFatigue\n\nReduced muscle mass\n\nInability to concentrate\n\nLuckily Low T is treatable, but the problem is prescription remedies are dangerous for women and children and can cause your body to actually reduce natural T production.\n\nThat is why we developed PRO T. With only the highest quality, proven ingredients that give your body what it needs for improved energy and Low T support.\n\nYou might be asking, what is the difference between ours, and other test boosters on the market?\n\nOur PRO T contains only the most potent and natural ingredients you need to boost T levels, without any potentially harmful 'other ingredients' you find in other products, at a fraction of the cost.\n\nSee, there is an ugly little secret that the supplement industry does not want you to know.\n\nMost test boosters provide low amounts of low quality ingredients that only address part of the hormone balance equation.\n\nAt Prometheus Wellness, our premium test booster provides clinical doses of research-backed ingredients focusing on hormone balance, including an estrogen blocker as well as test boosters.\n\nFor example:\n\nVitamin D, Zinc, and Boron Citrate: Scientifically proven to support testosterone production\n\nDIM (Diindolymethane): A proven estrogen blocker\n\nHerbal energy support: Such as Ashwagandha, a popular adaptogen\n\nThat's it! No unusual ingredients. No fluff or filler. Just ingredients you need for results.\n\nSupplementing for Low T support no longer needs to be confusing or frustrating. Go with the brand you can trust will \u2018tell it like it is\u2019 and give you products you need for results!",
