      "text": "Just received and put together. Pretty easy to do. It looks good, and the color is similar to what is pictured. Its a dark blue -- like a dark unwashed denim more than a navy blue. So far it seems comfortable and stable. Obviously its relatively cheaply made but from a distance you wouldn't know. We'll see how it holds up. The several large silica packets it came shipped with broke during shipping and made a huge mess, so that was frustrating. The box is pretty cumbersome, but the chair itself is light and easy to manipulate.",

I use a throw pillow in addition to the included pillow to support my back it\u2019s comfortable and I can read or watch tv in it. I did scotchguard the chair since I have multiple dogs. I expect it to last quite a while.",
