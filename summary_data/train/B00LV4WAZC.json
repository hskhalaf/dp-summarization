To my disappointment, the set I have most recently received are not only same sheets, they are a different color and a completely different material. Even the hems are different. The sheets aren't soft and all they are is microfiber. Even the tags are different, the little one is the original. It's false advertising to hit \"buy it again\" if the company does not sell the same product. In each photo the one on the left was the original purchase.",

When I opened the royal blue set to wash, I loved the brilliant color however, after washing, although the color did not fade, the sewing quality sure did. Along with fuzz balls, which didn't bother me too much, was the threads coming loose from the fitted sheet and that is totally unacceptable. I also did not care for the thinness or texture of the material. Microfiber is definitely not for me nor is crappy seamstress skills.",

For $29 - maybe this is a deal - we are used to $100+ sheets, and these are NOT even close to the quality of sheets in the hotels I sleep in: Hilton Garden, Holiday Inn Express, Hampton Inn, Marriott Courtyards - so no - these are not Hotel Luxury Bed sheets.",

They feel Horrible to the touch, very cheaply made and see through when I put them on the bed. I would not recommend these sheets to anyone. I packaged them up right away and went straight to the return button. Plus, I'm being charged five dollars and some change to ship them back for a refund. DO NOT BUY THESE!!!!",

The array of colors allowed me to ideally match each bedroom color scheme. The fit has been consistently perfect even on extra deep mattresses - the fitted sheets are easy to put on the beds and they stay in place because they're ample in size. I love the softness of the fabric and even my 10 and 12 year old grandsons noticed and commented. My own sheets are now several years old and are wearing well. And, \"last but not least,\" the price is unbeatable! I highly recommend this product.",

The stitching on the elastic band is ripped. I with they were like the 1st pair, but they are not. I may buy them again and take them right out of the package and look. Disappointed.",
