It seemed to provide all I was looking for - subtle detailing, good padding and waterproof lining. I ordered a size 8.5. The length was good and I had plenty of space there. I also have fairly slender feet. These trainers were incredibly narrow and painful to wear. There was no point getting the next size up, because they would still be too narrow. It's a shame because it's a good looking shoe. Avoid.",

Quality: grip was fine, but I think very similar to Speedcross4, the Goretex kept my feet dry until the water levels came over the top. will have to see how they hold up compared to the 4's in time. Bad points (for me): Laces. With the 4's you lock the system and forget about it until you are done. I was conscious of the laces and with muddy gloved hands, or in a race, I don't want to worry about laces!",

Lighter weight than my other Salomon GTX and more flexible. Closer to a running shoe than a trail running shoe. That is exactly what I was after. Very satisfied.",
