I have another canon point and shoot (A630) and it does not have any problem even after 6 years and 10000+ shots. The image shows a lot of noise and grain from ISO 400. Color does not look good in most settings. The auto mode usually overexposes the images by 2/3 or 1/3 stop. Face recognition worked well and the size was perfect for regular carry. It gets 3 star for image quality compared with a similarly priced competitors product and canon A630.",

We love that camera, but admittedly, there are times that it is simply too large for the situation (i.e. restaurants, doctor visits, etc). That said, We bought this SD630 one month ago and LOVE it for those occasions. The only niggle: It seems to create a great deal of redeye due to the close proximity of the flash blub to the lens. That said, the red eye reduction mode helps out a bit, and photoshop or picasa can remove redeye 95% of the time. I heartily recommend this camera.",

I love the simplified controls and fast start-up. I also like the small size--great for packing light on vacation trips. Picture quality is high so there's a lot to like on this camera. I wish Canon would add a couple of small rubberized strips on the camera to prevent slippage. It might not look as sleek but I would feel more confidant handling the camera when outdoors, especially in cold weather.",

Second, the camera offers no warning that the battery needs recharging, it just shuts down. So, it pays to have a second charged battery handy.

One big con of the camera is the red eye, with the reduction button my son and daughter always get red eye. Which leaves me to take it out with a computer program, which is a time inconvience. Besides that it is wonderful, if you don't mind taking the red eye out yourself.",

    "title": "Canon PowerShot SD630 6MP Digital Elph Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (OLD MODEL)",
    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe ultra-thin, ultra-stylish PowerShot SD630 Digital Elph offers a full range of enhanced shooting features that make taking pictures more comfortable and more exciting. A marvel of Canon engineering, this compact powerhouse has a super-sized 3.0-inch LCD screen.\n\n High resolution and superior comfort\nStylishly elegant yet impressively powerful, the PowerShot SD630 Digital Elph has the resolution you need to produce magnificent full-sized prints and on-screen images. The high-quality Canon 3x optical zoom delivers the clarity and sharpness that make even the smallest details come to life.\n\n Better shots, easier replay\nPowerShot SD630 Digital Elph incorporates a big new 3.0-inch LCD screen for a truly eye-opening view. This high-resolution screen offers a crisp, clear picture and wider viewing angle to make shooting, playback and using the camera's menu functions especially convenient. And when you're shooting at dusk or at night, the Night Display function lets you see the display clearly. It brightens the object while you compose your shot by reducing the frame rate on the LCD screen.\n\n Canon innovation enhances your experience\nThe PowerShot SD630 Digital Elph features new ISO 800 and High ISO Auto settings that reduce the effects of camera shake and sharpen subjects in low-light situations with high shutter speeds, giving you greater flexibility for shooting.\n\n Advanced imaging technology improves every photo\n\n DIGIC II Image Processor\nCanon's DIGIC II Image Processor is designed to improve processing speed and image quality, so DIGIC II provides markedly faster startup, autofocus, and playback, plus it assures that every image is more colorfully vibrant.\n\n iSAPS Technology\niSAPS Technology is an entirely original scene-recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos, iSAPS works with the fast DIGIC II Image Processor to improve focus speed and accuracy, as well as exposure and white balance.\n\n Shoot and view wide images\nThe PowerShot SD630 Digital Elph includes a 16:9 widescreen resolution option, producing images and film clips that are perfect for your widescreen TV or computer monitor.\n\n Superior quality movies\nFast Frame Rate Movie Mode allows you to record extremely smooth, full-motion movie clips for up to 1 minute long in QVGA at 60 fps (320 x 240 pixels). With a highly flexible movie mode, you can create the movie that's perfect for any application. Select from VGA (640 x 480 pixels) and QVGA (320 x 240 pixels) with frame rates of 30 fps and 15 fps for recording up to 1 hour or 1 GB. Plus Compact Movie Mode (QQVGA; 160 x 120 pixels) records at 15 fps for up to 3 minutes. \n\n Shooting Modes\nAdvanced presets for the best possible photos under certain conditions \n\nAuto: The camera chooses all the settings so you can concentrate on your subject. Manual: The ultimate in creative control, you set ISO speed, exposure compensation and white balance. Portrait: The camera sets a large aperture, focusing the subject and artistically blurring the background to make your subject \"pop.\" Foliage: Capture brilliant shots of autumn foliage, greenery and blossoms. Snow: Shoot clear snow scenes without darkened subjects or an unatural bluish tint. Beach: Get clear shots of people at a sunny beach without darkened faces. Fireworks: Grab brilliant images of skyrocketing fireworks. Underwater: Capture underwater images with reduced backscatter effect. (Note: Optional Waterproof Case WP-DC4 required for shooting any underwater images) Indoor: Reduce blur and improve color accuracy when shooting handheld indoors. Kids and Pets: Reduced focusing time freezes fast-moving subjects, so you won't miss those special shots. Night Snapshot: Get natural-looking pictures with brighter backgrounds and subjects lit by flash. Color Accent: Choose to retain a single color in your image while other colors turn monochrome. Color Swap: Select a color and replace it with a color you specify for special effects. Digital Macro: Shoot larger-than-life close-ups with one-button simplicity. Stitch Assist: Build awe-inspiring panoramas by neatly aligning sequential images. My Colors\nVivid: Yield vibrant shots with dramatic high-contrast.\nVivid Blue: Emphasize the sea, sky, and other blue areas.\nVivid Green: Add vivid dimension to greens for extraordinary nature shots.\nVivid Red: Charge up red objects in your images for extra impact. Neutral: Produce images of subtle, elegant tonality. Sepia: Recreate the look of vintage photographs. Black and White: Deliver enhanced clarity--especially useful when shooting text. Positive Film: Combine \"Vivid Blue,\" \"Vivid Green,\" and \"Vivid Red\" to achieve a positive film effect. Lighter Skin Tone: Make your subjects' skin tones lighter. Darker Skin Tone: Darken skin tones a shade. Custom Color: Finely adjust brightness and vividness, and set your preferred balance of blue, green, red, and skin colors. The complete print solution\nThe PowerShot SD630 Digital Elph's Print/Share button makes direct printing easier than ever. Simply connect the SD630 to a Canon CP, SElPHY, or PIXMA Photo Printer or any PictBridge-compatible photo printer, press the lighted Print/Share button, and print! Also use the Print/Share button to transfer images to a computer (Windows and Macintosh).\n\n Connect the USB interface cable to your Canon digital camera and a PictBridge compatible photo printer. Press lighted Print/Share button. You'll have long-lasting, professional-quality prints in minutes.\n\n Print your own ID photos in 28 different sizes or use the Movie Print function to output multiple stills from a recorded movie on a single sheet with a Canon SELPHY Compact Photo Printer. (Printers not included--must be purchased separately.)\n\n What's in the Box\nPowerShot SD630 body, Lithium battery pack NB-4L, battery charger CB-2LV, SD memory card SDC-16M, wrist strap WS-600, Digital Camera Solution CD-ROM, USB interface cable IFC-400PCU, AV cable AVC-DC300",
