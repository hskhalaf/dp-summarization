The Atrium 6 has much better bass (big sound difference).....and also note: while it does not say in the amazon description, it says on the owners manual - the Atrium 6 (and larger Atrium) - have a back port for 3db greater bass response. And it does. The Atrium 5 did not.....So, if you like deeper sound - purchase the Atrium 6. Great for late night jazz. ....also, i got a good deal off the open box WAREHOUSE DEALS with amazon.",

They need to make the recess larger, or angle the binding posts more. Not really an issue if permanently mounted, just use spade lugs, or even clamp the wire. But if you want to move them around, that's much more difficult than simply using a dual banana plug. Dinged one star for poor design.",

These replaced the pair of Bose 151 (not the SE) I had installed in the patio; They were okay but It was hard not to notice the lack of uniform, full rich sound. Thank you Polk for the Atrium 6.

      "text": "I read a ton of reviews and based my decision to purchase a pair of these based on all the positive comments... I couldn't agree more with all the five-star reviews! These speakers have tremendous depth of sound with clear highs and strong lows. I was originally concerned about how well they'd fill my screen porch (25x20 feet) with sound, powered with a Sonos Connect Amp. However after getting them wired up and powered, my concerns were unfounded as these speakers sound amazing! All in all, I'm completely happy with my purchase! I'll report back with how they handle the Minnesota weather.",

I can put something like an acoustic guitar solo on, and everyone is completely blown away by the sound.
