      "text": "I absolutely love this cash box, it's not too big not too small, even has a place at the top to properly store coins. The only downfall to this particular cash box, is that while it does lock, the lock can be easily \"picked\" so I suggest putting it somewhere no one would check to look for it. Also it doesn't have the option to \"lift up\" the cash drawer (as others do) so I have to keep my $100 bill underneath my $20's. That isn't a big deal however. I would recommend this cash box to anyone looking to use it to save money at home vs putting it in the bank (such as myself)",

      "text": "It's okay, BUT... the downsides of this product: The coins fall out when transporting if you don't hold it perfectly upright. Lengthwise, the dollar bill slots are very narrow, bills fit in a bit too snugly. Because the length of the bill slots are small, sometime you have to 'push' the bills under the clip and then they get 'pinched' by the clip, making it easy to tear a bill if you pull to remove it. The bill clips are stiff, I've used my box only 4 times and one of the clips that hold the bills have already come off. This box fits the purpose (until I find something else) but could be designed better.",

Sadly I wasn't able to return it, as the lock was removed by me (to get my cash out). Save your money or order a better quality item.",

The black tray does not sit solid in it's space, it often falls down into the gap below. The 2 starts are superficial and just based on the way it looks - it feels and looks durable...even though it's not. So perhaps since the lock is so crappy you can fake people out by thinking it really is durable. hah! Short answer - Would NOT recommend unless it's for casual use...like your kid's lemonade stand or something. But not for any real uses like a secure petty cash fund or business use.",

      "text": "Super happy with this. I had ordered one without a latch about a year ago and it was making me crazy always coming open! So I went back to the drawing board and this was perfect. I don't need my bills separated at craft shows, but I DO need the dang thing to stay closed while hauling it about. This is light, stays shut, and just what I wanted. Agreed that the lock isn't awesome, but that was not what I was after. I don't think a lock is of much concern if someone nabs your cash box it hardly matters what tiny lock it has.",

In fact, I cannot hold this thing by the handle because it just pops right open. The metal is sturdy, the metal clasps and spring are really study (be careful a finger doesn't get snapped), but that locking mechanism won't even keep the box closed, let alone locked.",

Unfortunately I was wanting as a way to store my savings and each slot doesn\u2019t hold very much money. I was able to get approx $1,500 in each slot so this isn\u2019t for you if you are only wanting to store money.",
