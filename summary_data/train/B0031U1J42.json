The Story mode will teach you most of what you need to know to play the game, and then there are a huge number of skirmish maps. The main things i like about these are: - Many different maps - The Tactics you employ need to change depending on the size of the map, as well as the number (and difficulty) of the enemy teams Good game and at this price an absolute steal.",

It runs smoothly, with very few bugs. I'm very pleased with it and I think it's got great potential. A lot of people don't like the game, just because it's not Forged Alliance again. Yes, it's a new game.",
