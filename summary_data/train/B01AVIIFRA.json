I will say though, be sure to really change it every 30 days! I waited a few days, thinking it was no big deal, and there was a small burn mark in the wick. It makes sense, if the wick can't suck up any more liquid and it will start to burn. I wouldn't say it's a safety hazzard if used properly- so use it according to their regulations! It's like letting a pot of water boil dry- you're going to burn your pot!",

I finally figured out that it was the diffuser--the device was pretty warm and had a nasty smell of burnt plastic. I don't see any visible melting of the device, but the smell was unmistakable. Thankfully Amazon it letting me return it. I hope the manufacturer addresses this issue because it's a fire hazard.",

But yesterday, after putting a new container on the diffuser, it started to smell like burning.

      "text": "Tried this because my cat is compulsively licking the fur off her belly and legs. After being plugged in a couple of hours, the diffuser smells strongly like burnt toast. It was quite hot to the touch. I was not comfortable leaving this plugged in overnight or unattended...which is large portions of the day when I am at work or asleep -- and times when my cat probably needs soothing the most. I am not confident this product is safe. I tried it in 2 other outlets, and it did the same thing. When I asked about it, other users reported no odor -- so I suspect there is something wrong with this one. I returned it with no hassle.",

It makes medicating and transporting him nearly impossible, and lately it's gotten worse to the point that even brushing him (which he used to love) has become a challenge. This morning I plugged in the diffuser. This afternoon my pumpkin happily let me brush him while he rolled around and purred. I'm thrilled. I've always been worried about how his anxiety would affect his health in other ways, and I tried other methods for calming him, but for a cat who quickly gets suspicious of medicated 'treats,' this worked really well.",

It is being used in a very small bedroom where the kittens are with window closed and door slightly open. Yes the diffuser does get hot because it heats the oil. So i recommend monitoring and using for a couple of hours at a time, and replace refill when oil is low. Thankfully, it arrived in two days.",

    "description": "Size:48 mlIs your cat peeing outside the litter box, scratching your furniture and carpet, or hiding on a regular basis? These behaviors may be caused by fear and anxiety. FELIWAY products are a vet recommended, drug free, and clinically proven to help alleviate many of the unwanted behaviors cat owners deal with. FELIWAY CLASSIC provides \u201chappy messages\u201d by mimicking the natural feline reassuring messages (pheromones) to make cats feel calm and comfortable at home. This product has been found to reduce scratching, spraying, and hiding for 90% of cats, and many owners see results within 7 days. Cats are also very sensitive to change, so if you anticipate changes in the home (moving, renovation, recorating, new pets, new family members, etcs.), FELIWAY is very effective in helping your cats remain calm, and adapt to the changes without unwanted behaviors. The FELIWAY Classic Diffuser Kit includes one diffuser, and one refill vial. You should plug your diffuser in the room(s) where your cat spends the most time - each diffuser covers up to 700 sq. feet. Make sure your diffuser isn't covered by curtains, or behind furniture. Each refill can last up to 30 days. For maximum effectiveness, you should replace your diffuser every 6 months. Make sure to follow the instructions when plugging in your diffuser, and plug the diffuser in upright.",
