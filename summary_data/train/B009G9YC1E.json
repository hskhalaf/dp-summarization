Unfortunately though it didn\u2019t last the week and now I spend my mornings picking up all the loose foam. My Dane doesn\u2019t chew but \u201cnests\u201d where she\u2019ll dig around until she gets comfortable. Maybe this bed would work for non-diggers but very disappointed it was so expensive and tore so easily.",

It\u2019s somewhat more expensive than previous beds, but definitely worth the cost because of high quality. We also love the modern look.
