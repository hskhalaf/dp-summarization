Really you should get a warm compress pack and leave that on your eyes for about 5-10 minutes once a day in addition to using drops so that you open up your tear ducts that can easily get clogged. However, this product will ensure long-lasting, moist eyes and not cause any side-effects. I've never had any burning issues and you're going to get a product that has a long shelf life too. The ones I ordered expire next year, which was much better than a homeopathic alternative I tried from another company that expired 1 month after I bought them.",
