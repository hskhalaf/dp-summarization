This is less effort to swing than an 8 pound maul. If it isn't enough power to blast through with one stroke, the axe does not seem to do much toward a second (or third) strike split. I think it is better suited to dry wood or smaller rounds. Most of my wood splitting is done on 20\" rounds that were live trees within the previous few days. This has MUCH more power than a simple hatchet, but less momentum than a maul.",

Considering the hardness of the wood and how eucalyptus is cross-grained, I am very happy with the tool.

The head is moderately heavy with a fine tip, coated head, that quickly expands to split and help prevent the head from burying itself in wood and becoming a real chore to pull from the wood. Works better then any other I have ever purchased, and I normally split about 2-3 cords of wood every year for the last 10 years. Hopefully this axe will survive at least 3 seasons - if so, it will be well worth it.",

I liked it so much I bought one for my sister in law who splits her own wood. She loves hers just as much as I love mine. It will even split wood with knots. Not even my trusty axe can get through some of those knots. Great product. Lifetime warranty. Good enough for me!",

One size does not fit all! 4 stars because after a few days of splitting 12-18 rounds of red oak, counted at least 8 burs. Not steel savvy or expert but that is troubling and NOTHING but wood contacted the blade.",

When I first received it I did not think it was going to be very efficient at splitting the oak and mesquite I use for firewood. Seemed to me that the head was somewhat on the smallish side. Wrong again! Works wonderfully, is well balanced, and doesn't seem to have as many \"glancing blows\" as some of the heavier splitters I've tried. If you have not already done so please use Amazon Smile as your default page for shopping here and I would greatly appreciate your designating Wheat Cutter Foundation as your charity.",

After further use, he said it works very well. He said fine tuning the edge with the Fiskar's blade sharpener I gave him with it really made a positive difference. He really likes it.",

It's almost too easy, I'm losing the ability to get a good workout in splitting.
