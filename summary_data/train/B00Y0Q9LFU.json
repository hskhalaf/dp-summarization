Pathetic for a pair of headphones at this price. I was concerned about the cable as soon as I took it out the box since it feels flimsy. And the sleeve is where you grip it to insert/remove the cable, so that should be the strongest part of the cable.",

      "text": "The P5s sound wonderful, BUT they would only \"pair\" briefly and spasmodically with a series of three transmitters. First, I returned the transmitters as I assumed they were the problem. After the third transmitter I reluctantly had to accept that the P5s were the problem. As an experiment, I bought a \u00a315 pair of wireless 'phones. They work straight away, every time! The P5s have a very limited range, my \u00a315 'phones are hugely superior here. However I will probably buy another pair of P5s at some time in the future and hope they work.",

First tried over Bluetooth and not loud enough so then tried them wired, they were a bit louder but still no where near loud enough. So not doubting the quality but they are very quiet. Kind of disapointed.",

      "text": "straight to point it is my personal review it may help next person.Sound is good but not brilliant for \u00a3200+ it should be brilliant. I have used it on my htc m8 and my Hi End HI FI I do not wish to enlist my equipment.Mids are good bass is good but there could be more punch. Treble is soft to medium there is no attack. Comfortable for half an hour to an hour not for prolonged use.I will keep it purely for looks and feel also comfort over sennheiser m2. Sound compared to sennheiser m2 little bit better but i had to return m2 to amazon because of sound and comfort also price point. good luck",
