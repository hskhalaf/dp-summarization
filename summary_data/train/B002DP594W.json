In addition, I noticed my lesser headphones needed twice the volume that these headphones require, which translates to less battery usage for portable devices.

I would not mix audio with them, but I would listen to mp3s. I don't think they try to replicate the true range of sound, but to give you the range you typically end up turning up on your ipod anyway. Bass and treble! Still covers the mid-range decently though.",

The only criticism I can give is the overall design leaves a bit to be desired. They are larger than some of the other options, and the cable connects to both ears instead of just one.",
