      "text": "I bought this to go with my wireless magic keyboard for iMac. Although it looks similar in appearance from the pictures, there is a significant thickness to it as well as entirely made of plastic instead of metal. The magic keyboard is about 8mm thick, this keypad is 20mm thick. It runs on one AAA battery that is included with the keypad. I am disappointed because It doesn't match the magic keyboard at all. I am keeping it because it does work well. Bluetooth connection is flawless and setup was a breeze. It will go in a drawer until i need it. It's not something that I will leave on the desk next to the magic keyboard.",

It looks great beside my keyboard and is, only, slightly higher on the lower end. The key placement is similar to my old unit and is easy to use. Yes, it is a bit clacky (noisy) but I am not an accountant. I like the positive feeling when I press the keys. Besides, I am not using it in the bedroom, so I am not worried about keeping my wife awake. For the money, this is a great find and I highly recommend it, unless you can afford the real deal.",

Not the same feel as an Apple keyboard, but good enough to do the job. The \"000\" key is an interesting option I haven't had before but I can see it will be useful. I'm running MacOS High Sierra, and when you plug it in it tries to recognize the keyboard. Just choose any key when you are asked to press one - there is no key next to the left shift key on the pad. The OS will say it doesn't recognize it. Choose one of the standard keyboards (in my case, US) and then it will work.",

I use a short keyboard without a number pad, so I wanted separate Numeric Keypad for when I need to do accounts and that sort of thing. I tried one wired and one wireless keypad from APAXQ. They were cheap, but I ran into problems. Neither of them had a CLEAR or DELETE key to instantly clear the display on the calculator app. It might be my fault, but I couldn't get them to work with the stock Mac calc - had to download another app. So, the iHome is light years better for me.",

The clear button didn't seem to work but that doesn't bother me. Also, the cord is a bit shorter then I would have liked, but it does reach to the Right side of the computer so it works! :)",

If you want something that matches and feels like your Mac, then I would keep looking. I purchased the Satechi Aluminum Finish USB Numeric Keypad (for the same price) knowing it was going to be plastic. It feels so much more like my mac keyboard and doesn't have the clunky feeling of the Ihome.",

      "text": "I bought this numeric pad for my MacBook Pro 2013. While the keys do not feel as sophisticated as those of the laptop, I do not find it bothersome at all as mentioned by some reviewers. In additon this should not be expected given such a low price. The unit works and looks as described and was functional the moment I connected it to the laptop. I would definitely recommend it.",

I'm sure that over time I will get used to this, but it's slightly annoying until then. In defense of the seller, this is visible in the picture.",
