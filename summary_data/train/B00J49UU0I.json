He has owned it for 3 months now and plays with it constantly he enjoys all the sounds, having his very own little chair to sit in and it talking to him when he does. He enjoys raising the seat and having his on little stash.He is a climber so of course he uses it for that. The worst problem is my grand daughter just started potty training him and yes he used the wrong chair.I like the chair because of all the adjustments to teach them and it grows in teaching with them while they play.",

She also loves to sit in it when she's eating her snacks or watching her favorite show Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood. It's the perfect height for her as well. It also prevents her from wanting to climb the other furniture in the room which is a big plus! It's been about 3 months now that she has the toy and she still plays with it everyday. I'm very happy with my purchase and highly recommend it! :)",

It also offers some catchy songs, with a few educational elements. The one thing I would note is that the storage space under the seat is very small. Really just enough space for a couple of board books. One other big positive is that the sound isn't too loud. The little guy can be in the seat playing music and we can barely hear it on the other side of the room. Still, a great value for the price!",

He loves to lift the seat up and down to hear it say \"up\" and \"down\", and he loves hiding things in it. Sometimes I will hide things in it for him to find later when he plays with it, and he always is delighted to find an unexpected treasure!",
