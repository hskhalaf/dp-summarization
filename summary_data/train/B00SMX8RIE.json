      "text": "This is my third Buckmasters II scope ... I replaced a much more expensive, ultra-long range scope that was mounted on my Mossberg MVP Predator 5.56mm bolt rifle with this scope, which is more appropriate for the caliber. Being a Nikon derivative scope the glass is excellent and low light collection is superb. The scope zero'd quickly and it didn't take long to set up the dead-hold BDC dots. Although Nikon Spot-On isn't intended for the Bushmaster scopes I'm able to get pretty darned close with the dope I put into the system for the rifle and custom loads I shoot... Nikon & Bushmasters have teamed up to produce a useful and affordable series of scopes. Good job, guys!!",

Never dropped, carefully kept, never bumped. I refuse to accept that a piece of equipment designed to be mounted on a rifle, cannot withstand less than 250 rds over the span of one year...
