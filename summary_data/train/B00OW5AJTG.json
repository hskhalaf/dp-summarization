When hooked up to a decent vacuum, practically no shavings or dust escape. If I ever need to use it freehand I can remove it from the jointer frame in about 5 minutes. I don't see any reason why this planer wouldn't produce excellent results freehand. I'll update my review when I've had an occasion to use it that way.",

The planed edge would be the edge I place up against the table saw fence to ensure I'm getting straight pieces of wood. It was the first time using this electric planer and I was very impressed. Sharp blades and adequate motor make it work great. My dust collection system wouldn't stay put on the plane, so I used some gorilla tape to hold it on during the planing.",

The blades are too wide so they can not be repositioned to make this sort of cut. When removing the blade it is difficult if not impossible to get another put in. This isn't worth however little money they are charging for it.",

The close up picture with the planer in it is how the wood looked before I planed it and then the two boards put together with the pegs is after I used it.",

Only happened once or twice while planing a large bench base, so not too bad. Just annoying that it happens, or that you can't lock it.

My only complaint is that it would eject the shavings out perfectly one direction, but when switched to the other side, it would clog up every time. Not a big deal and I can't wait to use it again soon! The chamfer groove worked great to take off the square edges too.",

    "description": "Size:3-1/4 Inch| Style:PlanerRemember when you needed to smooth out those joists? Plane away chips, splinters and misshapen edges with the WEN 6 Amp 3-1/4 Inch Electric Hand Planer. Perfect for fixing stubborn doors and fitting wood. This power planer\u2019s 6-Amp motor delivers over 34,000 cuts per minute to your workpiece, slicing away any irregularities until the surface of your boards are aligned and smooth. With a cutting width of 3-1/4 inches and a maximum cutting depth of 1/8 inch, you\u2019ll have the perfect companion for fitting and squaring boards. The 16 positive stops increase in increments of 1/128 inch anywhere from 0 all the way up to 1/8 inches. The base plate shoe even includes a v-shaped groove for easily flattening sharp post corners. Aside from the power planer, this package also includes a dust bag, a rabbeting guide, a kickstand and a parallel fence bracket. The included rabbeting guide adjusts anywhere from 0 to 7/10 inches to allow for rabbets up to an inch deep in size. The parallel fence provides an accurate and straight cut by making sure your strokes are directly parallel to the edge of the wood (a must have for planing door edges, wood trim and boards). The kickstand protects both the blade and the workpiece in between uses by keeping the blade elevated and out of contact from the surface of your project. Finally, the dust bag collects all of your loose shavings to keep your work space clean and sawdust free. The bag attaches to both the left or right hand side of the planer to fit whatever your preference may be. And because this is a WEN Product, your 6 Amp 3-1/4 Inch Electric Hand Planer comes backed by a 2-year warranty, a friendly customer help line, and a nationwide network of skilled service technicians. Remember when you had a reliable planer that lasted for years? Remember WEN.",
