It allows me to see if he needs something without him having to get frustrated since he is having trouble with picking his words. :( He is still able to live in his own house and we live basically next door. It is like he has his very own, personal nursing home but with much better care and attention. The speaker and talk functions are great too.",

I like the talk to feature, where the parent can talk through the monitor and it comes out the speaker for the camera. E.g. \"go to sleep baby boy/girl, lay down baby girl/boy\". Single monitor for multiple cameras. Like most families we have multiple kids and can listen for if they wake up in the night. Oh yeah, its durable. Dropped the monitor on the concrete while keeping an eye on sleeping baby and trying to put up Christmas lights.",

You can zoom in once with the unit which isn't bad and you can move the zoom around to focus what you want it on. The display will give you a warning when the temp gets to high.

Pros: Color monitor You can turn down the sensitivity so you only hear when your child is crying and not just making sleeping noises Screen turns off until your baby cries (so you don't have a bright light in your face all night) The monitor beeps if the battery is dying. You can zoom in on the baby You can buy another camera separately and hook both up to the same parent unit. Adjustable volume Cons: Directions it comes with doesn't explain everything. You need to go online for more directions.",

We are very pleased with the unit so far. Allows to keep track of the kids in their bedrooms as well as in their play area.
