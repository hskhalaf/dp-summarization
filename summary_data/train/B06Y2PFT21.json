If in doubt on sizing, go a size smaller, especially if you like a snugger fit. My daughter's gloves fit my adult hands. They are stretchy, and fit her fine with a bit of room, even though she measures at the very top end of the size range.",

He can't quite use the little pull loops to get them off but I think when he wears them more and gets used to them he will be able to get them off on his own. It is not the easiest thing putting the gloves on him but that is by no means the gloves fault...think toddler. I am overall so happy with them that I plan on buying them for some friends kids.",
