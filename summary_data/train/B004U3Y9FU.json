Admittedly, I haven't seen the amazing benefits of this supplement either but as a medical professional, I recognize that the effects are subtle and long-term. HOWEVER, I have been giving this to my dog for the past 3 months and one fascinating thing I noticed is that his dandruff has dramatically improved. There are a lot less white flakey dead skin on his black fur! I'm am very happy to see that effect so quickly!",
