The poles for the torches are longer than i would have perferred, but, its easier to cut them than it is to stretch them.",

They still light up but do not flicker. Of course I am just past the 30 day warranty window. So now they look stupid as only 1 flickers and the other 3 don't (we have them on all 4 corners of our pool). Don't waste your money!",
