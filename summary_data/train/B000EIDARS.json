That is not good when you want to be able to take a picture quickly. Do like the larger viewing screen, and of course many features are similar to the Coolpix 2100. It was stolen, and I had quite enjoyed using it, so thought I'd try another \"Coolpix\" camera. Price was great of course.",

I don't quite know why but it seems that if you have to take many pictures in quick succession then using the cameras's flash is not the best way to go! All in all, for the price i paid the quality is quite suitable. If you don't have any experience in photography, buy this one.",

It doesn't break super easily cause i droped it several times (although my sister has a L10, she dropped it once and it spilt in 2). My only complaints are: a. No audio on video mode b. Takes a while to adjust its self in between pictures c. Takes a while to actually take a picture d. Hard to get a pretty close up shot of something with out it being blurry Im thinking about upgrading this year, but ill probably just stick with this one for a while.",

It's got all the image quality of an older Olympus digicam that I had been toting, wrapped up in a smaller and sleeker package.

Because of this, images viewed on television may appear sideways, which effectually limits slide shows to the computer screen.",

    "title": "Nikon Coolpix L4 4MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom",
    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe Nikon Coolpix L4 combines an array of high-quality components including a 3x Zoom-Nikkor lens and a bright 2.0-inch LCD screen with in-camera image-improvement features, housed in lightweight, compact, yet elegantly finished bodies.\n\n It boasts a powerful 3x Zoom-Nikkor lenses with a focal range equivalent to that of a 38-114mm (35mm equivalent), providing the freedom to zoom in for tight personal portraits or out to capture expansive outdoor scenes.\n\n The CCD delivers higher performance within tighter dimensions, greatly adding to the camera's compact form and portability while offering generous effective megapixel value of 4.0 for the Coolpix L4, ensuring the refined image clarity that users have come to expect from other members of the Coolpix family.\n\n The camera also features a bright, easy-to-view 2.0-inch LCD that's now even easier to operate with new icons and function selections as well as a new color scheme that is easier on the eye.\n\n Specific design aspects of the Coolpix L4 make it streamlined and comfortable to hold, with a smooth, elegant finish that suggests a much higher level of sophistication. The curved grip contributes both to the camera's design elegance and its shooting stability.\n\n The strikingly compact dimensions and light camera weight make the L4 ideal for taking anywhere you may go, reinforced by the convenience of AA-size battery compatibility. One of the most widely available battery sizes in the world--in alkaline, lithium, rechargeable, or other forms--AA compatibility allows near-ubiquitous use anywhere in the world.\n\n In common with the entire current Coolpix digital camera range, this latest addition features a number of Nikon-inspired capabilities that give the user the power to automatically improve recorded images in-camera. Available in playback mode, for example, the D-Lighting function selects and creates a copy of images with excessive backlight or insufficient flash illumination, adding light and detail wherever needed while keeping other areas as they were.\n\n Nikon's Face-priority AF function automatically detects and focuses in on people's faces, regardless of where they are in the frame, ensuring superb crisp-focus portraits. The In-Camera Red-Eye Fix function analyzes each image, automatically finding and then correcting the accidental red-eye that sometimes occurs in flash photography, for more natural-looking portraits.\n\n A choice of 15 different Scene modes--four with Scene assist--makes the challenge of achieving desired results in a wide range of everyday situations that much simpler. By choosing the Scene mode best suited to the subject at hand, the Coolpix L2, L3 or L4 automatically selects the ideal settings for exactly the picture you had in mind, whether indoor party or outdoor nighttime fireworks display. Scene assist displays useful framing guides in the monitor, helping you compose shots for optimal results.\n\n The Coolpix L4 is also compatible with widely available SD memory cards. The provision of 10 MB of internal memory allows the user to keep shooting when no additional memory is available, as well as easily moving images from one SD card to another.\n\n The Coolpix L4 digital camera also offers movie-shooting capability in three sizes: TV movie size (640) for viewing on TV or computers; convenient Small size (320); and Smaller size (160) for extended recording or Internet usage.\n\n With the Coolpix L4, ease of use and convenience are still priorities, even when the shooting is over. Printing is kept simple, with PictBridge capability enabling connection to a compatible printer without the need of a computer and USB connectivity eases data transfer to computers and other peripherals.\n\n Completing the picture is the complimentary PictureProject accessory software, which greatly simplifies the importing, editing, and organizing of images. It even offers compatibility with a range of plug-ins that allows functions to be extended on demand.\n\n Nikon Coolpix L4 feature highlights:\n\n High performance from a small CCD\nUtilizing space-efficient design parameters that help facilitate the compact size of the Coolpix L2/L3/L4, the 1/2.5-inch CCD adds the advantage of outstandingly high performance. Boasting effective pixel values of 4 million, the CCD enables the capture of crisp-focus images that retain their high quality even when significantly enlarged.\n\n 3x zoom capability\nThe remarkably compact dimensions of the Coolpix L-line cameras belie the incorporation of powerful 38-114mm Zoom-Nikkor lenses (35mm equivalent), ensuring the freedom of a 3x zoom. This precision lens allows zooming in for tightly composed portraits or zooming way out for expansively wide views, providing greater compositional independence than the average digital camera. Macro mode allows shooting from as close as 4 centimeters.\n\n Simple-to-use features improve images in-camera\nA range of unique Nikon functions enables the photographer to actually improve images in-camera. Available in playback mode, the D-Lighting function selects and creates a copy of images with excessive backlight or insufficient flash illumination, adding light and detail wherever needed while keeping other areas as they were. The Face-priority AF function automatically detects and then focuses in on people's faces, regardless of where they are in the frame, ensuring superb crisp-focus portraits. The In-Camera Red-Eye Fix function analyzes each image, automatically finding and then correcting any accidental red-eye, which sometimes occurs in flash photography, to produce more natural-looking portraits.\n\n AA-size battery compatibility\nDespite its compact dimensions, the Coolpix L4 is compatible with AA-size batteries, one of the most widely available battery sizes in the world. The power to shoot approximately 250 shots when using alkaline batteries greatly augments its compact convenience.\n\n Other features:\n\n\n * Unique combination of all-round quality, ease of operation, and elegant styling makes the Coolpix L4 the compact digital camera of choice for entry-level photographers \n * Compact, portable dimensions: 86.5 x 60.5 x 34.5 millimeters (3.4 x 2.4 x 1.4 inches) \n * Light weight: approximately 115 grams (4.1 ounces) (without battery and SD memory card) \n * BSS (Best Shot Selector) automatically selects the shot with the sharpest focus from a series of consecutive images \n * Blur Warning informs user after shooting if an image is blurred \n * Time zone function enables local time to be set regardless of where you are in the world \n * Single AF and Continuous AF selectable in Movie mode \n * Capture modes: Single and Multi-Shot 16 \n * Built-in flash: features settings for Auto, Auto with red-eye reduction (In-Camera Red-Eye Fix), Off, Fill Flash, and Slow sync. \n * Noise reduction provides more attractive results in low-light conditions \n * Digital zoom of up to 4x \n * Choice of White Balance: Auto with TTL control, 6-mode manual (Daylight, Incandescent, Fluorescent, Cloudy, Flash, and White Bal.
