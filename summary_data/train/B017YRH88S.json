This was used to bring the bars closer to give her a better fit. This stem seems to be of good quality. To be honest, I thought this was too good to be true. I took the chance and bought it. For the price, it is more than acceptible. It fits 31.8 mm Specialized handlebars securely. Mine came with grease on the threads, some reviewers said that there wasn't any. So far so good, I'm going to update on usage, as she won't be using this bike for another year.",

I later read shorter stems (length of clamp from fork stem to handle bars) produce Faster Twitchy Turning. I wished had known that before experimenting on a bicycle that already had faster turning than I wanted from inferior entry level geometry. I would have liked slow down that faster twitchy turning. Putting the old stem back was an improvement for me. I am sure this stem may be fine on a better bicycle. Did seem like good quality for the price.",

I may replace it with a blingy stem later if I decide to go that route, but so far this stem has worked well. No issues. Recommended!",
