It takes a mid-mounted kick stand if you prefer one. It even comes with tools to assemble the bike, which took 15 mins. Front wheel, seat/saddle, handle bars are simple to put on.",

It took a retired Judge(who has put bikes together) and a college student 2 1/2 hours. The kickstand which was recommended didn\u2019t come with correct bolts either. Parts were missing and we had to use bolts and tools we had to put it together! Hope bike is durable!",

Also, Manufacturer tightened wheel nuts far beyond what they should be. I'm assuming it was done on an assembly line in China.... but so tight that the nuts deformed when using appropriately sized bike specific wrenches.",

I wonder can bigger tires be fitted onto this as it would certainly be easier for my son. He now prefers to use my wife's bike rather than his own as it is just that bit bigger with the frame just a bit bigger and larger wheels. The only reason this didnt get 5 out of 5 was for the sizing reason as its a very good bike and was easy enough to put together out of the box.",

I was hesitant to buy because of the \u201cwheel hitting foot\u201d issue in some reviews, but if assembled correctly, this isn\u2019t a problem. My 5\u20190\u201d 11-year-old ride this bicycle daily, and there\u2019s plenty of room for adjusting as he grows. The seat isn\u2019t comfortable, but that\u2019s easy to replace, as we did. Would definitely buy again!",
