Hearts pattern is 13\" length, thicker than Carnation pink and not much stretchy, but it covers the belly better.",

It\u2019s a teeny bit big, but she\u2019s still growing so it should fit next year. It\u2019s very soft and thick, but doesn\u2019t restrict her movements. I like that it\u2019s long enough to reach her tail, as most sweaters only cover the torso and aren\u2019t long enough for her body. It\u2019s comfy around the neck and not too tight, and the arm holes are in the correct place. It came just in time for snow in Texas! I will probably order another one for when this one is in the washer! Thanks!",
