No it won't run Photoshop or complex, expensive programs, they aren't made for that. These little laptops are PERFECT for surfing the web, watching videos on the web etc. They update themselves and take care of viruses and problems all by themselves. Fantastic little laptops.",

I am very happy with them and my kids are too.",

It certainly isn't blazing fast, but it has been perfectly adequate for browsing the web, writing emails, writing google docs, etc. The battery life has been amazing, I've been getting a solid 8 hours of use out of it. If you want something cheap to do any web-based tasks I would highly recommend this Chromebook!",
