So it's hit or miss if it will vacuum every room, and if I'm not home I'll never know where it went. Also when i hit the button on top of it to go back to the dock, it doesn't. Just flashes and keeps vacuuming. I'll guess I'll keep it, but I have to babysit it occasionally.",

I think it's worth the $200 - especially if you are beginning to consider alternatives like paying for house cleaners. My only \"con\" is that sometimes he doesn't make it back on the charger (1/5 times probably). I'm OK with that, though. It's no big deal to plop him back on the charger when I get home.",

      "text": "We've been using this for a while now. There are things we love about it (Alexa enabled, easy to use phone app, cleans certain areas really well) and there are things that are not so impressive (won't climb to clean a shaggy area rug, has difficulty returning to base, does not come with barriers). We set it to go off daily at specific times which it does but will sometimes get stuck. I am reading that these issues are common with most of these robot vacuums so I shouldn't be too critical, especially for the relatively reasonable price for a name brand compared to others.",
