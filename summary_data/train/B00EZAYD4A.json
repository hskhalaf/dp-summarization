Capabilities and control are well thought out, and for Nikon users in particular should be very familiar. Our one quibble is the write time necessary for the higher resolution files. Even with very fast cards, there is a definite lag between shutter press and the next \"ready to shoot\" state. This camera, consequently, isn't best for sports or action shots it seems. Picture quality is excellent....not it doesn't match our DSLRs with our selection of specialty lenses.....but who out there really blows up their photos to wall size!!? ;)",

Furthermore, having always used an eyelevel viewfinder I wanted that for sure. I shoot almost everything in RAW so that, too, was a must have. The P7800 met all those requirements and the fully articulated LCD screen was a plus. I give it four stars because it is pretty slow when handling RAW images and the optical zoom is not functional with RAW images. For me these were not problems but for a sports shooter they might be.",
