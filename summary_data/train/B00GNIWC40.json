Especially because it is electrical and didn't want to risk my home catching fire. They weren't willing to take a return and send me another. So I am going to have to purchase a new one from somewhere else. Also it is very loud and like others have said it looks good but it is mediocre at best. Multiple presses to get stuff to work. Halogen lights which make it very hot and expensive to replace. I hope I've learned my lesson.",

To my surprise they were very helpful as well as apologetic and promptly replaced it in just a matter of days. The wife and I are very pleased'",
