It was easy to use and comes with lots of stuffs. Had this came with memory card too, it would have been an icing on the cake. I had to buy memory card separately and I am fine with that because of its pricing.",

Perfect for mounting on helmets or for making \"minecraft videos\" or so I'm told. My dad bought the upgraded version for my mom for Christmas, and I think I'll buy one and try it in the car.

Later in the week, we used it in the pools, hot tub, waterslides and around the resort. It captured our vacation in a whole new way! Thank you for such an amazing camera at a VERY LOW price! I have recommended to many .... why pay the prices for a Go Pro when you could purchase this!",
