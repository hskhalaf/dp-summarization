Having said that I think it would also be a fine processor for a media center pc or a basic computer that's used for editing documents, watching Youtube, surfing the web. It would probably even handle light gaming on some e-sports titles. For those that don't know, it has on-board video. So, a graphics card is not required either. You could literally build a working pc around this processor for probably less than $200.",

Another Note: To use this on any motherboard that accepts Skylake processors requires you to update the BIOS. I did that for my H110M Gaming motherboard from MSI and it works just fine. Another Note: When you switch from Skylake to Kaby Lake using Windows 10, it will work, but your resolution will be reduced to UXGA or 1024 x 768. You can switch it back with Display settings. Make sure your version of Windows 10 is activated before using the new processor. If you have Windows 7, it won't work due to Kaby Lake processors not allowing updates.",

Worth the effort to run in a mining rig, probably not suitable for any high-end gaming, and I'd rather recommend a Core i3 at the bear minimum.",
