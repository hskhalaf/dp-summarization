I don\u2019t recommend placing it like the way I have it on the picture, as the housing gets really hot and you might accidentally knock it off and cause unwanted damage. I would either mount it on the wall with nothing around it or get one of their heat stand.",

It is used in an uninsulated area with 20' ceilings so it's strictly to throw some heat on a small work area. Works pretty well for this application. Cons- the mounting bracket is very flimsy, kind of surprising as the heater unit is quite sturdy. It works. The remote is really cheaply made, and is the only means to change temp. Really concerned that the remote will not survive long or will be misplaced. Heater is almost useless without the remote.",

Heater was mainly used in the evenings and turned off when not in use. Plus we have had a mild winter thus far. Very disappointed. Will be contacting seller and will report back on outcome.",
