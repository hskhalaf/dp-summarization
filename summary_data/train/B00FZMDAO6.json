The problem is a 3yo who consistently and constantly unscrews them, leaving the pieces in various places. An easy fix would be for it to come with a screw that's placed into the pole base going into the main base. So once you assemble it, the screw would keep it together. Or just have a kid who doesn't have a desire to deconstruct everything! There is a little hole that I believe is supposed to \"lock\" the pieces together. It does no such thing.",

Because Mellisa and Doug is such a superb brand, I decided to go ahead give it a try. She seemed so excited, she didn't know what to use first. I received a picture of her mopping and sweeping the kitchen floor at the same time. lol. Her mother said she was \"multi-tasking'\" . What great fun for a budding little helper!",

The mop is the worst as it has the plastic thing at the bottom and not too many cloth part so if a kid is going to mop it will leave scratch marks. It could've been better had they finished the wooden parts properly.",

They have been a real hit and the stand makes it easy to store them wherever you think they will be used, such as the kitchen.",
