It's adjustable so it's right up against my back, no gaping. It's slim so I won't accidentally smack anyone seated on the bus with it if I'm stuck standing. The colors are subtle and elegant. I can't state enough how much I love the shorter height and slimmer width on this bag.",

One fatal flaw though - the zipper on both of the main pockets are not strong enough to stay closed. Several times already, I closed the zippers but any weight in the bag will separate the zipper. It's a quick fix but really flawed since I'm not confident if my bag will stay closed or not!",
