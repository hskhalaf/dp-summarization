My Honda worked well for 2 years, but had carb, then fuel pump failure no doubt due to 87 octane/ethanol blend being used at some point. For half the price, this seems to be a comparable generator. As with all small engine devices, find a source for non-ethanol fuel. It has proven to be cancer to everything it's run in.",

If you follow these steps This little engine that could will run forever with no engine wear because of the Synerlec additive in the Royal Purple. It is a lil costly but worth every penny.

At high load it might be a bit louder but we are splitting hairs on the dB levels. The fuel tank is larger but that is offset by the larger load capacity. Running a 12k BTU window shaker, battery charger and several fans I can get 7 hours out of a full tank. I can run two of these AC units simultaneously but it will occasionally shut down due to overload if both units start up together.",
