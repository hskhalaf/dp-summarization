The actual steam that comes out of this is not hot, so this product is not a significant safety hazard. When transporting the top part to refill, I've noticed that it tends to leak a little bit of water no matter which orientation I hold it, so I recommend keeping the base close by. Handling and operating this product is clearly laid out in the instructions. All in all, this is yet another solid product by Taotronics! I now own several products from them.",
