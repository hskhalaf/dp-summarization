At 50 million, this bottle contains a lot, and more than many others. However, one must remember that this is a supplement, and eating an ounce or two of sauerkraut probably contains significantly more CFU",

Bottom-line is this prebiotic produced some kind of acid inside the body for me which gave skin rashes all over the body. Will not be using pre-biotic.",
