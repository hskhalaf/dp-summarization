Assembled product has a slight tendency to lean forward, but this was easily cured with the use of a shim. It sure holds a lot of CDs. Overall appearance doesn't suggest something cheap, either. Will most likely buy another as my music library expands. Good value overall.",

The build was very simple and did not take much time. The frame is sturdy and the shelves feel like they're held in place very well. The only negative was that when I opened the box the backing for the shelf had some kind of white powder on it. Not sure if it was for packaging purposes or if it was from the particle board. Overall though I would definitely recommend this product and will be looking into another for myself in the future.",

Even blu rays won't fit on that row and it ends up becoming a waste of space. Just make it 2 inches taller!",

They come with quite a few movable shelves to accommodate many kinds of media. If we had enough space we'd get another one. The quality is very good for the price and they seem to be more solidly made than some other ones we looked at. I'd recommend this unit to anyone who needs a lot of storage for their collection.",

Blu-rays run into a similar issue, basically you can't fill it from top to bottom with any single type of movie (dvd or blu ray). No worries though, we put cd's on the very bottom shelf.",

I have not yet found an arrangement where the shelving can be arranged to hold DVD/BluRay without laying some down which is a pet peeve of mine. They did include several sextra shelves and construction pieces for you to choose the shelf arrangement on your own. Overall, I would say I like this very much.",
