The average listener won't notice the difference and the experienced listener will be surprised to hear how much you spent on these. They come with wheels that you can install yourself, but they seemed flimsy so I didn't bother. But otherwise, they are well put together and sound very very good and can crank out the volume.",

The only reason I am writing this review is as a mild warning -- the bass response on this unit is a little light. You should expect to have to either EQ the signal to the speaker to boost the bass and/or considering adding a dedicated speaker to act as a subwoofer. the sound on this guy is really bright. p.s. extra perk -- it came with nice rubber ball casters. Since I have to repurpose its initial intended use, these casters will come in handy.",

Make sure you buy some febreeze or baking soda at the time or purchase. The second thing is that the wheels that the come with do not screw into the bottom. The screws do not grip at all.

I used to use Klipsch RF82 but I'm afraid when I play too loud, it may damage the horn, so I bought this pair. For this speaker, you need to play with high volume. If you turn down volume, it does not provide good sound. I think because the 12\" speaker is kind of hard, so it need strong power receiver to play with. And b/c there is no mid range speaker, your voice is not very clear when you sing. Anyway, If you play this speaker with big room, they'll do better job. I just use it for party.",

A little more bass would be nice for 4 12's, but then again they ARE 12's. I think Pyle may have bumped up the wattage on these a bit; I don't think they handle as much as they say they do, but still nice for the price.",
