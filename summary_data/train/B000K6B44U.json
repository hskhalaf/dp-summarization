      "text": "I thought this thing sounded pretty OK out of the box. Good tone and sustain. After upgrading the pickups to Duncan Seymour Quarter Pounders and the stings to cobalt Slinkys, it sounds GREAT. Lots of bite and grit, but full and clean at the same time. Also had the electrical tuned up as there was a slightly loose connection. Anyway, bought it for the look (got the pink one), of course, but after upgrading it checks all the boxes. Also stays in tune FOREVER. I love this bass.",

      "text": "This bass is okay for a beginners. I was attracted by the color, which is why I bought it. The pickups often give unwanted feedback, even on Monster cables. The action is very difficult to set. You'll need an allen wrench to adjust the tremolo height. The truss rod is there, but I have not needed to adjust it since neck is straight. It is pretty durable and heavy, which is expected of a bass. The only problems seem to be the bridge and the pickups. Does not seem worth it to replace pickups. Just get a different bass!",
