It's like all of a sudden, my knees are painful for no reason. I've really been researching, reading a lot of different research results and spoken to others who take supplements. Glucosamine has a lot of support. I started taking Turmeric supplements and it made a difference, but not 100%. I added this product recently and I swear I have no more pain in my knees. I'm actually surprised every morning when I walk down stairs and I don't have to go slower because of the knee pain.",

    "description": "Style:Glucosamine + D3Product Description Schiff Glucosamine Plus Vitamin D3 helps lubricate and protect joints by helping you maintain healthy structure and function of cartilage in your joints.* It contains Glucosamine Hydrochloride (HCl) which has a high potency of active Glucosamine.

The recommended serving size is 2 softgels daily to get your daily dose of 2000mg of Glucosamine. Schiff guaranteed for purity, freshness and labeled potency. Amazon.com Schiff Glucosamine Plus Vitamin D Tablets help you maintain healthy cartilage in your joints.

View larger. Highest Potency Glucosamine Keeps Joints Strong Glucosamine helps support healthy cartilage and maintain structural integrity of joints and connective tissue. Glucosamine is a building block for joint fluid, cartilage, tendons, ligaments, membrane, and blood vessels. Just two tablets of Schiff Glucosamine Plus provides 2,000 milligrams of glucosamine HCl, the highest potency of active glucosamine. While most brands use glucosamine sulfate that is only 65 percent glucosamine, Schiff Glucosamine Plus uses nearly 83 percent glucosamine for a stronger dose of joint support. Vitamin D Keeps Bones Strong As we age our bones lose calcium, which can compromise overall bone health and joint movement. Vitamin D addresses this problem by helping bones absorb calcium better and helps bones retain the calcium already in them. Two Glucosamine Plus tablets provide 2,000 IU of joint-healthy Vitamin D3. Joint Fluid to Protect and Cushion Joints This supplement also contains 3.3 milligrams of joint fluid (hyaluronic acid), a potent form of the molecule in lubricating fluid that exists naturally in joints. As we age, the level of hyaluronic acid in the body tends to decrease. The good news is that because hyaluronic acid is naturally present throughout the body, built-in pathways can absorb and utilize it. A clinical study shows that when taken orally, as with a nutritional supplement like Schiff's Glucosamine Plus, hyaluronic acid absorbed directly into the joints. Quick-Dissolve Formula for Better Absorption This supplement has Schiff's Sure Dissolve formula, which means it's made to disintegrate in the body within one hour for improved absorption and less waste.
