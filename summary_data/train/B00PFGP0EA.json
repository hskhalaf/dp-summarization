Note assembly requires wire stripping and a precision flat head screw driver. The only reason I am giving 2 stars is that the panel does function",

It comes with a short wire connected to the panel that is soldered on the small terminals under a black cover. I do wish these were screwed on instead so I could attach longer wires without having to crimp connectors on them. It does come with a longer set that connects to a voltage regulator.",
