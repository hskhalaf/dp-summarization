If you're someone who needs a lot of food and large Tupperware for your lunch, this bag will probably be too small for you. But it's perfect for someone like me who usually brings a sandwich, fruit, chips, salad, and other small food that I can fit in 3 or less small-medium sized food containers.",

      "text": "Very cute little lunch bag. The first day I took it to work, the ladies in my office all gushed over it and wanted to know where to buy one. I love that the ice pack is included. The inside is nice smooth insulation material. It's kind of small inside once you close it, though. I put 2 sandwich boxes inside, and had some trouble zipping it. My food was cold at lunch, but at the end of an 8-hour shift, the ice pack is fully melted (which is fine--just want to let you know realistic expectations--it's not going to keep a drink cold all day, for example.)",

It's a great size, I'm able to fit a couple of tupperwares in there and some snacks. The fabric is versatile so I can use a wider-sized tupperware if I want to. Great product with a cute design, I use it for work everyday!",
