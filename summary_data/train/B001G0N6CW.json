It is now in a molded rubber and velcro cast; I must keep it on for showering but cannot get it wet. My left arm is also broken at the elbow, but the bone is not displaced, so the ortho doctor decided that I should be able to use it. However, my left arm is NOT strong enough to hold the rubber seal on the cover to allow passage over the cast. I purchased the product for independence and ease of use but ended up using trash bags instead.",

Also the unit, while it was being put on, kept falling apart adding to the difficulty of trying to make it work. I thought the sleeve, which is elastic, would loosen up with usage but just a few stretches shows that the elastic is plainly too tough and will continue to be too tight and too difficult to put over a cast.",

Perhaps over a cast one could painlessly force it through. However if your surgery is very heavily padded bandageing, shoving a hand and wrist in can be very challenging and a bit painful. That said - what other options are there if you need watertight to shower and wash head of hair? Can't risk bag and tape! So I gave it 3 stars for not being more flexible which I think it could be - having a double flange in more flexible material would be a start and possibly the fix.",

The seal is incredibly hard to get past the cast for me. Kind of painful really. I know not all casts are made the same so maybe others won't have the problem. Either way, once its on, the Brown Medical SEAL-TIGHT Original Cast and Bandage Protector does a great job of keeping water out when taking a shower.",

The ring is tight (like it should be) and keeps water out when he showers or takes a bath. The length of the bag is a little too long though and would probably work better for an older child with longer arms.",
