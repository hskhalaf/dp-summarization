But there seems to be a few bugs here and there, but nothing to that really makes the game bad in any way. I'm really hoping Lego makes a Spongebob game, lol. They made the Spongebob Legos... why not a game? I'll bet that would be really fun... exploring Bikini Bottom, lol. My son would flip over a Lego Spongebob game.",

We had always been big fans of the LEGO Wii games, but they had moved on to the XBox360 platform and left the LEGO games behind.....UNTIL....LEGO LOTR!! They played it non-stop the first weekend and had to be pried away from the TV (they usually are pretty minimal video game players)!! Love that the voicings are actually the ones from the movie as that really adds to enjoyment of these for both the parents and the kids! Highly recommended!!",

Took me awhile to beat the game and will play through it again. So overall the controls were easy, game length was good and very enjoyable.

I enjoyed visiting the Shire, Rivendell, and Gondor. It was fun, but gathering all the extra items to reach 100% took a long time. Occasionally, it was hard to determine where to go next which is why I gave it 4 stars. I own all of the other LEGO games, and I personally enjoy the Harry Potter ones the most.",

Any violence is LEGO violence with LEGO pieces flying as opposed to blood and gore; kids pull their LEGOs apart all the time when they're playing. I always like the Easter eggs and fun stuff that the game makers throw in as well. The game is not high on the challenge meter but allows for a solid amount of gaming fun. Highly recommend!",

It makes following the storyline so much easier than in other Lego games, where the characters merely grunt and wave their hands.

It is also fun to watch the kids get along and work together. I like the music and how it mimics the movie, but is appropriate for all my children. I would recommend this game.",

Sometimes it seems that the B button has too many uses and the game has a hard time figuring out what use of B to do. But minor annoyances aside, it's a great game.",
