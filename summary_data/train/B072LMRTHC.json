      "title": "Excellent",
      "text": "Have moved from MacAir to Surface. So far very happy with the move. A robust high spec laptop. Very happy with Windows 10 as well. Reason for moving was Apple's lack of development of MacAirs after so long and their breathtaking prices. Microsoft Surface is a dream to use and the touchscreen is great. Two downsides - you cant migrate Outlook for Mac back to PC (!!). The alcantara keyboard material feels nice. Not sure how durable this is or how hygienic - developers should have thought a bit more here. But def gets 5*. Update - October - I've regrettably gone back to MacAir. Despite 4GM of RAM the laptop was painfully slow and tech support fairly basic.",

But it turned out to be a beautiful piece of technology, I've only had it for a day so I cannot speak about its long-term performance, but so far so good. I bought this as an emergency laptop because mine broke, so wanted a high-end, speedy laptop with a great keyboard and this laptop fits that description.
