      "text": "Please don't purchase from Ross Cellular - The phones are Refurbished, my phone had a lifetime timer of 72 hours you can check by ##634# on any Lumia phone. The phone is ATT branded but unlocked. Has a aftermarket back cover there was no NOKIA logo on it. The screen and lens have a plastic cover on top. Which makes the outside look deceivingly new. - Updated the phone to latest Windows 8.1 took 6 hours and 5 updates to move to latest version. WP 8.1 is much better compared to WP 8 looks good. Tested with both ATT and T-Mobile SIM.",

Other than that this phone has all the features like the big boys have and at a half price. If you want a good product than you can have it. But, if you need name \"iphone\" for $600/$700 then that is your personal choice.",
