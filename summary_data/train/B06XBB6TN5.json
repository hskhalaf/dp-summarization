I replaced the soles instantly with a quality product to add protection. Good value to get the Yonex brand, but not sure it's up to the standard of my prior Yonex products. Update; these have fallen apart after a few more plays and I'm trying to contact Amazon to arrange a refund.",

I've had these for nearly a year and they are still comfortable. The fabric over the insole has come away a little bit in the left shoe, however they do get a fair bit of hammer as we play at least three times a week at a competitive level.",

They are a tad smaller than the usual sizes (but I heard Yonex in general are like this), so if not used to Yonex, you may wish to buy half a size bigger than your usual size. They really feel comfy and absorbs the force of jumping and sudden movements on the court. Thanks",

I play middle blocker, so do a lot of jumping - this is an important factor for me. Have played on 3 different indoor courts. so far, and traction is also pretty good on all 3 surfaces. Overall ankle stability is decent. I've previously worn Mizuno, and Adidas volleyball shoes - so far, these have proved as good - if not better, especially in terms of cushioning.",
