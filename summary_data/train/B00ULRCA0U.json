I also like the markings on the side to keep me on track to drink water! In addition, I contacted the seller to replace my leaking bottle. Once I figured out how to communicate through Amazon Message Center, coordination of a replacement was easy. I am very impressed with Sean P. and his dedication to top notch customer service. If everyone did business like Sean the world would be a better place.",

It's very well made; the water pours down straight into the fruit infuser as well as around it; you can shake it without worry so as to speed up the infusion process because the lid when closed is completely sealed, aesthetically speaking it looks refreshing as the fruit infused water it creates. It's a great deal for the price, I'd recommend it to anyone wanting to drink healthier.",

It definitely infuses the water with fruit like it is supposed to do, I just think the bottle itself needs a little tweaking to make it even better! The best thing about the bottle is that I do not normally drink water and am always dehydrated. Now I will drink more water with the fruit flavor infused into the water!",

I have fingernails, so its difficult and my husband has large hands so it iss equally as difficult for him. There is enough space between the tube and the lid to make that tab sit up a little higher in order to make it easier to grasp.",

Tried blackberries (halved) and didn't get much flavor after infusing overnight. Last night tried strawberries (halved) and mint. This worked great and already drank one bottle. It's back in the fridge now with more water. We'll see how it does on the second go round.",

But I emailed company, they responded right away, and took care of it for me. I really appreciated the customer service. Five stars for excellent customer service but durability of this bottle is no bueno after a drop to floor.",

I would like to return in but I think it\u2019s silly going through all that process just for 7 dollars... really disappointed..",
