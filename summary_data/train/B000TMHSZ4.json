I cooked 5 lbs of FFries at once--only moved the needle just a little. It has an excellent way of adjusting the gas so you can pinpoint temp! The electric cookers I have never can keep up and therefore the food is oily and crappy--Not this unit--crispy and fast. I cooked a small turkey breast and chicken breasts and it did a great job! Customer service was great when I first received a thermometer that was 30F low--I had a replacement within 3 days \"BUY THIS\" you won't be disappointed!!",

Its not tall enough to get a 5 gallon container under it to drain the oil. However I added a platform to extend the height of the unit. I also think it should have an adjustable damper on the exhaust to regulate the exhaust flow. Does a great job holding the temp, even with two baskets dropped at a time. Be sure to monitor the temperature because this can get hot fairly quick and there is no automatic thermostat. Overall its a very good fryer for the price point.",

This Bayou cooked chicken wings, chicken breasts, fish, mushrooms, mozzarella sticks, French fries, cat heads, turkey nuts, etc., etc., etc... to perfection.

It took the same time to cook each food, but the time was saved in it holding the perfect temperature.",

      "text": "I'm just a little disappointed in the overall quality. As others have commented, the welds are pretty dodgy. I've attached a video so you can have a look before buying. Hope it helps. I'd probably still buy it, but just with lower expectations. By the way, I can't review the actual cook quality (I'm sure it's fine... after all it's just a tub of hot oil), until I fill it with hot water and detergent and spend some time scrubbing it out.",
