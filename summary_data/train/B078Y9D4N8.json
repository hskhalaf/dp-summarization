And when the batteries died she got 2 more. (I'm not sure if they would still be water resistent once the battery is opened.). I recommend the watch if you need something inexpensive and water-resistent that looks decent on most people. But be prepared to spend time figuring out how to set it!

I do wear my watch on my right hand since I am left-handed. I don't know if this has anything to do with the buttons I bump but it is happening often. OTHERWISE, it is a great watch for the price. Many pretty colors. It keeps the time you set it for correctly. I bought 2 of them.",

Then the buckle broke off completely, as the first one had. Learned our lesson, and replaced it with a different watch altogether.",

      "text": "For the price- this watch is great! I have had it now for about a month. I purchased it as my 'pool watch'. It is cute enough, water proof and tells time. Perfect. There are a few things that could done to improve it, like not have 'China' stamped in the inside end of the strap which can be seen by me. Or if the buckle matched the face instead of being silver. But again, for the price, I can't complain. Also, the face is pretty small, the size of a quarter, which for my child-like wrists is perfect. I would buy it again in a heartbeat and am glad I did!",

I\u2019d like to add that I haven\u2019t worn any kind of new jeans or clothing that would change the color due to excess pigment in the clothing. This was just from regular old cloths. If you\u2019re going to get this watch, I would STRONGLY discourage you from getting any light colored one (which sucks for spring and summer).",

Also, at the end of the band it says \"China\". If I don't slide the \"band holder\" near the end it's pretty visible. If it has to say China it should be somewhere less visible.

I can attest to this because this is the 5th of this type of watch that I've owned. However, for the price and functionality, It's my go to watch and I will continue to buy a new one every time the band breaks, every 1-2 years.",
