I use it as a teacher principally for taking roll, issuing token economy points (both via touch screen), and entering grades. I lend it to trusted students to perform some of these tasks. It's been dropped a half dozen times, has a slight bend on one of the corners, and continues to function like a champ. I can drop this little computer in my bag and have to double-check that it's there, it's so small. With offline sync, I can work on my Google docs on the train as I go in and out of wifi service. The battery lasts more than all day.",

It has been great for doing coursework on the Microsoft office suite of apps. My only downside is the consistency of the touchscrren at times. I have tried to use it for writing notes and I often get breaks in my lines or pauses. This may be due to my stylus rather than the screen but either way, that's my one issue. A great buy overall totally worth the money! I love Asus products.",

They offer zero warranty - Amazon was no help - so don't think you can return past the 30 days and get your money back. All they offered was for us to send it in for repair. Will never purchase from this company again.",

Plays YouTube just fine. Light weight and small and is jus all around ok. You see it for good price you wont be disappointed.",

When I flip it to tablet mode, certain apps stop working and/or won't launch. Very disappointed as I was looking for something to replace my Samsung Tab A (which worked flawlessly) that acted more like a laptop. I'm going to keep looking for fixes but buyer beware of this Chromebook.",
