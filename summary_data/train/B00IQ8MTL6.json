My daughter still plays with it and I don't think she realizes it's not doing what it claims to be able to do. But she still likes to talk to Dora and pretend with the phone on her own. I give this 3 stars.",

This toy just seemed annoying. My daughter now plays with the two toys separately. She uses the phone as a toy phone and the doll is just a baby. She also only watched the original Dora, so the Dora and friends doll does not resemble the Dora she knows. This is probably a great toy for an older girl who is into the show.",
