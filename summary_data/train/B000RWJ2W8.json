      "text": "We had a swissmar Raclette grill for over 10 years and it was time to replace it with a newer version. We were eager to receive the new grill but unfortunately after opening he box, we realized the craftsmanship of the new model was not near as good as the older one. For example, the grill pans in the old model were very sturdy and well-made where as in the newer model (square shaped) they are very thin and flimsy. In addition, the older model was much cheaper in price than the newer version but the quality of the older model was much better.",

So far works great with the granite top the cooking oils , or fat goes everywhere, there is no drip pan quite messy The cast aluminum holds all the cooking oils , until it overflows also , ? So in my opinion because of the lack of any type of drip pan, I can only hope the quality holds up on the heat coil itself",

It isn\u2019t that difficult to clean and it heats nicely and cooks food better and more evenly than the Teflon tops (I\u2019ve used both). I have the eight person, which is really only useful for 4-5 folks, as the top grill becomes too crowded. I wish the cord was longer. We have to use an extension cord, which looks tacky. It makes for a fun winter evening as we spend hours \u201ccooking\u201d around it with family and friends.",

My only complaint would be that there is no on/off button. You plug it in and it immediately gets warm so be careful not to burn yourself. There is a temperature adjustment knob on one side though.",

The heat takes some time to build up, but once the Swissmar gets going your food warms up quickly. So far, I've cooked shrimp, thin slices of beef/bacon, cheeses and veggies. Everything cooks well on this Raclette. Cons - The cord is way too short and of a low quality. I had to return my original ordered Swissmar Raclette because I used an extension cable in order to connect to the wall while placing the Raclette on the table, and the end of the cord got very hot and the cord broke.",

It also prevents the mixing of flavors, as the granite top is just one big area. If one cooks fish, and someone else cooks meat.... flavors, juices will mix. Using the pans prevent this.
