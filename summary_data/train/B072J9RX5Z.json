      "text": "Works well for ordinary socks. Moderate compression stockings are problematic; medical full-compression stockings are very difficult. If one notices in the video, a slightly different technique is used for compression stockings: pulling back with the handle. Unit was easy to assemble, but handle kept coming apart and I eventually glued it. One of the problems is its extremely light weight: if you do not put a lot of downward pressure when using, it has a tendency to slip even with the 'non-slip' pads. After using multiple times I found it to be easier and more efficient. But, all-in-all, I rate it just 'ok'",
