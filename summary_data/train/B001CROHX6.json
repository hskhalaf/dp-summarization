With the Line-In Autoplay functionality, anytime I play a vinyl record it immediately begins playing on my stereo and all Sonos speakers in the same group as my Connect. The setup for all of this could not have been easier. Very pleased with the Sonos Connect.",

It even brought my dad's Hi-Fi into the digital age! Would have rated it 5 stars except software and firmware updates are not always optional and once updated, you cannot revert to the older version, even if the new version won't work with your older computer and/or operating system. Other than that, the system offers excellent control of the any Sonos component using iPhone, iTouch, iPad, Andriod device, PC or Mac. Use your handheld device to create playlists, control playback, select source, control volume, etc, or do it all from your desktop. Great system!",

If you are playing radio stations it will keep playing for the family while you run to town or what not. Awesome product! App is so easy",

No. But... the convenience, variety of music available and flexibility are worth the price of admission. Internet radio, Spotify, TuneIn and SiriusXM (via internet) compatible. Many other services too. I still spin CDs and vinyl for critical listening because there is a difference in sound quality. Highly recommended!",
