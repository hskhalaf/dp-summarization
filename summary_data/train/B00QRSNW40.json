Its probably ideal for those wanting a deep clarifying cleanse but not good for a moisturizing and daily/weekly cleansing unless there is lot of product bulid-up/grease/dirt oil. It probably okay for wavy/straight/curly hair that is not prone to dryness.",

I started to panic. After doing research, I found that I should be using a clarifying shampoo regularly to ensure my scalp gets totally clean. So, I started using a new shampoo and my scalp is back to being clean and dandruff free. I really like this shampoo because it's very slippery and conditioning for my tangled curly mane. However, I recommend using a clarifying shampoo at least once or twice a month to ensure your scalp is getting thoroughly cleaned.",
