      "text": "I was not sure which ramp to get after spending hours reading reviews. I have a golden retriever puppy that would not be able to safely get in and out of the truck, so I needed a ramp. I started out teaching him to use it laying it on the floor than elevated it 1/2 way up the height of the truck. We finished our training session with the ramp at the back door of the truck. He flies up and down it and I don't have to worry about lifting him in and out. It is about an inch too wide for the back door of a Dodge Ram Quad Cab, but it does fit flat.",

It was easy to train her by laying it flat on the ground for a couple of times before having her learn to walk down it, then up. I do have to hold her collar as she goes up but it isn't because it's not sturdy, but because she's not sturdy. The only thing I wish it had was a handle to hold and carry it. And if you're dog's stance is much wider than mine, this may not be wide enough.",

I lay down all of the rear and middle row seats, and I can slide this in behind the front seats in both cars so it's out of the way of the dogs.
