He didn't wear them on the first day and his feet got a little damp and cold. The second day he put these on over some dry socks and they worked as advertised. His feet stayed dry and he got warmer since his feet were not wet. We're going to order another pair.",

I went by the sizing chart and the socks are a little big for my feet. I end up wearing a second pair of short socks under them for extra warmth in the winter. My boyfriend seemed to like the second pair. I am not sure yet if by washing them in the washing machine with Tide has ruined them but that should be tested soon enough. I wear a woman's 9 1/2 and ordered the Mediums for reference.",
