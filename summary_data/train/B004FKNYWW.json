After the first application, my skin felt soft and was less red. I did notice some little bumps, but they weren't pimples. By the 3rd application (I use it every other day) my skin was totally smooth and my pores look smaller than ever. This continues to this day! Highly recommended. FYI: the English translation says to rub it into your skin for 10-15 minutes, but you just rub it for a few seconds and leave it on for 10-15 minutes.",

I prefer this Skin Food Rice Mask compared to the Black Sugar Mask. The rice mask makes my skin feel soft and smooth without the abrasiveness of harsh exfoliating beads like the Black Sugar Mask.
