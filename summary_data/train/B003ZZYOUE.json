The table top is not solid wood but made of veneer. The puck either sticks to the surface or just slides of the table. Just had a big Thanksgiving get together and the table was the biggest joke. I bought this table for my birthday and thought it would just take time to get used to the table. Well that is not the case, this is the worst purchase possible. Do not buy this table you will waist your money.",

It took about 3 hours to fully assemble, but it wasn't difficult, just took some time. The table seems to be good quality, and runs very fast, which requires some skill to get the right distance on the puck. We played on this table at a rental house last year, and it proved to not disappoint here.",

It tends to clump more too. Just ordered some number 4 in hopes that it is the perfect medium.",

When assembling the table (all done upside down) either do it on carpet or use the box it comes in to prevent damage to the edges. Vanessa and I did it in about 2 1/2 hours, including breaks and fooling around. BTW use a good straight comb to level the wax.",
