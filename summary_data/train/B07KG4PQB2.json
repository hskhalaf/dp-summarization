      "text": "I really liked this air purifier for many reasons! It\u2019s compact, it lights up to indicate that\u2019s its working, it has two USB ports for charging! I\u2019d say that there\u2019s not many cons - i think my cigarette lighter is slightly bigger, so it comes loose at times, so I have to be sure it\u2019s plugged in each time I get in the car. I do feel that it has improved the air quality in my car - no longer smells like food if i leave some leftover fries in there! I want to continue to use it to see if it helps my allergies when the pollen is bad.",
