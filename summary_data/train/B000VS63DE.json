There is NO tag, NO registration or instruction sheets..The bar code was covered and is NOT what the original glove was. I've read that people have been burned using these fakes. I have very small hands and have to fight to put them on. Not sure who I can contact but I want my money back and should NOT have to pay to send these FAKES back!! As they say, \"a bargain isn't always a bargain\"! This is the 2nd item from my last two Amazon orders that items were not as advertised. Come on Amazon..If I wanted fakes I'd go back to Ebay!",

I accidentally ordered this one named \"Joseph Enterprises HH501-18 Ove Glove - As Seen On TV\". Received it today via China post from an address in China (about 9 days later). Right away I noticed the glove felt thinner and lighter than what I bought last year. I weighed the two and there was a significant difference. 111grams vs 84grams. I have no proof this is counterfeit, but I'm reluctant to use this product in high heat situations to protect myself. See my uploaded image of the side by side comparison.",

They are not very heat resistant, as even a 350 degree cookie sheet penetrates the glove rather quickly. The stitching seems cheap, and starts to fray too early in the life of the glove. Forget about washing these things - they shrink, stay wet inside, and generally don't clean up well in the wash anyway. Sized too small for most American hands, so not great for most average-sized male hands. Would not recommend these any more.",

      "text": "After extensive research, unfortunately I received two knock-off Ove' Gloves. The fingers are very small and barely fit my hand, the wrist cuffs are small, neither had a tag attached (which authentic Ove' Gloves have), and the gloves are thinner than my original Ove' Gloves. I don't know how to ensure the ordering of an authentic glove - maybe it's luck of the draw.",

The Ove Gloves gives you a far better grip than traditional oven kits. The rubber grips are soft and pliable yet somehow are impervious to the high temperatures of the oven. The gloves stretch effectively so that one size fits most people.",

It's very flexible and it's easy to grasp things with it. Very glad I splurged. Don't use it while it's wet, though. Everything except a material like silicone will transfer heat through the water.",
