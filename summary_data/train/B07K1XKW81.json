      "text": "This is an impressive piece of technology when sitting in a meeting...take notes, show others items you are working on, and the looks it gets are priceless. I also love this laptop/tablet on the couch. Easily switch from laptop to tablet mode and get stuff done in comfort. Would be nice if the angle of the screen in laptop mode had more flexibility, but it works well just the same. I have used this for more intensive programs like Photoshop and Premiere, and it works well (gets a little warm but all laptops do with those programs). I love it!",

However, if you just use your laptop for basics and school, this folio is a step above the competition. This model has been out for a couple years already, but the wow factor is still there. In a world full of Apple, dare to be the orange. I mean, the friggin chassis is made of leather, like, real leather. It\u2019s a cool machine, and the pen comes in the box. Most importantly, when it converts to tablet mode, the keyboard isn\u2019t on the back. That\u2019s really the whole reason I bought it, personally.",
