These say they have \"odor resistance technology\" but I can't find anywhere where it states they're actually treated with antimicrobial, like the ExOfficio's. The material is also heavier and will take longer to air dry. I will wear them for everyday but I don't think I'll take these on our AT section hikes. Still.... very pleased with these.",

If they were cotton, I would wear them all the time (that\u2019s my only issue with them so far.) I was concerned with other reviews that said they fell apart, so I\u2019ve been washing them in a lingerie bag on warm with the rest of my laundry; it\u2019s true that the writing on the back waist band started peeling immediately after the first wash, but that\u2019s the only problem I\u2019ve had with them, and it\u2019s not been bothersome.",

This was a great investment and I will order more. Comfortable panties with no ride up and great moisture wick protection to help keep you dry and rash free.",

Great price compared to Exofficio and other performance undies. Thinking about getting another 6 pack!",
