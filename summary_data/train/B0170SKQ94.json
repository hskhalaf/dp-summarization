He loves music and he was wanting a lava lamp so I figured why not kill two birds with one stone!? Anyway, we plugged it in and the speaker actually had great sound, but, the lava lamp has been plugged in for 4 hours and the lava still isn't flowing. We problem shooted and its still barely working. Pros- The size is great for the price The Bluetooth speaker sounds pretty good Cons- The lava takes FOREVER to warm up!",

      "text": "Bought this product as a Christmas present for my son. I thought it would be a nice to give it to him early on Christmas Eve to entertain him because he always wanted a lava lamp (tradition in our house that you get to open one present Christmas Eve night). Opened it and tore through everything for 15 minutes trying to find a bulb. Plugged it in without the bulb and the bluetooth works pretty good. But the disappointment on my kids face that the lava part was not operational was hard.",

      "text": "I thought this would be a sweet lava lamp with a cool speaker feature. Instead it's a \"meh\" speaker with a weak lava lamp. We've now had two of these as i had to return the first one. The wax \"lava\" in the first one stopped melting completely and would just stay in an amorphous lump at the bottom of the lamp for hours after using it off and on for a few days. The second one works better, but the wax never seems to really reach a liquid state, rather preferring to clump and tear as it moves about the glass cylinder.",
