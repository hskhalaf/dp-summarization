When you get up close, its inexpensive price starts to show itself. Also, if you have to get in and out of it frequently, this is not great for that because the top needs to be manipulated to get it back into place. My rating would be significantly lower if the price wasn\u2019t so inexpensive.",

I know some people had issues with the top cracking when they sat on it. My daughter is only 60 some off pounds...so I think she would be good with this. Me personally would not sit on it. Not because I dont think it would hold me but because its not really made for that purpose. I think if you use it as storage and not additional seating it should be fine.",

It will close fine if there isn't much put inside. I bought this for bedding, but honestly I would use it for something else and get something sturdier for bulging fabrics.
