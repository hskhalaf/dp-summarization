It is fairly easy to set up with the different extensions that are included. The best way to install is to find the extensions that work best then put in the fasteners. The metal is very strong and sturdy. I definitely recommend this product if you have baby or a puppy. I will probably purchase another one when we have a child to prevent them from entering certain spaces. Great product!",

However, neither my parents or my sister could figure it out.

The gate is very well designed and fabrication/finish quality is also very good. Packaging is excellent and eliminates damage and scratches to the finish. We were so impressed with how well the first one worked, we immediately ordered a second one for our other opening. Our widest opening is just under 48 inches, so this gate is perfect with the two extension pieces. None of the competing gates had this feature. We've had them installed about two months and have zero complaints. Great product, works as described.",

Neither have had issues and it's always been very stable, even with a large energetic dog jumping up on it. Looks nice, and high enough to keep our dog from wanting to jump over it, she has successfully once but it was difficult for her, she hasn't tried it again.",

This gate is SO CLOSE to perfect as she is somehow too lazy to hop over like our more agile cat (with much better bladder control) but will turn into a liquid when necessary. I bought this based on the reviews saying cats could not fit through but alas, nothing can keep our soot sprite down. Really bummed at yet another failure but it is not the gates fault. Super easy to install and very sturdy compared to our last attempt. At least it will be useful when the baby starts walking...",

      "text": "Instead of the retention holders going 180 degrees like the larger product, this gate you have to align all 4 by dropping them into place on a small ridge on the end supports. This made getting them all into position by yourself actually quite tedious. But actually assembling it was a breeze just wish they had a better method for getting it aligned into the holding pieces that attach to the wall. Now the door holding itself open is a huge plus. And the fact that a tension style gate is this sturdy is also a plus. It has great features and is well built.",

If the tension is tight enough to hold the gate steady and not fall right over anytime the baby is touching it, then even grown adults struggle to open it with two hands. If you lessen the tension so you can get through the gate, the gate falls down when the baby stands at it.",
