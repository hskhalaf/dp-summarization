Any colder, and I plan to layer it under a thicker jacket, but I get cold very easily. I'm 5'4\", 105 pounds, and I ordered XS.",

My only issue is that it needs to be a little longer for a 1X. It barely makes it to the top of my jeans. When I sized up, it was way to big though. Overall happy at the price point but other busty women may find it shorter than preferred.",

The fleece fabric is a bit lighter and overall fit is a big snugger than my older purchase otherwise the style is the same. I had hoped for a brighter red based on the picture. This is a dull red and the color on the zippers is a bit off in terms of a dye match to the fleece fabric. The zippers have an orange cast to them. I will keep the jacket but really wish I could have rated it 5 stars.",

I ended up buying the Large and I\u2019m glad I did. The arm length is perfect, if not a bit longer than I expected. There\u2019s a little room in the chest, but it\u2019s perfect for layering. If you want a tighter fit, I would suggest Medium. I\u2019m subtracting one star only because the neck, when fully zipped up hits my chin at a weird angle. But I can make it work! But besides that, this a solid layering jacket for tall ladies.",

Weight is great for about 60-50 degrees with a tshirt under or lower temps with a thermal or long sleeve sweater under. The side seams give the jacket a nice shape - black color was very rich true black. Bottom and wrist edges are tailored and lie flat not bunchy drawstring like similar jackets.

      "text": "Very nice Columbia jacket. Fits true to size and washed up very well. This jacked does not have a liner but is still very warm and comfortable. It does not offer the warmth of a heavier jacket for the extremely cold days but is perfect for mild winters and shopping trips when you go in the stores and the heat is on blast. The jacket is very easy to keep up with and not to bulky to lug around with you. As a bonus I took this jacket to my local embroiderer and had initials added to the left side. This was a big hit for a Christmas present for my mom & sister in law!",

It fit nicely, not too tight, not too loose. She loved everything but the little dangly string on the sleeve for zipping the pocket. However, it was easily removed and there is a zipper handle. We live in the Southern US so we don't get a harsh winter. This coat provides just the right amount of warmth. I highly recommend this product.",

It worked out perfectly and I can probably layer a jacket or sweatshirt underneath if needed. I love the pocket on the upper arm and the fleece material is very soft and cozy :)",

The sleeves are a little more baggy/wide than I would like, but it's not too bad.",

I bought it for work so no harm done. I can get it on with my scrubs and a long sleeve undershirt on and still be able to move freely.",

It is fun to wear, practical, and just an all around great fleece. I like how it just flows on the bottom without any elastic. A more modern Columbia version although I am more of a higher end purchaser of fleece with bigger brand names. It is just all around great to wear and pretty impressed with it so far.",
