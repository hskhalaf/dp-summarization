It was easy to assemble as well . .not my strongpoint but if I could do it anyone could do it. The quality is amazing ! The finish is very clean and sturdy, nothing uneven or rocking back and forth. The only issue I had was the packaging. I didn't care for the clean-up afterwards with the foam balls all over the place. I had to vacuum at night. lol. I vacuum on the weekends when its daylight outside. Not after work. However after the clean-up and I placed the stand it was well worth it.",

Assembly was easy, and the set has one extra of every screws, that's a nice touch. Overall not disappointed, but could be a bit better on QC I guess.

I was seeing 'ok' media tables and stands that were starting at $299. I decided to search Amazon and came across this little gem. WONDERFUL media stand. Looks great (the curved wood is unbelievable) and it is very sturdy. Cable wheels and hidden cable run (down the back). Great purchase. If you are looking at this Whalen AVTEC48-TC and are just not sure.....forget about it! Great purchase. You will not be disappointed.",

My only complaint is that my receiver is fairly deep, and as a result the back of it butts up against the vertical support in the rear middle. That blocks use of some of the ports on the back of the receiver. Fortunately i was able to plug my wires in on the left and right, but that is a design defect if you have audio equipment that is really deep like me. Measure your equipment and get the depth of each shelf so you confirm you have plenty of space.",

For one thing the directions say to put each wooden side piece up first, and it's almost impossible to do this until all the shelves are in, because the side pieces tend to fall over. So you have to awkwardly use your leg to hold them still, or have a second person to hold them as you tighten screws. Also - your hands can get really tired trying to press 20 suction cups into the shelves - 4 per shelf. But that said - it's not complicated, the directions are clear, and it's a very pretty stand for a great price.",

Only minor complaint during unpacking there was a lot of tiny styrofoam particles that seem to stick to everything. Stand is taller than I was expecting. I have a fairly large receiver and it could fit easily on any one of the 5 shelves. Overall great product for the price and highly recommend.",

Some reviews complained about the stickers but I just used a little goo gone to get them off and no problem. The stickers help in identifying the correct pieces which is necessary for assembly. No problems with any of the pieces. The box and description say to not use it as a TV but we have a large 56 inch on it with no problem. Excellent product in my opinion.",

Only complaint is that the support bars under the top shelf cut in a little on the space, and I had to put my Klipsch Reference RC-52ii center channel speaker on the second from the bottom shelf, which is a little low for my taste, but it still works well. Other than that, very sturdy, aesthetically pleasing, and a solid piece of furniture. The cord management in the back is an added plus.",
