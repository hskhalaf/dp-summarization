This Epson's output is slightly less crisp than the Canon at the same quality setting, but it's certainly acceptable, and I can always bump up the quality setting when needed. The joy of not having to worry about running out of ink or paying for expensive replacement cartridges more than offset the small degradation in quality.",

Cleaning (regular and power flush) helps but does not completely fix the problem, and then it gets worse again soon thereafter. Scanning software is functional but very clunky. The advantage of not having to replace ink cartridges probably outweighs these problems for everyday work. Hopefully the next generation of this concept will be better.",

      "text": "After setting this printer up, I am really impressed with it! Filling the ink tanks was easy, but I was very cautious doing it, and had no problems with spilling ink. The quality of printing is very good, and the speed is also very good. I replaced a very good Canon printer with this printer....but the Canon printer used way too much ink! Although the initial cost of this printer is more, after about three ink refills with the Canon I would replace most of the cost of this Epson printer. Very happy with it!",
