Since the projector is connected to a receiver not able to speak on the speaker. We replaced this projector with one we've had for five years and the picture is ten times better. We have a dedicated theater room. During the super bowl party that's where most guest migrated to because of the picture. In fact one guess asked if he can camp out in our theater room during NFL season. All our guest was impressed with the picture quality. Set up didn't seem difficult.
