It does go crazy if a dirty fingerprint is used and the sun hits the fingerprint reader directly. A few issues: (1)install is difficult because its a chinese to english translation that doesn't make much sense, however the companies customer support is good. (2) One person can't have all forms of access, fingerprint, card, token, password (3) The fingerprint pad doesn't like direct sunlight",

It is on a hidden safe of mine, so i had to build it in with additional brackets. But it was so easy to install. It came with a disc that has very good instructions. Once set up... the functionality is VERY good...and the unit looks so professional. Could not be happier. GREAT product.",
