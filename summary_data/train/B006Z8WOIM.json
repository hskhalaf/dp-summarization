We lived in Japan for 3 years and our Honda Fit was experiencing slipping starting from a dead stop (a common issue if you don't keep up with the fluid changes). We replaced the fluid and solved most of the issues. Slipping mostly dissipated but permanent damage was already done to the transmission by the previous owner. With the fluid changed we were able to stop the damage and it lasted us for our time in Japan.",
