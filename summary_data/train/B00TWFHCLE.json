The screens back then were the size of an iphone but the entire size of the tv was close to the size of an elephant. So she thinks this is the bomb works good even if you don't have HDTV cable service she has cable but does not have the HDTV capability but this looks better than her other tv which is the old type. Maybe I'm back in the will now who knows.",

The feet are okay, I put them in correctly and used the screws provided to secure them, so they don't feel as though they are going to fall out and there is no wobble. But they do not balance the TV all that well. For example, if I had a cat I would be worried about it crawling behind the TV and knocking it over. So, use a wall mount or place in a low-traffic area.",

NOT!) but I was not about to spend half a day waiting for repair on a new set. Boo- Samsung. Yea- Amazon. I called Amazon and they issued me a credit right away with a return label. Yes- it's still inconvenient but more reasonable. Bad TV. Luck of the draw? You decide.",

Set up was quick and easy. I don't feel the legs supporting the TV are flimsy, they seem pretty sturdy to me. They don't take up a lot of space either. Very satisfied with this purchase and I recommend it, especially because I got it for sale for $189. It's my first Samsung and won't be my last!",
