      "text": "We recently moved into a place with stone tile that the previous owners left pretty dirty. We had mopped and scrubbed to no avail. So We we started looking for a solution to clean the floors without the use of harsh chemicals that would really get in there. We purchased this mop and after 1 pass in the kitchen (10x 5) we were BLOWN away by how clean it got them. If you are on the fence about this product I say go for it. It works amazing and is extremely easy to use.",

But I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 stars because of the flimsiness.",
