The cover becomes slightly lose in places again very quickly. For me, the Plus wasn't worth it as I don't take many pictures and a fingerprint sensor would be nice but not nice enough to justify the price bump (plus the fingerprint sensor spoils the look of the front of the phone slightly in my opinion.",
