      "text": "I'm a migraine sufferer and work on dual monitors at least 40 hours a week. I was hesitant about buying new computer screens since I needed 2 but I was desperate to deter any and all migraine triggers. I went ahead and bought these not expecting much of a difference but I am shocked. I keep my screen brightness extremely low since I have photophobia with my migraines and even with the brightness on 5, everything is crisp, clear and easy to read. My eye fatigue has decreased dramatically along with my migraines. If you suffer from migraines and have to be on a computer often, it is worth the investment.",

I know some programs do this automatically but for organizations that lock down their machine this is a nice way around it without using the blue light filtering glasses.",

Not individual pixels, whole rows of them from top of the screen to the bottom. I understand that these kinds of monitors suffer from the occasional dead pixel, but a whole row of them is something else entirely. I am not going to bash the brand, just this particular model. If you are looking at one of these I would recommend you don't. Spend a few extra bucks and get something else, something better.",

Compared to more expensive models and brands that I looked at when at Office Max, this monitor beats them, hands down. Matte screen and viewing angle are excellent. No room reflections.",

Only problem I encountered was fitting a DVI to HDMI adapter. This won't pose much of an issue for most people but the DVI adapter was a little large, and there is a ledge that prevents both the hdmi cable and dvi adapter to fit well. It fits and works perfectly fine but it is not 100% secure. Overall great monitor and this was my fault for not doing proper research, so I didn't deduct any stars. Would 100% recommend this monitor.",
