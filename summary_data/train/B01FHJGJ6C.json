I suppose you could guess about charge by looking at flashlight brightness or testing each time you go out but then it might down quickly..IDK...I just like seeing a green light turn on when I'm done charging... when I tested it the noise alone sounds intimidating so I think that's very cool",

It locks up the muscles like a conventional Taser that you see on TV. The only downside compared to other self defense tools (i.e. fire@rms)(silly Amazon restrictions) is you have to be close to your opponent. A brazen criminal will push right past the shock, and subdue you if he is bigger. So don't completely rely on this to save your life. Learn actual self defense (not from a McDojo that teaches Hollywood moves. Go practical.)",

    "description": "The VIPERTEK VTS-T03 stun gun really packs a punch! Just test firing this unit into the air is often enough to stop an attacker. As the bright electric current pulsates between the test prongs and creates an intimidating electrical sound, an attacker with any sense at all will be stopped in his tracks. If the sight and sound doesn't stop him, a jolt from this stun gun certainly will bring an attacker down! When an attacker is touched by the stun gun it will disrupt the message the brain sends to the voluntary muscles. Simply touching an attacker will deliver a high voltage shock causing loss of balance and muscle control, confusion, and disorientation bringing him to his knees and making him incapable of further aggressive activity.
