In order to stop our little angel from climbing up and balancing on the 1/2 inch top edge of our wide screen TV, we set up the units to each side of the television and with just a little snipping, placed an eight foot length of closet shelving over them. It was a perfect fit and better yet, it keeps her off the TV. The units are very sturdy and easy to assemble. Very good deal for the price.",

One of the metal pieces was slightly bent, too - but you can't see it so I'm not worried about it. Even with the slight shipping damage, these were still well worth the price I paid for them.

It was not difficult or labor intensive to assemble and the instructions are quite clear and easy to understand. I think this was a good value for my money.",

This is because there aren't predrilled holes within the shelves; when assembling, you will have to drill the holes in yourself which causes imperfections in alignment. So if you want them side by side, keep that in mind.",

They did not put the stickers where they would not be seen they are right in front for everyone to see. Third I was missing the last 2 screws to hold the shelves",

Assembly very easy, but recommend electric screwdriver unless you want to do 104 screws by hand! Assembly easier with two people only due to awkwardness of size, not weight. Hardware sizes up perfectly, no issues. Makes two bookcases. The only improvement I would suggest would be a higher lip on the back of each shelf. Probably the sturdiest and easiest to assemble furniture I've ever purchased. Much better than Ikea.",
