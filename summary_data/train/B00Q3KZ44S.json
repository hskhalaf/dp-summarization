I had hoped there would be an easier setting so that I could gradually build up strength. My main purpose for this purchase was the research behind using hand grips to lower blood pressure. It requires a 2-minute hold, but two minutes on the easiest setting is too much for me. There should be a couple of extra settings on this so that people can work their way up to a greater strength. As a modification, I am holding the grips partially engaged instead of fully engaged. I don't know if this will give me the same benefits.",

Once you apply pressure your fingers slip around the grip so the action isn't as beneficial as if it were non-slip. Also, it is very difficult to exercise using just the ends of your fingers; they slip off when you squeeze. I have wrapped the handles with gaffers tape to make them non slip. Now the device works well but there's still the danger of getting skin pinched by the \"stoppers\" (circled in the picture) which are not needed on a grip strengthener.",

I am more cautious, now.",

After a few months I've been increasing the resistance step by step, and getting great results. Jar lids fear me now. My biggest problem has been the hinge pin (see photo). As the gripper is used, the steel pin slowly slides out. After a few days I have to push it back with heavy pliers. Nothing I've tried will get it to stay in place.",

My one quip is that I don't care for the hard plastic grip when doing numerous repetitions - I think I'd like a slightly softer grip, perhaps with some texture. I think that the softer grip would affect longevity so it's probably a bit of a give and take in the grand spectrum of things, but it's something to consider while making your purchase.",

I can use it literally anywhere. Unfortunately, I can tell I will eventually outgrow it. I'm already using the highest setting. It would be great if there was a way to change out the spring for a stronger one. Maybe there already is!",

I mostly use it on the highest, but can adjust if I want to. I would say 90% highest, 10% on the next two lower resistances. It seems well constructed. As far as size, it fits my hands perfectly.
