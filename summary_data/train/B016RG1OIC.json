Only thing that's a bit tricky is due to the nature of it being collapsable, the side walls on the ball bit aren't going to withstand kids hanging/climbing on them. It doesn't break for us, just collapses down. It's fine for us, but may not be ok for some. Very easy to set up and take down. It's stored in a small bag. This makes it great for setting up inside when the weather isn't great outside. The balls aren't included (I almost missed this when I ordered), but there are tons of options on here for that.",

Dad loves the basketball net and we've had many ball \"wars\". Balls are not included and you will need well over 300 balls to fill completely, we started with 150 and the bottom is hardly covered. Planning to buy more balls soon, but overall great buy.",

It also has a flaw in the design, since the plastic balls don't stay into their hexagonal box, they overflow and get into the tunnel, since there is no boundaries there. Won't recommend it.",
