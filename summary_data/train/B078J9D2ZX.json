I followed the reviews and ordered a half size down from my normal cole haan size and the fit well. 4 stars because there was a bit of fraying in the back of the material already but it doesn\u2019t bother me enough to return. If I had ordered these directly from cole haan I would have returned but the price here was cheaper.",

I can\u2019t get a refund since I bought the shoes with my Amex credit rewards. So it is a waste of money. I dont recommend this shoes to anyone and I am very very much disappointed with Cole Haan",
