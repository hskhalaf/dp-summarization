The chest strap fits great, won't roll-up on your lats and will easily pair with any Suunto producr from AMBIT3 on up.",

Product description indicated the H10 is compatible with Strava however it appears one has to link the Polar app to Strava to transfer data, it does not link directly. If trying to use the Polar app (Polar Beat) it does not report altitude, this is apparently an extra-cost option. Polar Product Support was not helpful, just re-stated the above. Polar app does a whole lot of training tracking, with lots of features I don't need and does not do the simple one of altitude tracking.",
