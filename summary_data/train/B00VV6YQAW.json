So I bought these marine grade speakers and mounted them under my toolbox on a 2\" aluminum bar, they are being pushed with a pioneer 480 watt 4 channel amp. THEY SOUND GREAT!!! I am completely satisfied. I wired in a switch to the remote wire to turn them off when I don't need them. These speakers are super loud. Would def recomend these to anyone!!",

I have recently installed a Monster Tower on my boat (2.5\" diameter) and these will not fit. Kind of sad because I bought them on a budget, I will be returning them and looking for something else with a better mount.",
