I was so pleasently surprised when I got this in the mail and it came with easy to use instructions, a soft storage bag, and it actually worked! I tried the ear and head option on myself, and my son, and both readings were super close and seemed like a normal temperature! To use the ear feature you just remove the blue top and it reveals the ear part. The light is also nice for nightime temperature taking! I am so impressed!",
