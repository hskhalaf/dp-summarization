The golden flax seed seems to have a softer husk than the brown, if the sound they make when being ground up in a coffee grinder is any indication. I'd give the brown ones four stars as well, but for the higher omega 3 levels. A five star rating would be flax seed that had better taste overall, but that's not the reason you eat the stuff in the first place.",
