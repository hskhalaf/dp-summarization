My only complaint is that the dimmer is a little fussy and touchy, sometimes turning the lamp completely off when trying to adjust. But the lamp is beautiful, warm and I LOVE the color. It is pink during day and orange at night. In fact, I have to close my bedroom door to keep it from lighting up the room. A beautiful glow but one I prefer not to see while I'm sleeping.",

Well, it definitely enhances the air quality, adds soft light and is just overall a great item. I originally bought one and had to buy a second one for the household. So, we have two now. What I liked about this particular product is the wooden base (although I use a ceramic plate underneath, just in case), the fact that it is made of natural materials. The lamps differ in shape and in size a little, as they're carved out of natural salt deposits. So, all in all, a great product worth the investment. I would recommend it to anyone. Thank you!",
