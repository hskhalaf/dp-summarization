From unpacking to completion took about 3 hours. The most difficult task was peeling off the protective film from the stainless steel surfaces. Although Weber included a couple of assembly tools, I discarded them and used my own socket set and screwdrivers.",

I am by no means a pro at grilling, but by following recipes from a separately purchased Weber cookbook I have had no fails. The ease of igniting the burners and the grease collection system are big winners. I find the heat is even but adjustable for indirect cooking. The grill is sturdy and attractive. I am glad I purchased this grill and would recommend.",

(Including beverage breaks) Other than that, I'm very happy with this grill. I'm just about through my first tank, and have used it probably 15 times this season. With two burners on high, it reaches 450 pretty quickly. I've only had all three burners going once and it was into the 700 range before I turned down the heat. The grates after holding up nicely, and clean up well with minimal effort. Very satisfied.",

The heat distribution was great and temperature control was easy. The steaks turned out delicious and it was much easier to keep them consistent than my previous grill.",
