The drive is a little thinner than the older OCZ drives so I suspect it fits in lower-profile laptops. One issue I've encountered is that my SATA cable clips don't catch and pull out easily. The only other drawback to the drive is that it's making me want to get rid of my older OCZ drives!",

I wont give it 5 starts because while trying to make a full backup the computer crashed several times only to find out there where like 10-20 corrupted files. Had to delete them before completing the backup (luckily had a backup of this files). For now I've got everything in a NAS server and a backup just in case.
