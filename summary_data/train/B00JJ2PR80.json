      "text": "I swore off keyboards for my iPad Air after going through a few keyboards- the experience was not satisfactory. With some hesitation, I tried the Alpatronix KX130 keyboard. The keyboard itself is quite solid, with large keys. Operating it is intuitive and the user manual is straightforward and helpful. Connecting to bluetooth was quick and easy and the battery lasts a long time for a portable. My iPad slipped into (and out of) the keyboard case easily. The Keyboard case itself was only adequate at keeping the keyboard in different orientations, frequently slipping closed. Overall, a great product that is durable and easy to use. Worth the investment",

I have only had to charge the keyboard once and almost a month later it's still more than halfway charged. The bluetooth automatically connects to the iPad and there is no lag when I type. The keyboard base is magnetically attached to the bottom, so one can easily take it off if they won't be typing, which then offers you two different placements for putting your iPad. The flap that closes the case is also magnetic and easily snaps close. Overall, it has a sturdy feel to it and is nicely designed for work or school use.",

The magnetic connection between keyboard and iPad is easy and makes an immediate functional connection. Keyboard charges while connected so no worries about having to charge yet another device each evening. The keyboard case protects the back and front of the IPad but is slim and sleek. I\u2019m very happy with the design and function of this keyboard. I\u2019d buy it again. Glad I researched and didn\u2019t settle for the Apple product.",

Well, this is another winner. Couldn't be easier to use and set up- the iPad linked to it instantly and one really nice feature is that you can switch off the keyboard if you don't want to use it. You can also totally remove it (it's held magnetically, I think) and just use the case for protection. You have clear access to all the iPad's buttons and switches so don't worry about that.

It comes with a mini-usb charging cable that will plug into any USB block charger or an available USB jack on your PC or hub.

It also broke its hinge about a year in, so no more for me. This keyboard has a nice tight feel, and I've not had a single duplicate stroke. 4-stars only because it's quite a bit bulkier than I'm used to, but I'll get used to it. Overall, I'm very pleased and would buy it again.",

In order to change to an uppercase I have to hold down shift key hard. Also, the ridge that holds the IPad upright when using it is not sufficient. It needs a larger ridge so the IPad doesn't slide down over the keys.",

I like how the case extends below the keyboard and serves as a 'pad' to rest your wrists on when typing. Nice design touch. Keyboard is removable and held in place with magnets. Using a keyboard with the iPad is so much better than trying to type long emails or documents with the on-screen keyboard. Would recommend!",

It gets interesting having two charging cables but then that's cable management not the product. Only reason I gave 4 not 5 stars is the case flap at the end of the keyboard, not shown in the pictures, gets in the way when I'm trying to use it on my lap or a non-hard surface. You tuck it under the keyboard and it raises it up to a funny angle, you leave it out and you can't move the keyboard closer, it's in the way.",

I was hoping to be able to sit it in my lap and use the keyboard but it doesn't really fit that well. I wish that my old keyboard that I bought when I originally got the iPad at the Verizon store didn't break. If my iPad was brand new I would return this keyboard but it'll be fine for my old one.
