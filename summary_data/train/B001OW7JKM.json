I tested this at the container store (As many others have) and the chairs are very similar, it seems their chair is a bit larger but not by much. I really like this chair and wanted to buy another one but NO WAY they raised the price for some reason to nearly double what I paid just 3 days later!! Now I am going to the container store to buy the other chair!",

Feels like the chair is designed for someone 5'5\" or shorter. The one with the arm rests at the Container Store is way more comfortable. The seat is bigger and the chair reclines.",

Not good when you sit and don't expect that!! I'm afraid someone will end up on the floor one of these days since it's on wheels.

The chair pumped to full height has a nice bounce, but if you use your hands to hold the sides of the chair as you sit down and leave them there, the seat comes down on your fingers, causing your fingers to be painfully crushed.

I'm very small so office chairs are often just not quite right for me. However, this has proven very comfortable. In addition, it arrived in great shape and was incredibly easy to set up. For the price, it's an incredible product. I just have to figure out an attractive option for transforming it into something that doesn't look like a discarded lawn chair.",

I am 5'11, 175 lbs and I had to return this. The measurements in the description are accurate but because of the bungee system you cannot sit on about 2-3 inches of it on each of the sides and you cannot sit with your legs open over the sides (comfortably).",
