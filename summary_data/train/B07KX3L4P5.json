The bottom is nearly flat and i slip almost every time. This is the first time i transitioned to adidas from nike/under armor but after this i think ima stick to them. Great fit, comfortable, and breathable, but not too practical",

Box was little beat up but shoes were new and in excellent condition. My son was excited to break them in till he tried them on. In the box I couldn't not tell. They do run narrow in the toes and not recommended for wide feet. They are super light weight and great football shoes. Seller was quick to respond and could not locate other shoe. So I had to return them and covered shipping. I ended up ordering directly from Adidas for his cleats.",
