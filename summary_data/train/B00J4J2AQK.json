I use it to store my laptop, charger, assorted cords and cables and adapters, students' papers, my water bottle, makeup, and wallet. It cleans easily and it's just terrific. The insulation works to protect my laptop, too- and it keeps condensation from my water bottle away from electronics",

      "text": "Ok, I love this bag. It's pretty and I like that I'm not carrying around a cartoon covered bag. It had a bunch of pockets which help keep me organzied. Easy to wipe clean as well. My FAVORITE thing about this is the stroller straps. I use them all the time, on my stroller and on shopping carts. So why the 3 stars? The size. I wish it was just 2 inches wider. It would fit so much more that way I mean babies take A LOT of crap to get through a trip or day. It is taller which is nice but then you end up digging around and removing items to find things in the bottom",

The bag should be slightly wider and allow the opening at the top to be larger so you can easily see/access the items. Ended up finding a larger bag by a different brand for baby number two and realized just how frustrated I had been with the Skip hop Duo. Good, but not great.",

I can fit a receiving blanket, 3-4 changes of clothes, and bottles in this bag easily with my Pronto bag containing the diapers and wipes fitting on top.

The way the bag is designed is its about a 4\" wide base and tapers to a 2.75\" opening so because of that you actually lose space and the opening to me is tight when reaching in with both hands. This is the newer bag too. Skip Hop needs to designe the bag 4\" all the up and it would be perfect. Really wanted the messenger one with the flap but I heard and saw it did not seal and stuff could easily fall out.",

I fit all my baby things and have room for my things as well, so I use it as my everyday bag. The style is cute and durable, and I love that it's tall I can fit a magazine in the back sleeve or my tablet and still have room for everything else. I open it and can easily find stuff even on the bottom. Great bag, highly recommend!",

The best part is that you can hook it to the push bar on your stroller. That is a life saver. It's really cute, I've gotten compliments on it. The long strap is really comfortable over the shoulder. Some people think the main pocket is too deep, and I guess it is deep but I don't see what the big deal is. I put less useful stuff on the bottom like a spare change of clothes.",
