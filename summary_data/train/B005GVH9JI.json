The Aramith Balls definitely have a better shine, and play, but both have shown gouges/scratch marks after just a few days of play. Before I owned my own table, I used to play 3 to 4 times per week at my local pool hall, and their pool balls get abused much more than mine do, and they do not show the wear that these do. Let me be clear after my rant, these balls hold up much better than the cheaper balls.....if you are serious about your play, get this set, or the more expensive set",

Sort of like that solid car door closing sound that is so rare today, these balls sound right when you play. And they play very well, too. The literature accompanying the balls states that we could expect them to last up to five times longer than traditional polymer balls. We've got many years of games to play before we can comment on that, but so far, so good! Highly recommended.",
