The stone stains quickly which causes fresh pizza dough to stick to the burnt residue which increases the problem with each pizza cooked. But worse, the stone emits a foul odor that stinks up the house for hours after use. Need to burn candles, spray room spray and open windows. Maybe overtime that will eventually stop, but I am uncertain as to see if that is the case.",

It helps to maintain heat levels in the oven so there is less up and down or on and off of the heating action. Makes cooking at sustained temps much more stable. If you don't cook pizza at home, I would say to still get one to help all your other oven cooking!",
