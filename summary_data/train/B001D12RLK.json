      "text": "My 3-year-old son loves his red Tripp Trapp chair. Its easy to climb on and he's proud that he has his own adult chair. It was easy to assemble and I've adjusted it a couple of times without much difficulty. The wood and painted surface are of excellent quality. Its very very easy to wipe clean - much easier than our wooden dining chairs and our other toddler's plastic booster. My 1-year-old is always trying to climb onto the chair, so we'll probably get one for her too.",

The reason for buying this is for its adaptability. From high chair to adult chair and everything in between. Given the solid construction I can see this lasting for years. The red is an appealing color.",

It's pricey but it'll last for a very long time. We sometimes even use it as a ladder to get stuff from higher shelves. It's that sturdy.",

It grows with the child, and enables proper ergonomics throughout. With the Stokke chair they enjoy a meal and sit still to eat. I think it just calms them down to be at the right height. There's no wiggly discomfort that we see at a lot of friends' houses where the kids graduate to a grown up chair far too early. Peace of mind to enjoy the food then you don't have your plate at eye level. Well made, so well thought out!",

I bought the plastic baby guard for this chair because our older seat only has a waist belt, but this newer seat has an over the shoulder harness, so I don't think we even needed the guard.

We bought a second high chair with a tray and put our Stokke chair away for a while. We're hoping it will become useful later as our baby grows.",
