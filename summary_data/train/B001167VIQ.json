      "text": "I use these pots and pans daily. I'm not very gentle when it comes to storing them in my cabinets, but they are holding up well with no scratches whatsoever. Nonstick surface makes both cooking and cleaning a breeze. Any leftover residue in the pan after cooking comes off easily with warm water and a soft sponge. Great heat distribution and a nice weight on the bottom of the pan, so the handle doesn't cause the pan to tilt while it's sitting on the stovetop. Packaging was perfect, delivery was quick, no issues at all. Highly recommend.",

Heats nice and evenly. Can get them really hot and it doesn't affect the pan. And I clean them almost exclusively by throwing them in the dishwasher.
