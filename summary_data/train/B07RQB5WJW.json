It is not a problem with the document pages ... it is clearly the feeder. I have run the same documents through my home printer/scanner (a Brother product) with no problems; then this scanner and the pages run through at the same time.",

I'm using it at home while working during the pandemic, but it is ideal for our small ministry office. The price seems reasonable.

I tried doing this and the chip fell into the new cartridge and got stuck! Now I can't afford the cartridges with the chip and I have no working cartridges so I have a useless $400 printer! I will never buy HP again!",

The Toners for this are extremely expensive and for a business that makes tons of copies each day, its almost not worth the price on how fast we go through them. Buying generic toner is a pain because you have to remove the chip from the old toner and replace. I probably would not buy this machine again for business. Buying it for home use should be okay.",
