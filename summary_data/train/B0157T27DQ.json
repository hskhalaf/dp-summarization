      "text": "The throw size is too small, but that's my fault for not measuring out the dimensions. My issue with this blanket is with how terribly thin it is. It is virtually weightless and provides nothing but texture. If all you're looking for is a soft surface, this is good for you. But, per my own taste, this is not really ideal if you're looking to wrap up for a cozy couch potato session. If it's a chilly day, do not count on this item to provide any sort of warmth. I would spend the extra money for a heavier, larger blanket.",

I haven't used it long enough yet to see how it stands up to a wash, but I love how it feels so far! I recommend this!",

I have ordered the burgundy blanket and hope that one will turn out better.
