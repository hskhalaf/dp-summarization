The story is pretty linear, and it feels like your choices only change the story at surface level. Choices don't really make much of a difference. The story is epic.

Waiting a month for less than an hours\u2019 worth of game play is just not worth it to me. This concept of waiting on episodes is no different than paying money for something that\u2019s not finished yet, so if I were you I would wait until this game is completely finished, all episodes are made, before you buy, of course that could mean a year are so :-(",

The code provided doesn't work through Steam and can only be used directly with Telltale's website. I have been trying to contact Telltale for WEEKS, and I haven't heard a peep from them. My impression is that if your game has issues, you're stuck with those issues unless the solution is found through Google. I assume it's a great game based on Episode 1, but I have no access to it.",

The only problem I had was one or two times where I chose to say something and it didn't really come out the way I had wanted it to. Overall amazing game!",

Like Telltale's Walking Dead series, it's best to think of this as a choose your own interactive adventure than a typical adventure game. The story and the choices make up most of the gameplay. It's never particularly difficult, but the game forces you to make decisions quickly that impact the story. My biggest complaint is that I have to wait for the remaining episodes. Part 1 was amazing. The first episode lasts around 2 hours (your mileage will vary) and I assume the remaining episodes will follow that trend.",
