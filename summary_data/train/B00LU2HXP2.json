      "text": "I had the old George Foremans that did not have the removable grill plates, so I was very excited about that prospect. These are a basic model and don't do anything fancy, which was fine with me. The removable grill plates have made cleanup so much easier that we are using these much more now. The downside is that they are already showing wear on the grill plates with some of the surface material coming off. I kind of expected this since they were not very expensive. There are probably grills out there that won't do that so soon, but for the price and ease of cleaning I am not unhappy with it.",

And once it is hot, it is really difficult to get it back in its place.Those two little tabs do not hold the top grill in place -- really bad design. Plus, I read another reviewer's comment that the drip catcher doesn't work, and I thought how could that be possible? Well, he was right, it misses a lot of drips and is really messy. Will never buy this model again.",

It's virtually impossible to screw up since there is a green light that turns on when the grill is ready, then turns off and and on again when the food is ready. The grill plates popped off easy and cleaned spotless in the dishwasher, as promised. The cord wraps neatly around the base for convenient storage. I give it a 4.5 stars (it loses .5 of a star because I am a bitch and nothing is perfect)",
