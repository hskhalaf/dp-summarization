Today, not even 5 months later, both of the straps broke and the mirror fell and hit my baby's shoulder (thankfully not her face). I don't work now and drive a couple miles every other day, so I am not sure what the hell happened to the product. The straps look like they are literally falling apart when I press on them, VERY bad quality! I have never seen anything like this before. I decided to buy this product because of great amazon reviews, and thankfully my baby is okay.",

My baby hasn't figured it out yet but I'm sure she will soon and we can stare at each other at stop signs or such. The suction on the smaller mirror worked like a charm, super easy to put onto the windshield.",

It was preassembled and fit perfectly over the middle headrest of our 2014 Toyota Corolla. It looks like it will work to move to the side seat when we upgrade car seats. It has a tilt feature and it is very secure- we've seem no movement of the mirror while driving. It has given me peace of mind that I can see my daughter while driving (she hates car rides and cries often). It also comes with a cleaning cloth and a lifetime warranty. I'd recommend this mirror- easy to install, secure and large.",

      "text": "We purchased this mirror a couple of years ago when our son was born. The mirror works well. We did scratch it early on, but that was due to putting it in the trunk and not protecting it adequately. The mirror is easy to attach to the headrest and the pivot adjustment is stable and stays in place. However, I recently removed the mirror and found that it has stained the headrest. Our car is a Honda Accord with beige leather seats. The headrest now has dark stains in the shape of the black nylon straps that attach the mirror to the headrest. While the mirror functions as intended, I find that staining the seat is unacceptable.",

In person, this is a good-looking mirror - I like the matte charcoal plastic frame - it doesn't look cheap like many plastic products. Unfortunately, this mirror did not reflect as big of an area of the baby car seat as the competitor product. It just doesn't set back the reflection far enough to capture as much vertical area as the other. So I am sending this one back and keeping the other.",

I have made adjustments to both mirrors to fix them but most wouldn't be able to. Overall not worth the money.",

Second, I really like that it is adjustable (rotates) so it works for me to see my baby but it's nice for him to look at himself too. I guess he thinks he's as cute as we think he is :) Third, it is very big which is great for me and him. Fourth, it is a nice clear mirror. None of that \"fun house\" mirror look at all. Lastly, it's a great price for how nice it is. I would definitely recommend this product!",

The only draw back is when I put it on the head rest and made sure to follow the installation instructions, as well as tighten the straps, making sure the adjustment was tight too - the mirror kept moving down while I would drive and not stay in the position I put it in. So my husband went to adjust it and ended up putting the mirror upside down so that it would stay in place.",

That is the one negative on this mirror. Even if we don\u2019t nudge it, the mirror still moves while we\u2019re driving to where we can\u2019t see our child. We really like the mirrors. They fit on all sizes of headrests and you can adjust them any direction. The only negative is that you can't tighten them in place enough, so they move easily with any nudge. We end up hitting ours with the car seat a lot, so we are constantly readjusting them.",

I would recommend this to someone and would buy it again. It also has a lifetime warranty which is great!",

Small pressure from your hands will move it easy enough though. For me, I feel the the view from my rear view to this mirror gave me a \"wide\" lense view of my baby. Also sort of made my daughter look tinier coz it seemed further away than it really was.",
