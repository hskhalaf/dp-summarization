Otherwise, the cage is very cute and sturdy. She loves having a little hideaway house and an area to be out in the open when she wants to be.",

This is tight for my two piggies and I will most likely need to get something bigger in the future.",

      "text": "Great hutch for a guinea pig. Attractive, functional, etc, but consider this - the floor of the covered section is wood (removable), and wood absorbs liquid and hold onto odors. Guinea pigs like to do their business in the dark, so this is a good place for a litter box. However, they also like to sleep in the covered dark section. My daughter's guinea pig ends up sleeping, pooping, and peeing all in that small space. I line it with pee pads, and he's litter trained, but I'm still concerned that he sleeps and spends so much time in a confined space with poop & ammonia odors (which can very quickly cause respiratory problems).",

We tried more absorbent bedding, expensive bedding, newspaper, paper bags from the grocery store etc and no matter what we do, urine leaks out of the side and down the leg.

The waterproof pan seems to be well constructed - that I was pleased with. My niece's rabbit immediate hopped to the covered section - that seemed to be a big hit for her rabbit.

I wouldn't Recommend for full size bunny it would be rather cramped. I also wouldn't recommend it unless your animal is litter-box trained or you do wire across the tray because there's nothing separating the tray they walk on on there droppings/pee if they go anywhere in the hutch itself.",
