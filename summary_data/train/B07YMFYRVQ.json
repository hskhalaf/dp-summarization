      "title": "Great Racing Wheel for Kids",
      "text": "Before purchase, note that this is more of a wheel for kids. The wheel diameter is only 220mm and can only turn 90 degree to each side, (180 total). Also, there is no force feedback (that is to be expected given it's only $70) but instead, it's a rubber that forces the wheel into neutral position. One thing my kid really like is the logo is actually a button for horn. It's a great wheel for introducing driving games to kids. There is a Pro version exclusive to Gamestop for $100. It's bigger (280mm), and can turn 270 degree, but note that there is no force feedback for that version as well.",

      "text": "This is a fantastic product. Revived our love for Mario Kart. The wheel is very expertly crafted. The pedals are designed to be on carpet floor since it has no suction cups like the wheel does. They move around a bit while in use. However there's nothing duct tape won't fix. The suction cups do work you just have to get everything REALLY clean. The cups themselves, The platform they will be resting on, your hands. You know just tidy up a bit. The pedals and everything are designed for kids so if you a big boy or girl. Buy the bigger versions instead. Overall fantastic product.",
