The doctors were perplexed and kept suggesting stretching it. The pain kept getting worse until I decided to get this collar. I wore it for only a week and the pain reduced by almost 80%. I still wear once in a while to get 100% result. All I needed was some restriction in the neck motion not the stretching as per doc\u2019s suggestions. I shelled so much money on them and the actual solution cost me only $15.99. Unbelievable!",

Otherwise, it washes well and has been the answer to getting rid of my neck pain.",

      "text": "I was hesitant about ordering a collar without trying it on first, but I\u2019m definitely glad I found this one! So easy to wear with most of my clothes without being in your face that I have a Cervical collar on, especially in the winter; I was able to get my hoodies and shirts over them without a problem (I have both versions) and even customized them with colorful, fuzzy socks on a few occasions. Highly recommend if you have never had to wear one of these and need it for daily support/protection!",

I love that is has a silky sleeve to go over it for comfort and for cleanliness. There is a seam on the sleeve that WAS badly irritating the skin beneath my neck . . . but when I figured out it was the seam not the brace itself I took the sleeve off and put it back on being sure the seam on the collar was facing out and not touching my skin. Then it was very comfortable day and night!",
