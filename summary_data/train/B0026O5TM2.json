Once I did figured it out (which did take some time) it was simple... First start with the bottom step for stability. Insert the back of the step (as shown in the pic) then step on the front. Snaps right in. Then do the same with the top step. Took me less than five minutes on my own (no help). Hope this helps\ud83d\ude0a",

You can put this together with either a curved edge or a straight edge on top. Since my hot tub has a straightedge, I placed a straight edge on the top step as the directions say. If your hot tub has a curved edge, you place the curved step on top. These are definitely rugged steps. I had to jump on the step to get it to snap into place.",

However, it does not require any brains to figure the assembly out but it requires a rubber hammer and a lot of muscles to snap it together! One has to pound REALLY hard and fore a long time for the pieces to snap. What worked at the end was pounding one snap in and just stepping really hard on the other snap. The snap parts are poorly designed! Like someone said, yes, you have to pound the daylight to get it assembled! This company should learn from IKEA.... Pieces fit together way easier...",

      "text": "I actually purchased these steps to use with our older motorhome when it is parked at my home. It's also use as \"guest quarters\" when a lot of friends and family stay over. The \"built in\" steps are small and steep and some older family members struggle with them. These steps worked out great for us. They are wide, stable and a weather resistant material. They could be a bit stiffer, but they should hold up well for average sized user.",
