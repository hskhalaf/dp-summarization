But they are comfortable and you can wear them all day. I use them on my laptop for Zoom meetings. They're reasonably well made and serve their purpose well. If you want high quality sound then don't get these but if you need headphones for Zoom meetings and occasionally listening to music at work then these will do the job well.",

      "text": "I bought these headphones for listening to talk programs, and I think that they are ideally suited for that purpose because their frequency output is strongest in the high range and weakest in the low range. That weakness in the bass frequencies however make them a poor choice for listening to music in my opinion. Also the jack for the insertion of the plug is recessed into a 6 mm. diameter hole which means that the headphones will not accept a standard patch cord plug unless you first file or grind the back part of the plug down to 5.5 mm. diameter or smaller.",

They sound almost exactly the same, in every significant way, to my older Sennheiser HD 580 headphones, except that they may have a little more bass extension, if you get a good seal on your ears. I think I would describe the sound quality as being very neutral, and wide range - like a good pair of near-field monitor loudspeakers. I like the plug-in stereo cord. If you need to replace it, or want to change it's length, just buy any stereo cord with 1/8th inch plugs from any electronics supply store. You can't go wrong for the price.",

I can see using the SP540 for travel (plane, train, bus) and SP330 for travel (car). There is more background noise on planes, trains and buses than in the car. The SP540 fits over the entire ear where the SP330 model just sits onto of the ear. So if there is background noise you definitely want the SP540. Another place I think the SP540 would benefit over the SP330 is the coffee shop or the beach where there is a lot of background noise. Both fit nicely into a carry case for compact storage.",
