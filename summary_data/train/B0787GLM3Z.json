The 2mm wetsuit provides core warmth for swimming on colder days. The design allows for unrestricted movement for all types of water activities. I am really happy with this wetsuit and recommend it. UPDATE: Been using it for a month now and I have nothing but positive things to say. I have no problem swimming laps in it, no rashes, and no discomfort. The rubber lining at the edges prevent cold water from getting underneath. Truly an excellent spring suit. Worth every penny.",

However, my husband is XL and so, after reading the reviews and their comments about size, I figured it would be best to order him XXL. As it happens, he can only just fit into it ... I should have ordered XXXL. There is one other thing I would mention. This wet suit zips up at the back. It is therefore impossible to get in or out of this wetsuit without assistance. This was not something I considered when picking this wetsuit.",
