      "text": "I honestly never thought i would appreciate a rubber collapsible bucket so much. Purchased this to keep in a smaller boat. Works extremely well for throwing live bait in it and keeping close by instead of taking trips back and forth to the livewell. It worked so well that my fishing buddy stole it to use in his boat and i had to buy another. Update: It has been about a year now and it's still going strong. No rips or leaks in it, and still folds up flat and stores easy. The handle did begin to rust but that was expected being it is used only with salt water.",
