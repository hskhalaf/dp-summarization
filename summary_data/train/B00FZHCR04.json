I returned as there\u2019s a bit of interference and it\u2019s impossible to speak with both ears in. That said, just returned my Powerbeats 3 also as they are horrendous in calls, like calling from inside an electric razor whilst inside a washing machine",

There is clearly a problem with this product. I would not recommend.",

    "description": "Style Name:Wired| Colour Name:Black/GrayEPIC, Earbuds ReImagined Revolutionary Fit. Radical Sound. 8 Years. 1 EPIC pair of earbuds. That's right. The EPIC is the result of eight years of engineering, research and design. They're the new bad boy of sound - and they were created directly from customer feedback, reviews and industry know-how. 1,000 ways to rock. Comfortably. We straight ran out of ways to make old technology comfortable. So, we got innovative. Introducing Cush Fins, the revolutionary earbud system that guarantees a perfect fit and ear-lapping comfort. Coupled with seven gel tips, Cush Fins give you 1,000-plus formulas to fine-tune your listening setup. Whoa, this is big. Sound not forgotten. Just because they're comfortable doesn't mean they won't rattle your globe. The EPIC uses C3 technology to deliver clean, crisp sound no matter your flavor of music. Drench your ears in vibrant highs and song-defining mids - all delivered through Jlab's high-performance 13-mm drivers, the largest driver we've ever packed into an earbud! Built To Last Did we get carried away? Perhaps. But how epic would these earbuds be if they weren't built to last? Featuring a universal mic and simple track control, the flat, tangle-free cable offers additional strength when things get messy. Seriously, we tested these during a death match with a cobra, puma and liger. OK, no, we didn't. But they're pretty dang strong.\n\nBOX CONTAINS\n1x headphones",
