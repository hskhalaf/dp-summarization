      "text": "Probably the best strap available. It truly fits like a glove. I use it with the XT3 and while the XT3 is a very lightweight camera, it gives me extra security when hand holding it. There is an extra strap that you can attach to prevent it from ever slipping out of your hand. Very useful if you are on some sort of ledge or standing over water where one drop could mean the end of your investment. Only problem was that Amazon Warehouse didn't send me any of the necessary hardware to attach it. Being as awesome as Amazon is, they compensated me with no issues so I am very happy.",

      "text": "The product works great. It gets the neck strap off the camera and provides a great way to secure the camera while moving through the field. Buy the belt clip and plate so you can secure the camera while ascending or descending on trails, stairs, or other obstacles. Sounds like a no brainer but skimping here equates to arm/wrist fatige and less than stable hobbling over obstacles. Pro Tip: If you have medium to large hands. Angle the strap towards the lens and curl/choke up like you're dialing in the shutter speed. Then lock down the straps position. This will ensure you have enough room to articulate quickly.",

      "text": "The strap is really comfortable while providing a safe way to carry my 5D MIII. However, when I put the camera into my camera bag, the plastic tab (at arrow in picture) that attaches the strap to the camera often slips out of the flattened islet on my camera. A small strap keeps the camera from complete separation, but with the tab out of position the Spider Pro Hand Strap is loose. An engineering change to that tab attachment is needed to make this strap perfect. Despite this problem, I really like this strap and use it frequently.",

It's like the camera becomes a natural extension for my hand. No more neck aches. I bought additional units from amazon for my other cameras.",

When I first installed it, I had the plastic brace going parallel to the camera (straight across). It made holding it kind of awkward. I noticed for DSLRs it said to angle it, so I gave it a bit of an angle and I was able to hold it better (thumb and index finger placements in their spots). Overall great strap. I worry about the thin leather security strap, but so far so good.",

Another issue I have is that going from hip to hand takes several seconds getting this thing all strapped on. I have found i have missed a few shots due to this. Other than that, it is very well made and very comfortable.",

I have fairly big hands, and I am still able to use all buttons on the back of Canon 5D Mk III with my right thumb (only after adjusting the strap properly).",

In our case I believe that is partly due to the way we \"stuff\" it down in our camera case, but it's very easy to tighten and didn't stop us from purchasing one for our second camera.",

I have tried both Spider-Pro and Spider-Light with this camera, and I can say with certainty that the Spider-Pro feels a lot more secure as it doesn't rely on a loose plastic hinge. My only complaint is the tight squeeze on the battery / SD card doors. They are both accessible, but may require a few extra seconds to insert / remove. Otherwise, it's still a relatively comfy fit and I am able to access all functionality.",

It is comfortable, extremely adjustable, and simply feels like its part of the camera rather than something simply slapped on to give added support. I'm thoroughly enjoying the SpiderPro Hand Strap on both of my cameras and I will likely purchase a third for my backup camera since I don't plan on ever taking them off my two primary cameras.",

I would rather have shoulder straps. Although not 100% uncomfortable, it's not perfect. I like how you can adjust it though based on your hand size. I don't like the face that it's an allen wrench connection.",
