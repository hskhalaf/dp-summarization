The tread on all my wheels are so worn down and my baby is only a month and a half old. At this rate I will be having to replace the wheels every few months.",

The car seat must be approved by the hospital which allowed you to leave with the baby and this product does just that. This system is also good for when the baby becomes a toddler, just remove the carriage. Best investment ever.",

The car seat is easy to adjust for when they get bigger, the stroller is amazing and rides smoothly. I\u2019ve been using it for the past 6 months now and I\u2019m very happy with my purchase. Highly recommend!",
