Even if it ends up breaking for the price I will probably end up buying another. Not sure what else there is to say! The only confusing thing about this product is the lights on the front are 'backwards': when you plug in the back controller, the light on the panel that lights up is the bottom one...I find this odd, but no reason not to buy the product!!",

HOWEVER, because the charger plugs into the headphone I feel like it has caused very minor damage to my controller. Because you will always be charging your controller it will wear out your headphone jack and if you use wired headsets like me the connection with your headphones will probably be loose. In the end it's a great buy and if you use wireless headsets anyway it's a must have.",

No chance of the controller falling out or not charging. Uses USB to charge so if you are like me and only puts their PS4 to sleep, you can just plug it into the front of the PS4 and it will always be charged! THE BAD: Nothing. It charges. End of story haha OVERALL: GREAT buy for a PS4 owner. Great price. Works perfectly, completely as advertised.",

I tried three controllers and all three would only charge if I pressed them down hard on back port. Don't want to screw up charger port and no need for the dock if I can only charge one at a time.",

Also, the charging symbols are wildly ineffective at showing which controller(s) are connected or charging. Sometimes they\u2019re red when the controller is connected. Sometimes they\u2019re green. Neither is apparently a sure sign of charging, because often I pull the controller off after many hours of being connected, and it\u2019s still dead.",

It seems to only charge the controller when needed. If i play for a short time the controller still shows as charged when I'm done. I feel like the charging indicator LEDs were in the wrong order. Like the front LED was for the rear controller but i don't have it in front of me to verify. Either way, the amber LED on the controller itself is on while charging.",

I was so tired of my son either losing the cord to charge the controller or he couldn't wait for them to charged so he would plug it and play while it was charging. This way both of the controllers can at the same time and when one dies he can pick up the other. It's a lifesaver!",

I have not found this to be an issue at all. It easily charges two controllers with no problem. The led indicators on the front are a good addition as well. Would definitely recommend.",

If you plug it into your PS4, your controllers charge when it's in rest mode or if you're using one controller you can charge the other. Or if you have an extra AC adapter laying around you can have it always charging if you get a longer cord!",
