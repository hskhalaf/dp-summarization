This sling is something I will be using alot as its so comfortable for me to carry and doesn't hurt my shoulders. I highly recommend this sling to anyone with a small dog. The sling looks exactly as described. It's a little long as I'm very petite, but from reading another review, I simply just made a knot and now it's just perfect. I couldn't be happier. I just used it a few days ago at a Bark in the Park baseball game and had people asking me where I got it.",

In a world of big business that often treats us as numbers or odds (what are the odds they sue, what are the odds enough people complain....), it is refreshing and appreciated that my opinion did matter and they offered to refund.

Once you both learn how it hangs on your body you can relax & really enjoy it. My little guy snuggles in and with his head sticking out, gets to enjoy the sights, sounds, and smells of the outdoors like dogs were meant to do. It is well made and should last many winters.

      "text": "Indispensable for my workouts with Nellie I like to take long walks for my work out. My dog Nellie likes to go with me even though she is small and gets tired. I used to have to switch arms back and forth while huffing and puffing. Now, we can both enjoy the workout, secure that she won't fall or I won't trip. I like that you can attach the leash to the sling. It is comfortable.",
