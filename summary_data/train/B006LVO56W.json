I was initially concerned about how much it would read and how it would interact with the library's catalog system. It works perfectly and the librarian is pleased! I would definitely recommend this scanner. Great price compared to the high-end ones that do almost the same thing.",

Amazon had the perfect product in stock, a pluggable USB 2.0 2 port hub from Plugable Technologies.

I ordered a replacement cord and we're good to go again. It would have been nice to not have to order a new one so soon after purchase, though.",

The product looks nice as well. its easy to plug and play or unplug and put away. I would recommend this product and would buy it again.",
