I had similar ones puma ones before and when the sock started stretching out at the opening, the arch support kept the socks in place anyway. Also i was a bit worried my feet would get hot when running in these because they're a bit thicker but so far my feet feel fine (although weather is becoming cooler so not sure how it would be in summer).",
