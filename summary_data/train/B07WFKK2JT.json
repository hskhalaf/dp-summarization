And not wide enough to get the nail in there. Wide enough for a dipped nail that's been dipped 3 times or less.",

At first I used the slowest setting just to get used to the product, now I can use it at higher speeds and it works great. I do not use it for my own acrylic application but I do believe it would be suitable enough for that use.",
