One thing that the buyer needs to be aware of: debris (adhesive flakes, dirt, etc) tend to find their way into the sensor housing. This is problematic for 2 reasons: 1. Creates fog clouds/specs/imperfections on all of the images you take. That means a lot of Photoshop and Lightroom correction work. No bueno. 2. To \"clean\" the debris out requires that a camera expert dismantle the entire portion of the camera. This is a costly and tricky thing because the sensor/section/housing is glued together...so it has to be pried off. I've had 2 of these and purchased them used. Each of them exhibited the same issue.",

F2 makes this a fast camera. The large sensor make a huge difference on the image quality. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 since it cannot be effectively used about ISO 400 since the image quality degrades noticeably. Also, the camera is a bit on the pricey side. The S90 has since been replaced by the S110 which continues to get excellent reviews. I also like that this camera is slim and compact and fits nicely in my pair of jeans...always handy when I travel/hike, etc.",

I would charge the battery and it would say that it wasn't charged. Also, the power button only worked sporadically. My mother has the same camera (we offered her the same one about a year ago) and she is having some of the same problems. Right now, the camera doesn't power up at all (regardless of the battery being charged). I hesitate recommending this camera to anyone, especially given the price.

Canon is indisputably the leader in the digital-imaging camera field, probably the reason that a former industry-standard in the old film world (Nikon) directly targets their camera models at Canon. As such, this new S90IS is amazingly well-built and sturdy. Along with a couple of other competitive models, the S90IS also sets a standard in low-light imagery and the quality of the 3-inch LCD preview display, yet this camera is small enough to fit into your shirt pocket. --ARHPG",

I had no issues whatsoever! He was helpful, quick to respond to email concerns, and complied with my requests. I haven't used my camera yet, it literally JUST arrived here in my office 10 mins ago. But I know the capabilities of my S90 and I can't WAIT to start using it (after the battery charges :P ) Thanks again!!",

Several times accidentally had the camera set for -1 or +1 stop without realizing it until too late. Now if they would only make the G11 smaller and add HD movies to it.",

I also have not been happy with the Canon XSi and T1i and returned them both. On the plus side, it's very handy and pocketable, but I don't intend to keep it.

    "title": "Canon PowerShot S90 10MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3-Inch LCD (OLD MODEL)",
    "description": "By combining a 10 megapixel CCD sensor and Canon's advanced DIGIC 4 Image Processor, the PowerShot S90 offers dramatic low light sensitivity with minimal noise. Impressive ISO 3200 capability reduces blur and subject movement for crisp photos with spectacular sharpness and clarity. The S90 boasts an incredibly slim profile and lightweight body for true pocket-sized convenience. For the photographer that never wants to miss an opportunity, the S90 the high quality camera that you can carry every day. With an equivalent zoom range of 28-105mm, Canon's 3.8x Optical Zoom Lens captures everything from sweeping landscapes to telephoto action shots with ease. An impressive f/2.0 aperture allows you to create dramatic portraits by emphasizing your subject's face and blurring the background with a soft, shallow depth-of-field.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nCanon\u2019s storied S Series gets a revitalized new leader in the slimmer, lighter, new PowerShot S90, the perfect everyday camera for people who are serious about great photography. Image quality is superb thanks to the new High Sensitivity System and higher ISO speeds, plus an exceptionally bright f/2.0 lens that makes portraits and low-light shots come to life. Photography enthusiasts will love the new control ring at the base of the lens barrel, designed for intuitive, pro-style manual control. \n\n\n\nPowerShot S90 Highlights \n\nNew 10-megapixel sensor coupled with Canon\u2019s DIGIC 4 Image Processor\nThe PowerShot S90 employs a newly developed, 10-megapixel High Sensitivity System by combining a powerful CCD sensor and Canon\u2019s DIGIC 4 Image Processor. Thanks to this technological advancement, the S90 is dramatically more sensitive than cameras with identical megapixel counts, and delivers spectacular images with minimal noise. Increased sensitivity demands a higher ISO speed, and the PowerShot S90 delivers with a new maximum setting of ISO 3,200. Blur and camera shake are notably reduced for the ultimate in sharpness and clarity. \n\nIn addition, a new Low Light mode lets you capture images in an astonishing range of conditions. The camera automatically adjusts the ISO speed from ISO 320 to ISO 12,800 in relation to ambient brightness, subject movement and camera shake. \n\nCompact and pocket-sized camera for everyday use for the advanced amateur\nSerious photography buffs never want to miss a shooting opportunity, and that means keeping a high-quality camera on hand at all times. With a robust feature set that meets an advanced amateur\u2019s exacting standards, the compact PowerShot S90 fits the bill. The S90 boasts an incredibly slim profile and lightweight body for pocket-sized convenience, yet packs in advanced capabilities that make every image memorable. It\u2019s the perfect take-along complement to your camera collection. \n\nBright f/2.0 lens, great for shooting in low light conditions or using a shallow depth-of-field\nThe S90 sports an f/2.0 aperture, perfect for creating enticing portraits, by drawing attention to the face and blurring the background with its impressively shallow depth-of-field. The Macro setting lets you get even closer. The large aperture also does more. It lets you capture more nuances in low light shooting by using more of the available light. You\u2019ll be ready for anything with a lens aperture larger than even many professional sizes. \n\nCustomizable control ring for easy access and operation of manual settings\nFocus, Exposure, ISO, Step Zoom, or White Balance can now be adjusted more precisely than ever with the S90\u2019s new control ring. It\u2019s even more intuitive and quicker than the usual 2-button control and the S90 lets you decide which function the ring will adjust. \n\n3.8x optical zoom in action Wide-angle 3.8x optical zoom (equivalent to 28-105mm) with Canon\u2019s Optical Image Stabilizer\nThe PowerShot S90 features Canon's precision 28mm Wide-Angle Lens that allows you to shoot any scene from wide-angle to telephoto. It lets you capture more in every frame, so everyone fits in a family gathering shot. When it's time to take a closer look, a 3.8x optical zoom (35mm equivalent 28-105mm) greatly minimizes camera shake and maximizes the brilliance of every detail. The camera uses a USM (Ultrasonic Motor) for high-speed, quiet, energy-efficient lens movement with precise control. Focal length is conveniently indicated on the lens barrel. \n\nFull range of shooting and recording modes including RAW + JPEG\nThe PowerShot S90's RAW mode lets you shoot images without JPEG compression. It gives you clearer images and complete creative control in editing. RAW images are transferred directly to the computer where they can then be edited using image adjustment software or a processing application to adjust your images as you please. The camera can also be set to allow the simultaneous recording of both RAW and JPEG images while shooting. \n\nAlso, with 25 Shooting Modes including 17 Special Scene Modes, you're ready for whatever shot comes your way. \n\nLarge, 3.0-inch PureColor System LCD Large 3.0-inch PureColor System LCD\nWith a high resolution stemming 461,000 dots, a high contrast ratio and a wide viewing angle, the PowerShot S90 captures the more subtle variations of color in a scene to make all your images truer to the real thing. The LCD\u2019s multiple coatings prevent visual interference from dust, scratches and reflection. \n\nWhat's in the Box  * PowerShot S90 Body \n * NB-6L Battery Pack \n * Battery Charger CB-2LY\n * Neck Strap WS-DC9 \n * Digital Camera Solution CD-ROM \n * USB Interface Cable IFC-400PCU \n * AV Cable AVC-DC400",
