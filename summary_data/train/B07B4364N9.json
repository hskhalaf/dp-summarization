Pressing a fingernail against it will cause an indentation that doesn't impair using the phone, but if you hold the phone at an angle you'll see all the imperfections in the glare. For the price I guess it's ok? They give you two so I'l probably be using this for the next several months but for my next screen protector i'd rather upgrade to something with glass. If you're low maintenance and don't care that it has weird indentations this case is actually perfect for you. Just to note, these aren't big scratches that cause warping of color or anything.",

Turns out the tempered glass protector i bought did not fit on my phone perfectly; what a waste of money. Good thing I had an extra one from this product. I installed my 2nd protector, again, with ease.I would recommend this product. :)",

The positive is its WAY better than the glass/w liquid under screen savers becasue there is a little flex, so it doesnt peel up, the bad is im sure it is less protective, but its a great middle ground to protect against scrarches, and still have full sensitivity on thr screen (have also tried the plastic/glass covers that just stick at top and bottom, those suck..ha So overall, very happy so far w product!!",

But trying to slip on the plastic sleeve, the thin edge taps the protector and creates bubbles no matter how you try it. I've gotten it completely on, and then the protector bubbles from stress points. Why give me 2 screen protectors when you could've just made it wrap my phone entirely and saved my anger?",

I didn't see this in the description so we'll see if it fits. Otherwise, seems like an ok screen protector and would probably fist S9 better than S9+.

Nothing worked. So, I used a file and box cutter to trim approximately 1/8 inch off the bottom edge of the hard plastic Ottr Box frame. Bingo! Problem solved. Yes!",
