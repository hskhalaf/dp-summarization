I ordered a Medium, bu it was too small for her. I requested an exchange for a size Large in black, instead of the blue. They immediately sent out the exchange. The black slippers were slightly more money, so they only charged me the $4.00 difference, wile awaiting my return.Very easy exchange!! The black does fit a little large, but she has no problem wearing them and now has room for growth.",

Well...these latest Spa Thongs slippers, in black, shed, have strings of both thread and pile that escape along the seams, are squishy feeling rather than conforming and, are just not at all the quality of Acorn of \"old\". I'm really disappointed, as I like for a product to be reliable, and to go back to it, anticipating and receiving the same quality. NOT this Spa Thong slipper anymore, unfortunately!",

If they padded the toe-thong, they'd be comfortable, but they don't and it isn't. In fact, they're uncomfortable to wear and to walk in. Never buying Acorn brand again. Their designer should have noted this flaw. And it could be such a simple fix. Oh well.",

It's a quarter inch closer to center than it is on the left slipper. Just that little bit forces the ball and toes of my foot to be noticeably off center (too far right).

My first pair has not worn out, I just didn't wash them often enough to remove all the ground in soil from my feet; and so they were getting a little bit embarrassing. The materials of the insole and midsole of my first pair has not worn out so the slippers are still as comfortable as the new pair. I also very much like that the soles are a no slip rubber so I can step outside with them on",

The first pair I ordered, I returned because they came ripped. The replacement pair that came looked fine, but after wearing them for 3 days has now ripped. The quality on these slippers has absolutely gone down the drain. Don't buy them, they're not worth the money. I wish I hadn't wasted my money.",

Thinking I just got a bad pair, I ordered a new pair on Amazon - same defect! Didn't even open the package, as I could see they had the same problem. I contacted customercare@acorn.com and was told to send pictures! Sorry. No, I returned the 2nd pair to Amazon and am wearing the original pair for now. Acorn - NOT Amazon - lost a loyal customer.",

I thought it might be temporary, but not the case. Also, I notice there is a hole in one of them already. I do wear them every day, but they usually last me 1-2 years, not 2 months. Bottom line, I would recommend this slipper. Just know that you could get a bad pair.",

I had white, and in the end they looked like crap. Like other reviewers wrote impossible to wash off dark stains. Sizewise buy your true size, I am wearing 9-9.5, bought 8-9 and 9.5-10 to compare. 8-9 size fits just right, 9.5-10 are too big. I have narrow feet but they are quit tight, hope will stretch a little. Next time will try 8-9 wide. In my opinion they are priced a little bit too high, around $20 would be the right price.",

The length is a little long but the width is perfect. I would say they run narrow but true to length. They are sturdy enough to provide some support, unlike many slippers that have a very thin sole. I haven't tried cleaning them, though the tag says they can be machine-washed. Would definitely purchase these again!",
