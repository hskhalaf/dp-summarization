I bought this on deployment because I had a hard time seeing on the flight deck at night and some of the lights were out in berthing so the red light was a selling point for me (because you can't have white light at night on a ship). As a maintenance tech, I work with my hands so the second selling feature was the headband for hands free use. Lights are bright and has good battery life. Stock up on batteries (AAA) because you will be using this ALL the time once you see the usefulness and functionality of this piece of equipment.",

The real killer on this product is that the edge of the lens extends past the body, and because it's made of clear plastic, results in your being partially blinded by the light. Other models inset the lens in a colored plastic body which protects your vision.",

Time will tell if durability is up to par, but I've found that even the more pricey outdoor-store models can have issues holding up. Don't beat it against rocks or drop it in a lake and you should be fine. Bright green colored body and headband will help not forgetting it at the last campsite - leave no trace!",

      "text": "Purchased to walk the dogs in New England at 5AM in the winter. Husband runs his on the highest setting (he's the one who picks up the deposits, while I used the lowest. We both used the tilt feature to ensure the light fell where we wanted it to go. We both wear glasses, and neither one of us noticed any glare. They will get daily, short time usage, but the units are comfortable, adjustable and, since I'm using it in the dark, the fashion statement isn't going to be an issue. We are already thinking of other uses for them. These replaced a prior Energizer unit and we appreciate the design improvements. An excellent value for the price.",
