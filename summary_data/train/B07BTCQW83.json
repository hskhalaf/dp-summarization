A friend found this on Amazon, did some minor research, bought the mower and couldn't be happier. It's a powerful beast for sure and the 4 wheel drive makes the job so much easier. Easy to learn, started the first time. Had a blast mowing.",

The plastic air filter cover also falls off several times per mowing of the yard, and the rubber flap at the rear of the mower deck, (by your feet) that is supposed to deflect flying rocks and other debris into the ground, instead of letting them fly into your foot, or ankle, got ripped off and broken the first time I used the mower, when it caught on uneven ground. I could build better stuff than this.",
