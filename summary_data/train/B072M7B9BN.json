The duty free shop that was there was asking 42 Euro for a similar adapter that didn\u2019t have all the plugs this one does. In short, great purchase for this trip and more to come.",

Which make me happier is that there are two USB portal. It's not only an adapter but also an charger for your mobile devices, you don't even need to bring your charger with you.

The design is simply brilliant! It accepts multiple different inputs and allows you to select the appropriate output for the wall socket of the country you are in. Best of all, it's compact, maybe 1.5-2\" on a side. Pro tip: bring a power strip from home when you travel. Plug this thing into the wall, and your power strip into this. Then, plug your electronics into the power strip from, which it should already match anyway.",

The blue LED light in the USB plug is a nice addition as many of the European plugs are switched. So it is easy to tell that electricity is flowing. Having thought I was charging my phone and wasn\u2019t in the past, this feature was much appreciated. It is also very light and completely devoid of all those different plug adapter parts on other products.",

The slide out option for European plug has a tendency to slide back into the central housing yet when fully extended caused a weight imbalance for attaching plugs to the main unit. Also, the round plugs for the European adapter are a bit small and I found outlets that the plugs would not fit snug enough into for charging (like in CDG airport in Paris). All in all, I prefer the PORS-ELA 2.4A Dual USB International Travel Power Adapter (Blue) I had purchased a prior year.",

Plug a straight US device that does not clearly state it has an internal converter that allows it to handle 220 volts and you are looking for a disaster. You will normally find notice of this type of converter on the bottom of your power device.",

It will light up a dark room, and is completely unnecessary. Would not buy this product again.",

I'd love to exchange for a brand new one if possible, as I love to travel out of the country yearly, and I love its versatility with US, EU, AUS & UK.
