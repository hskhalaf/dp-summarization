Mostly in joshua tree, we\u2019ve had it a while but only used it on 4-5 trips so far, it\u2019s bulky but I don\u2019t mind the size, it molds to the ground nicely. The one big con we are having with it is that the stitching is coming undone and it keep leaking the foam. A real pain in the ass when try to leave no trace. Wife has stitched up 2 separate holes the developed. Not sure what\u2019s up, otherwise it\u2019s seems like a good pad. Added a pic, you can see a new hole forming and an old hole my wife is stitching.",
