      "text": "Very nice boots. First day I wore them was a rainy day and they kept all the water out. They are comfy to walk in as well. The whole reason I got these was because I needed something with a slightly wider calf since the boots I ordered from another seller were too tight on my calves. These are a perfect fit on my slightly larger calves and even give a little wiggle room. Also Im usually a 7.5 in women's US and ordered an 8 instead and its a perfect fit as well. Highly recommend!",

These boots are true to size and are really a wide calf yet they look fantastic. The leather is a good quality and the style is classic yet up to date. These are not grandma boots! So glad to find a brand I can trust with a wide calf size. I got black, I'm probably going to get the brown ones too, b/c as a wide calf girl, once you find a boot that fits and looks great, you buy it in every color you can!",

I recommend wearing thick socks or hose to alleviate the pressure for the first few times of wearing the boots. It also helps to pull the boots as taunt and straight as possible while zipping the insides. This keeps them from scrunching down which helps them not to dig into the ankles. Even with this issue they are still great boots, especially if you can get them on sale.",
