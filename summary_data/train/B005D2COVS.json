All while pulling an arena drag, hay wagon or manure spreader. They are the perfect mix of a paddle tire for mud and sand, and a directional tread for everything else. They self clean quite well and resist mud clogging. They were a bit of a pain for the tire guys, as they did not want to seat on the rim. They could be a wheel related problem though. Almost no comparison the the Maxxis tires Honda installs at the factory.",

Today I received one of the two tires I paid for - the other has not even shipped. Thanks - my project and timeline are now both ruined. Tire quality is average but DO NOT trust this company to have the item in-stock even when they say they do and you cannot depend on their ship dates at all. POOR!",

Softer ride and I've been driving where I shredded a bunch of locust trees with no leaks I guess the 6 ply is way tougher than the original 4 ply.
