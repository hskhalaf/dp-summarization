For a humidifier, this was on the quiet side but main reasons I disliked was that this had both cold and warm humidifier features. After using this product for only 2-3 days, no warm steam at all. This ad is misleading. Also, after using for half the day, the inside fills with water. I first had thought the product I received may have been broken so I ordered a replacement, but nonetheless, the replacement humidifier was leaking inside as well. Also, after leaving it on the warm mist, there was a small burn mark inside when I lifted the tank. Overall, I would give this product zero stars.",

The warm and cool mist options on the unit are fabulous. Compact and stylish which makes it perfect for my end table next to the bed. Unit is extremely quiet and low water indicator light is a nice touch. All and all this item is super feature friendly and I would highly recommend to anyone considering a purchase.",

And when i tell you i am careful, i am careful. This gets wiped down nightly and we only use distilled water. I've never used harsh chemicals and only use the little brush that comes with it or paper towels. I just think if you are going to make a product and sell it for this much, it should last for more than a year or two. The first one broke in less than a year. I'm switching brands.

Thanks to ultrasonic technology, it disperses a fine mist into the air, and is ultra-quiet, making it ideal to have on while you sleep. The humidifier is equipped with the option for warm or cool mist, a night-light and variable mist control. A low water indicator light lets you know when it's time to refill the water tank. PureGuardian humidifiers create a better home environment for those suffering from colds, allergies and dry skin. It is important to only use GENUINE Guardian Technologies replacement parts to maintain product performance.",
