So I suspected that it is not a Series 2. Once I made the selection of product name to just \"KryptoLok\", the key prefix choice changed to letter P. I'm sure that this lock will function for some time, but I have to give 1 star due to false product name here on Amazon.",

I leave my bike locked up on a campus area that is well traveled and thus far the lock has done its job! I will say the mount that comes with it is a little cheap, but it works. Overall I am pretty happy with my purchase and would recommend this lock to anyone who is commuting daily and locking their bike up in an are that is well lit and traversed daily.",
