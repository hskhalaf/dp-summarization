I can tell that it probably isn't going to last very long, but for now its pretty good! The color is the main disappointment for me, it makes it look cheap.

This would have been a great product if it weren't for that. The fabric is super soft and heavy. But the fact that the stitching is just coming out EVERYWHERE makes it a complete WASTE of money. It's literally garbage already and it's only a few months old. DO NOT BUY! So angry..",

The next day when I was making the bed I pulled on the blanket again to adjust it and some more of the stitching started coming undone again. Now I carefully adjust it when I use it but the softness and comfort of it is really nice.",

We have cold winters and my daughter has huge windows in her room so this was intended to give her some added warmth during the winter months.

Haven\u2019t figured out what\u2019s causing this, but it won\u2019t last through a wash/dry cycle, so it\u2019s going in the garbage. It\u2019s too bad. Everything else about it is great.",

I wouldn't mind the price if it was excellent quality but this isn't. There are loose threads everywhere which means the sewn squares will begin to unravel. This is very unfortunate because the comforter itself is soft and the color is very beautiful.",

The top is very soft and was enough to stop the invasion on my son to stop and appreciate it. I recommend it but will update after more use.",

My only issue with this product is that buying more of the pillowcases would require buying the whole set a few more times. If the pieces of this set were sold separately as well, I'd definitely buy these pillowcases every time I needed any.",
