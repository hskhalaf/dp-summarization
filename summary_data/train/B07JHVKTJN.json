Sure, someone can say the three year old pair is broken in but when I only measure the rubber bottom - the new pair is shorter and not as wide. I can't imagine rubber stretched out that much.

The soles are soft rubber so they have good traction right out of the box but probably won\u2019t last a real long time. I\u2019ll update that later. I purchased these for a two week trip I\u2019ll be taking this summer. They seem well made and look good. They are pretty light weight and are comfortable right out of the box. They shouldn\u2019t need much break-in. The price was a factor in purchasing these boots. I think they\u2019ll hold up well to some light hiking and walking around on my vacation. So far I would recommend these.",

There's EXACTLY enough to reach the sole, but no overlap-- so shoe goo or whatever can't repair these. The other downfall is maybe because of the waterproof nature of the boot, but they tend to get uncomfortably warm and damp.
