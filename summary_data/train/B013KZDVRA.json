      "text": "Others have mentioned how sharp and easy to handle this knife is. I'll add my voice. I've gotten knives from Costco and other big box stores, and this one blows them out of the water. It stays sharp and cuts through all sorts of hard to cut through items. We used it first for raw chicken and it likely could have cut through the bone had we used more force. Obviously the sharper the knife the more careful you have to be handling it. Finally, make sure to dry off the knife completely. Like razor-blades, keeping knife edges wet is a way to make it lose the edge more quickly. Though if it does, I'd recommend a cheapto supplement.",

The blade is thinner and slightly bendy compared to my $100 Wustoff, but it's sharp, and the handle is really the best thing - great handle. Can't complain, unless the knife breaks eventually, or if it won't hold a sharp edge. One thing is that the stability of the knife, depending on what you're cutting, isn't as good as other more expensive chefs knives, but you have to look at the price for what you're getting.",

I agree with some reviewers that the edges on the top of the knife feel sharp. I haven't had any injuries result from it but sometimes I do get nervous putting pressure on the top of the knife with my bare hand.",

      "text": "It is sharp. The handle is too short for me; my hand hangs over the end of it sometimes. I also prefer a deeper wedge. If I were a man, I would not buy this knife. It is too small for serious home cooking or fast choppers. The packaging was overkill. I'd spend more on the product and less on the packaging.",
