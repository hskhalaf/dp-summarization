I wanted a pen that I could attach to my phone and carry around; this pen is much thicker, and clearly made for home/desk use. The part that makes me scratch my head is that for a pen, it's very inaccurate. While that applies to most capacitive touch pens, a Wacom tablet is known for pen accuracy. I've owned Graphire 3 & 4 tablets, and still love my widescreen Intuos3. Why then, would Wacom make a pen that has such flex in the tip that drawing is so difficult?",

It comes with some red and blue rim rings to make it more colorful, too, if you actually care about such a small form of customization. Anyway, this is a great travel stylus for the price ($5), but if you want something suave or fancy-looking, spend a few extra dollars for one of Wacom's other styluses.",

I like to sketch very detailed on my tablet and this stylus is great for that, and travels easily due to it's size and the option to hook it in to your headphone jack on the tablet.

The advantage is in the nib, the bamboo nibs glide and flow better than the regular off the shelf brands. The same is true of this unit and I thought I would appreciate the collapsing feature however it does not lock or have enough friction to remain in either position when in use and tends to move or change position causing a minor distraction. I simply prefer the fixed size bamboo stylus. I also thought the attachment clip would be handy but it requires more effort than it should to remove the cap from the pen.",

While it's works relatively well when drawing (the main reason I bough said product) there are times when is it isn't totally responsive. On the flip side this is a product of terrific build and style. It feels great in your hand, the retractable nature of it is supercool, and I like the headphone jack attachment. So if you can get over the poor quality and the price remains reasonable (I bought mine for less than 10) I would recommend the small investment.",

I still bought extras for when that day comes. This works very well on my iPhone and the new iPad. Perfect weight- I like that it is sturdy. Absolutely worth the money as you will never need another stylus. I tried many others and none compare to Bamboo's product(s).",
