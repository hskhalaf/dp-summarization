On the opposite side of the on/off button there is a black plastic circle which is removable, exposing a hole with a brass threaded insert for use as a second option for mounting using the suction cup. This is my reason for 5 stars. Most of the reviews I read complained about the suction cup, however nobody seemed to have noticed this other mounting option. Hope this helps.",

The light, which is what it's about is not very bright. It should be brighter, but hopefully, this means the batteries will last several days of light on. You can install it standing for more clearance but then it needs a reflective tape so its glare will not interfere with navigation. I will not know about durability but it looks well made and well thought out.",

Better to use www.rowkraft.com lights that are USB, recharegeble, much brighter and STAY ON.",
