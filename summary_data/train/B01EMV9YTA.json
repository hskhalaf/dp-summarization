I stuck it in my shower kit which was packed in checked luggage on an outbound and return flight from Tucson to Sacramento and back. On both legs of the trip TSA opened and inspected my checked luggage to determine what the case contained. Apparently the case is a type of metal which triggers their detection system. If you're not going to fly with this kit I'd recommend it but if it might end up on an airplane, I'd try something else.",
