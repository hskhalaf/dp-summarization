If you use it the way it was delivered, the adjustments will slip easily and it will not securely hold the weight of your feet. Take a look at the diagram I attached to this review. It shows the way it was shipped and the proper way to retie the knots. It shouldn't take you more than 5 minutes, and the effects are night and day! :)",

I love that its adjustable so you can change the slack easily. Having something that swings is also great because I can get fidgety sometimes and having long it means I can move forward or backward and still keep my feet on it. I work on an a Cintiq (monitor your can draw on) that's on an adjustable arm so I change my position a lot. Because the hammock is the span of my desk I don't have to adjust it everytime I move. The clamps are very sturdy also.",

So. I had to clip them onto the back of the desk which is ok...but not great because it orients the hammock strangely. The hammock itself is a durable heavy canvas that feels sturdy. The rope appears to be cotton...so I feel like it will fray and stretch over time and I will want to replace it with a more durable nylon rope when the time comes. The accessory hook is optional...which was a relief because I can\u2019t use it at my desk.",

Again, I can't really fault the product because it's a hammock and did what it was supposed to do.
