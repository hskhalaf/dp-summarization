      "text": "We bought this for my 3-year old daughter for a camping trip the weekend of June 24th. The zipper broke on the first night. Since I ordered it over a month (May 18th) in advance to prepare for the trip, I cannot return/replace through Amazon. I have contacted the company to inquire on the warranty and will update my review to 5-stars if they will replace. My daughter does love the bag and it still kept her warm despite the broken zipper, but I am pretty bummed that it broke so easily. It was not stuck on anything and literally just popped off.",

We've only used it at home to play so far. So far I am very impressed with the zippers. They have double sided pulls, so you can zip from the outside or if your arms are inside, you can open that way too. And they have yet to pull in any of the fabric or get stuck! Very good zippers. Seems overall great quality.",

She doesn't have any trouble with the zipper and it does not get caught on the fabric. I thought she might get cold since the inside material is the same as the outside, not flannel but she says its warm and cozy. It's great that it can unzip by the feet as my son likes to sleep in the opposite end. I just ordered him his own since he loves it so much!",

Overall I would highly recommend these sleeping bags above any other. You don't need to spend $40 on child's sleeping bag. This one right here is everything you could ask for and more.",

Also I don't like the chemical warning along with the boys sleeping bag in print where you cannot remove it. I will try to cover it with tape. The bag seems to fill the bill so I will ignore the case it goes into.",

You have to fold the sleeping bag in half, then roll up to use both straps. Also, the zipper has not gotten stuck which is a complaint on other sleeping bags.

I bought this in mind for letting her grow into it - thinking that perhaps buying a small size would be too thin and or too short, like a one-time-use deal. I would give it 5 stars if it rolled back up more compactly.",

Perfect sleeping bag to bring on a camping trip or sleep over. I would guess a 6-12 year old would be more of the age to use this bag. It is too small for an adult but to big for a preschooler.",
