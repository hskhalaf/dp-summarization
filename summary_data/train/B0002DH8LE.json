The stairs do catch most of the excess litter, but not completely.

The cats, due to the small size, always knock litter over the edges into the stair region. The litter then rolls down the stairs and into the floor. Finally, the shape of the box makes it impossible to change the box without making a mess, especially because of the litter which the cats knock into the stair region.",

Only down side is that it is a bit bulky. So be sure to have a rather large space for the litter box to sit.",

      "text": "We bought this so our dog would stop eating cat crap, she can't get into it. She's a medium sized dog about 45 lbs, smaller dogs may be able to get into this. I recommend putting a small weight on top of the lid or attaching a latch of some kind to the lid. We found that the dog could move the lid without the weight on top. After a few attempts to lift it she left it alone. If you're looking for something to keep your dog from having Brown treats this is the catbox for you. I've attached a picture showing the 2.5 lb weight placed on top of the lid.",

I purchased this litterbox since my cat was having difficulty getting in and out of his last one due to the ramp but I wish I had purchased a different product since my apartment now stinks of dung whenever he uses it. I have tried a new filter and have put the lid on securely, nothing stops the odors. I did not have this problem with my previous litterbox and did not change my cats diet since purchasing this so my only conclusion is that it is the box.",
