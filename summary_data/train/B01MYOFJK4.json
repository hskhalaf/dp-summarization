      "title": "Easiest Networking Ever",
      "text": "Excellent. This has to be the easiest networking experience I've ever had. Large-footprint house with modem/router in one corner, wanted better reception elsewhere. Had a Netgear Powerline system and a WiFi router acting as access-point that just stopped working for reasons unknown -- plug in sender, flashed on, then died. Got this thinking I could remove the 2nd router kludged to act as an access point since it has wireless at the receiving end. Yep. Plugged in unit at the router/modem end, plugged in cable. Went downstairs and plugged in the receiver/WiFi. Launched the app, renamed the network, done. Figured it'd take an hour or so to do it all, done in 10 minutes.",

The wi-fi connection on the same house power wiring (even the same outlets) is extremely frustrating. Both Skype connections and attempting to watch YouTube on the same smart TV is unusable, even when 10 feet or less from the wi-fi access point. Not recommended, unfortunately.",

This one in particular is nice because you are able to create a remote WiFi network if the area shares an electrical connection with the main building that houses your router- in my case a studio space in a garage on the back of our lot. This solved many problems that result from MacBooks without Ethernet ports etc( or any ports for that matter). We are also able to stream movies on the tv without a direct connection. Inexpensive and easy to setup with a smartphone.",

I stream television via Roku and had to re-connect my Roku wirelessly to my upstairs router instead of this unit, because the speeds are too slow, causes choppy pictures. Zyxel signal shows as stronger, which is expected since it is closer to the Roku, but the speed is noticeably slower.",

Laptops and smartphones also test at near 100 Mbs in the Living Room or Kitchen, just like near the router.",
