Amazon was awesome and promptly sent me a pair for exchange which then ALSO broke just as fast in the exact same place! The knob that the strap connects to just pulls right out of the fabric, and I didn't even have them very tight, snug at best. I usually like Dewalt, but will not be buying their kneepads again. They are very comfy to kneel in though when the straps arent breaking. Not as comfy to walk in as some others.",

It isn\u2019t the most comfortable because it keeps sliding down which is readjusted by making the elastic velcro strap tighter. Unfortunately this isn\u2019t the best to do because it cuts off circulation to my feet when leaning on my knees. The elastic has also given way and doesn\u2019t stretch as it used to. The two thin velcro strips doesn\u2019t hold on because the worn out elastic straps is stretched out. Was hoping more from Dewalt.",

The gel inserts truly helps to alleviate the abuse that a cement floor will do to your knees.

Would recommend for any technician that spends considerably time on their knees.",

They were great at first but wore down very swiftly. THESE, however, have been holding up! He doesn't rant and rave about these sorts of things but every few months I ask \"How're the kneepads holding up\" and he'll chipperly reply, \"they're great!\" Good enough for me! I've also caught sight of them and they look in perfect shape. Sometimes he even comes home wearing them! I take that as a sign that they must be comfy, too. :)",

On the second day I had to quit using the pads because they no longer cushioned my knees and it was actually painful. Now, I don't know if the pads cushioning was faulty and just a problem with only this pair or a design flaw effecting all pads.",
