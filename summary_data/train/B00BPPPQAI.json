      "text": "Have been looking for a starter weight set for some time and couldn't get past the sticker shock for the weight sets at our local athletic stores. When I saw this deal, I jumped at the price/shipping cost as nearly 25% less than the local equivalent. Overall very good quality and the rubber weights have held up well. I like the contoured grips as they fit my hands well. The stand is basic but very sturdy. It is a little awkward getting weights off the bottom rungs but better than grabbing them from the ground. I would buy again.",

      "text": "I ignored the warnings about the toxic phthalate and the overpowering smell, figuring those folks were whiners. Whoah, was I wrong. Spent half my saturday trying to get this nasty slimy, smelly oil off the weights, while being overpowered by the odor. And the room still stinks like the worst plastic you've ever smelled. Finding out it's toxic phthalate that I was breathing and probably absorbing into my skin has definitely given me a poor association with them weights and frankly makes me want to limit my time with them, which is of course the opposite of the point. But hey...they're cheap.",

The range 10-30 is good for my size, however I will need to pick up 40 and 50 lb dumbbells to do chest workouts. 30 lbs is not enough to do productive chest workouts, but the range is perfect for bi's, tri's, back, and legs. I like the space-saving design and I am sure that I will get many years of use out of this set. Great product.",
