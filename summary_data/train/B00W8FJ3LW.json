      "text": "Fantastic quality! I never expect multi-purpose tools like this to perform well in both functions but this not only has a sturdy build more than capable of breaking glass/serving as a self defense weapon, it also writes fantastically. Originally bought this to keep in my car but now I bring it into the office with me every morning and use as my note jotting pen. Highly recommend, I'll be purchasing another one.",

I give these away when I teach women's defense classes, and I ensure my wide and college aged children have them everywhere they go. I've tried many other tactical pens, but this is the one that ticks all of the boxes!!",
