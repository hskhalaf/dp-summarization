They have a decent taste, no weird aftertaste, and will be very convenient when I'm on the go, but you should know there are other choices with more protein. I will probably stick with RX bars most often - they are less calories (210 vs 240) and have twice the protein (12 vs 6). But the puck will be a nice change from time to time. UPDATE - despite the above I have found that these pucks keep me feeling full for hours, more than RX bars.",
