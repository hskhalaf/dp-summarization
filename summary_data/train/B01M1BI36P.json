      "verdict": "The Fierce Knit, from Puma lifestyle shoe collection, offers the perfect combination of robust materials and lightweight construction. While it works as a lifestyle sneaker, it has the technical aspects for enduring rigorous activities. It is a good value for the money considering its features. The only drawback, though, is its rubber material that can feel hot especially during the summer.",
      "pros": [
        "The Puma Fierce Knit has an internal flatlock stitching which lessens friction",
        "It is a reasonably-priced shoe",
        "The shoe promotes a movement of 360 degrees through its pivot points applied to the outsole toe and heel",
        "It has a rubber outsole for traction",
        "The tongue and heel sections have a pull tab for easy on and off",
        "The heel is exaggeratedly thick to provide more stability",
        "Most people who own a pair of these shoes say that it is comfortable",
        "The majority of online shoppers observe that the Puma Fierce Knit is true to size"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "A reviewer complains that the rubber material is very hot and recommends it as winter wear",
