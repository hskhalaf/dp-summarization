Some of the hardware did not align properly (I think this may be due to the angled design; but that is also what makes this piece unique). The table looks great after assembly but is a little unstable and may tip if you place anything with substantial weight. Hardware and instructions for wall anchoring were included, but that is beyond my expertise. I am not a do it your-selfer and it took me a while to put it together. All things considered it seems a little overpriced. Overall, I do like the design and I am happy with it.",

The only draw back I had on assembly were the legs for the base . for the life of me I could not get that peg for the long secure screw to align to secure it better. So I just left it alone fore now. I suggest using that Gorilla glue on some attach parts, may take a while to dry but once it sets it does hold. Other than that I really do admire it's design. Just what I needed.

It took several times to read and then reread to make sure we were doing the right thing. One of the legs still isn't held together properly, the screw would never tighten, hopefully the weight will hold. Once complete it is nice looking, however you can only have it against a wall, the back side is unfinished. It is reasonably priced, however, I can't say I would recommend purchase, I think the price charged for the final product is still on the high side, it is really better priced around the $55.00 or under mark.",

So I really had to use the glue, to glue back the plywood piece that had come off. 1 star for assembling. 5 stars for the final look. The picture adequately describes the esthetical finish.

Just remember, at only $64, the back isn't finished, and it isn't real wood, but since the color is super dark brown [almost black], you don't notice the quality as much.",
