It goes a good speed without being too fast not to control. Simple steering forward, reverse, left, right. Headlights only come on in forward motion. Only reason we removed 1 star is because it does not go on carpet. We have very short carpet and it barely goes on it at all. Would definitely buy again.",

It kind of ruins the whole experience cause my little brother loves to run it into walls (cause he's 3) and it dislodges the batteries immediately. Even when I reinforced it with tape. I did however use some plastic and cut it down to size to fit the square covering, but it still doesn't keep the batteries in place. Probably wasn't their fault since there was no indication that it was opened. Maybe could've been left out of production cause the car had everything else and was strapped down properly. I'll probably buy another one just to replace it.",

It's not strong enough to even move on any sort of carpet at all, the wheels won't even spin. This severely limits where it can be played with inside, which is unfortunate for something that's designed for small children. Either a motor with a tiny bit more power, or larger wheels would have solved this issue. Also - where's Patrick? He was riding shotgun in the movie.",

Actually it won't work at all. Occasionally the signal does fade away and the patty ride does seem like it's losing battery but it's just doesn't have a strong signal to the remote.",
