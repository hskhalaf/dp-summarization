In their directions they did not mention you might need to add washer to sink attachment to stop leak in swivel. Also Apex needs to give percentages of how much heavy metal is removed.

I have been buying bottled water for years and finally decided to get a filter for my home so that I could just refill bottles and not have to carry heavy packs of bottles and fill the local dump with empty bottles. I researched may different options and decided this was the best for me. It was incredibly easy to hook up, just removed the aeriator on the faucet and attach the filter. The water is delicious and I'm drinking more water than ever, which will make my doctor very happy. Win-win!",

I use this mainly for making coffee, drinking water (I keep a pitcher of filtered water in the fridge), and oversized ice cubes for cocktails. The tap water in my town is way over chlorinated and this filter makes a huge difference in the taste and odor. It doesn't take up much room on the sink. Installation was easy. I used 2 small zip ties to se ure the tubing to the back of the faucet for a neater look.",

Looks pretty gawdy on the sink with the tubing but its ok because the water tastes amazing. Clear and soft feeling. Love it.",

It attaches to sink very easily and the water is delicious. Much much better than Poland Spring, Dasani, Nestle. Its still a notch below Fiji water which I think is the best but still very good for a filter system.",

Do you wonder if your drinking water is actually safe or if it\u2019s making you sick? Most of us think our water is clean when it comes out of the faucet. There might actually be a lot of impurities that you can\u2019t see, smell, or even taste. APEX\u2019s Clear Countertop Alkaline Water Filter System is the solution you need to ensure that the water you drink is free of the many contaminants that seep into groundwater supplies. Water from kitchen faucets may be fine for washing dishes \u2013 but drinking it is entirely different. If you are looking for a kitchen water filter system, consider APEX water filters. This APEX water filtering system comes as a complete water purification kit that is simple to install and use. It attaches easily to most standard kitchen faucets with easy do-it-yourself installation. Simply remove the aerator screen (bubbler screen) from the faucet and screw on the collar of the APEX diverter valve. APEX Clear Countertop Alkaline Drinking Water Filter System for home faucets removes impurities and chemicals. Tiny particles and contaminants are removed through carbon block filters that remove mercury, pesticides, chlorine, radon, and more from your family\u2019s drinking water.
