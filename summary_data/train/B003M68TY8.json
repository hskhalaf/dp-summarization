But sharp lines and precise depth were achieved, thanks to all the rehearsing in mind and tools that could deliver. I don\u2019t even have the lovely wooden mallet seen in some of the ads. Took my rubber mallet to the task. These chisels allowed me to chip at the angles desired and I earned myself a clean result. I\u2019d recommend practice on same type of scrap wood to learn the way of the chisels. Once you know their tendency it\u2019s a lot easier to get to where you want together.",

I haven't even sharpened them yet, but so far wood carving of all sorts has been wonderful! If I was a serious professional I'd give a more in-depth review but as the first set of seriously well-built chisels I've ever owned, I am very happy with these! A good mix of 3 sizes, though I will be investing in a larger set one day. Make sure to get a good mallet! Though these have open steel bottoms, they can obviously take a serious beating.",

I have used super expensive chisels that come from the factory with a bur on it so you can put your own edge on it. But honestly. I can talk nice shavings with these and need no mallet. A word to the wise. Do not let a contractor touch your Marples. They are like I was as a kid when my mom had to explain that a butter knife was not a screw driver, I respect good tools and these are good tools.",
