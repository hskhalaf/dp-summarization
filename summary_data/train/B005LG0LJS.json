      "text": "I was very surprised that this was only 6$ and pretty big. I was expecting some foamy little boys ball since the description said \"juniors\". I didn't get this for literal sport. My friend wanted to surprise her boyfriend with a blue ball since they are long distance but because her parents don't know she's dating anyway she left it up to me to write on it and send it for her. Their secret word is \"blue moon\" (hence the blue ball) and her boyfriend plays football. So this was the perfect gesture of love for my friend's boyfriends surprise birthday present! The ball says... \"If you are reading this, I threw pretty far. blue football, blue moon?\"",

This seems to me like a nice compromise/step-up from a foam football that's not quite getting to a full-size leather ball.",
