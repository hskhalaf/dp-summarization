This means that this product does not use 100% food grade silicone, but instead uses plastic fillers as well as silicone. I don't want to take the chance of chemicals leeching into my baby's food, so this will be returned.",

They claim to be all silicone but as you can see by the pictures they are not. Why are so many companies lying about what their products are made of? It's so hard to find something that is 100% silicone to put his food in. Such a let down.",

      "text": "These are great! They're expensive, but I tried going cheaper with one of the ones that look like a plastic ice tray and it was much harder to get the frozen cubes out; plus those were only 1 ounce, which quickly gets too small, and it's great how with these, you can fill them up to make 1.5 ounces or use the 1 ounce line if your baby isn't eating quite as much. It's very easy to pop out the frozen cubes, and they stack well in the freezer and don't leak. I purchased a second for the days when I go puree crazy!",

These are actually better than the actual baby bullet freezer trays. It has a measuring line on the inside so you don't fill them too full, the frozen baby food pops out soooo much easier than the baby bullet one does, the lid pops on quickly, and clean up is a breeze. The only thing is I wish the compartments were deeper and held more. But other than that, I love it!",
