The XL is roomy but not too big for him at 6\"1' and 215 lbs. Just wish it was made in USA instead of China - I would pay more for that. I couldn't find any robes like this made in USA. I also wish Amazon would let me filter by country of origin.",

He is 5'11\" and 74 years old with a tummy that comes with getting older and it fits just fine. I'm glad I choose it as a gift.",

He's been wearing it almost every day to and from the shower as well as at night when he plays video games. Something to check for though -- ours came with a hole in the pocket! I'm gonna hand sew it to avoid the hassle of returning but it really needs better quality control! Deducted a star for the hole but otherwise nice robe.",
