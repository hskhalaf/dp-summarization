With light clamp force the non-marring head held my not-round tube bike with ease and also a regular round-tube mountain bike in any orientation that seemed helpful. Heavy-duty metal legs helps provide counterweight for the sturdy feel. Folds compact for travel if needed on the road. The height has good range as well so it will work for tall people too. All n all very happy with it.",

Completely surprised by the materials used and overall design of the stand. The main tubes and support legs are all steel construction. Supports his road bike and our mountain bikes easily. Won't be able to support e-bike which is not surprising given their weight. He put it together in about 2 mins so definitely easy to construct and use. Definitely looks sturdy and should last for a long time with normal use. Cannot believe a product of this quality is sold at this price point.",

However, because you have to hold the frame it makes it difficult with most bikes as there are wires running where you would have to use this to clamp to. If you have a section of the frame without exposed wires, you can't beat the price on this. It's definitely not as good as my main repair stand but great to have as a spare so you can easily wash 2 bicycles next to each other.",

I guess they just need to be glued or taped in place. Like I said, just something very minor. Everything else is great. Very sturdy and durable, and to me, very worth the price.
