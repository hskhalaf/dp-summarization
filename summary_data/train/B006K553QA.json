When I don\u2019t want to carry anything bigger than a phone but want a capable camera, I reach for this one. The menus can be a little confusing, and this is not the most robust small camera, but if you take time to learn it and take care of it, you will get images far better than what a phone can produce.",

After reading reviews of the DSC-WX150 and several other brands recommended by my cousin, a professional photographer I picked this camera. I photograph dogs in my grooming salon with some additional pictures of cats and a rabbit at home, which I post on Facebook and my website. Not only are the pictures clear but there is almost no lag time when I click, which was the case with the W530. This baby also takes great shots in low-light circumstances. Great value for money!",

It is small. It has a great zoom. And, it is easy to use. The first charge lasted about month with moderate use. Update: The optical zoom on this camera does indeed work during movie recording.",

This took great photos at first but after 6 months the battery door latch wouldn't hold so I had to use tape to keep it closed. It also did not operate well in humid conditions; when you turned it on the lens would stick and it wouldn't turn on correctly. After a year the picture quality deteriorated due to it wasn't focusing properly so I got another camera. It's an okay camera if you baby it, but if you plan on using it in action settings it may not last as long as you want.",

In addition, this camera seems to have a problem with the on/off switch. Sometimes the camera starts quickly, sometimes slowly and sometimes not at all. I sent it back to Sony in Texas and they supposedly fixed it but it still has the same problem. Pictures are generally okay. Next camera will be another Canon.",

Major drawback is maximum aperture of only 3.3, but for its size factor (tiny!) and having a ten X zoom, that's to be expected. Lens is top of the line Sony G and extremely sharp.

The screen is bright and clear and makes setting up your pictures and framing everything properly extremely easy.

I am very pleased with the image quality given the small sensor and the high pixel count. I was confused when the PMB software could not detect my videos on the SD card, but once I installed the newer software, PlayMemories Home, everything worked just fine. One suggestion for improvement. PlayMemories Home can only detect videos when the camera is connected to the computer, not when the SD card is inserted into a card reader. It would be nice if the latter was possible.",

We did a lot of comparison shopping before deciding on the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-WX150 and based on her reaction and the quality of the pictures she has taken so far, we definitely made the right choice. She also loves the size - it is small enough to put in her purse or pocket.",

However, I'm still learning how to use this camera (it's very different from my old camera), so it could be user error.",

Picture taking is already much easier than with our old camera (that thankfully, accidentally was thrown out with the Christmas trash). No more big delays to take photos, no more missing the shot (and with 4 young kids there are a lot of shots), no more futzing with the flash, no more changing out the batteries every 30 minutes. Just pure family photo and video taking bliss! I will admit that taking photos is loud, but so are my kids so who really cares? Survey says: A+. Thanks Sony!",

    "title": "Sony Cyber-shot DSC-WX150 18.2 MP Exmor R CMOS Digital Camera with 10x Optical Zoom and 3.0-inch LCD (Black) (2012 Model)",
    "description": "Color:BlackFocus faster day or night with this slim Sony Cyber-shot DSC-WX150 digital camera. High speed AF dramatically improves speed and accuracy, while 10X optical and 20X Clear Image zoom gets you close enough to capture every ounce of the action. Boasting an 18.2-megapixel Exmor R CMOS sensor, exceptional low-light performance is yours while shooting high-resolution photos or Full HD 1080/60i videos (records in 29-minute segments). And with the ability to shoot up to 10 frames per second (fps), you'll be sure to capture the fleeting moments that other cameras miss.What's in the box: Sony Cyber-shot DSC-WX150 Digital Camera (Black), NP-BN Battery, ACUB10 AC Adapter, Micro USB Cable, Wrist Strap, Instruction Manual and 1-Year Limited Warranty.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n A+ \n\n\n\n\n\nFocus faster, day or night, with the slim Sony\u00ae DSC-WX150. Its sensitive 18.2MP\nsensor and wide-angle, ultra-stabilized 10X Optical/20X Clear Image zoom\ncapture stunning images as well as AVCHD\u2122 1080/60i videos. 18.2MP Exmor\u00ae R CMOS sensor High Speed Auto Focus Optical zoom plus Clear image zoom The 18.2MP Exmor\u00ae R CMOS sensor enables advanced processing that reduces noise levels more than other sensors, resulting in stunning low light images with incredible details. To improve focusing speed and sensitivity, the Exmor\u00ae R sensor uses its rapid throughput to deliver high-quality image signals to the camera\u2019s BIONZ\u00ae processor. The result is fast, DSLR-like focusing speeds, even in low light. Clear image digital zoom maintains a high-resolution feel that is as precise as optical zoom and vastly expands the zoom range without lowering visible quality or pixel count in the final image. \nTechnology Pixel Power With an 18.2MP Exmor R CMOS sensor, capture high-resolution images that take full advantage of the camera's sharp Sony G lens. More pixels means you can enlarge, zoom in and crop your photos without losing detail. Advanced processing reduces noise and graininess for incredibly crisp, clear images\u2014even in low-light conditions. Focus Faster Focusing is faster than ever thanks to the collaboration of four technologies: an advanced Sony G lens, Exmor R CMOS sensor, a newly-developed BIONZ\u00ae image processor and optimized focus processing. The result? Tack-sharp focus in as little as 0.1 seconds, so you never miss a shot. 20x Clear Image Zoom Zoom in close for great sports, wildlife and travel photos. The WX150 combines 10x optical zoom with Clear Image digital zoom technology to offer 20x total zoom. Powerful By Pixel Super Resolution processing technology reduces graininess for crisper, more realistic, higher-quality images\u2014even in close-ups. Amazing HD Movies Record crystal-clear movies at the highest resolution available with Full HD 1080/60i AVCHD\u2122 video capture.1 Stunning, fast-motion video with reduced distortion looks great when played on your HDTV.2 Notice a perfect photo opp while shooting video? With dual record of stills and movies, you can shoot both at the same time. Never Miss a Moment Capture up to 10 frames per second at full 18.2MP resolution. The perfect feature for high-speed sports or capturing a unique sequence of photos, no matter how fast the action, you know you'll get the shot. Plus, a mechanical shutter helps reduce distortion when continuously shooting moving subjects for even crisper, clearer high-speed shots. Say Goodbye to Blur Don't let a not-so-steady hand prevent you from capturing the moment. Optical SteadyShot\u2122 image stabilization with Active Mode compensates for camera shake by countering camera movements in both horizontal and vertical directions. Get sharp, blur-free footage in otherwise unsteady situations, like shooting video while walking. \nProduct description and full feature list Explore the full range of features and options below. \n18.2MP Exmor\u00ae R CMOS sensor\nThe 18.2MP Exmor\u00ae R CMOS sensor captures ultra-high definition images that take full advantage of the camera's sharp Sony\u00ae G lens.The sensor enables advanced processing that reduces noise levels more than other sensors, resulting in stunning low light images with incredible details. \n\nHigh speed AF\nTo improve focusing speed and sensitivity, the Exmor\u00ae R CMOS sensor uses its rapid 240fps throughput to deliver high-quality image signals to the camera's BIONZ\u00ae processor. The result is fast, DSLR-like focusing speeds, even in low light. \n\nOptical zoom plus Clear image zoom\nClear image digital zoom maintains a high-resolution feel that is as precise as optical zoom and vastly expands the zoom range without lowering visible quality or pixel count in the final image. With By Pixel Super Resolution processing, the camera's 10x optical zoom range is extended, allowing full resolution 18.2MP images with a maximum 20x zoom. \n\nFull HD 1080/60i\nRecord crystal clear movies at the highest resolution available with capabilities for 60i in 1080 AVCHD\u2122 video.1 This provides stunning, fast motion video with less distortion for playback on your HD TV.2 With dual record of stills and movies, you can shoot both at the same time.\n\nCapture the decisive\nmoment - up to 10fps\nCapture full 18.2 megapixel resolution images at up to 10 frames per second, helping to ensure that the decisive moment is captured such as the soccer ball flying into the goal. In addition, a mechanical shutter helps reduce distortion when continuously shooting moving subjects. \n\nOptical SteadyShot\u2122\nwith Active Mode\nOptical SteadyShot\u2122 with Active Mode for\nblur-free movies even while walking. Camera-shake compensation using Optical SteadyShot/Active Mode has been improved with the addition of new electronic image stabilization. Now it's easier than ever to obtain sharp, blur-free movies even when zooming in unsteady situations, such as shooting with one hand\nwhile walking. \n\n\n3D still image and\n3D Sweep Panorama\u2122 mode3\nProduce awe-inspiring images with 3D still image and 3D Sweep Panorama\u2122 capabilities.3 Photos will take on a new dimension of creative capabilities for viewing the world in a whole new way. \n\nPicture Effect\nPicture Effect adds a new level of expression to photos, making ordinary landscapes and portraits come to life by heightening mood and emphasizing certain attributes. Select camera models have up to nine different effects. \n\nIntelligent Sweep\nPanorama\u2122 HR mode\nWith Intelligent Sweep Panorama\u2122 HR mode just press the shutter, pan the landscape and\nlet the camera do the rest. It automatically links together each frame to produce a high resolution panoramic image providing the ability to zoom in on small details. This model even detects faces and moving subjects to stitch intelligently different widths to help avoid subject distortion.\n\nBackground Defocus\nDSLR photographs are often beautiful because they blur the background, putting the emphasis on the subject. Now our point-and-shoot cameras can deliver this signature DSLR benefit. The system takes two shots, identifies the background and applies a defocused background keeping the subject crisp and clear. \n\nSuperior Auto mode\nGet cleaner, more dynamic pictures and fewer missed shots. The camera automatically recognizes the correct scene mode, then quickly shoots and combines up to six shots to produce images with greater clarity, optimum dynamic range using Backlight Correction HDR technology and lower image noise using 6 shots layering technology. Superior Auto intelligently detects 33 scenes for still images and movies, making it easy to get the best shot.\n\nPhoto Creativity \nPhoto Creativity Photo Creativity allows you to fine-tune your exposure settings, such as brightness, color, and vividness, and quickly choose the right enhancement for your subject. Now you can view Picture Effects and Photo Creativity effects in real time on the camera\u2019s monitor or in the viewfinder before shooting. \n\nFace Detection technology\nFace Detection technology detects up to eight individual faces and adjusts focus, exposure, and white balance to help deliver crisp, properly lit images of family and friends.\n\n\n\nSmile Shutter\u2122 technology\nSmile Shutter\u2122 technology captures a smile the moment it happens. Simply press the Smile Shutter\u2122 button and the camera does the rest. You can also select adult and child priority and indicate the degree of Smile Detection sensitivity. Intelligent Scene Recognition can be used together with Smile Shutter\u2122 mode when the Intelligent Auto mode is on. This means that beautiful smiles can be captured with settings optimized for the particular scene, even in difficult conditions such as twilight and backlighting.\n\nNatural Flash\nConventional point-and-shoot camera flash shots just don't capture colors the way the eye sees them. Natural Flash controls the white balance of both the background and main subjects. \n\nMotion Detection\nMotion Detection, along with Face Motion Detection adjusts ISO sensitivity and increases the shutter speed when movement is detected, reducing blur in moving subjects and faces.\n\nAnti-blink Function\nIt's frustrating to capture the perfect shot, only to review it later and discover subjects blinked during the photo. The Anti-blink function works to help counter blinking and squinting. When the camera is set to Soft Snap, the Anti-blink function captures two images, recording only the photo with less squinting. If a blink is detected in other shooting modes, a warning will be displayed after you take the shot. \n\nSoft Skin mode\nPortrait subjects will love the results. Soft Skin mode recognizes skin tones and reduces the appearance of blemishes and wrinkles without affecting the rest of the shot. \n\nIntelligent Scene Recognition mode\nIntelligent Scene Recognition (iSCN) Mode automatically detects 33 different types of scenes and selects the appropriate camera settings. iSCN has two modes: Auto and Advanced. In Auto Mode, the camera takes a single shot using the optimal settings.
