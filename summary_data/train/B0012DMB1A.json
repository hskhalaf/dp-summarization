In a nutshell, these are useless as delivered in my opinion and they are too cheap to hassle with a return. Don't buy these things.",

Additional, the unit feels cheap, much lighter than other rocker switches I have. Finally, if you are mixing switches that are white, it is close, but not quite the same white or as glossy as other switches. Bottom line: Just don't buy it; there are much better choices.",
