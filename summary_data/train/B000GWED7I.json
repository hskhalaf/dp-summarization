The casters are very good commercial quality and the top is very thick stainless steel and can hold lots of weight without bending or bowing. The packaging is very sturdy and the product arrives intact with almost all recyclable contents-no styro and very little plastic bags. I highly recommend this product and will use Seville for all stainless I need.",

You can pick a pipe cutter at Home Depot in the plumbing section. I was still able it use the baste even at 1/2 the height. Would definitely but this product again if I found another use for it.",
