It's my first digital camera and I bought it to photograph special moments of my life and, although I am not an expert photographer, I have to say that this is an excellent camera. Very easy to use for beginners, takes very good pictures, the battery is durable, among other attributes. Now I have 6 months of use and I have no complaints. I would like the zoom can be used in video mode too, is everything. Panasonic Lumix digital camera is my first and this brand will be my first choice to replace my small camera in the future.

It took great pictures. The zoom was a little lack luster. It wasn't the best, it wasn't the worst, it wasn't the most expensive, and it wasn't the least expensive, but it had amazing value for the money. I loved the camera so much that I bought another Lumix after I lost this camera.",

I love the battery charger, it and the camera can fit together in my old camera case, just another bonus.

He was absolutely right. It is simple to use, it has an easy-to-use zoom, and takes very nice clear pictures. It's light and fits easily in my pocket. I'm sure that people who want to play a bigger role in their photography would find it inadequate but someone wanting a fine inexpensive basically point-and-shoot camera can't go wrong with this one. Buy a soft case to go with it.",

It does what I need; my only regret is that it takes its time to take the picture. I think Sony has faster shooting comparing with a friend camera last weekend trip. In spite of it, battery lifetime and performance is very good. The new night scenery takes a lot less time (1s shoot). It has more resolution/size options than before. A new power saving mode. Cool enough for a non-professional use.",

This fantastic little camera has a Leica lens, 12.1 megapixels, 5x optical zoom, image stabilization and I carried it everywhere I went. After a long search, I found a refurbished (by Panasonic) one on Amazon. I received it promptly with all of the accessories and it works beautifully. Why do companies stop making wonderful things? I guess because Amazon can find them anyway.",

The customer service here is about as bad as it can get. I deserve a call back which I will probably NEVER RECEIVE. I had hoped for a long experience with these people of buying merchandise. I'll look elsewhere. FOUR of the same type cameras? REALLY! Mad and Disappointed in Bowie, MD",

    "title": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-FS15 12MP Digital Camera with 5x MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7 inch LCD (Blue)",
    "description": "Color:BlueFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nThe 12.1-megapixel Lumix DMC-FS15 features a 29mm wide-angle Leica DC Vario-Elmar lens with a 5x optical zoom. Panasonic has enhanced the Intelligent Auto Mode (iA) on the DMC-FS15 from the previous FS models to now include AF tracking and Intelligent Exposure functions in addition to Mega O.I.S., Intelligent ISO Control, Intelligent Scene Selector and Face Detection. AF Tracking enables the user to \"lock\" the focus onto a moving subject. The camera then automatically tracks the subject as it moves, keeping it in focus without the need to hold the shutter button halfway down. Additionally, Intelligent Exposure helps capture natural-looking images by suppressing blocked shadows and blown highlights. It continually monitors the light source in the shooting environment and automatically activates the backlight compensation function if it detects the light source is behind the subject. \n\nOther features of the FS15 include a Venus Engine IV processor, which enables an advanced processing system and quick response times. An intelligent LCD screen detects light conditions and automatically adjusts the brightness levels for viewing in sunlight and helps to preserve battery life. The new Photo Frame mode lets the user put attractive borders around photos, so when printed, they look like postcards in picture frames. Also, the new My Scene setting lets the user assign their most frequently used Scene modes to the setting, and with a simple switch, access that scene instantly. The FS-Series is also capable of recording WVGA (848 x 480) motion pictures at 30 frames per second in 16:9 wide-screen format, as well as standard VGA (640 x 480) format.",
