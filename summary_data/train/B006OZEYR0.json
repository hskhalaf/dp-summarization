It's powdery, patchy, the lighter colors have little color payoff, the darkest color is impossible to blend, and even with primer, the shadow creased and disappeared by mid-day. I threw this away after the first wearing. It is absolute junk.",

Can you see it in my picture?! If Relvon didn't advertise this as 16 hr colorstay, i would rate this 4 stars. Since it states that the color stays16hr but didn't meet that expectation, i rate it 3 star. Little disappointed but I shouldn't expect high quality at $5.97.",
