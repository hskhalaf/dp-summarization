I am slowly replacing all the bulbs in my house with bright white daylight bulbs.They burn bright and cool to the touch. I absolutely love the look it gives the house. I was wanting to paint all the walls because they were looking a little yellow, but I realized that was just the tint of my lights. It's amazing what a different it makes. Great product. Hoping this will save a little money on the power bill as well! I would recommend.",

It is REALLY bright and white, like I\u2019m standing in direct sunlight. I am going to order soft white and maybe do half and half in my fixture.

I don't have a non-dimmable circuit that accepts this type of bulb to test this theory, nor am I interested in removing the dimmer switch. I contacted the manufacturer but never received a response after about 3 months. Another issue with these is when trying to remove them, the bulb itself came unscrewed instead of it unscrewing from the socket. I'm giving it two stars because I did like how bright they were and there is a good chance that my dimmer circuit is to blame for the flickering.",
