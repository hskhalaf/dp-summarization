I installed a sim and it was up and running in minutes. It doesnt transfer the data easily and several things i had to manually input back in but i think thats pretty standard in all electronic stuff today. Im a budget minded person that doesnt want to spend big bucks on phones any more that your gonna replace in two years or less anyway.",

      "text": "The exterior of the phone was in good shape, minus a small scratch, but this phone is MUCH slower than my other phone, which was the same make and model. It also freezes from time to time, requiring that the battery be taken out and put back in to restart it. I wish I had spent my money somewhere else.",

Functions as it should, looks nice, and definitely an upgrade from my LG Volt. For this price, I'm honestly amazed. I recommend it if you're looking for a bigger, newer phone with a nice camera. The stylus is a plus!",

    "title": "LG G Stylo 4G LTE Mobile Stylus Smartphone GSM Unlocked",
    "description": "The Good The LG G Stylo has a competitively low prepaid price, a long-lasting battery and a built-in stylus for added functionality. The Bad The handset picked up a subtle amount of static during calls, 4G LTE data speeds were slow in our area and its stylus doesn't have as many productivity tools as the Samsung Galaxy Note 4's S-Pen. The Bottom Line Though the LG G Stylo's stylus is more of an afterthought, it's still a highly affordable big-screen handset.",
