You can feel the rough edges where stitched together on the inside. Externally 2 of the fingers were stitched loosely and threads were coming loose and hanging off. Will try washing them/breaking them in to see if they get softer as gloves typically do. May try turning them inside out to cut off some of the excess material that is making them uncomfortable.

Also the fingers themselves are a little loose too. All in all you get what you pay for its 20 bucks and hey it's better than nothing. And again I think they look cool.",

The only thing bad about them (which really isnt that bad) is that they have a TON of ventilation which means night riding where I live means my fingers freeze. But they will be great for summer driving. Look no further, get these gloves. They are awesome!",
