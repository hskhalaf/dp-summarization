The lightweight build and the versatile outsole construction are highlighted as the elements that elevated this product to the realm of agreeable user-friendliness. Also, the slip-on structure apparently worked with the nonrestrictive lacing system to properly keep the foot in place.Fans of neutral running shoes that are for the unpredictable terrains are the target market of the Saucony Mad River TR.",
      "pros": [
        "Some people claim that for a trail running shoe, the Saucony Mad River TR is light enough for all-day wear",
        "The platform is deemed sufficiently flexible by a few testers who like the natural movement of the foot to be encouraged",
        "Several consumers have stated that the trail-ready outsole of this Saucony running shoe isn\u2019t too aggressive to remove efficacy on flat surfaces",
        "A couple of runners wrote that the underfoot cushioning system is able to provide comfort throughout the running session",
        "The one-piece opening of the Mad River TR is lauded by those who welcome a quick in-and-out experience when wearing a shoe",
        "The choice of wide and close-fitting lacing methods on the roof of the upper is praised by those who like some customization for the fit-adjustment"

Looking forward to my 1/2 marathon trail run in November. Love the options for lacing, as well as the option to add traction via screws into the bottom - which I will try when the ice comes to Michigan. This is my first pair of trail shoes, but if this is what I can expect from Saucony's trail shoes - I will be buying many more!",

I saw these being marketed as wide toe box for proper toe splay and was really impressed that they have a near foot shape almost like a Topo shoe but not ridiculously wide like an Altra. This is helpful not just for toe comfort but for stability on trails where you may roll an ankle. I personally bought these for work use in a hospital. I am also an avid runner and will likely get another pair for trail/road running as these will be great for any surface. Saucony, please stop making pointy elf shoes and make more road versions ie Ride ISO like this shoe!",

Adequate trail performance (up/downhill, rocky, roots, spots of mud). I considered going with the 9.5 since my toe was so close to the end of the shoe; however, I discovered that the price of the shoe had gone up $30 in two days so scrapped that plan. Would pay $79 for this utilitarian footwear, but $109 is edging toward a price for a better shoe.",

The shoe laces are pretty long and I am going to try the second lace option. The graphic is awesome and I am going to wear these with a white+grey camo shirt from Amazon Basic.",

Unfortunately, they are notably long, and the wide toe box is actually a bit too roomy. That left too much material at the front of the shoe, especially on the outer side of the foot and my foot would slide a bit inside the shoe.",
