The day I hooked it up it was putting out 7000+ volts my gauge went no higher. I put it outdoors in a plastic storage container and I can see the indicator light from my kitchen. It\u2019s in an urban area so I have it on a dusk to dawn timer. Never installed one before but if you have basic DIY knowledge and can drive several 8\u2019 ground rods you can also control your pests.",

This quickly corrected their behavior without causing them serious harm. I agonized for a couple of years over doing something like this because I love my dogs, but the risk of them escaping my fence and getting run over or having a problem with another dog was terrifying. After only a few days of electrifying the fence, they stayed clear of it and quickly lost interest in any people or animals who were beyond my fence. It\u2019s the best thing I ever did and I wish I had done it much sooner.",
