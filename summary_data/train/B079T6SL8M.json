      "text": "Excellent ! Not my first e bike kit. Original was front wheel drive. Makes front end very heavy and can be sloppy in the corners. Install went very well. Just take your time and think it through ! Very smooth and strong. Just give it a kick with the pedals if you wish. I can cruise at 20 + for better than 15 miles !! That\u2019s moving on a bicycle !!!! 2.2 tires help and softens up the ride at speed. It\u2019s my daily commuter and it works very well. I only use the twist grip. Very controllable and the lit indicator is helpful to monitor the battery charge.",

      "text": "I've put over 1,000mi on this kit now. I taped a little piece of clear plastic over the handlebar display and duct taped the controller to the frame and wrapped it in tape to keep it dry. I do bike deliveries in All weather and it's performed without a single problem. There are certainly better kits out there, but they cost more. For the money, this one is great. I would recommend getting a geared rear hub motor. Direct drive hubs, as in this kit, make pedaling difficult when not using the throttle. Now that I know, my next motor will certainly be geared.",

I will see. I can work around the free wheel (got extras hanging around) just need to set my mind on which style of bike I will be doing.",

      "text": "I bought this upgrade kit for my daughter ebike. She had a 300W brushless motor and I decided to increase power since we live in an area where hills are pretty steep to get to her school. It was an easy upgrade. She rode the bike to school 3 times and the controller burned out. The connectors, which are insulated, were fried. Voilamart does not sell the controller by itself. I bought another Chinese-manufactured controller and I could not get it to work. Will probably not purchase another Voilamart product.",

      "text": "its a square wave controller which makes the motor much noisier than a sine wave controller. great value and lots of power. the controller is more like a 750 watt so youll need a battery pack that can output at 20 amps if you're going to use it without the speed limiter. i had to get a bigger battery because this controller/motor is very power hungry and kept tripping the battery bms by drawing so many amps when accelerating at full throttle. strong rim and well built but didn't come with a rim strip so i had to use electrical tape to cover the spoke holes along the rim.",

The PAS system is jerky and dangerous in stop and go traffic, had to disconnect and use twist throttle, seems to work fine on open road. Requires a 48 mm valve steam but comes with a tube that has a standard steam. On positive side seems to have plenty of power and speed, although I do ride on flat land, not sure how it would perform on hills.",
