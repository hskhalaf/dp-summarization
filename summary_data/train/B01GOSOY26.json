After burning off the residue and using toothpaste to clean as directed, it was very clear and no fogging. BUT, this is the dealbreaker for me -- it came in just a plastic bag. NO BOX AT ALLl!!! Most quality masks would come with a box to protect it. Not this one. Now I have to spend my time and money looking for a box that will fit it. Ugh.",

I have an Aqualung Maui thats is popular in the military circles, and this, for me, is better! It fits me a lot better, feels softer, but still solid. Low volume, easy to clear and most importantly no leaks. It also has a great field of view. Also seems easier to keep from fogging after the initial cleaning with tooth paste. I cant believe it keeps up, and seems to surpass my beloved Maui! At this price....a no brainer!",

I never dived beyond six feet deep, as I was searching for agates, but overall I really appreciated the quality of the goggles.",
