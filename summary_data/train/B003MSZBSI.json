As they got bigger I could start weighing them in ounces. I have also used it weigh pounds of butter, or nuts for cooking. The batteries last a long time too.",

Bad things: It is rather difficult to use, especially the TARE function. The function is combined with the ON/OFF power button. So, a lot of times, it is a tedious guess work: one or two quick taps. If the finger stayed on the power area a bit too long, then the scale will be turned off. Inaccurate. An weight of around 13 g ground coffee will be measured for 13, 14 and 15 with three tries. The lesson is: if TART function is important, buy a scale with a dedicated button for the function. This scale is disappointing.",

I would zero it with a piece of celophane on it to weigh meat for half pound burgers. it worked perfectly. Also it is very easy to clean, and has little rubber feet on the bottom so it doesn't slide around on the counter.",

The reason being is because the buttons do not work when you get your hands wet or water on the scale. There's pretty much nothing that can be done about it since it's an inherent design flaw.

While there are many scales available on the market, I absolutely love the black color of this scale and especially the reversed LCD display. The display is what sells this scale and it does look great. Not to be all fashion and no function, this scale has all the bells and whistles you might imagine from a kitchen scale and I really enjoy using it. If you are curious, it is about the thickness and size of an iPad.",

It's also very easy to use. It only has two buttons, one to turn on and off and set the starting weight, the second to change the units of measurement. If you want to subtract the weight of the bowl when you start, you just press start button after adding the bowl. Easy peasy. Love this scale!",

It uses 2 CR2032 batteries (the big round discs) which aren't always the easiest to find, and are expensive.
