      "text": "I had bought this trumpet for my son, who is in the advanced band at school. It was a Christmas gift, and he loved it. The nickel plating on this instrument is extremely shiny and looks very sharp and clean. The slides are smooth to move and the valves are pre-oiled. The sound it produces is also clean and crisp. Not the sound quality of a Bach or a Conn-Selmer, but it is very good for this price range. I recommend this instrument.",

The case is really nice and quality stuff. We have had no issues with the trumpet at all and the teacher said it sounds great. We will probably upgrade her IF she decides to continue on with it. For anyone with a child / teen, this is a great option to avoid the high rental costs or to avoid borrowing a previously used one because who wants to do that these days? Not us!",

I don't know the name of the piece but one of my daughters claimed that the piece was so difficult to use and it would hurt her pinky everytime she used it. We tried to fix it but not much luck. She has a higher quality trumpet that she uses. And in comparison of the two I can tell the sound difference. My other daughter's trumpet came in good and easy to use. So I guess it is hit or miss. But the sound quality is okay for students but not necessarily for professional use.",

The included case feels sturdy enough to be dropped without much worry. The metalwork was perfect. Didn't see any imperfections. The valves didn't stick or lag at all while I've been playing it. The important thing, sound quality seemed fantastic for a trumpet in this price bracket. I would highly recommend this to any student of music, young or old.",

The valves work nice and smooth and it even came with valve oil. Overall, I'm not disappointed in this trumpet at all. It's decent quality and nice sound for the price point.",
