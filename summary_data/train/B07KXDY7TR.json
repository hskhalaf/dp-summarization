      "text": "This Kit is ok , for the person wanting to see if leather working is something for them , definitely not the quality of tools one would purchase if leather working was their job. I also believe that the marketer of this kit adds insignificant tiny items for the sake of saying its a 356 piece kit. For example (a tin foil thimble) \u201cuseless\u201d dollar store (or lesser quality) scissors ect . Ide much rather have lesser items with higher quality..... for the 85.00",

      "text": "This set was given as a gift to my wife who is just starting out leathercrafting. She likes that it came with so many different tools to try, but they aren't high quality and it's a struggle to use a few of them. Overall, I can't complain. I knew what price range I was in, and the goal was to try everything out and determine which ones would be worth replacing with higher quality tools later on. Decent value.",

      "text": "This kit is very good for the price. It has a lot of tools and it's unreasonably priced for what comes in it. I only wish it came with a better stitching awl for handheld stitching. I think the awl that comes with it is a cheaper version of the handy stitch awl without the bobbin in the handle and what I am looking for is an actual sewing awl.",
