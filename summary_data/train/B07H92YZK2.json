If your car has a small door opening (which honestly I didn't think the Fusion had), you might want to look at a Britax. Also, I've noticed with my husband's smaller car, it is harder to loosen the shoulder straps. No issues in my car though. Plus, that won't be an issue once it is time to do forward-facing. Very easy to install. We're talking like two minutes, tops.",

Tightening the anchor straps is not easy and the carseat always seems to wobble more than you would prefer. It works and the price is less but This carseat frustrates me every time I use it.

    "description": "Style:NextFit Sport| Color:BlackThe #1-rated Chicco NextFit Sport Convertible Car Seat is engineered to surround your little one in comfort and safety, all the way to preschool and beyond. Reassuringly easy installation and user-friendly touchpoints simplify travel and everyday life, making it easier for families to go and grow together. The NextFit Sport accommodates infants and growing toddlers in rear-facing mode then transitions smoothly to forward-facing mode for older children. A nine-position headrest and padded, no-rethread harness comfortably accommodate growth throughout both modes. The NextFit Sport is designed to deliver the confidence of a secure install with remarkably simple leveling and tightening. A SuperCinch force-multiplying tightener and LockSure belt-tightening system make it easy to achieve a tight fit with LATCH or with the vehicle seat belt. The NextFit Sport also transitions smoothly from vehicle to vehicle and between modes thanks to premium LATCH connectors with click-on attachment and push-button release, plus a built-in slide path to re-position the LATCH strap for forward-facing mode. DuoGuard provides two layers of side-impact protection with a deep rigid shell and EPS energy-absorbing foam. The seat shell is also reinforced with a steel frame. For use from 12-40 lbs in rear-facing mode, from 22-65 lbs in forward-facing mode, and up to 49\".",
