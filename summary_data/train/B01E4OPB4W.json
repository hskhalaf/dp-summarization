I peed a lot and was in the bathroom often but nothing violent. The only time I wanted food was if I smelled it. After my three day cleanse I am down 10 lbs and I feel great.

It is of course tough around lunch time since everyone in the office eats yummy smelling foods but once that has passed it was smooth sailing! Peed a LOT might be a little bothersome but so much liquid you should kind of expect it. I am starting a new diet regime tomorrow so did this to get cleaned out for it! Worked like a charm and lost 4lbs probably mostly from bloating. I feel amazing and ready to tackle this new challenge. Will be using this product again!",

They all pretty much tasted the same and were incredibly sweet, except the renew at night. For the money I wish I would have tried another brand for this cleanse because I was very underwhelmed. I am only giving this 3 stars because the customer service was excellent. When my juices arrived (completely room temp might I add which is super weird) one was busted and had spilled all over the box. I contacted the company, not amazon, and they overnighted a replacement juice and 4 additional juices and a tote for the inconvenience.",

I enjoyed a few slightly slushy, almost too delicious to consider \"healthy\". Having more options (8) per day definitely helps for active metabolisms. Definitely recommending to everyone and will order again myself for sure.",
