Babybjorn feels sturdier, in our opinion better made - the top is completely non-slip corner to corner, not just dots of non-slip (and that also varies in quality between Dreambaby and Kids best friend even though they look very much the same). The non-slip strips on the bottom of Babybjorn also seems better made/installed. Dreambaby's bottom non-slip strips are similar to Babybjorn, while Kid's best friends only have 4 corners of non-slip. Here is our personal ranking: 1) Babybjorn, 2) Dreambaby, 3) Kids best friend. Hope this helps.",

It doesn't quite get him there. If he reaches as much as he can, he can get the tips of his fingers under the faucet, but can't reach the handles. That doesn't take away from the quality of the stool. It will work great for him when he gets a little taller and it seems well made. Its also not terribly bulky so it won't take up a lot of space in small bathrooms.",

After having this for 9 months now the top as well as the rubber feet are a terrible orange.color. Would have been much better if the top and feet were black. I would not recommend. .",

When she grows up, I will inherit it, I will use it in the kitchen as a step stool. Made of durable plastic that will not crack and it is easy to clean. Black and white color will look good everywhere unlike acid green or pink stools you see around. Gender and age neutral. A bit overpriced for a piece of plastic, but looks like I am gonna use this for years and years.",

Between the rubber grips and the wide base the stool is very stable and although she has fallen off a few times it is not a fault of the step but rather our daughter learning about gravity. With more practice (and remembering she is on a stool) falling will no longer be a concern as the stool is exceptionally stable. Considering how well made this stool appears to be I imagine we will get many years out of it.",

I am going to look for something a little taller to help his independence.",

Unfortunately, it's a little short and my son just barely gets his chin over the sink. He's not short either, he's about 37.5 inches. I like the wide rubber surface and the rubber on the legs so it won't slip. It seems to hold up well no matter where he is standing on it. It would be a 5 star item, if only it added a few inches!",

So, of course, she can't reach the sink either. Also, it is a little top-heavy. She has difficulty setting it down right side up when she is moving it from one location to the next. On the flip side, it does seem to be very sturdy. The rubber strip on the legs keep it securely in place while the rubber step surface helps to keep her feet from slipping. It has room for improvement and will be more useful when she gets a little taller.",
