Likely if she ran after a rabbit or something. Scared me senseless as I almost hit her with my car!! I've had other stakes that she has bent and twisted and thought this would work well considering it said up to 100 lbs and she's only 65 lbs! Cheaply made and not reliable. She could've been hurt, I'm so angry! We have only used it for two weeks!",

I like that the dogs can move around freely and still stay within our area. It's very nice to be able to easily move the stakes to follow the shady areas. The stakes are very strong and have never been pulled out of the ground by our large athletic dogs. We even bought a 3rd stake to use to tie our fishing boat to shore at the lake. Will definately recommend this product.",

Since it is so long, make sure there is nothing in the ground it can damage. When my dad was installing it, he hit the septic tank. So be careful of that.",
