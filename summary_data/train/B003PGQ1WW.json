A warning: They are not attractive when they arrive - they look like a matted dog. Once you brush them, they look great. 1st pic shows how pillows arrive; 2nd pic shows close up after brushing.",

      "text": "When I first saw this pillow online, I knew immediately that it would be the perfect piece for my Louis ghost chair and my makeup vanity. I love luxurious and beautiful looks. When I saw the pillow in my hands, my initial thought was that the pillow looked like an unkempt Great Pyrenees. The texture is not soft, either. It will look out-of-place, obtuse even, in a pretty setting. I would not buy this particular product, unless you do not mind a matted hair look for a pillow.",

I hesitate to order certain things online so it took me a while to decide to purchase these, but they're a good choice if you're looking for something in this style. I ordered a second one after the first one arrived. Wasn't planning on being that person with two shaggy pillows on the sofa, but here we are.",

They are definitely not white white, but are more of an off white/very light cream. Nice, full pillows too! And the back is like a microsuede type material. Would definitely recommend these!",
