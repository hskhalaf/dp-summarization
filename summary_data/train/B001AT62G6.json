Then, they advise to contact the manufacture because they do not offer a discount on this otras nether accept a return. This is my feedback: DO NOT BUT THIS PRODUCT. It is not worth the money!! It will break after a few days of use.",

Chinchillas bring more weight then your common rodent plus they have a hop in there run as well. These are advertised for chinchillas which should 100% be considered False Advertising. Furthermore in case someone brings size into it. I've had a 5 year old and a 1 year old chinchilla break these cheep designs. Go with the Metal!!!! Hope this helps",

The others just seem to be initially perplexed by the device, and quickly move on to ignoring it. These are rats who routinely use rodent balls to run around, and have figured out \"puzzle\" toys for rabbits and chinchillas in minutes, so I don't think it's an intelligence thing.

If you happen to get a little rough with the wheel trying to separate it from the base, the pin will also snap off. Once the pin snaps, the wheel is unusable and so far, we haven't found a alternate fix. On average, these wheels lasted 2-3 months before breaking.",

It's definitely not recommended for Chinchillas or any animal of that size. The purple saucer is nice an vibrant, the blue one is more like a royal blue, it's also pretty. The price is really good ($14.75 on Prime). I saw it at Petco for $35.00.",
