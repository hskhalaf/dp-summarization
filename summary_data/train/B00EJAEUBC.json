      "text": "Bought this for my 3 year old granddaughter who is just learning how to use her scissors. I know she will love it. I was a preschool teacher for years and kids really need these types of activities. For those of you thinking of teaching this to your kids, a rule of thumb that will help is to have the child hold the scissors in front of their tummy, and move the paper, not the scissors. But if you teach them to hold them at tummy level, and remind them a few times, the teaching will go so much easier on you.",

What we like to do is have my daughter cut everything out, and then I give her construction paper and a glue stick and have her put it all back together how ever she wants to.

If they were, then they broke quickly. Either way, the blade is plastic. I know this is a safety feature, but for occupational therapy purposes, it is tremendously frustrating for the child because nine out of ten cuts have no \"reward\" -- no impact. The angle has to be DEAD ON. So I'd suggest investing in this (since it is so inexpensive) but providing your own blunt metal safety scissors (with supervision) unless the child is not yet familiar enough with scissors to understand that they \"pinch.\"",

The scissors that come with it are orange glittered plastic and don\u2019t have metal blades, so they only cut paper, which is awesome. A slight downfall is that they don\u2019t cut paper once the pieces are very small because the paper just bends with them. I trust my kids with these scissors much more than the ones that we sent to school in their school supplies.",

The skills go in order (straight lines, big curves, small curves, whole circles, etc.) and they're fairly quick activities so it's easy to squeeze into your day, or do more or less depending on frustration levels. We both love this book and it's definitely helping her get the hang of using scissors. Highly recommend!",

The scissors are pretty easy for a toddler to figure out (about 4) and the workbook is cute and just challenging enough to get skills down! My 4.5 year old son loves doing this part of his \"homework\". My 2 year old can't quite figure out how to cut with these- so probably should be over 3 at least. These also are safe- I'm not sure they could actually cut you but I still have him used supervised and keep put away after use. Great buy!",

Some of the projects are purely cutting, and some are meant to be glued to another piece of paper. Sometimes, I'll ask him if he wants to do a page of his cutting book and he says no.
