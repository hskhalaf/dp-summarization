Optical quality is what one would expect from Leitz optics. The automatic functions seem to work very well, but I've been a photographer for going on 50 years, so I have my own way of shooting and set the camera accordingly. So far, the only thing I'd add is a variable output control for the flash. The camera may have that function and I just haven't found it yet. If anything changes, I'll let you know, but overall, I am more than pleased with this camera.",

I wanted something with a DSLR body (otherwise I was gonna drop it) and something that could record in 1080i, and was rechargeable. This does that, and thus I am extremely pleased. I've been using it for a couple months and a full battery charge lasts me a good while if I'm not leaving it on all day. The HD video format is extremely large, so be aware that uploading them is going to eat up a lot of space on your computer. All in all, it's really good for a hobby camera.",

Battery will last for about 450 photos with little flash use. We always buy extra batteries for any of our items. Zoom feature is unbelievable, it will bring objects from very far away to filling the view screen. It also has the a view finder that can be turned on for detailed long shots! Great camera",

Manual controls are logically laid out. The high-definition video format does require using the Windows-only PhotofunStudio software (included with the camera) to transfer to video sequences to a DVD; a Mac version would be a welcome addition.",

However, the loss of the longer than 4 second exposures and the lack of a true high frame rate sequential shot is disappointing. The 10fps is good, but only for three shots. Even the 5fps rate can't be sustained for more than a second! Had I know that I might not have purchased. I don't know why the high-speed data transfer evidently available for higher end cameras like the Nikon 7D can't be ported to this camera, but if it could it make this camera amazing!",

The pix were as good as nearly anything I've ever shot in motorsports, and that's been a long time.",

    "title": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ60 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 24x Optical Zoom - Black",
    "description": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ60 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 24 x Optical Zoom - Black\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n\nPANASONIC LUMIX DMC-FZ60, 16.1 MP DIGITAL CAMERA WITH 24X OPTICAL ZOOM AND 3.0-INCH LCD, POWERFUL ZOOM & HIGH SENSITIVITY MOS SENSOR - BLACK \n\nZOOM, ZOOM, ZOOM, AND ZOOM SOME MORE WITH THE LEICA ULTRA WIDE-ANGLE 25MM LENS FOR THE FZ60K DIGITAL CAMERA\nBring your subjects up close with this powerful 24x zoom.With the dynamic 24x optical zoom you won't miss your child's expressions or your favorite athlete's split-second scoring action, or even the far-away wild animal that is on the prowl. Why? Because the F5.2 wide aperture gives you stunning images and videos produced in a softly-focused background. The advanced LEICA DC VARIO-ELMARIT lens system delivers exceptional optical performance, suppressing distortion and color bleeding on the FZ60 digital camera. A clear and sharp focus in telephoto shots renders superb resolution. Use the digital Intelligent Zoom function and virtually extend 48x bringing your subjects to your frame without moving a step while the built-in Intelligent Resolution technology preserves image quality.\n\nMORE CREATIVE CONTROLS & PHOTO STYLES TELL YOUR PHOTOGRAPHIC STORY\nPhoto Style, 8 new creative controls, and 3D Imagery will elevate your photographic journey.Want a digital camera that creates expressive, telling and fun scenes? With the FZ60 compact digital camera, choose from among 8 new and 6 original creative control effects as you play with a range from Toy Effect to Star Filter and Expressive. Add an artistic touch in Photo Style to your pictures and videos with 6 customizable color types, like Vivid. And get more shooting control with the new Panorama Shot, the Intelligent Handheld Night Shot (iA Mode generates an illuminated night scene), and the White Balance Bracket function which shoots 3 consecutive photos while adjusting the white balance. You can even produce 3D Images with the LUMIX FZ60 digital camera. For advanced photographers, use the manual control mode for even greater creative license. \n\nSHOOT LIKE A PRO WITH THESE PROFESSIONAL-GRADE CONTROL FEATURES THAT COME WITH THE LUMIX FZ60 DIGITAL CAMERA\nGo after those pictures-in-the-making with Panasonic's new 12.1MP High Sensitivity MOS Sensor and Venus Engine.A newly developed 12.1-megapixel High Sensitivity MOS sensor and high performance image processing LSI Venus Engine provide high speed response, high sensitivity recording and superb image quality to capture even the most fleeting photo opportunities. The ratio of the MOS sensor and the Intelligent Noise Reduction system in the Venus Engine adjusts photos and videos taken in sensitive areas and creates clear, crisp imagery. For low-lit situations, the FZ60 digital camera's multi-process Noise Reduction System produces dramatically clear photos and videos. Intelligent HDR (High Dynamic Range) in the iA Mode overlays several still pictures consecutively shot at different exposure levels and produces a single composite picture avoiding over or under exposure. \n\nTAKE A PICTURE AND RECORD IT IN FULL 1080/60P HD WITH 24X ZOOM\nAll-at-once: Shoot and Record in Full HD with Photo Style, Creative Video, MPEG-4, and 3D.The Motion Picture designated button, on the FZ60 digital camera, lets you record while taking photos without having to switch modes. Make videos in full HD 1,920x1,080 60p in both AVCHD Progressive (MPEG-4) and MP4 formats. The powerful 24x optical zoom, with its redesigned side lever for easier zooming access, captures highly natural expressions and fast-moving sports scenes that the naked eye may miss. Play it back in dramatic slow motion and see the difference. Creative Control and Photo Style render highly unique expressions by coordinating colors to your subject and its surroundings. The point and shoot camera's Creative Video Mode lets you adjust the shutter speed and aperture any way you like when shooting videos. \n\nSNAP IN UNDER A SECOND WITH THE FZ60K DIGITAL CAMERA\nNever Miss a shot: With quick start-up time and Light Speed Auto Focus.Capture the moment with a quick start-up time of approx. 0.95 sec. and Light Speed Auto Focus. Get 12 fps full resolution photographs with the 12.1-megapixel MOS sensor as you take a series of shots. Snap consecutively at approx. 5.5 fps/2 fps with Auto Focus Tracking. And the newly added focus mode AF Flexible resets automatically when your subject moves. Even high-speed burst shooting is possible with the electronic shutter. In Intelligent Burst Shooting, the frame rate sets according to the subject's movement. And faster data transfer is possible as the DMC-FZ60 compact digital camera is compatible with the Ultra High Speed-I standard SDHC/SDXC Memory Card. \n\nADVANCED TECHNOLOGY REDUCES GLARE AND MINIMIZES HANDSHAKING\nMinimize blur and produce picture perfect photos with Nano Surface Coating technology.Panasonic's Nano Surface Coating technology minimizes light reflection within the entire zoom range (380nm-780nm) thus reducing glare and producing super clear pictures. The LUMIX FZ60 camera's powerful 24x optical zoom can be increased to the 48x equivalent with the Intelligent Zoom function, taking advantage of its Intelligent Resolution technology which brings images to life. The compact digital camera's POWER O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer) minimizes blur, even when zoomed, and Active Mode effectively suppresses handshake vibrations in both still picture taking and video recording. \n\nA CAMERA THAT IS EASY TO USE\nLet iA (Intelligent Auto) Plus do all the work for you. (View Larger)Use the turn-and-push jog dial, on the FZ60K digital camera, to change your desired settings quickly so you don't miss your moving subjects. And for those intricate close-ups of flowers and insects, the 1-cm Macro feature renders dynamic detail. The newly developed 0.2-inch EVF (Electronic Viewfinder) with a 100% field-of-vision adds high resolution to every scene. In the camera's iA (Intelligent Auto) Plus Mode, you have greater creative freedom as you slide to reach the right amount of defocus control, white balance, and brightness. With features like Shake, Motion, Face, and Scene Detection and Recognition, your images will stand out even more. For fun, add Happy Mode, optimizing your image's true colors marking memorable memories.\n\nA LUMIX CAMERA THAT MAKES SHARING YOUR PHOTOS WITH YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA CIRCLES EASY\nMake sure your images make the social circles with easy uploading to Facebook and YouTube.With the LUMIX FZ60 digital camera, upload photos and videos instantly to Facebook and videos to YouTube. Photos or videos recorded in AVCHD on the SD/SDHC/SDXC Memory Cards are easy to view on a Panasonic VIERA TV. Viewing images taken in the 3D Photo Mode via the 3D VIERA TV will offer an exciting experience. And the PHOTOfunSTUDIO 8.3 AE makes it possible to sort and organize new photos and videos and those stored on your computer. You can also enjoy making slideshows using varying effects as well as your iTunes library for background music. Add a title or comments or even tag family and friends with Face Recognition.\n\nACCESSORIZE AWAY WITH THESE GREAT LUMIX PRODUCTS\nTele Conversion Lens DMW-LT55 (requires Lens Adaptor DMW-LA5)\nShoots at 1.7x magnification and F3.7 brightness. It is almost half the size and less heavy than the 1.5x tele conversion lens.Lens Adaptor DMW-LA5 (works with Conversion Lens DMW-LT55)\nMade of high-quality aluminum, this adapter mounts onto the Tele Conversion Lens DMW-LT55 and Close-up Lens (DMW-LC55).Dynamic Close-up Lens DMW-LC55 (requires Lens Adaptor DMW-LA5)\nPrevents blurring with a 2-lens feature that magnifies 3-times that of a typical telephoto setting in Macro Mode.
