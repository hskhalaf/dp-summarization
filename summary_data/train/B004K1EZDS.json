I tried every setup combination, and firmware that Linksys had, and then gave up and installed dd-wrt. After installing dd-wrt the router is stable, and the throughput much better, you also end up with a device with the features of one that would be thousands of dollars not hundreds. Bottom Line: If you are technical, and don't mind installing and configuring dd-wrt, then this is not a bad router. If you prefer plug and play, stay away from this one, there are much better routers out there.",

And let me tell you this one does not disappoint. No hiccups, I've only reset it twice in the 4 years I have owned it and handles all WiFi traffic with ease while broadcasting the signal further than routers with external antennas. Sometimes, you can pay less for a product and get the same quality. But with routers you have to pay to play. If you want want a robust router that can handle network traffic and put out a reliable gigabit LAN, look no further. Highly recommend.",

During that time, we've had to reset the router multiple times by cycling the power in order to reestablish our internet connection. The smart wifi GUI is a good idea, but could use a little polish. It wasn't all that intuitive and not as reliable as connecting directly to your router by typing 192.168.1.1 in your browser like I've done in the past. I'll be trying one of the other brands next. This is my 4th Linksys in about 8 years. Three of them were replaced because of failures like this.",

If I reboot the router it will connect but ultimately drops the connection after a while. Sucks. Pretty disappointing for a networking product from Cisco.",
