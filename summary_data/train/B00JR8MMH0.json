Im.not a review person but still I have this I always wanted to let others know just ignore Windows and go for Chrome OS and its so quick, refresh itself and easy to use that I cannot believe! I have it for years now and just do not understand how its not became lot more popular! After years u do not need to do anything reinstall or these things it just work perfectly without servicing all the time (not like other brands u can bin it in few years)",

Its quite attractive and well designed, especially in white. The speakers are poor, the capacitive buttons are somewhat hit and miss and the keyboard could be better but at the price that is not wholly unreasonable. If it came with a wireless mouse at the least and was a little sturdier, it would have got full marks.",
