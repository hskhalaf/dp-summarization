      "title": "a good macbook substitute",
      "text": "For people who don't want to buy mac but like everything on the mac, this is a good substitute. The mac is a better laptop in my opinion. 4 things where the mac is better: mac runs cooler on the metal body where the np900 bottom felt warm/hot. The scroll pad cursor keep freezing up. The fan is loud. Window 8 and the boot petition takes up too much space and leaves only 48GB for use. The mac leaves 92GB after initial boot up. What I like about the np900: The price is right compared to the mac. Light weight. So far, battery life is about 5hrs.",

      "text": "The Samsung Series 9 looks great in design and it is very light. The looks and use are great however, it freezes very often when you are using Mozilla Firefox browser? I am wondering whether it is a browser problem or computer hardware issue. I had it for a couple weeks and for the price you would expect something better. I bought several Lenovo and never had any problems when using any browser. I hope it is not the hardware problem because it is not a cheap laptop, it is very light and the design is nice but if the hardware is a problem is does not matter how nice it looks because it is a useless computer...",

      "text": "Good features: Very light weight, rapid start, good screen resolution. Not so good: Small size (128 GB) Solid-State Drive, which rapidly fills with programs, making the user constantly try to clean the disk to be able to continue. Sealing of screen is poor: a drop of water is enough to wreck the laptop, which forces you to mail the laptop to Samsung. Overall, I still prefer the Solid-State Drive to traditional hard drives. Hopefully Samsung will improve the sealing in the future.",

Its super thin and light, has a super fast start up (flash memory) and it is beautifully designed. But there were a few small issues that made me return it. Namely the display was too small, I kind of had to squint to see things. And on the track pad i was finding it hard to right click, that may have been something I needed to work on. Most importantly, I realized that, although solidly built, 2.5 pounds is just too light for my taste.",
