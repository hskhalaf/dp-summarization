I don't think it'd hold up. But for occasional use and for the price I think it's a 5 star purchase.",

The color and fabric on this vest are good quality and most importantly the reflective strips are significantly wide so they do not blend in with my surroundings. My only disappointment is that the zippered pocket is also made of the same breathable material as the rest of the best and is not waterproof. Waterproof pocketing would have made this vest perfect",

It is very reflective and bright so I believe it will do the job well of keeping me safe while running.",

I bought this to be visible when I run at night and it will do that flawlessly. Bright yellow and reflective. The pocket is a bonus. There isn't a sizing chart but I went with the size I would buy in a jacket and it will fit over my clothes just fine. It connects at the sides with velcro so there is some flexibility. Bottom line - I would recommend this product to anyone.",

I would not be able to velcro the sides if wearing anything other than a t-shirt. After the first time of wearing, today when I received it, the velcro patch stitching came out and is falling off.(picture attached)",

It was very tight on him over a shirt, and in colder weather would need to be worn over a coat. We have now ordered a large and hope to have better luck. Apart from that it is a nice product, packs up small and gives good reflection for cycling or jogging in the dark.",

The front stays put. I like the inside zipper for your phone, glasses, etc. I ordered a large for allowance for the backpack.",
