I don't know why they die so soon; I can remember the same dehumidifier in my home the whole time I was there when I was a kid. Anyway, now I'm happy if I can get 4 or 5 years out of them. This one is reasonably priced, and functions well. It is a bit louder than the previous one, but no big deal for me because of where I use it. Obviously just bought it, so we shall see how long it lasts.",

This energy efficient unit operates quietly on 2 fan speeds (high/low) in rooms up to 1,500 square feet. It has a smart dehumidifying function that allows the unit to automatically control humidity by factoring in ambient room temperature. If the unit shuts off unexpectedly due to a power outage, it will automatically restart with the previous function settings when power is restored. The automatic de-icing system ensures the coils are always ice-free while the low temperature feature allows the system to continue to operate at temperatures as low as 41F. Maintenance is easy with the removable air filter and direct-drain system. Plus, Danby 30-Pint dehumidifier has four built-in caster wheels making it easy and convenient to move the unit from one room to another.",
