    "title": "Sony NW-E005 2 GB Flash Digital Music Player (Black)",
    "description": "Product Packaging:Standard Packaging2gb flash digital music player\n\nAMAZON.COM\nAmazon.com Product Description Weighing less than 1 ounce and featuring a built-in FM tuner with programmable presets, the Sony NW-E005 is the prefect MP3 player for the gym, the daily commute, or traveling. The unit, which offers 2 GB of built-in flash memory, stores up to 1,350 of your favorite tracks--more than enough for most applications. Listeners who already have extensive music libraries can use the included software and hardware to play back their collection of MP3s, while newer listeners will find plenty to like in Sony's ATRAC format, which provides higher sound quality while taking up less space on the flash memory. \n\n\n\nMemory stores up to 1,350 of your favorite tracks. In addition, the NW-E005 supports the playback of WMA and AAC (non-DRM) audio files, a great feature if you have a large catalog of audio on your PC that was ripped from personal CDs.  Navigation is straightforward thanks to the player's one-line, rotating OLED display, which shows the song title, song length, and remaining battery power while swiveling to accommodate both right- and left-handed users. Other display details include a multilingual interface, support for CD text and ID3 tagging, a wide viewing angle, an internal clock, and a calendar. The built-in FM tuner, meanwhile, delivers accurate, drift- free tuning of all your favorite FM stations, with 30 station presets making it a breeze to quickly switch from one favorite to another. And when it comes time to transfer data from your PC to the NW-E005, simply remove the end cap and insert the MP3 player directly into your computer's USB port--no cable required. \n\n The NW-E005 comes with a copy of Sony's SonicStage music management software, which lets listeners manage their music, create playlists, burn CDs, import digital files, and easily transfer songs from one location to another. It's also a breeze to customize the sound, with a five-band equalizer that includes heavy, pop, jazz, custom, and manual modes. Additional features include a skip-proof design (the MP3 player has no moving parts), a quick battery charge function that delivers up to three hours of playback with just a three-minute charge, a stylish black housing, a USB connection support cable for desktops with hard-to-reach USB ports, and compatibility with Sony's Connect Music store. \n\n The NW-E005, which provides up to 28 hours of continuous playback per full charge, measures 3.11 by 0.96 by 0.53 inches (W x H x D) and is backed by a 90-day warranty on labor and a one-year warranty on parts. \n\n What's in the Box\nNW-E005 MP3 player, headphones, SonicStage 4.0 software CD-ROM, quick-start guide. \n\n\n\nA skip-proof design and quick battery charge function allow you to take your music on-the-go. \n\nThis ultra-portable Sony MP3 player comes in a variety of stylish colors.",
