The keyboard is so cheap that you can actually bend it in the middle. The mouse is very cheap, but it does work. Avoid this set. If you're looking for a cheaper combo, that isn't awful, try the MK345 instead:  Yes, it's twice the cost, but it's so worth the extra price. It's not even close.",

The windows key works as the Apple command key, and having the extra numberpad on the side is nice. I wouldn't call it sleek, but it's not as bulky as I was expecting. Only complaint is that the keys when typing and scroll wheel on the mouse are very loud, but overall this is a great option for the price. I will update this review if I run into any issues.",

The key press is pretty mushy but expected from a super cheap, non-mechanical keyboard and the symbols on the keys were wearing off on the WASD and homekeys within a few weeks of use. After 1.8yrs of steady use, the hardware started failing. Keys would register as being held down regardless if I was not pressing them or repeatedly pressing them in a frantic attempt to reset it. This is super frustrating when typing and even more so in games when it would be my WASD keys trying to walk me off a map. Won't be buying another logitech keyboard in the future.",

And you can here the spring making an abnormal sound which tells me the spring has failed. I don't know if one should expect more from such a cheap product, but I am not happy that it failed so soon.

I'll probably eventually get a set of Bluetooth accessories, but I'll keep these for when you can't use blue tooth. Recommendation? Get these if you want a wired set. You wont regret it.",

      "title": "Cheap, effective, with puffy keys",
      "text": "This is what is known as a $15 keyboard. It works. It doesn't have any bells and whistles. It's like a hammer. It does it's job, cheaply and relatively effectively. The one thing to truly note is that the keys are what I would consider \"classically raised.\" Most modern keyboards have slightly lower, flatter keys popularized by Apple back with the iMacs. The keys on this MK120 are fully raised and \"puffy\" in the vein of the more classic keyboards of old. Buy accordingly.",

Since I had ordered this set some time ago as a spare, I switched it. Wow! What a difference. I see now the previous wasn't sensitive enough, nor the problems were my PC. This Logitech is crisp, moves like super fast, and I have none of the problems that have \"plagued\" me before. I decided even the smooth \"roll\" is much better than the \"click\" one, too. This price makes it all the more \"excellent\"",
