This seemed to work the best. Her feet are so smooth now and the fact that this comes with both a soap and scrubber is even better. I\u2019m excited that my legs aren\u2019t being scratched by her sharp feet in bed anymore. She would roll around in bed, and one of those sharp cracked edges would snag my skin, sometimes causing a deep gash.",

Pumice is defined as: \"a very light and porous volcanic rock formed when a gas-rich froth of glassy lava solidifies rapidly.\" I went back to read the description, and it does say it's synthetic WAY down in the paragraph section. But it clearly says \"pumice stone\" on the package, and it is NOT. I can push my thumbnail into the \"stone\" very easily and it's obvious that it will not last long. I'm annoyed that I was duped, because this looked like a good product. It might work while it lasts, but it's still NOT what it says it is.",

The more pressure you put, the more you notice this happening. I honestly don\u2019t know how long the pumice will last, but don\u2019t expect any more than a few uses before I get to the plastic.

My feet are like a baby's bum - I highly recommend for anyone who wants to slough off dead skin from their feet :)",

This worked out great, I can now wear cute sandals without worrying about my ugly dry feet. I'm going to buy another one and one for my mother.",

      "text": "Because otherwise buying a pumice stone and moisture soap is so much cheaper. Bought it for my mom. Love the lemongrass scent. Can't tell if she will get such drastic improvement yet. She only used it for 3 days. Minus 1 star for not design a way to store it after each use. Would be great if it can stand on one of its side without the soap or the stone touching any bathroom surface (i.e., sink, bathtub).",

      "VERSATILE USE: This Cracked Heel Treatment Foot Scrub also works great on hands and elbows. If you suffer from dry hands and elbows, My Solemate can help. Just rub gently in circular motions since the skin on hands and elbows is more delicate.",

      "AT-HOME PEDICURE: Save time and money on getting expensive pedicures at the spa. My Solemate is so effective, if offers guaranteed results in just one use! Keep your feet soft, smooth and supple just like a baby\u2019s feet with fewer pedicures."
