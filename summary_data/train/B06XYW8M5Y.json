I contacted Amazon who told me that my warranty expired and I had to contact the direct distributor. I will attempt this mind you the TV was inexpensive but three months . The Expiration date should have read last only three months and I would have passed on this model. Buyer be wear!",

      "text": "Great little TV. Works well on the corner of my desk which was its intended purpose. I would suggest trying all the included antennas to see which works best. I found the wired telescope works best for my situation. Be prepared to scan more than once with the antenna(s) in different places to get the channels you prefer. With no manual, maximizing the remote has a bit of a learning curve. All in all, this unit is exactly what I had hoped for.",
