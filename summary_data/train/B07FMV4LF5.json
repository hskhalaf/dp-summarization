I used to shoot my work in a small light tent kit, but now that I paint much larger works, needed a larger setup. Everything arrived in excellent condition, it was well packaged and nothing was broken, torn, or dented. It's fully adjustable and I am really, really pleased with this purchase. Am still learning how to capture subtle nuances with the textures in my paintings, but gone are the blown highlights and hot spots. Thanks for making an affordable kit available, that isn't \"cheesy\".",

I sure recommend this product due to the quality and customer service by the seller. Thank you to amazon and the seller. Great experience!",

They were bright enough without being overpowering and with the types of bulbs provided, they did not overheat the small space we used them in. It was a bit odd that there were three stands and lights, but only two umbrellas, but that was fine for us as two were enough for our needs.",
