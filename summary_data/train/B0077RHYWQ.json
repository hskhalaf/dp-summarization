Lightweight Small size. Price. Simple switch design. Simple to use in the dark Cons: To lock the laser/light switch on you must push the lever down on the right side. It should have been ambidextrous with the same features on both sides. Recommended: Yes. For the price this was a great purchase.

      "title": "Streamlight TLR-4 TAC Light for Beretta 92A1",
      "text": "Bought this for my Beretta 92A1. The light and laser are bright and easy to see. The laser adjustments are easy to make. The main reason I gave it only 4 stars was due to fitment issues. The crossbar on the adapter designated for my pistol required some filing to fit into slot on the rail. I'm not sure if it's a Beretta or Streamlight issue. Also the clamp seems to work loose after firing ( in my case 200 rnds. in one session at the range ). I'll just remember to check tightness more often.",

This is exactly what I was looking for to to put on my home defense pistol (Sig P320 Full Size) It will fit a wide variety of pistols with the included adaptors. Nice, sleek, compact design. Bright laser that is easy to adjust and is spot on. Stands up to recoils no problem without having to make any adjustments. Flashlight is very bright and will illuminate anything you need it to. Just as good if not better than some of the more expensive ones out there. Will be purchasing more in the future. Great buy!!!",
