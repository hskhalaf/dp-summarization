E-ink is like looking at a newspaper: no harsh light to trigger strain, fatigue, and migraines. The refresh is quick enough that there is not the irritating lag of previous attempts at an e-ink monitor. It is even fast enough to watch video! Less buggy and less expensive than the Paperlike, of which I own three. This is my new goto device for when I want to spend more than fifteen minutes on my computer. Check out the review on Good Reads--it is what made me want to give this a try.",

Con: The screen. Unlike Kindle which has white background, the screen of BOOX Max 2 is pretty much yellow. The characters are dark gray instead of being solid black. This gray on yellow screen leads to very low contrast (image the printing on a piece of old yellow news paper). Honestly, it may do more bad than good to your eyesight.",

Contrast is good, and it makes a high resolution image, with text that is nearly as good as printed ink. It has Android, so you can basically do anything with it if you need to, but the screen refresh rate does make some tasks awkward. Overall it serves its purpose admirably, and has capabilities its competition lacks, making it the best choice available for many use cases.",
