The dry-erase board is thin but sticks to a magnetic surface easily and smoothly. The four pens with built-in erasers that came along with it worked wonderfully. The large rectangular eraser was also great for bigger jobs and had a magnet on the back. It all comes in a Handy heavy duty reusable storage tube. I would highly recommend this product!",

The board itself erases well and has not slipped at all. I wouldn't let the problems with the pens and eraser stop me from buying it, those problems were easily solved, although they should be made a little better to begin with.",

There is a tiny magnet on the side of each one, with which you can stick it to the frig, as you can with the small board eraser, which also worked well. This whiteboard might also work for the inside of a school locker. It is a new item for me, and if my opinion changes after using it for some time, I will update.",

The only issue I had is that a day or two after I received it, one of the smaller erasers on the markers fell off. Also, before you purchase, if the colors matter to you, the ink doesn't match the color of the markers themselves - the ink is much darker.",

The markers that come with it are kind of faint as noted in other reviews so i ordered a name brand set at the same time.

But it actually stuck to it fairly well and the packaging didn't cause a permanent curl. The dry erase markers and eraser were pretty neat. We use it frequently and it hasn't dried out nor has the felt tip worn down at all. The happy-face magnet is a nice touch. I don't use it too often but it's still pretty cool.",

It comes rolled up and take a little bit to get it flattened and ready for mounting on the refrigerator. It cleans nicely with the included eraser, however, have only used the included markers. If you use different markers it may not clean as nicely. All-in-all a nice addition to the kitchen.",

Best thing i can say is that the marker wipes clean with no hazy ghosts, even after leaving writing up for 2+ weeks. Also, being a thin magnet and whiteboard combo makes this mount flat against the surface, limiting the chance for something to knock it off the fridge. Great product and will recommend to family/friends",

The only issue I've found is that the decorations (smiley face and quote) on the magnets are peeling off after only a few weeks, but I didn't buy it for the magnets so it doesn't bother me. For clarifications I thought the red marker looked pink in the photos but its red and the blue isn't as light as it looks in the photos either. I would definitely recommend.",
