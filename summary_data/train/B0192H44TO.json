We have a big air compressor and had to turn it up higher to get it to do anything. Wishing we would have just did it by hand, it could not have been any worse.",

It really surprised me it will serve my purpose well. You do have to give it a shake when you stop seeing media come out. It's not intended for big jobs so if you have a big project this is not for you. Now I got to see what I can do about the hole.",

You will need a minimum of a 2.5hp 20gal compressor to run this blaster effectively. I also recommend cutting the rubber tube in half for stronger flow of material to gun which means you'll have to be closer to the item to be blasted but overall works well",
