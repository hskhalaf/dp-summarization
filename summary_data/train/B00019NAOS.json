I have used it to catch springtime bass with topwater poppers, trout in New Mexico Mountains, trout in Oklahomas Lower Illinois River, and caught up to 5 lb catfish with bread cube flies in community lakes. Like others here, I used 5wt weight forward floating line instead of 3/4 wt. the 3/4 wt White River Fly Shop Dogwood reel is a perfect match for this rod. Just be sure the second piece is inserted snug before you start fishing, otherwise it may go flying out during casting.",

I knew i had to have one for blue gill. i spooled it up with rio 3 wt, and casted dry fly ants, to small woolly buggers and it is a fun rod to cast. The challenge i found was with landing fish, there simply is a lack of back bone making it hard to play the fish without loosing it. I was just catching small bluegills. This may be designed more for broke trout but is still fun. i just wish it was slightly longer, but its just bluegill at the end of the day for sport rather than food, so it serves its purpose",

Always helps to have a smaller rod for tight areas where there are lots of trees and brush. For the price, you really can't beat it. The only gripe I have with it is the reel seat. The bottom ring that goes over the reel attachment point is a perfect circle, but most higher end rods have this ring notched out to allow a tight fit. My reel is a little loose, which bothers me to some degree, but doesn't affect rod performance. Mainly just an aesthetic concern over function.",

Also, I'm not going out in the rivers out west, will primarily use it for catching panfish in small lakes and ponds. So I'm not looking for something that will \"shoot the line\" out 100 feet, or bring home a trophy brown. I just want to have a nice day catching 8\" Bluegill. I've had it for close to 2 months now, and I've probably fished it 7-8 times or more. I can't be more pleased.",

People keep saying this rod is a 5 weight rod, but mine says 3/4 weight. The action on this thing is unreal, it is so smooth,and easy loading rod. It looks just like the rods that cost about $200. Wooden reel seat, and i think the guides, rod butt, and reel lock are brass. Its also got measurements on the rod itself, which is a nice touch. This to me, is the perfect rod for catching panfish. I highly reccomend this to any hardcore panfisher.",
