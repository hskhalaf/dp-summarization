The board never snapped back at me, and while surfing I never once stepped on the leash. Would have been 5 stars, but the ankle strap is thinner than the leashes I usually use, and thus a bit less comfortable. Overall, though, I am a satisfied customer. It's a great leash for the price.",

Occasionally bailing my board at shallow pointbreaks and reefs, because a deep duckdive would lead to angry kisses from big boulders and sharp rocks. The leash held like a champ. Only reason I'm giving it four stars is because the ankle cuff is a bit thin (widthwise) and liked to loosen up a little over the course of a session. Otherwise, a fantastic budget leash. Took it as a backup and ended up using it on all my boards for the entire trip. Ho Stevie!",
