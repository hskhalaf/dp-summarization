Yes you need 3 separate cables but they are all nicely hidden and organized under the stand. My only con is I wanted it in white, so I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s all white, right? No! it has 2 little annoying black rubber things meant to hold the phone in horizontal position. Whyyyy!?",

I have a series 4 watch, so I'm not sure if this is only a problem with older watches but it has not effected me. One thing I will say is that it's important to have apple brand chargers, since it doesn't seem like any other charger would fit in this stand. Overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase.",

So I had to go with out a watch 3days last week. Since I have removed the charger and have gone back to charging on the night stand. I think if two small brackets would be incorporated to hold watch in place would solve the issue. Phone charges works great and so does the holder for the Airpods.

Instead, the phone/airpods is sitting on top of the charger. Also, you can't remove your phone or pods single handed. You need both hands to hold the stand down, otherwise the whole thing comes up and pulls all the cables. This probably wouldn't happen if the stand was heavier. Would not recommend.",

Once it is together I would not recommend disassembling to travel or anything. It was a very awkward shape to try and pack, but it work well enough to tuck in with clothing or the likes. Great to keep your bedside table organized and clean.",

The only drawback is the phone charger cord is not very sturdy in the stand and it can be a bit hard to connect, other then that I am really enjoying the charger stand. I purchased the rose color, but I think I should have gotten black.",

I would totally recommend it for a nightstand! My only complaint is that I had non-Apple charging cords for the AirPods and iPhone. This dock only fits Apple manufactured cords. I wish the clips that held the cables in place were a little more flexible to allow for other types to fit.",
