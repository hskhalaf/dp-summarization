I can't speak on behalf of these headphones yet, but in the past the Skullcandy Lowriders usually last me for about 6 months, which isn't bad in my opinion considering the price, you get what you pay for. We'll see how these ones do. Buy them now before there's none left! Or don't, so that there's more for me. :)",

The new model looks and feels cheap, nothing like the older version. I immediately purchased a pair of 2011 Lowriders, which have been discontinued by the manufacturer, and will be returning these ones. Not even worth it.",
