I loved the DSC-W90, but it quit working properly after 1-1/2 years, and Sony wanted $182 to repair it. I was particularly disappointed to find that the DSC-W200 camera does not have the capability to superimpose the date on the picture. If I had it to do over, I would have saved some money and bought the DSC-W80 which is probably more like the W90 I liked so well.",
