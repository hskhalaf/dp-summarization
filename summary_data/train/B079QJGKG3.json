The arch support is fantastic, and I was blown away at how cushiony and comfortable they are. And they looker more dressy (if that's possible for sneakers). My show size varies between 7-7.5 and 8 in running shoes. I ordered a 7.5 and they fit perfect wearing them with thin, no-show socks! Really glad I didn't order a size up because I probably would slip right out of them. I have high arches and narrow heals. I'll for sure be buying another pair.",

As one earlier reviewer similarly stated, the padding just drops out of existence once you get to the ball of the foot. The shoe was extremely stiff. So stiff that the heel of the shoe rides, rubbing up and down, the top of my heel. I can see how that would lead to a wicked blister if I were crazy enough to keep wearing the shoe.",
