Actually, I think it's a pretty good drone for the beginners/younger kids because it has a button to land smoothly. My other kids have more sophisticated drones that you have more to control and it can change parts, but I think this Potensic Mini Drone is more fun to fly.",

Dad: Blade protectors help extend blade life which is a great plus. If the drone runs into something while flying, it can bounce off the object instead of crashing to the ground like other drones we've owned. The controller is what you'd expect for this price range.

      "text": "This is a very cute mini drone, highly recommend for beginners and gift for kids. The only problem that I have with this drone is the battery life. They supply 2 small batteries that are usb rechargeable, but each battery will last for maybe 15-20 minutes tops before the drone starts beeping to change the battery. To have continuous play, you'd have to be constantly charging one battery while the other is being used. Other than that, I would say it's a fun mini drone to fly around.",

The battery is swapable, which is great to continue flying (the older version didn't have this), but the connectors are TINY and somewhat difficult to plug in and out. Also, I have found that the joysticks drift a bit on these so they move around without any input at times. Despite that, this was a good beginner drone for my kids to fly indoors and we actually bought 6 more to give as birthday gifts.",

If it gets stuck against the wall, runs into something that tangles the blades, it shuts down to protect itself. The motors have soft rubber pads on the bottom to absorb shock from landing. Most small drones have a crappy headless mode but this one works very well. Recharge time is about 30 minutes, flight time is about 10. Altitude hold works very well, even when you do a lot of banking and turns, it stays pretty steady.

Within a week, a new drone arrived and it has worked as expected. My son has really picked-up the controls and has become quite adept at navigating it around our home, up and down stairs. Highly recommended for the ease of use, customer service, battery life, and short charging time.",
