I use it 5 minutes a day and feel much better I still go to the chiropractor but only twice a month to maintain.",

      "text": "Very helpful little device to relieve back pain. I use it mostly when doing housework, like vacuuming, mopping floor, cleaning bathrooms... my back starts hurting about 30 min after I start that kind of housework and I have found that taking 5 min breaks to lie down with this back stretcher makes a huge difference! It relaxes my back and I'm able to resume cleaning with little or no back pain. I usually clean for about 30-45 min and then spend 5 min or so laying on the back stretcher. Works great!",
