By leaving the temp setting on high, all she has to do is turn the time knob to the time she needs. She quickly took to it and now her frustrations are gone.

      "text": "I use this microwave to cook food in my Semi truck, i can run it off of the 1200w inverter and it does fine, cooking times need to be a little longer than the food packages say sometimes because the wattage is kinda low. The mechanism that runs the turn table is starting to make some petty creepy and grindy noises, but seeing as though this thing has been bouncing around in the cabinet on my Cascadia for the past 6 months, I'm not surprised. As long as no microwaves are leaking out and nuking me, it's ok. Id imagine the more expensive microwaves made for RV's are build to handle all the bouncing and vibrations.",

On the one hand, having the knob is super-easy to use, but since there's a little play, it is a little difficult to know if you actually set it to one minute or a minute and a half. Normally not a big deal, but some things that I reheat, that 30 seconds can make a difference between just right and a little too much. If my home microwave went out, I might even consider this as a replacement because of the simplicity and the fact that I use a microwave simply to re-heat things and not as an actual cooking appliance.",

I passed up many cheaper options that produce much more power, simply because I don't use a microwave too often. One pretty major downside is the lack of any precise time inputs. Only a few degrees of rotation of the knob will give you an extra two or three minutes of cook time. furthermore, if you open the door and grab your food and there' still time left on the timer, the oven will turn back on once you close the door.",

Plan to heat longer than some packages may suggest. 2) Analog timer isn't very precise and timing for seconds isn't possible without an auxiliary timer.",

I solved the problem by putting a quilted placemat under it, but am still securing it with one hand while opening the door with the other. I am sure others have worked out their own solutions, but they shouldn't have to do so. This is a case where I bought something inexpensive, trusting the brand name.
