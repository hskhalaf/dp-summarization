I didn\u2019t find the pressure too tight as some stated, but that\u2019s personal preference. I had 2 blood clots in my lower leg during my pregnancy 2 years ago and I\u2019ve had occasional soreness still from hyper irritated nerves. I\u2019d recommend this product for sure!",

The different settings are basically the exact same thing, just with altered timing. If this sounds like what you want, you probably wont be disappointed.",

I sent it back to Amazon for a refund to purchase a different one.",
