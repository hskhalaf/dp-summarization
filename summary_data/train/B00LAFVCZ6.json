I mixed it with kombucha & coffee to test how well it dissolved- BINGO! This is a winner. It's also my first time using maca, so I'm looking forward to the amazing benefits of increased stamina and balancing hormones etc",

I've been taking maca for a little while now to help with energy and I do thinks it's helping, although not quite as dramatic of an effect as several cups of coffee would have, but I do notice subtle changes in my energy level. The taste of the maca is pretty terrible in my opinion(that's why only 4 stars), so I made some \"energy balls\" with unsweetened chocolate powder, cinnamon, peanut butter, a little honey and the maca. It makes them more palatable and actually they go well with a cup of coffee.",
