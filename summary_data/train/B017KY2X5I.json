I love listening to music when I swim, it makes the workout more interesting. These headphones hold up in slow, moderate, and fast swimming. This is technological genius. The only thing is they can't quite withstand flip-turns, but I'm going to try to clip them to my swim cap or suit strap and hopefully that'll help with flip-turns. Other than that they are amazing, with excellent sound and clarity in water. Love them. --Lorrie, San Antonio, Tx",

I LOVE swimming and the workout it gives me, but I HAD to find a solution to my boredom. These earphones are GREAT, with great sound and comfort.

The Hydro Active Waterproof Headphones does not have this charging problem. Additionally, the overall sound is much clearer. It also gives a better base sound. Moreover, when swimming the sound is equal if your head is underwater or lifts up from the water. This is another advantage that it has over the Finis Duo.

      "text": "I've tried several of the cheaper headphones and lived to regret it. I've learned that sometimes, you get what you pay for! These aren't perfect 100 % of the time but they are pretty darn close. I've noticed that when I do flip turns the sound becomes muffled, however, as soon as I get to the surface, the sound returns. I'm a long distance swimmer so I really appreciate that I don't have to stop frequently to adjust or squeeze water out. If you are on the fence at all, learn from mistakes and just get these. It will save you a lot of heartache and frustration.",
