      "text": "We use Bosch and Dewalt lasers but needed an extra as the office was always fighting over them. Both previously mentioned lasers work great but cost considerably more. I decided to take a chance on the Tacklife since it was only to be used as an extra but was very pleasantly surprised by its quality and accuracy. It's easy to use and works perfectly at a very attractive price when compared to its competition. The only reason I elected to give 4 stars instead of 5 is because the numbers are a bit small compared to others. Luckily my vision is still good but I imagine it could be hard to read otherwise.",

The results were within 1/16 of an inch, and that was to textured wallboard. The texture varied that much! This thing is accurate. The zero baseline can be adjusted to coincide with the top OR bottom surface, allowing for inside and outside measurements. Displayed units can be changed from metric to the actually useful units of feet, inches, and fractions of inches. Their new puppy loved to chase the laser, so be careful around animals.",

If you wish to take outside measurements, don't get this unit, get a true rangefinder. For inside work I'd give it a 5 star, for outside work a 1 star, so the 3 star is an average of the two. I'll keep the unit just for inside measurements and not have the hassle of returning.",

You can use either end of the Tacklife as the zero reference point, which makes it nice for all different applications. A very handy and useful addition to your toolbox.",

I am older and reading the fractional inches, like 1/16 or 7/16 was difficult for me. I had to use a magnifying glass to tell the difference.

Slightly smaller than the size of two iPhone 5s stacked on top of each, feels like a sold build for infrequent use. I don't think it would hold up using it daily in a construction area, but office/IT staff, this might also work well for. Tip ... the lower left black button w/ the \"U\" on it ... long, slow press to change units. (depress and hold for about a second - so about 2-3 times longer than the typical key press. )",
