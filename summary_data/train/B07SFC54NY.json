It came in the original Apple box, and it looked like I just bought it from the Apple store! The battery life goes a little fast, but the speakers are very loud for such a small device.

My only gripe is I really like the fingerprint touch for getting into my iPad and iPhone. I wish this latest generation iPod had that feature.",

It was frustrating to have to manage play lists and routinely change the i-pod's contents only to wish we still had songs we just removed. This i-pod holds our entire library - over 400 CDs - and half the chip is still open. The interface is familiar and easy. We love it.",

I got a case for it as it is pretty slippery otherwise. So far so good.",

It's just a big rip off and it was more than likely made by forced child labor in Apple's foxcon assembly plant in China.",

That didn\u2019t work. Basically now re-install everything. What a waste of money and not even Apple knows why. Completely frustrated at this point.",

Only hours after receiving it, it was knocked off a short coffee table and fell onto the carpet where the screen completely shattered. I'm assuming the chipped screen weakened it allowing it to shatter, beyond disappointed.",

After another month or so passed, the screen was on the grey and white stripes almost constantly and the device was not usable at all. Unfortunately, there is no way to get it fixed and we have a useless iPod. Very disappointed!",
