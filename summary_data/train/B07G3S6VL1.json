Since the return period had expired, I had to purchase another jump house for my grandson who has autism and loves to use this as a safe, fun way to get rid of excess energy. . Thankfully, after my previous review, the seller refunded my money for the second jump house and my grandson is over the moon happy. This shows the seller stands behind his product and has great customer service. I will buy from and refer others to buy from this seller. Thank you, you have made myself and my grandson extremely happy!",
