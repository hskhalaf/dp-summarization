It's solid, sturdy, doesn't feel cheap, feels great in my hands, great weight balance, meaning, it's not super light or too heavy, and it's very reliably sharp. It's also super easy to clean once you twist it open to 90 degrees, and can clean each section individually. For anyone that states that this scissors come apart too easily, I can't imagine what you're doing to have this happen - never even got close to coming apart unless if I wanted to.

Blades are sharp, they feel good in my hand and also feel decently constructed. Even though they are come apart scissors, they haven't come apart except when I've wanted them to (no separating at inconvenient times) and the bottle/cap opener is very handy.

    "description": "Wusthof come-a-part kitchen shears. These Wusthof come-a-part kitchen shears are good for snipping flowers, strings, cloth or herbs. The come-a-part mechanism lets you clean these scissors easily and quickly. It also prevents bacteria or rust from developing between the two halves. Standard features: Wusthof come-a-part kitchen shears length: 8\"; precision forged high carbon stainless steel has a bone notch synthetic handle; hand wash; lifetime Wusthof warranty against material and manufacturing defects, with normal use and proper care; Model#: 5558-1 240613\n\nAMAZON.COM\nThese powerful 8-inch kitchen shears cut food, flowers, paper, cardboard, even carpet. They're balanced in the hand and work equally well for right-handers and left-handers. Blades formed from high-carbon stainless steel curve inward so they meet in only one place at any given position and cutting action is smooth and exact. One blade's serrations prevent slippage. A plastic cap on the screw securing the blades can be lifted so the shears can be taken apart for resharpening. Steel-tooth insets in the rugged synthetic handles twist open bottle and jar caps. The shears are dishwasher-safe, but hand washing better protects the blade edges. --Fred Brack",
