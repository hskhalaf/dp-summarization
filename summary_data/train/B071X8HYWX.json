I do think the flag will eventually break, so I will keep my eyes out for replacement sticks. The flag is useful for determining wind strength and direction. It definitely does not catch discs as well as a standard basket, but since this is most likely going to be used for fun and practice I don't see that being much of an issue. You know when it would have stayed in the basket anyway, and you still get a nice \"ching\" when you hit the chains.",

Other reviews mentioned this lacking in chains but I've not noticed any issues with discs sticking to the basket. Is this really portable? It sure is, takes 5 minutes (1-2 after you get the hang of it) to assemble/disassemble. Push pins and screws with knobs are all it takes. The only issue here is there is no bag/carrying case (more expensive models have this). Does this feel durable? Durable enough! If the push pins fail I imagine i will have to work the tension screw knobs into overtime, but really it's a great buy.",

The best part (for me) is the design of the chains. The chains are rather lightweight, however the netting design catches discs very well - eliminating the need for a second inner row of chains. While this design may not be PDGA approved it is been a great addition to my private course and functions at least as well as the Discraft Chainstart Lite 24 chain baskets that I have on the rest of the course at less than half the price.",

Some of my close puts would go straight through the chains, I feel they should be slightly heavier chains, and I may buy some from a hardware store. All in all it was worth every penny.

It is very cheaply made, the pieces fit very loose and the basket moves a lot when you putt into it. The locking pins get caught in the set screw holes and fall out. You have to spend 5 minutes trying to get them back in. The metal is very thin and bends easily. There were a few bends in the metal upon arrival. Overall, if you're serious about disc gold and plan to practice on this thing, I would steer clear.",

The price point is surprisingly low compared to the other practice baskets out there, but after several days and a few hours of throwing discs at it, I am completely satisfied with this basket.

This is obviously not a Mach x or anything like that but it runs the correct dimensions and is so damn cheap that there is no excuse not to practice putting. Yes the chains are not that great but spend a few bucks at the local hardware store on thicker chains for the middle and it will be damn great. I order it in New York, during the Covid 19 for practice while in quarantine and it got there in 24 hours! I don't know how but it did. Amazing product for the price.",

My package came without the screws so I contacted the seller and they shipped a replacement promptly. It can stand on its own without the screws but it is hard to carry around that way.",

We are really enjoying it and the price couldn\u2019t be beat.",

It missed catching a few that would have been caught with some of the heavy duty baskets. Overall, definitely recommend.",
