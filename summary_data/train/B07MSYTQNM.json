If you do outdoor sports I don't advice you to buy it because it will be difficult to read. 3) Display on, it stays 2-3 sec only then it goes off.

The charger for Inspire II is NOTHING like the Alta HR and is a super challenge to get it to stay on the tracker long enough to charge it. The Alta HR can accept replacement bands (metal, mesh) and they just pop on and off. With the inspire you have to take pins out and replace the band and then the pins. Very cumbersome. Yes, the Inspire II is about half the cost, but it's not worth $80!",

But the real issue, the cable is so short its virtually useless It is like 5\u201d and magnetic so I end up putting the Fitbit on a box to raise it near my laptop or USB charger or an outlet.",
