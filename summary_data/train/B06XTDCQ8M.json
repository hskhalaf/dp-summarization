The headlights are a really nice touch too. It's fairly quiet and doesn't upset our two dogs the way some other appliances do. It's very light in my hand and so much easier to use to clean my wood floors vs the older big traditional vacuum (although I think for carpeted rooms you may still want to have a bigger unit on hand). It charges quickly and has lights to let you know how much battery is left.",

However the flat, non-powered head will pick it up. Yes the button is hard to push, but my issue is that you can't locate it most of the time without looking for it.

It can't even properly vacuum up dust bunnies with the bristle attachment after a full charge with cleaned filters. It's like 4 days past the return window on amazon and now I'm stuck with this overpriced junk.",

      "text": "If you think you can use this vacuum to clean under a bed or all the way under furniture, forget it! If you push the vacuum all the way under a bed, the brush head part does not remain flat. It is elevated off the ground and is therefore not able to clean in a fully extended position. That is the main reason I purchased this vacuum. If you intend to vacuum under furniture, keep looking. This is not the vacuum for you. Description is totally misleading. I attempted to turn the vacuum nozzle in all directions, but no matter what I did it didn\u2019t stay flat enough to pick up dirt under furniture. I returned it to Amazon today!",
