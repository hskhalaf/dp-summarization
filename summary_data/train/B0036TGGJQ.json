Sometimes it will only take the first sheet sometimes none at all. The scanner function will sometimes scan all of the document. Sometimes it won't. Sometimes the scan will be readable, sometimes it is not. Sometimes it will scan all of the text on a page sometimes it won't. Will scan black on a page but not blue. After all this time you would think that HP could get this right. We are a small business and the scan function is key for us. I guess it deserves one star because it does print.",

A couple things that made it challening: 1) if you printed more than 5 pages, the printer got very steamy and the pages would curl 2) the scanner feeder would pick up more than one page at a time often 3) the software for the scanner would make the scans GIANT (even black and white) so I had to spend a lot of time editing them.

My old LaserJet 1012 had a manual feed on top of the main paper tray, I really wish this had that.",

I did find the written instructions pretty vague and the instructions for scanning were not to be found in the printed directions. Once I found them on the CD which said to find a directory and click an icon, I could not get the printer to scan. By sheer luck I found an oddly named file which I clicked on and that finally launched the scanning application. Scanning is a little on the slow side compared to the Lexmark it replaced. All in all, I'm happy with this printer.",

Unfortunately most new models come with starter laser cartridge which isn't like normal or full size one. Regardless you'll save more $$ using laser vs. ink/jet cartridges.",
