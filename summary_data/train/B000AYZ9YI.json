Could just replace laces but decided to take advantage of my work's shoe policy. I switch becase the my old Timberland Pro didn't provide the traction (indoor manufacturing) and the arch location seemed odd. The switch fixed both issues.",

To add to all of the above, these are really good-looking boots.

One of those thin spots were located on some stitching near the heel, and tore through after a month.

It is virtually impossible to get your finger in there to pull the rolled material back, and it hurts because it creates a ridge. Poor design for an otherwise seemingly well-built boot.

The wearer uses them for work at a factory, he reports them to be much heavier on his feet and stiff at the back of the ankle. Once broke in a bit he expects them to last much longer than any of the $50 pairs of cheapo boots...... As long as he can keep the bums from walking off the street into the break room & stealing this pair, he should be good.",
