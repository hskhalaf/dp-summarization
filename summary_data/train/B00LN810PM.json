There are always at least four or five in my fridge at any given time. Thanks for a GREAT product!!",

They look brand new each time they come out of the dishwasher - no waxy feel, no stains, no odors, no lids that have disappeared (I hate plastic). The only negative - someone with painful joint problems (fingers, wrists) may have trouble locking/unlocking the lids. If so, check them out in a store before buying on line.",

The only downside is they weight more than regular containers and they're sometimes difficult to snap close, but overall I like them because the glass is thick and they won't break easily-they've fallen a few times into flat surfaces. They work great in the oven too and they are dishwasher and oven friendly. I don't wash the lids in the dishwasher because they are plastic, and I don't like to mix hot stuff and plastic, but its a durable type of plastic. I've had these since November of 2016.

Liked them so much that I bough this new pack. I think the quality has improved. This is a very nice set and I certainly recommend it. [I would suggest microwaving only the glass lower dish and leaving the lid outside the microwave. That's just me, but I did get a very long life (and still continuing) with my first set. I've had no problems dish washing these.]",

I have a feeling the newer version of the lids may not be as sturdy as when they first came out. Either way, I've had one set for over a year and the second set for months now with no issues. You can place liquid in them, lock it, and turn it upside down with no liquid coming out. I highly recommend.",

BPA is only the tip of the iceberg IMHO. A good range of sizes, can freeze meals for 1 - 3 people in one container depending on which you choose. 4 stars because the lids (plastic, I know, but I only put the lid on when the food is cold already) do wear out over time - (admittedly a long time). Would be nice if you could just buy the lids... Would give 4.5 stars if that was an option.",
