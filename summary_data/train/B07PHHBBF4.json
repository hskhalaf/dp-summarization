Colour is very stylish (dark blue) and can be dressed up or down. I took them to a 4 day trip as soon as it arrived, wore it 4 days and it didn't change shape or became soggy... or loose! Also, important to know is that these jeans does make your stomach in 2 balloons, rather nice all in fit without looking old fashion. I will buy all colours there are!",

I love the waist line - it is not low rise and can hide some rolls of love handles out of site. It also has a \"lifting\" effect on the butt area which is a plus!!! Fit is perfect, color is perfect for slimmed down look.",

The stitching is already starting to fray, the tag on left at waist is totally a different quality also. I'm convinced that one of my two pairs I ordered, is definitely not an authentic Levi's brand jeans. Super disappointing",

I wore a pair on a long flight a few days ago and they were comfortable, the amount of stretch is perfect. Indigo canvas is a great wash, not too dark, not too light, very nice denim.",

The waist is not as cinched as two of the other styles I tried, which allows me to get a smaller size that will fit my legs and booty better without squishing my belly and suffocating me. The rise is perfect to hold in my belly without being too high. I am 5'2\", 126 lbs, carry my weight in my belly and have a mom belly shape due to having a child, skinny legs, and barely any booty for reference.",

This pair is exactly what I expected! It\u2019s a replacement of a favorite pair that worn out. Fits great, color is what I wanted. I got them on amazon for a good price. I wear mostly shaping straight, but really like this exact color. So tried the skinny and really liked them! I prefer Levi\u2019s with 81% cotton like this one, and glad that they at least give me one to choose!",

The butt and thigh areas don't have as much room as I would hope. It's fairly flattering, but does squish the booty a bit. Going up one size might help?

I don't know if it is formaldehyde or moth balls or...what? I have washed multiple times, soaked in vinegar - all the tricks I can find and yet they still stink. Which make me worried if I ever wear on a date and instead of smelling sexy, I smell like a morgue. I honestly would buy more if they didn't stink so bad.",

I have an athletic build - large thighs and rear but a smaller waist. Usually, if jeans fit me in the waist, they are too tight everywhere else. If they fit everywhere else, they are too loose in the waist. These are perfect!!! The stretchy materials forms to my curves. The wash is beautiful - Wallflower is a just-right shade of light blue without being too light or too dark. I'm buying more of these!",
