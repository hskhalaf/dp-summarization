      "text": "This bed shipped fast. It arrived a head of schedule, in a damaged box. However, it was in great condition, complete and very well packed. It is a two person job to put it together, but it a pretty simple process. Its sturdy and looks nice. I actually have two of these, one dark, one light. One is just the bed (purchased here), the other is all the add on's (purchased second hand). My kids love it, they like to have a cave to hang out in. It is wood, no MDF or plywood. Its not a hard oak, but it is much better quality captain or loft bed then I was able to find in my area",

It's very spacious, fit my 6 and 4 year olds comfortably together when they wanted to do a \"sleepover\" on it. I would definitely recommend it!",

      "text": "We ordered this bed for my daughter when we moved. The ceilings were low so we couldn't have a standard loft, and it's an old house so it's a small room. This is perfect because it is an efficient use of the space. She loves the little play area under neath the bed; she's created a little fort under there with simple fabric from the store. The bed is nice and sturdy, we didn't even anchor it to the wall. It was a quick 1/2 hour setup with 2 pair of mechanically inclined hands. For those less inclined, I would estimate about an hour start to finish. Bottom line, great bed for the price.",
