There are a lot of videos about this and people as well as verified gym instructors say it is useful for muscle building. One does feel a bit different and I would say a bit more sharp and hungrier when using the supplement. The overall make and quality of the nitric oxide dosage is great and would recommend to anyone who is looking to get their muscle improved through the nitric oxide boosting.",
