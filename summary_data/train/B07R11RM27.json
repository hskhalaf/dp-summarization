This model was a standout for wearers because of its superb comfort, support and stylish colors. However, it does come with some flaws like strap adjustment issues and extended break-in period. Overall, this Chaco product delivers a promising performance, but only after it has been broken in.",

      "text": "I own classic Chocos as well, but the Zvolv sport are my favorite. They fit to the contours of my foot best, with a deep heal for heal and arch support. I use them for adventure exploring in Hawaii. I am a private adventure guide in Maui, so the Zvolv's are fantastic for hiking in and out of streams, rock hopping, jumping waterfalls, I even keep them on when swimming in waterfall pools. The straps are very strong, adjustable, and the soles are flexible and sturdy. This is my second pair of ZVolv's because I lost my first pair after a year. So, I've had a lot of experience with these already.",

I do not typically have to wear wide shoes but I found the woman\u2019s chacos to be a bit narrow so I used Amazon Wardrobe and had a few of the men\u2019s chacos sent to me. It was awesome to be able to try on many choices and then send back what I didn\u2019t want without it costing me anything. I wear a woman\u2019s 11 but men\u2019s 10 fit just right.",

      "text": "I had had a pair of original Chacos that had lasted me for years until our most recent puppy found them when I forgot to put them away. Hence the new pair. They are absolutely as comfortable as my prior pair, but the soles aren't as thick and the tread isn't the hiking-shoe design as was my old pair. Regardless, they still perform quite well on semi-gravely hikes, but I wouldn't wear them on more difficult hikes like I did my last pair. Still, I would recommend them definitely for casual and easy hiking wear.",

Had to return them :( The lighter sole on these is nice but surprisingly doesn't really offer any more cushion or softness over the classics.
