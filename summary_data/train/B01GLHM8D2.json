It will give you 20-40 seconds of warm wash water then hot air to dry. It can even be put on an RV toilet as it is independent of the flush system.",

This was not the case. After removing and replacing twice, the leak was still there, and I had to remove it permanently.",

I've never used a bidet but I'm sold on the cleanliness and decreased toilet paper use. This model also has a drying unit but it takes a while so I suggest you blot dry first for best results. Installation instructions were not complicated but I had my plumber install the unit because I wanted it in quickly and accurately.",

It would a nice fix, to see the manufacturer install a small plastic lip onto the bottom of the bidet seat, which covers and extends past the actual toilet bowl... To keep the water from getting through the gap between seat and toilet bowl.",
