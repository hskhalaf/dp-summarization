Otherwise, it's not effective for spaces of your face outside of those. 2) The light is not very bright. 3) To turn on the light you need to open the clamshell in 2 places, which is not necessarily easy to do, and I don't know why they wouldn't just make the light switch accessible on the outside.

      "text": "Bought this for myself as a travel mirror. I absolutely love it! I took it to a family reunion and both my sisters and mother liked it so much that I bought it for them. I then decided to buy it for my daughter and my husband because they kept stealing mine on the trip. They will be getting theirs as Christmas gifts stocking stuffers. Learning how to open it is a bit tricky at first. But once you know how, it\u2019s a breeze. Highly recommend",
