It's simple to use and requires little to no user input. I don't wear it on my wrist so at night I put it on my wrist to track sleep which requires making a change in the app to let it know it's now on the wrist. The E-ink screen is fantastic and simple. The Go is durable almost as simple as set and forget. The one feature it does not have I wish it did is a silent alarm. Overall, fantastic product.",

On one occasion I manually counted 1000 steps, the Go recorded 832 while clipped to my pocket. Too much of a difference in my opinion. Three stars for the simplicity of the device and app design despite the inaccurate step tracking. Again, this is only my experience, but something to keep in mind. The Fitbit One, on the other hand, was usually within 2-3% from my Iphone for daily totals during the week and measured 1011 while manually counting 1000 steps.",

The clip itself is somewhat fragile, so the wristband is the more durable choice. However, Withings customer service is outstanding when it comes to replacing a broken clip. And the Withings platform is the equal of any when it comes to measuring your stats. With scales and a blood pressure monitor on offer, Withings is obviously focused on your health. The Withings Go is highly recommended.",

I liked the price of this, its waterproofness, and the ability to switch it from wrist to pocket (I walk a lot pushing a stroller). It is a bit clunky, and kind of stingy counting steps compared to the Fitbit, and Nokia\u2019s app is much more basic than Fitbit\u2019s, but given the price point, this all seemed reasonable. However, it died after 10 months of use. I thought it was just the battery, but replacing the battery did nothing.

I have had a Fitbit and enjoyed it so I was very excited when Withings had the Go. The swimming feature and the price helped also. The swim feature worked well. The sleep feature did not. It kept saying I took a nap when I did not. I went to a movie and it thought I was taking a nap. The step feature was always much less than my phone showed. With all of that said I believe Withings will figure out the bugs and make the changes necessary.",
