Indeed, the sandal has comfort in spades, but what further promotes it to must-buy status comes from its accommodating wide fit. There is, unfortunately, just one pebble in this footwear that possibly many people will not at all appreciate\u2014its uninspiring lacing system. All in all, the New Balance Appalachian (despite the challenge it poses during lace-ups) is still leaps and bounds a remarkable hiking sandal, thanks to its compelling combination of outdoor-centric qualities.",

Enough room to put in a gel insert, which is needed and I will do.Look good, feel ok.
