My only complaint is that a few of the sea animal puppets don't have deep enough finger holes so they fall of easier than my toddler would like. Overall these are quality made puppets and will hold up well.",

I would definitely purchase for this purpose again.",

You can add another yarn in a different color like I did (pink) or cut it off either way the cow looks cute. My 2yo niece Got these for her birthday last month and she loves to play with them.
