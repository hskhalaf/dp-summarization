They feel great, lightweight and fairly well constructed, although I probably wouldn't toss them across the room, but they are solid. Sound is very crisp but they could be a little louder. Some songs from my phone seem to have a higher volume than others but the quality is just as promised. Overall a very good deal.!!! I would certainly recommend them. Good value and so far good product. Does exactly what is says. And as usual fast free Prime shipping!!",

Bad parts are: don't bend over or they fall off (no sticky headband material), headband is plastic and looks like it will easily break, ear \"cups\" are low quality plastic foam, no song fwd/bkwd button, frequent Bluetooth drop-outs when playing music when the phone is a mere 2 feet away.",

Sure! Who wouldn't? At 10% of the cost I'll settle for a little less and still get great value. The Sound Blaster Jams are easy to pair with iOS and Windows 10 (haven't used with other OSs) and phone calls are crystal clear on both ends. At least no one has complained when during phone conversations. Bottom line, I enjoy these headphones and have zero complaints.",

If you do need Chromebook support I have found that Amazon Basic's devices seem compatible.",

The battery life is great, they are indestructible, and the bluetooth is reliable and easy to pair.",

It's adequate for bedtime TV viewing when I want a break from my heavy around-the-ears headphones (with much better audio quality). As other reviewers have stated, the headband is on the smaller side, the volume is unexpectedly low, and the foam ear pads can become a bit uncomfortable after a while. It seems to take much longer to charge than any of my other headphones and ear buds.",

Battery life is phenomenal. I tried many pairs of in-ear and on-ear Bluetooth headphones. Most are very uncomfortable for me or just fall out regularly while at the gym. These stay put very well and are quite comfortable. I've read others say they have fallen asleep while wearing them - i call BS. I have a very narrow head and they still apply generous amounts of pressure. No way i'd forget i was wearing them, but I can go a few hours without major 'headphone fatigue'.",

Its a decent buy, the price may not justify the actual product though, but if you need a simple bluetooth earphone this will work",

Charge lasts a few days with apprx 3 hours on skype in the morning and the same at night watching stuff. However it does give off a good amount of sound to others since there is not much isolation from the sponges and does not pair with a second device even though it is BT 4.1.",

I have had these for 9 months and they work just as well as the day I bought them.",
