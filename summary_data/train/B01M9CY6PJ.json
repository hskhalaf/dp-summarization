I have to keep a mug there as I have it set to auto turn off and if I don\u2019t the water just fills up the base. But that\u2019s my only complaint! It\u2019 makes some of the best coffee I\u2019ve ever had!",

Not too happy with grinder hopper, either, as I have to \"help\" the beans into the grinder ever so often. (And it is not because the beans are too oily.) As far as blending power, I have not idea what that means.",

My husband drinks espresso and I like americano, so I choose the long pull. I do recommend to use the dry beans, not too oily, so that they easily fall into the grinder. We found an amazing coffee roasting company close to us and always buy their espresso blend (the beans are dry and not oily). It tastes amazing! (People who think that the oily beans are the best clearly are mistaken. The coffee flavour depends on so many things and oiliness has nothing to do with this). Overwall great machine!",

I just use the plastic scoop to make sure they are going in correctly, and it's fine. Without doing so, the grinder spins up without pulling in beans which results in watery coffee. I love everything else about this machine! Makes a truly excellent cup of coffee. Steams a mean pitcher of milk. Rinses and repeats as needed.",

Takes a lot of water purging the system. With the poor service that De'Longhi offers is better to avoid complicated machines. The extended warranty is ver expensive. Don't buy a problem.
