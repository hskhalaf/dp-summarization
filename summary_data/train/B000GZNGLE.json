I finally broke down and sprung for this stuff after reading tons of reviews, EWG's reports, and scouring the internet to try to find sunscreen that wouldn't sicken me. This is it. Like many of these sunscreens, this can be a bit challenging to rub in and, if your kid squirms, may leave a greasy or chalky sheen. Such is life with no ozone layer. This keeps her unburned and the odor, while detectable during application, fades quickly. Glad I finally found it and I won't stray.",
