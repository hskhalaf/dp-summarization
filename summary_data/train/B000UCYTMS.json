Will never buy a pair of shoes on-line again because if I'd seen what cheap clunky plastic crap they are, I'd never have wasted my money on them. I guess they're ok for going out to get the mail which is the only place I'd ever be caught dead wearing them--actually I'm embarrassed to wear them then, too, but if I walk quickly enough no one usually sees me. Of course, walking quickly is not recommended because they will fly off. Let's face it: they're worthless. Have had other Skechers shoes and really liked them; but, these are junk.",

So I buy 3 pairs of these shoes this time just to plan ahead... and as of today 2 of the soles from 2 different pair have given out. I was about to return them but just realized that you only have 30 days to return. Missed it by less than 2 weeks. I don't have high hopes for my 3rd pair either. I now know that the product has become lower quality and I will not be getting anymore Sketchers in the future.",

Croc non slip soles are layered on and detached fairly quickly, whereas Sketchers are an integral part of the shoes and will not detach. These are also a pure clog.
