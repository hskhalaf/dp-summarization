      "text": "works well for watering closely spaced arrangements of various plants. Just snake the hose back and forth through the plants so each gets some watering inside the drip line. The hose leaks slowly at full water flow from the faucet so the water get absorbed directly into the ground without running off. The hose can be twisted with no kinking so the water continues regardless of the way you snake across a bed. The hose is perfect for watering those plantings for which a sprinkler cannot be efficiently configured to water just the plants and not surrounding areas that you do not want to water.",

The water still gets beyond the leaks, but a lot of water comes out at certain places. Without the leaks, and used straight, it's probably fine.",

I use with a shutoff valve accessory which lets me set the amount of drippage I prefer for around my house. Dripping even varies depending on whether the seam or the round edge is down. I like that it allows you to twist the hose below the attachment end to avoid kinks. Haven't tried burying it under mulch this year, but I don't anticipate difficulty next. I will of course take them up during the freezing weather.",

      "text": "I have used soaker hoses for years since they are so much more efficient. I needed new ones and tried these. They are wonderful! So much easier to use and a better quality. And even more efficient since I don't have lots of miscellaneous spray coming out of them. Plus I don't feel like I have to wrestle with them to get them in place. So glad to find them.",
