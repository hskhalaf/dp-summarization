I went onto the website to see about warranty service and, to my dismay, while there is a 5 year \"warranty,\" it will cost you $40 to file a warranty claim - which is essentially the cost of a new suitcase. So, really, the bags are low quality and the warranty is more of an illusion than anything. You can buy a new bag or pay $40 for the \"warranty\" to replace it - it leads to the same result.",

The boss for the screw and thread engagement is insufficient. In the picture the screw is still exposed where it came out of the handle. What can't be seen in the picture is the case itself is separating where the handle should be secured, which indicates the case material is too thin. I'm disappointed I let me daughter down, but will return it asap and get luggage with handles that are properly designed/secured.",

      "text": "The suitcases are great and easily fit into each other for storage and quite scratch resistant. Problem encountered was with the TSA locks that might be faulty as they seem to scramble or jam the combination. I use the same 3-digit codes for ease of recall. First time one wouldn\u2019t unlock, it took days of trying before it opened with one digit change by one number! Second time the lock jammed, and changing the digits by one didn\u2019t help. In the process, the zipper got damaged, and the claim process proved too onerous. Have always loved Rockland suitcases but will in future buy my own TSA Locks.",

      "text": "I purchased this stylish, lightweight luggage (carry on for my son and my husband the larger size) for my five year old son. He was delighted and absolutely loved the bold color. However, my husband kept warning him that it most likely would get damaged after passing through baggage claim. He warned him that it may come around the conveyor belt with a missing wheel or seriously scratched up. Fortunately, it survived. It did have a marking or two but for the most part it definitely held up. Great workmanship and very spacious. He enjoyed packing and unpacking his clothes. Carry on is perfect for your average 3-11 year old child.",
