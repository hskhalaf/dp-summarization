I wish it came with a couple more straight sections as I was only able to pull down about 5-6 ft. of snow from the roof while standing on the ground. Once I use it a few more times I will try to update this review but so far I am not disappointed.",

Since this is when I'm likely to use it that's not a good thing. The rake itself works fine. With all 3 sections in place it is rather unwieldy and takes some height and strength to use. As a 115 pound woman it works for me as is without extensions attached. Wish the extensions were shorter, i.e. 4 instead of 3 to achieve the same reach. The most beneficial thing about the rake is that it can be used from the ground around the first floor eaves.",

That being said, the design feature which is important is that the stabilizing brackets are at the top of the blade versus the bottom. This allows the snow to fall freely from the blade when pulled over the edge of the roof instead of the snow being trapped by the stabilizing blades when on the bottom and making the rake heavy and the snow difficult to dislodge. Overall, a productive and useful tool. A taller blade would make it more so.",

Just charge me a reasonable $10-$15 so I can get this fully or mostly assembled and not have to waste my time, or create a video with a step by step tutorial that makes everything clear. Even so, there was one bolt that would *just not go in*. So much time is wasted with assemblage of products, and customers really need to hold these companies accountable.",

      "text": "After comparing the Garant roof rake to others that appeared more sophisticated (some with cutting wires, some that \"shaved\" the snow, etc.), I decided to go with this one. Since receiving it, I've removed both deep, dry snow and heavy, wet snow with great success. The Garant is light weight but sturdy and the scoop of the rake seems just the right size and set at a perfect angle. It may be that some of the other much more expensive devices might be better for very set-up, crusty snow, but for typical use here in Idaho, I'm more than content with this product.",

Everytime I went to the local home improvement center, they said they had just sold out, it was on back order or \"they're waitnig for the truck\". What a blessing to find it online. It was worth the extra bucks to expedite the shipping. At once I had, it was a great relief to have that weight off my roof.",
