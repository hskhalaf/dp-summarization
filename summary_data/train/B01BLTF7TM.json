I barely had any on the brush and my contour came out looking like I had mud on my face, lol! So use just a TINY bit when first applying it! It's real Tarte and AWESOME!",

All of the eye shadows are beautiful, however two of the bronzers are a little too dark for me right now, but will probably get used closer to the summer time. The big mirror in the palette is perfect for traveling. This palette is perfect for short vacations, as it provides 3 different natural shadow looks, and 3 different bronzers/contour colors.",
