      "text": "I got this after trying a different Rachel Ray dog food that had corn. My dog liked it but his stools seemed too soft. I got this thinking maybe he has a corn allergy. His stools are normal now so I think the corn was the problem. He likes this food but doesn't love it (but is also not a super food oriented dog) and doesn't always finish his bowl. Overall I think this is a good affordable dog food and I will buy it again",

The price is affordable (unlike those other pet store brands) and it really helped with his allergies. He's licking and biting and his paws much less and seems to really like the food (he is a pug though, so he likes any food!). We've been using the food for about a year now and are pleased with the results.",
