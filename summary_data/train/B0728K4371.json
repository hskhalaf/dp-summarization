      "text": "It is very easy to setup and use. You step on, line up with the indicators on the screen, and wait until the flashing of the weight finishes and you are done. I usually step off immediately after the weight reading and check the app right after for the BMI changes. I also use a withings watch so all the data flow in the same across all devices so at a glance I can see how I am doing. Overall it is very easy to use, doesn\u2019t need much recharging, and above all the tracking works great.",
