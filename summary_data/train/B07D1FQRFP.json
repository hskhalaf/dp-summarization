The sound is great, but could have slightly more oomph. We will consider getting a flat sound bar in the future. A great televison with lots of options to customize.",

No need to modify the picture any at all + The receiver I use (SONY) converted to this tv by itself !! Adjusted into a VERY sharp surround sound for my entertainment center. No need to adjust my receiver levels any either. One thing worth mentioning is that the screen is 44X24. Strong recommendation to get yourself one of these AWESOME TV'S",
