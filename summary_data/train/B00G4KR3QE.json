      "text": "We have had this coffee maker since March 1, 2019 when our old BonaVita coffee maker died. The coffee maker started to overflow and stop dripping into the carafe, and eventually overflowed onto the counter and the floor. I thought my husband did something wrong and then it started happening to me. It is the 26th of April. We have used the same type/grind of coffee for years. After reading some of the comments about the coffee maker, it is very sensitive to the grind of coffee used. I also bought a separate coffee carafe because it didn't keep the coffee hot enough. I feel we wasted $300+ on this coffee brewer.",

      "text": "I love this brewer. It brews (checking with a NSF digital thermometer) 198-205 Degrees F. When brewing into the supplied double wall 60oz. carafe, (room temperature) the temperature will drop to around 180 Degrees F. and hold that temp for about two hours before gradually falling. If you pre-heat the carafe and swap the brew lid for the travel plug (also a pourable plug) the temp will settle to 190 Degrees and hold for 5-6 hours minimum then slowly begin to fall. The brewer does feel cheap, however, because of the lightweight plastics and thin metal parts but what doesn't these days? I also had to reduce the recommended coffee amount by 40%to suit my taste.",

      "text": "Great Coffee Brewer! Purchased this after our OXO Barista Brain 12 Cup Coffee Maker stopped working (has been discontinued too). My only complaint, is that for large families with coffee drinkers like mine, there are occasions where not all of us are present in the morning, and it would be beneficial to have the water reservoir markings on this machine (when making less than a full pot). Since a smaller brewer does not suffice for larger families, etc., from a user standpoint, it doesn't make sense to me that this feature (water reservoir markings) were not included in the design. Recommend that Technivorm revisit this decision. Thank you. John Burgoyne",

Because it is considered to be customer damage (which I don't see) the warranty is said to not be applicable. I honestly don't need the aggravation or disrespect. Even if I get it fixed, I'll sell it and move on. I won't deal with a company that treats customers like this.",

My main issue is with the \u201cpause and pour\u201d function. Several times I have accidentally jiggled the tab which blocks the output which means you get a total mess. Since this machine heats the water to the correct 196 degrees it\u2019s literally a hot mess. I also wish that you didn\u2019t have to buy their filters but c\u2019est la vie. Great coffee is the bottom line and this delivers on that plus the turnaround from wishing to having coffee is quick. Just be very careful about that little metal tab.",

It also brews about 2x as fast as my old Mr Coffee. I'm VERY pleased with it. It feels very well made, worth the money. The frickin' power cord looks like a 220v cable, the whole thing is over built. My ONLY complaint is the lack of marks on the water tank so we had to experiment a little early on and then use a tiny amount of tape to mark our own.",

The ground holder is poorly designed in that it does not stop coffee from dripping after the brew. It uses a piece of metal to pinch against the drain to stop the coffee. You have to used the carafe every time, which is less ideal when making one cup. Is the plastic BPH free it seem very cheap versus other coffee machines? Again, best coffee but could use some improvement with materials and mixing chamber.",

It arrived in the original packaging with all the components. The packaging was obviously previously opened, but no problem. Great deal and what a coffee maker. Best ever.
