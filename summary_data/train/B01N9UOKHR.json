If you are sensitive to smells or have trouble breathing due to allergies, you will quickly notice. 2. It has a residue. The first two weeks of using this product my face swelled. In fact my skin continues to feel stiff using this product. I find it helps to shake vigorously and air out the mask before using it. I am going to buy my second box if I have any more skin reactions I will chalk this off as not for me. Great odor cancellation once you get past the mild suffocation and glue smell.",

It makes a huge difference. BEST MASK for bronchitis or any respotorial problem.",
