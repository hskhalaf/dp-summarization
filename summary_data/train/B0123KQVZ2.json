Not a deal breaker for me but something to conceder if you are not welling to do all of this.",

I knew I wanted a French press - maybe it's a Dexter thing. Maybe I just wanted to be different. My parents - lifetime coffee drinkers - are much more mainstream. Growing up it was a programmable automatic drip coffee maker and more recently a Keurig machine for the ultimate in convenience. Despite my incredibly busy lifestyle and a propensity towards tardiness",
