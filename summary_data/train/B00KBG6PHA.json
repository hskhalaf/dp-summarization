I was a bit concerned that it could fall of the walls due to constant exposure to moisture, but it holds surprisingly well. Just make sure that you apply heavy-duty glue when you put it on. I bought Rust-Oleum 69384 1-Quart Suregrip 122 Heavy Duty Clear Strippable Wallpaper Adhesive and it worked really well. I bought this wallpaper in ivory (in pictures) and forest silver brown. Both shades are really beautiful.",

I found a metallic silver and gold pen set at the hobby store that blended the rips I made (my own inexperience) quite nicely. After I got rolling, it went easier. No pattern to match so that was great. Can't see a seam ANYWHERE. If it was a little more resistant to tearing, I would have given it 5 stars. All things considered, I love this paper.",

Not the type of wallpaper that an amateur should try to hang. That said, the texture and weight of the paper actually helps to hide a lot of mistakes.

Painters tape will separate and remove the vinyl top layer, even when left on for minimal time. Recommendation: I changed to Frog Tape and did not have this issue. (If you don't have Frog tape, I experimented and found that pre-spraying with a clear sealer worked to prevent this, as well.)",
