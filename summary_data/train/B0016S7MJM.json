As for portion, it looks small at first. After I finished all the bowls, I am full. This set is for sure for women. If you want to get it for your boyfriend or husband, this might be too small. There are a lot of pieces to wash, if you don\u2019t mind doing dishes by hand. I can also squeeze a drink cup into the lunch bag. Hope everybody enjoy the lunch bag!",

      "text": "I debated for awhile before purchasing this item, but decided to go for it after receiving a Zojirushi thermos as a gift and being impressed by how well it kept hot drinks hot for hours and ice cubes frozen for hours as well. This is a beautifully designed bento and I get compliments on it every time I used it. The soup and main compartment stays hot, but the top compartment is basically at room temperature. The container sizes look small but are actually good for a very decently sized meal. Great for portion control and storing items separately for lunch.",

Portion sizes may be a little small for the average American but you can do a lot worse for the price. I only wish there were a side pocket for accessories and that the latch system was was a bit tougher and more precise. You do have some room in the bag for a few snacks etc. Overall I'm very pleased with the Ms. Bento set.",

Had I known this I probably wouldn't have ordered this product, but I'm glad I did. I have found different uses for it and it stands up to punishment, dishwasher and transit.",

Room-temp foods like rice and noodles are best for this section, but the top is where I like to keep my fruit and a bit of yogurt or dessert in the removable half-circle section.

Will probably use it cold and microwave at lunchtime instead of heating in the morning because even thought the canister is insulated, it doesn't keep it quite hot enough for me. This way everything will be cold and remain cold (better) together, rather than the cold stuff absorbing the heat from the hot stuff. Convenient Nicely made. Highly Recommended",

    "description": "Color:Stainless| Package Quantity:1\n\nZOJIRUSHI MS. BENTO STAINLESS VACUUM INSULATED LUNCH JAR\nLUNCH ON THE GO\nWhether in the office or on the go, you can take a healthier, tastier, more interesting lunch with you thanks to Zojirushi's Ms. Bento Stainless Lunch Jar. One of the most versatile lunch boxes you'll ever come across, the Ms. Bento lunch jar comes with three different containers that allow you to pack a multi-course lunch of both hot and cold items easily and securely. \n\nThe jar itself is made of stainless steel and is vacuum-insulated that houses three plastic containers with lids. The large soup bowl comes with gasket-sealed lid to prevent messy spills and is specially insulated to keep soup hot. All pieces should be washed by hand with non-abrasive cleaning pads. Inner bowls are microwave-safe. \n\nThe lunch jar lid also locks to hold all the inner containers. The Ms. Bento also comes with a convenient carry bag with a strap for easy transport. A forked spoon is included with its own protective cover.\n\nCapacity: Main Bowl 10oz, Side Bowl 11 oz, Soup Bowl 7 oz.\n\nDimensions: Container measures 10 by 6 by 6 inches.\n\nMS. BENTO FEATURES\n * Vacuum insulation keeps foods hot or cold for hours\n * Durable stainless steel construction with excellent heat retention\n * 3 microwaveable inner bowls\n * Washable nonstick coated outer container\n * Includes forked spoon with cover and easy to carry tote bag\n * BPA Free\n * 5 Year Warranty on Vacuum Insulationy\n\nGREAT FOR HOT OR COLD LUNCHES\nThe Ms. Bento is an excellent way to safely and conveniently pack lunch where microwave or refrigerator may not be available. The Ms. Bento allows you to compartmentalize your food and bring an entire meal, like a pasta dish, soup, salad and cookies in each separate bowl. You will appreciate the \u201cgreenness\u201d of packing a lunch in our lunch jars, instead of using a paper bag or disposable containers.\n\nHOW DOES IT KEEP FOOD HOT OR COLD?\nWith Zojirushi's renowned vacuum insulation technology, air between the two thin layers of stainless steel on the outer container is removed, creating a vacuum. Because there is no air, the temperature on the outside does not transfer into the container; keeping foods hot or cold for hours.\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\nSIDE BOWL\nThe Ms. Bento comes with an 11-ounce side bowl that sits inside the lid. It is ideal for foods that should be kept room temperature, such as chips, nuts or snacks. The side bowl is not insulated.\n\nMAIN BOWL\nThe 10-ounce main bowl is designed to hold the main course. The outer container's vacuum insulation and the insulated lid of the main bowl help keep foods hot or cold for hours without reheating or refrigeration.\n\nSOUP BOWL\nThe 7-ounce soup bowl has a unique lid that minimizes leaks and is ideal for holding soups, dips, or fruit cocktail. It sits at the bottom of the outer container, where vacuum insulation keeps the foods hot or cold for hours.\n\nFORKED SPOON\nNever worry about forgetting your utensils. The Ms. Bento also includes a forked spoon with its own protective cover.",
