      "verdict": "For hikers needing a kind of boot that has excellent comfort and ankle support, the Hedgehog Fastpack Mid GTX from The North Face has arrived. Their quest for something light, grippy, and waterproof need not continue either as the boot also possesses such qualities in great amounts. That being said, the gear might scare some people away with its allegedly deficient outsole. Overall, the Hedgehog Fastpack Mid GTX is a showstopper with all of its good points factored in. Prospective buyers just need to be extra careful with its outsole and not subject it to much abuse.",
      "pros": [
        "The Hedgehog Fastpack Mid GTX surpassed the expectations of numerous verified purchasers with its impressive level of comfort",

        "Many wearers couldn\u2019t help but commend the Hedgehog Fastpack Mid GTX for being reliably grippy",
        "More than a dozen reviewers expressed their appreciation of the boot\u2019s unshakable ankle support",
        "A moderate percentage of reports described the footgear\u2019s fit as one-to-one",
        "Several female hikers found the Hedgehog Fastpack Mid GTX stunningly cute",
        "Testers by the handful felt compelled to call the boot amazingly breathable"

Needs a little more arch support, which is not really a big deal as it\u2019s easy to find good half insoles with decent arch support around. Great ankle support for pronation. Fits wider feet perfectly. Will report back after wearing in rain etc. So far very pleased with the looks, quality and comfort.",

These boots needed no breaking in but I did remove the thin insole and in its place use a thicker foam sole. The boots had very good grip and appeared to be water proof , comfortable and light weight . 6 hours of Brecon Beacons and I can say these boots proved to be excellent.",

Unfortunately, this is not the case. Simply walking over damp grass results in wet socks. I thought they must be faulty, so I returned them, however the replacement pair are exactly the same. Apart from that, they are reasonably comfortable and very light.",
