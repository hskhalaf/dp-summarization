The buckles are nice and sturdy but I wish they had a snap behind them so you didn't have to buckle and unbuckle the bag to get in and out of it. This was you could access the bag a little easier and keep the look of the buckled bag if you don't want to buckle it. There are two snaps to hold the leather part down but they are higher up.",

I found this Otium bag, read the reviews and opted to buy this one after all my research on other bags. The bag arrived after only 2 days and I cannot say how pleased I am with it. It is a beautiful bag. A little on the smaller side but it does have a padded area if you happen to have a smaller lap top or notebook. But overall an excellent bag and excellent craftsmanship!",

      "text": "If there were a separate rating for aesthetics, I would give this bag five stars for it's beauty alone. Functionally however, the bag suffers due to it's loose magnetic buckles. The magnets on the buckles attach to rivets on the bag and make it so that you have the option of simply snapping the magnets in place to secure the bag or actually threading/unthreading the leather straps. The problem is that the magnetic buckles are loose and can easily fall off if you are not paying attention. I've had my bag for about three months now and have lost both buckles already. Needless to say, that's very disappointing.",

Got this to have one bag to keep all my electronics and their accessories handy in. Very pleased.",

Front snaps easy and work well keeping bag secure. For added security there are the belts. And for the price , this bag is outstanding value.
