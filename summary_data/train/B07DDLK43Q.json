You see it's a combination of digital and real (the software and the egg shaped casing). Until we have full blown VR the novelty will still be there. It's very ambitious when you think about it. They have simulated a living creature, and effectively. It moves by itself, responds, grows. What is the purpose of the game? What is the value of the egg shaped encasement? it's to appreciate it, it's happiness you guys.",

Overall, the product itself is great. It comes with an instruction manual on how to take care of the pet and how to play games with it and everything. But it's all very complicated depending on the age range. The 5-year old I purchased this for received it on Christmas, and now, a few days later, she doesn't even know where it is. Honestly, I played with it more than she did. It's a great gift, but for the right age range!",

The plastic tab was still in it and we had to pull it out to turn it on, but immediately after pressing the reset button, we got the low battery symbol. Luckily, we have an assortment of lithium batteries in my house from different gadgets and toys, so I was able to quickly replace it. I'm pretty disappointed in this seller for selling electronics with low batteries.",
