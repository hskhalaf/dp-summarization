      "text": "Great Hard Drive. I work in a very rough environment in the Offshore Dredging industry and my equipment is subject to vibration, dust, mud, rain, you name it. The built in cable is a plus because you know you dont have any chance of getting mud or dust introduced into the internal components. Some say its bulky, but its very stout. If you need a hard drive that will take a beating and come back for more, this is WELL worth the minimal investment. Don't buy junk because its $30 or $40 bucks cheaper. You will be glad you bought this. I've owned mine for over a year.",

I downloaded the EaseUS backup software (since the supplied software is terrible) and the one backup I successfully did mysteriously was deleted. Moreover, even after I unlock it, I cannot seem to be able to add a folder or really do anything with it. It is pointless developing a superior hardware product if you cannot successfully inform people how to use it. Even if you are an intermediate user, do not buy.",

The drive casing is a bit larger than expected; but with the promise of great protection from drops, spills, and other minor mishaps. 256 bit encryption with NFC security card included. Even after removing the very small amount of included software, the useable space on this drive is 1.81TB. Might not seem like a big deal. But that is a loss of nearly 200GB of drive space!!!",
