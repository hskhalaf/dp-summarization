I have checked the cushions of my couch and recovered $1.09, wiring in a blind junction box on hard to reach attic stud, and of course my ears, nose and throat. I don\u2019t expect the battery to last long, so I\u2019m running it off a li-ion battery charging pack. I will find as many DIY project uses for this as I have for the phone camera in the years to come... It really is an impressive piece of hardware. Well worth $36. My platform is iOS 12. Oh, most importantly: my wife approves... Thanks for reading.",

Also, the variable light intensity control is touchy. It's like a mechanical volume control on a small radio. For most of its range of movement, about 3/4, the intensity is low. Then in the final 1/4 it ramps up rapidly to maximum. It's not easy to get a \"middle\" light intensity. I guess this is just the design, and not a defect. In the next version I hope they improve this function.",
