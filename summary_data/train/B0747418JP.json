The Milliard Diplomat was easy to assemble and very lightweight considering the metal frame. My 90 year old mother-in-law spent the weekend with us and she loved it. She said it was the first time in years that she actually slept the ENTIRE night. She usually gets up often because of back pain or comfort issues. We are going to look into getting her a new mattress. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!",

I am very pleased and satisfied with my purchase. The frame was easy to assemble, it is sturdy, supportive, memory foam mattress (no springs!) very very nice. Thank you!",

I HIGHLY suggest getting a mattress topper, it makes a world of difference for comfort and I have been sleeping much better.
