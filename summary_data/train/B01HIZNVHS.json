My only con is that they're quite hard to pull away from the attachment & it seems like it takes them forever to cool off once shut off. Overall the product is good, curls are beautiful, & i would recommend them.",

The tension on the spring in the handle is too loose and hair won't stay clamped in place - it just slides right out when you start to twist the wand.

I can't separate a strand of hair for curling with a glove on my hand. How hard would it have been to put a tip on these wands...couldn't send it back fast enough.",

She isn't used to the heatless tip NOT being there and hasn't used the glove yet, she says it seems a bit of a hassle and she can learn to remember this isn't like the last curling iron she had. She enjoys the versatility of this and the results are very cute. I will say as the gift she was not sure what the box of shiny, long, varying-width objects were and a little surprised to be getting something like that!",

I also found that the locking mechanism that keeps the barrel in place will not unlock until the barrel has cooled down slightly. Very user friendly. The handle is the perfect size for your hand.
