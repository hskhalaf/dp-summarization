It works 10 times better than my Xbox one headset that cost me 100+ dollars while this one was around 20 dollars and has cool bright led lights. The sound and voice are great. Has a volume controller and mute button on the cable that are handy. VersionTech costumer service is excellent if you have any issue quick and responsive. Thank you!",

First the microphone is located on the left side only and isn't able to be moved. Secondly, the headset is one of the ones that lights up but it's powered through an extremely short USB plug. So on PS4, in order to use the lighted feature, you'd either need a USB extension or be sitting face to face with the system. It does function fine without the lights being used though, it just has an annoying dangling USB cord.",

Fairly light with well cushioned ear pieces. have not had occasion to use the mike but it folds up and out of the way and blends in with the blue black chrome design. Very nice looking almost futuristic. Has a long cord which I have not had to use while connected to my VR headset. The mike design is really neat almost 1/2 wide and 6\" long and curved.. A lot of thought has gone into the design of this headset.",

The earpieces go around both ears, and the sound quality is good. The only two things that I don't quite like about it are that I can't hear my voice coming through the headset, so I always feel like I have to raise my voice when playing with friends. And secondly, my brother told me my voice is a little quiet at times, when we play. Other than that, it's a solid headset, especially for the price.",

We did have some trouble with the mic at first, but it was user error (customer support is above par \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb). If you aren\u2019t tech savvy like myself and have trouble with getting the mic to work on a Nintendo Switch go into the settings on the game being played and turn the mic setting to \u201copen mic\u201d instead of \u201con\u201d and this will fix that issue!",

Listen to music on it and you will also notice a better difference as well. Sturdy construction, it has taken some abuse but still works fine. No complaints. The wire has taken the most abuse, and it holds still. Not saying you can pull it and such, but accidental twists and light yanks shouldn't hurt it - still have to care for it. Sound cancelation isn't as awesome as other higher end headsets, but this one does fairly well above average.",

I was so busy that I completely forgot about it and they kept emailing me for 6mo!

I've had them a few months now, they work perfectly, are comfortable and have excellent sound quality. This company is great. :)",

However, i found them extremely uncomfortable to wear for an long period of time. They have a mesh with small circles covering the ear piece that just rubs against your ears while on. My ears aren't even big so I was pretty annoyed. I had to shred cotton balls and put them over that mesh in order to wear them comfortably. Honestly now they are perfect. Hopefully in their new products they made this simple change to make it more comfortable for every. 6/10 recommend as is, 10/10 recommend with cotton ball ear muffs.",

The other issue is that, there is a light up option for the headphones, but because of the cable being short I usually have to be pretty close to the TV and my console to use it.",

      "text": "Really fast shipping. Product seems solid for the money. Son says they sound VERY good and he's no longer experiencing a sound lag he had with a prior mic. Says they are comfortable. One drawback is he connects through xBox One controller and so we would need a USB extension cable to the console or a micro converter to the controller in order to allow him to use the LED lights. No biggie, really, and at this point he says he doesn't care about ordering either and is just going with no lights. After looking more extensively through the reviews and product information, this tip is there, I just didn't see it before I ordered.",

We have not yet used it in a gaming capacity, but I intend to resolve that as soon as possible. Given the price point, I'm very satisfied with what we've received.",

It says they are KOTION EACH like my first pair but it says you need to buy a splicer so a little concerned i wont be able to play with them on my ps4 right away until i buy that piece. The only down side was the usb that makes them light up has to plugged into the console itself so you only have about 6ft of range",

Only complaint is that at times they can be a little too loud and the sound can leak out into the microphone, although this happened rarely and only on certain games (like Apex Legends and COD Modern Warfare).

      "text": "I've only had these for about a week but so far I'm very happy with this headset. While they're quite a bit bulkier than I anticipated, they're extremely comfortable and even when I wear my glasses, the earpieces do not push my glasses into the side of my head. My fellow glasses wearers know exactly what I'm talking about! The sound quality is excellent, too. I use these on my PS4 and do not have close access to the USB plug, so I haven't been able to really test out the lights to see how they look while gaming.",

Other than those issues, the mic works great and the sound is good for the price. Once I fixed the Jack and plug in issues I have been thoroughly happy.",
