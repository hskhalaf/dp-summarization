This tennis shoe really helps stabilize your feet and prevents your foot from turning in and out which in return affects your knees. I will continue to purchase this shoe as long as it is available. Also, years ago my chiropractor told me to purchase this brand of shoe but I did not listen. I should of bought this shoe year ago.",
