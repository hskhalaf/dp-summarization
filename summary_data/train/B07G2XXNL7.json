On the flipside, its lack of support and drawn-out break-in phase tarnished its somewhat unparalleled reputation in the outdoor footwear game. Overall, The North Face Hedgehog Fastpack GTX can still work in a variety of outdoor conditions but would require adjustments from the user's end.",

I've had these for a little less than a month, and have been tromping around in mud, snow, rain and ice on the daily, and have not had a single problem. They keep my feet nice and warm especially with my wool insoles. I rubbed some beeswax into them for extra water protection and it darkened the color significantly, hard to say if it made them more waterproof as I hadn't had any problems. Perhaps I am in the honeymoon phase, but I am in love with these boots, definitely my favorite pair I've ever gotten, highly recommended.",

The soles are going up well to the daily abuse. These shoes are very comfortable. They do eventually let moisture in, but I haven't found any Gore-Tex that is 100% water proof.

I log about 55 miles a workweek and I bought these with the expectation that they'd fit the same at the North Face Ultra 109s that I bought from R.E.I. I LOVED those shoes. These shoes fit as expected, but I felt a \"hardness\" on the spot on the sole where the ball of my foot rests. I figured they'd break in after a week or so, but they never did. I've now logged about 200 miles on them and I think I've given up on them. Since there seems to be a bit of inconsistency with the North Face shoes I'll likely not buy another pair online.",
