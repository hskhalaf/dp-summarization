It looks nice in the picture, but it's just cheap. As you can see in the picture the green Boye hook on the left is thicker around than the one that comes in this kit.",

Since I bought this set, I haven\u2019t lost a single one. They aren\u2019t the fanciest hooks, but they work well and the grip feels good. I put the hooks I found at home in the case too. The rest of the tools in the kit all work great. I like that the scissors are foldable. I also like that the center zippered pouch is removable. (Just be careful when you take it out, because I accidentally broke the mesh where it attached to the snap. My fault)",

The set came in two days & the packaging was good as the case was not damaged or dented/bent or crushed. I love the multi-colored hooks & I hope they ease my daughters hand pain when she uses them. I will have to report back once she uses them as I don't crochet & can't report on their comfort level. So far I'm very pleased with the vendors promptness, the look of the set & the price was a real value!",

I'm even going to buy a yarn bag to go with the kit. Looking forward to making more than scarves, blankets and other flat rectangular items!

The needles fit into elastic slots, one for each needle. The needles are marked in a letter and metric number to correspond to any pattern directions.

The handles make these comfortable to hold and are a slight bit shorter than my other crochet hooks which makes them easier to use. All of the included accessories are great. I like that everything fits so neatly into this case so that I have all that I need right at my fingertips. I bought a bin/tote for my afghan project and this set fits right in with the wool and instructions and I am ready to go.",

I'm using the 5.5 hook on my current project and, although it handles differently than my plain aluminium hook, I find it works well. Once I get used to it, I'm sure I'll be able to pick up speed on it. The case and pouches seem well-made and sturdy and I'm looking forward to many years of use. Thank you for providing a set of ergo hooks in a case with goodies --- it's just what I needed!!",
