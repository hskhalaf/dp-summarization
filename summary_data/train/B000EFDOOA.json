I stood at one place going over it for a bit, because my carpet is older, and matted down in high traffic areas. On the kitchen vinyl floor, the brush side trapped floating hair that usually escapes being swept up with a conventional broom. It also cleaned fur out of the dog bed quickly and easily. This thing is definitely a great tool!",

The height adjustment part of the pole keeps coming loose when you use it and gives way suddenly.

Even then, it takes a huge amount of time and effort to make any noticeable difference in the way the carpet looks and feels. So, it does work. But, don't expect miracles. And do expect a fair amount of effort. I wonder if the more expensive versions would have been worth the money.",

It seems to work well on tiled bathroom floors to gather hair - but I haven't seen the results I was expecting with carpet. The other downfall is that it does not work with shorter hairs, from what I've seen, only long hair - and is somewhat ineffective in actually removing the hair off of the bristles. Take it with a grain of salt, the carpet in my townhome is longer than most - which could be the issue with gathering hair.",

That said, what it IS great for, is the throw rugs. It pulls the hair, etc. off of them real good. I will use it for that. So if you want it to sweep your wood floors, I wouldn't recommend it.

I was very excited to see how it worked since I have a golden retriever and even with vacuuming 3 times per day the rug still is covered in hair. And I saw all the super cool reviews of piles of hair. This doesnt work on my rug at all lol I cant move it when I push the broom at all even with tiny strokes it just bends the broom, and pulling it towards me or the squeegee side does nothing. The rug has pretty long pile which I'm assuming is why it doesnt work. I'll keep it anyways in case some day I get a different rug.",

I bought a Furminator yeeears ago when they first came out and cost fifty dollars, and I've been using that ever since to \"pre-clean\" the floors before vacuuming. The Furminator requires being on hands and knees; this doesn't. I would still use the Furminator for rugs or carpets that have a weird, grippy nap in some cases, but this is pretty great. It not only gets the pet hair but things like Christmas-tree needles which the Furminator is not as great at. Between the brush, the broom, and a special pet-hair vacuum, our floors look largely respectable, usually.",

      "text": "I bought this it assist in getting cat hair out of carpet, and while it works, it doesn\u2019t work AS WELL as I had hoped. The brush head also won\u2019t stay on the included pole...and I\u2019d honestly not mind if it got a little deeper into the carpet. The \u201cbristles\u201d just are sturdy enough to penetrate my medium pile carpet to get out deeply imbedded fur. It does get for surface stuff up, but it wasn\u2019t the miracle I was hoping for. I bought it expecting to work up a sweat, and I\u2019ve tried to really \u201cdig in\u201d to the carpet...but even with all my elbow grease...it\u2019s just meh.",

      "text": "This is AMAZING for dog hair. We have two larger dogs that shed something awful. This is the best broom I have every used, and I'm not saying that just for the review. It's hands down amazing. I have recommended it to many people. Regular brooms fling dog hair everywhere and you just spend half the day chasing dog hair with the broom. This broom does NOT fling dog hair. It puts all the dog hair in a neat little pile. I have even used it on carpet and its amazing the hair that came up even after just vacuuming. I never knew I could talk so much about a broom! Go buy it.",

      "text": "It says this is good on carpets but it did absolutely nothing for my low pile carpet. I started a return & then decided to try it on my hardwood floors. It was EXCELLENT on the hardwood & was better than anything else I've ever tried. Not only did it quickly capture all the dog & cat fur flying/lying around -- it immediately released it, unlike brooms that won't let go so that I can dispose of the fur! I immediately cancelled my return. I have a great metal rake for my carpets that doesn't work on hardwood. Now I have an excellent tool for each & I'm fur free at last!",

      "text": "I read the other reviews before buying this product. I was still skeptical until I used it myself. I have a multiple cat household and need to clean floors daily. This broom is great! It has two sides, one looks like a fine rake the other side is smooth. I also used it on furniture and the cat hair thoroughly came up. I can clean without using my vacuum cleaner. Honestly, I have an expensive Dyson and this broom cleans the cat hair up better than the expensive vacuum cleaner.",

    "description": "Style:Broom\n\nThe innovative and unique multi-purpose FURemover Broom can be used indoors or outdoors to remove cat hair, dog fur, and dirt from practically any surface including hardwood floors, tile, carpet, rugs, linoleum, concrete, and upholstery. The soft head is made of natural rubber that acts like a pet hair magnet and won't scratch hardwood floors.\n\nFor carpet fur removal, pull the broom in short, sharp strokes to bring embedded hair to the surface of the carpet. Even expensive vacuums made specifically for pet hair can't compete with the FURemover Broom's ability to pick up embedded pet hair. \n\nFlip it over and use the all-purpose rubber squeegee side to pick up dirt and dust on hardwood floors. It cleans up spills with ease. The natural rubber of the squeegee blade prevents water spots even on glass, which is great for wiping windows, glass shower doors, and car windshields.",
