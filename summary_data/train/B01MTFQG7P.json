The Beast 16's are by far the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned, because even if other brands offer arch support for over-pronation, only Brooks offers the proper kind of support for someone with severe/extreme over-pronation like me (to date). Hell, I love these shoes enough to keep an eye out for them on Black Friday so that I can buy the other two designs as well.",

These shoes, however, caused pain in the inside of my heel after half a block. The tilt to the outside is way more pronounced than in the previous shoes. For me, they've gone too far in preventing overpronation. It's really unfortunate. Now I'm back to the drawing board to find properly supportive walking/running shoes. I posted a picture from the back so you can see just how tilted it is.",
