You\u2019re sore in 2 sets, instead of after 4. The material is nice, thick and comfortable. The only thing stopping it from being a 5 star product is the way you have to put it on. My arms measure 17.5 inches, so I have to open it up quite a bit, then when I put them on it\u2019s hard to tighten with one arm. I have to use my teeth then clamp it, if it wasn\u2019t for that, it\u2019s be an easy 5 star, but I look forward to using these some more.",

I would guess that the elastic would get worn out within a short time, and the buckle probably won't be able to hold the straps after a couple of months. I am returning these.",

I\u2019m actually seeing an increase in strength and muscle, without having to add a dangerous amount of weight. The only problem is, when putting them on your own arms, it is so easy to pinch yourself with the band or the clip. It\u2019s also difficult to get the right tightness on your own.",
