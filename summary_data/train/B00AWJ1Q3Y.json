      "text": "I wasted a month trying to get this to create the Kombucha.. Their tech support said everything was going good but after a month of fermenting in an 81 degree environment (which should have created a super acidic Kombucha),,, nothing,, The tech support insisted the Kombucha was good. So I started a second ferment... There was ZERO fermentation after 5 days. All of this leads me to believe that the starter scoby and starter tea was insufficient to start the reaction. So this was a complete waste of money and TIME. They say its sufficient for 5 gallons of tea, and I couldn't even get 1 gallon made.",

For the size of scoby, start smaller (1-gallon), as it took close to 3 weeks for my first batch. On the upside, the original scoby was so healthy it produced a very healthy and large baby. Would definitely buy again!",

I've flavored each pint with six pieces each, raspberries or blackberries, and a few with both. The last bottle (quart) I used elderberry extract because I ran out of fresh berries.

The scoby arrived healthy and ready to ferment. The seller has been in touch with me the entire time to make sure that I am satisfied with my order. I never had any issues with the order; the seller was just being proactive, which is why I am posting this 5-star review. I definitely recommend this kit and Get Kombucha!",

She spent a lot of time looking things up online to make sure she was doing it right, so I guess there could have been a little more info included in the kit, but we're both really happy with it. She also ran out of pH strips pretty quickly, but those were inexpensive and easy to replace. Overall, this was a great product (and price) for beginners.",

It does take about a week to ferment, then you can add fruit to flavor your kombucha and leave for a few more days. I highly recommend GetKombucha for any Kombucha making novice or expert.",
