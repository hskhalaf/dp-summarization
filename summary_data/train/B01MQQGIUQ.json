Being a copy of a glass version means the stem is also thin like the glass version. Glass is much stiffer, however. The stems on these glasses bend a bit. When full, the glass wobbles just a bit. Other than the thin flexible stem, these vessels (how can you call a plastic glass a \"glass?\") are great for parties where a top heavy beverage risks being tipped over and crashing into a million shards of glass around a pool.",
