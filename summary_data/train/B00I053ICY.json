However, I recently purchased a JBL Charge 3 bc it was slightly less expensive than this Sony, waterproof, and I figured with it being a newer model it would be better, however it sounds terrible imo. This old model Sony has way better sound; it\u2019s just so much cleaner and crisper!! I was going return the JBL, however I don\u2019t want to ruin my Sony if I\u2019m out at the river or beach, so I\u2019ll keep it for those occasions, and the Sony for in my home.",

Personally, I would rather save $100 and not have the newest features - I mean, what more do you need than: Pairs with your phone, tablet, computer, plays the music wirelessly, and sounds great! Save the money and buy the old model! Battery life is decent. Only complaint is that the volume doesn't quite reach the level I would like, especially at a crowded party. If you're alone inside, it's more than enough. But if you have a party, it may not permeate the noise enough. But it's well-made, easy to use, sleek looking, and great quality.",

The power brick puts out 12.5V, which I thought was a little odd. But, it's been running for hours now on a single charge, and the music quality is top shelf.",

The sound it produces easily fills a medium sized room when plugged in. The size of the speaker is not overly large and can be put off to the side as to not get in the way. After researching multiple speakers and going to Best Buy to listen, I believe this speaker out performed the Bose Soundlink color. I would also say it is better than the mini soundlink however it is definitely larger in size. I would recommend this speaker to anyone looking for a great speaker to fill your family room and impress you with sound.",

The sound cuts in and out constantly, and it is infuriating. I turn bluetooth on and off and relink the speaker to the computer. It will work for about 15 minutes or so, and then it starts again. If I could go back, I would not buy this speaker.",

Yes, it's a bit expensive, but I'm worth it!",

      "text": "Excellent sound quality! My son has a Beats Pill portable speaker. It was more expensive, yet my Sony SRSX5 is so much better. It connects to my iPhone and my iPad2 without any problems. It has great sound quality and good bass. If I had to choose anything negative, I'd say that the speaker is a little heavy and the volume doesn't go as loud as I would like, but it is still great for a small speaker. I'm very happy with it.",

I'm not sure that I would buy it at $200 or anything close to that especially because the volume isn't all that great. I was hoping for this to be a loud speaker but its not. **If you want a loud speaker keep on looking. If you want crisp sounding music go ahead and buy it.**",
