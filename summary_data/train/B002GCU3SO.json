I am using it to drive 2.5\" nails through pressure treated 2x4s into my concrete basement floor. So far I have completed three walls with zero issues. Every nail is driven securely through the 2x4 and into the concrete. I use the yellow shells to drive the nails.",

I didn\u2019t wear gloves & in tight corners or close to obstacles, the force of tool can slam knuckles pretty good!",

It's been working good and I'm glad I took a chance on it. Makes my project so much easier. I got a trigger style for the price of a hammer style. I'm happy.",
