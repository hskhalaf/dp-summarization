    "title": "Portmeirion Sophie Conran Covered Sugar (White)",
    "description": "Color:WhiteThe Sophie Conran Collection was designed exclusively for Portmeirion. This collection is as durable and functional as it is beautiful. Sophie is part of the world-famous Conran lifestyle and culinary dynasty. The simplistic and organic nature of this collection makes it perfect for every style and taste. Each beautifully delicate item meets the hard-wearing needs of today's family and culinary experts. Available in White, Bisque and Celadon, the look can be as simple or diverse as your tastes demand.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nThis simple, beautiful, and functional sugar bowl is part of an entire tableware and bakeware collection designed by Sophie Conran, an English food writer with her own gourmet pie company. Conran infuses her namesake tableware with a flowing organic nature and tactile expression, as evidenced by the ridges and dipped rims that recall handcrafted pottery. Made of porcelain expressly for Portmeirion, the collection comes in glossy white with select pieces available in cool blue celadon and a creamy biscuit color. \n\n The Sophie Conran sugar bowl is formed in a compellingly rotund shape that harmonizes with the collection's cream jug and teapot. A lip at the rim holds in place the domed lid, which features an unusual knob and a cutout hole for a spoon. The durable, chip-resistant porcelain bowl and lid clean up without fuss in the dishwasher, and also may be used to warm food in a microwave or oven, for example, to liquefy crystallized honey. Combined with the creamer, the set makes a great gift for those who appreciate a rustic yet modern look on the table. --Ann Bieri",
