They had much better arch support than either of the others. The staps feel comfortable and the size was as expected (size 8, regular width feet). In comparison the Crocs have almost no arch support. The Viakix feel as though there is arch support initially, but it weirdly compresses as you walk (the sole is not as stiff) and therefore don't provide true support. They also ran a little shorter (I saw that some people experienced the Tevas being too long, so maybe they would prefer the Viakix in length).",

Otherwise the footbed was fantastic--cushy and great arch support. Totally bummed. Teva should really rethink that ankle strap design.",

      "text": "After several surgeries on my feel for Morton's Neuroma, two knee replacements and back surgery, I need a sandal that provides good padding, excellent arch support and unparalleled stability. I found these three things in the Teva Tirra. For years I only wore the all-leather Teva hiking sandal, but they have changed and no longer meet my needs. I also tried numerous other brands such as Rockport (fair), Sketchers (POOR), and others. I like this sandal--it's the closest I have found to the hiking sandal. I ordered the Bering Sea in blue, since I needed a blue sandal, but liked it so much, I have ordered it again in black/black. I sure do wish it came in a dark brown.",

      "text": "Great fit! I've been wearing these sandals daily for about a month now. They're lightweight and flattering yet sturdy and provide support for my arches. Unlike other sandals, there's no uncomfortable rubbing from the straps so no need to worry about getting blisters. The other reviews are right that there is a thin film of something on the underside of the sandals when you first receive them, but after wearing them on rough concrete, it quickly goes away so no worries. My only complaint is that the velcro is starting to come off the main strap so I'll need to sew it back on. Otherwise very satisfied.",

I am generally between a normal and a wide width and like another person mentioned, if your feet tend to be wide the straps are too short which I would have to agree. The one strap for me secures but not by much. I am hopeful it will hold and or these might stretch a tad. But for the price, I'm going to give 'em hell.",

The first few days of wearing that foot had pain in that area and I\u2019m sure it was due to fixing the alignment in that area. Now going into week 2 of wearing daily they will great. I notice the bunion bump is smaller too. I\u2019d recommend for those struggling with this issue too!",

It is lighter than the leather Tirra, and not quite as well-made, but it's meant to hold up to water use, so I think that's why.
