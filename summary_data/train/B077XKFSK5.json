I will probably get any other GE bnha plushies they make in this line bc I think they did a great job on them :) He even has a string out the top of his head to display him from!",

His eyes normally are mostly black, with the deep green shade at the bottom (with the white shine to the side.) but that's just a nitpick, I do hope they release his Costume Beta and Gamma Hero suits as plushies, I know his alpha (mom costume) is one, but I'd like the others!",
