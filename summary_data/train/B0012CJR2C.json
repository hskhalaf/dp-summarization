The phone works well and is well made. I am using the Plantronics Mobile Convertible Headset M175C which plugs in directly to the headset jack. The headset works well but does not provide additional amplification for the speaker or listener and the chord is short. I plan on buying this conversion piece [...] Adapter-Amplifier_2104.php which will allow me to us any plantronics headset amplifier and the built-in headset button of the phone.",
