My biggest gripe is that the bottom cushion is more shallow and the seat doesn't sit as low, making them much less comfortable. Still given that the helinox are almost prohibitively expensive, these are certainly worth the trade-offs for a price that makes them worth considering.",

It packs up small and the weight really is pretty light. I tried all the old backpack chairs like the 3 leg version, and folding square. They just aren't worth it. Many rocks are more comfortable than those. This chair is light, compact, and comfortable. The legs are thin, so don't expect to use this in the sand.",

      "text": "Bought this Marchway chair for a backpack camping trip because we really needed chairs that didn\u2019t add too much weight to our load. I actually bought a very light (approx 1lb), way more expensive chair for my husband and this one for myself. For more than a third of the price and a little more weight (approx 2lbs), this little chair is awesome!! Granted it is heavier than the $119 one, but it is so comfortable- my husband actually likes mine bette because it fits his larger body better. You can\u2019t beat the price either \u2014 I actually bought 3 additional chairs as gifts to our fellow day hiking friends - they love them too!!",

There is no real seat, just fabric, causing a person to be pitched backward instead of a sitting position. Miserable. Left it in the hotel.",
