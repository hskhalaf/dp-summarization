My 5 year old played with it fine but kept getting frustrated with the parts falling off all the time and not being able to easily hang the pods back on without my help. My two year old was thrilled when she saw it but quickly lost interest since it was so flimsy and she couldn\u2019t really play with it without it falling over or breaking. I would say that I don\u2019t regret the purchase but for the price, I expected a sturdier toy.",
