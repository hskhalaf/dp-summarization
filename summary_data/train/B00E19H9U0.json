It works over and over again and comes with plenty of fluid, 2 large cloths, and moist cleaning wipes. It cleans a screen protector too.",

The Tech Armor formula leaves a clear film that makes keeping the screens clean easy. Several subsequent cleanings required only a dry microfiber cloth to wipe the screen. I'm quite happy with this purchase.",

However, the vendor sent me an email asking to let them know if I wasn't 100% happy with my purchase. I explained the issue in a reply and they sent me another package for free.
