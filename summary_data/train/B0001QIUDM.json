The cast-iron pans are perfect for fajitas, but they also work great for a couple of hamburgers, bacon, veggies or anything else you'd like to \"grill\" on the stove (or on a real grill) when you don't need big, round, cast-iron pan. The top varnish on the wooden pan-holders quickly gets toasted, but that's part of it's charm, it goes with the cast iron. The little pot-holders for the handles are great for the table, but a larger mitt is safer while grilling. NOTE: this IS cast iron and you will need to properly \"season\" the pans before you first use them to keep food from sticking.",

I gave 5 stars to my grill because the quality is great and the price is right! If you want a great fajita recipe look for Paula Dean's sizzling fajitas at the Food Network's website.",

    "description": "Size:1Cast-Iron Ribbed Fajita Platter Set\n\nAMAZON.COM\nIf you think Fajitas taste best when served sizzling hot, you\u2019ll love this cast-iron grilling platter. Heavy cast iron absorbs and retains heat at the high temperatures required for searing strips of steak or chicken, as well as green peppers and onions. Ribs in the platter raise the meat above grease, which can be poured off by means of two lips, one on either side. The 7-1/2 by 9-1/2-inch cooking surface produces enough fajita filling for one hungry person, or two who like to share. In addition, the set contains a padded mitt for safety, as well as a 12-1/2- by 7-1/2-inch oval, lacquered wooden base to keep the cast-iron platter from slipping during serving. \n\n The fajita platter must be seasoned before first use to create a nonstick patina that also helps prevent rusting. After washing, a thin layer of vegetable oil is applied and the platter is heated for one hour. While the platter can be seasoned on a grill, an oven works best. Instructions for the seasoning process are included. After subsequent use, the platter should be washed by hand and dried before storing. Mr. Bar-B-Q covers the fajita set with a five-year warranty. --Ann Bieri \n\n What\u2019s In the Box\nCast-iron platter, wooden base, handle mitt.",
