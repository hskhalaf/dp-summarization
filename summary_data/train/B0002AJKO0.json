      "text": "One of my 2 batteries died quite a while ago and the other has been fading, but I put off buying new ones because of the cost. Made my purchase here as Amazon has the best price and made it less painful. Charged both new packs and now have done quite a bit of drilling/screwing without even switching to the second one yet. Loving it. A fantastic difference with a new battery and the fact that it's an XRP, too.",

The battery charges in one hour giving you the power to complete almost any project and when you set your tool down the battery stays, it dosen't discharge like most all cheap batteries,these are simply the best batteries you can buy period. They hold a charge while not being used so that your ready to go when the next project comes up.",

This new battery is stunning--great power, holds it's charge while in the drill and on the shelf, and I feel good about not having to dump the old drill. I don't think I'll ever need a second battery, and I wonder if I was not shortening the life of the old ones by constantly having one of the two in the charger all the time.",
