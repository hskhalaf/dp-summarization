My Sony walkman from the 80's sounded better than these on AM radio. I thought hey maybe it's just the Bluetooth drivers on her phone that suck let's hook it up to my pixel which drives my sol BT headset like a champ and use power amp to dial it in yea still no bass. #2 they do not stay in your ears while exercising.",

The buds don't stay in my ears too well without the wings. There is a delay between my phone (SG Note 4) and the command buttons on the Bluetooth. You also have to hold down the power button for forever before it powers on. Great sound cancellation and background noise. Music plays nice. However with most bluetooths the other person hears everything in the background.",

Jabra won't warranty them without the original receipt. I loved the magnetic standby, not only does it stop the music but it also keeps them around your neck.",

I have asked jabra if they will issue a firmware update. Will update if they respond. Going back to my LG tone platinums. Update: Over a month and still no response from Jabra. Headset is also acting even more wonky and connects on calls only part of the time. Very bad headset given the cost.",
