Some cheap bands have this horrible smell of rubber that does not go away with time and stays on the skin after working out - but not those ones! Great quality material, very nice in touch, durable but not bulky, folds fantastically into the provided bag so it's literally a travel-sized pocket gym! Love the gradation too, from light to really heavy. I use them with a set of non-looped bands and I'm getting a better whole body workout than when I was paying for the gym membership (and without the stress of strangers glaring at me as I train!). Definitely worth recommending. :)",

It's also useful that they're in different colours so you can quickly identify what tension you want if you're in a rush. This would be so useful for holidays when you can't get to the gym!

For example, you can't loop one round your foot, stand vertical with the other end looped in your hand and work it. That means it won't work for many exercises. The chart that comes with them makes this clear but not the words with the ad online. Why aren't I returning them? They are very very handy to have nearby all the time for a range of simple but effective upper body work while some of the leg exercises are easier with these than longer loops.",

Went from an xtra heavy on these to a medium on one of the fabric Grace Fit bands so these definitely are no way near as strong. 3 stars because they roll up your legs when working out doing some exercises, e.g leg kicks when on all fours, and then dig into you and it\u2019s hopeless and you can\u2019t continue. They are also painful on bare skin. Fine quality for the price you pay but if you intend on using them often I suggest investing in some sturdy fabric ones.",

I can't rate the durability yet, I can only hope they last longer than the previous ones.",

I was on edge incase it snapped. I will invest in some fabric ones because I don't want to have to stop and start and want comfort too.",

The bands are too small for bicep curls even though the booklet shows you can, but that is a demo of a half bicep curl to 90 deg while you are seated on a small chair or stool. I cannot do a full bicep curl with these bands as they are too short. You also cannot do press-ups, squats, chest exercise, shoulder press. These are best for things like pilates or yoga. I now have to look around again for longer resistance bands as i need resistance bands long enough to do gym exercises as seen on the internet.",

Also because they are rubber bands, you are better off wearing them with leggings instead of shorts because they stick to your skin. Other than thr fact they roll all the time, they are OK as a first set of bands and are decent enough quality for the price of them considering you get 5 in a bag with a nice bag to keep them safe in. I'd probably recommend thicker bands for comfort though.",
