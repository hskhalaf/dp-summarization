The wood grain is awesome, and even though it is really wood, it's completely flexible. The phone fits in the case with my screen protector, and there are no gaps where dust and such and find it way into the case. The Black Rose color is a perfect combination with the matte black iPhone, it looks beautiful and the synchronize well with each other. The product was shipped timely and arrived within the 2 days. Fantastic!",
