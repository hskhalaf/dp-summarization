The app is full of bugs and does not work often times, wont switch modes, notifications come DELAYED, there customer service is good, but the actual product quality just DOES NOT WORK and this is one of those items whose quality needs to work, for security purposes over its customer service.",

Used to be able to see video recordings for 24 hours if motion detected and now that's only for members. Unless they change this would not recommend to anyone.

A real slap in the face to a loyal customer who sold others on buying this device. All this just to force user into paying $10 for the subscription service. Would not buy again. I am amazed a company would take key features away from loyal customers just to push new services and attempt to push them into paying more.",
