I don't even use the app control anymore. Just the front mounted switch to create a nice soft glow around my tub in a myriad of colors. While they did not really work for my intended purpose they do a great job providing light just about anywhere in a compact package. If you have more patience the app control may be for you.

After I had done the same steps over 3 times, it suddenly started to work. Don't know why it took so long. But it works perfectly now.",

I couldn't even \"force close\" the app. As much as I love the light, my battery on my phone is more important.
