The Amazon box came today and I eagerly opened the box and pulled the bolt cutter out. Now, I wish I hadn't and just sent the box right back. The pictures attached to this review were taken within 30 minutes of using the \"bolt cutters\" on something no thicker than chain-link fence. That large-sized chuck missing from the right blade make cutting next to impossible. These were not \"bolt cutters,\" just glorified wire cutters and now they can't even cut a rug if they were dancing with Ginger Rogers.",

You just have to keep adjusting it (cut it a little, then move it back...then repeat till it cuts off).",

      "text": "I purchased these to help remove various chicken wire and crosshatch fencing that was wrapped to protect trees, gardens, and other landscape items from deer and wild animals. These are spring loaded and have a very fluid motion. I would estimate the thickest fence we cut was 10 or 12 gauge. These had no problem chopping through on the first try. Having used over 100 times, these show no signs of wear. I expect many years of use.",
