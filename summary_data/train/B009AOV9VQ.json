I use this as a 2nd monitor with an iMac 5k Retina (I have it configured to display video output from Adobe PremiereProCC). It works really well and using the Thunderbolt connection there is no apparent audio or video latency. The 5k iMac has no problem outputting a different resolution this 2nd monitor (without reducing resolution of the iMac 5k display) - so the iMac runs both displays at the native resolution. I am really pleased I chose this as my video output monitor rather than an HDMI TV.",

That said, it's completely inextensible as it has no ports at the back, just the mini-DisplayPort cable and the laptop charger cable (old version with an adaptor for 2012-2016 models). You can buy good monitors for a quarter of the price! Will be selling mine at a year and a half just to free up some space and make back some of the cost.",

A good saving compared to the Apple site! Advice re. teething problems above ... put laptop to sleep before disconnecting from, and connecting to, the screen. This ensures the screen will wake when reconnecting and waking the laptop. Sometimes it would not wake otherwise, and there is no on/off switch. This seems to have solved the issue and no further problems.",
