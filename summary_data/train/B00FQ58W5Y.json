So... we did another renovation in our new kitchen and I bought the same one again. Came in without a scratch. Works great and I love the patina we get from it. It fit our old home and fits this one just as well. If you're not a patina friend, don't get it. It changes color and ages ... we love the character and feel it suits our soapstone counters and ivory cabinets... we went with brushed nickel hardware including the drain. Beautiful.",

I installed this as a top mount over new wooden counters and there are spots I had to hammer down because the lip sits too far above the counter. Other than that this is great and I can't wait to use this.",

Acidic liquids will leave a shiny mark on the antique finish that takes some time to fill in again. It really should be wiped out and dried after each use. That said, even with the spots and such, this sink is absolutely stunning.",

That being said it does look nice, it's just not as sturdy as I was hoping. We have not used it at all yet, I hope it holds up.",

I am hoping the Cleaning Kit from the company will help to protect the finish and keep it looking beautiful .I priced other sinks and this one was by far the best price and is high quality workmanship.

It does have a finish on it that gives it the rustic darker color. It gets scratches and wear and now has fresh bright copper shining through those areas. I love that. We designed our home to feel rustic and this sink fits perfect. We plan on living here forever and I'm very excited to see how the sink changes over the years. The apron front will receive a lot of wear and will take on its own look. This is a great deal. Buy this sink!",
