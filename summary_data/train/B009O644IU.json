      "text": "These are nice pads for sparring and bag work. One size fits all but tag says L. Wished that they were slightly smaller, but that's because I'm pretty short (5' 4\"). Pads aren't pre-formed so I placed rubber bands around them to get them to bend around my shin and instep. There's also a lot of spacing between the shin guard and instep guard. Leaves portion of foot open for direct contact. Maybe I'll stitch that part together. Overall, a good buy. If you're short like me and wondering if these will fit, they will. May seem a bit loose, but they stay in place. I haven't had to adjust them at all during sparring.",

I would recommend these to someone who does light sparring if any sparring at all. If you\u2019re training multiple times throwing/checking hard kicks, these will not properly protect your shins. After a few months of using these, doing Muay Thai 2-3 times a week, I\u2019m upgrading to the Venum Predators as my shins easily bruise up with these. I bought these for $18 and at that value, are a steal. I would say these are a great starter set and stepping stone but if you have sensitive shins, these probably aren\u2019t for you.",

I should\u2019ve know this since a lot of people already stated this, but a hard check or kicking someone\u2019s knee will go right through the protective layer and give you a nice big bruise. It\u2019s comfortable to wear though and you don\u2019t have to make that many adjustments while sparring but the protection is the issue. So I would recommend it for people just training casually or light sparring but once you start hard sparring I would suggest getting a different pair",

There is an opening between the shin and the foot. You will constantly injure yourself when you throw low leg kicks or kicks that get blocked by forearms. Buy something that\u2019s fully protected and that also has side protection. I accidentally kicked an elbow going for a liver kick and it hit right in the opening. Now It\u2019s been swollen and bruised for the past 2 weeks. I know it\u2019s apart of the game but better shin guards would of stopped that from happening.",

Overall I like Venum products for Muay Thai and MMA but in this case I would recommend spending extra to go with some of their higher end shin guards.",
