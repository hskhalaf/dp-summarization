Their large diameter make them easy to roll on carpeted surfaces, and over bumps, but they just are not rigid enough. For a cost of over $200, the wheels are just cheap crap, and don't belong on this rollator.",

High quality, easy to adjust, being a younger guy with COPD wanted something that didn't look like my grandmother's walker or in powder blue or blinding red. I thought my friends would laugh at me but they thought it was great. Got my freedom back. Just put my oxygen concentrator (needed a longer canula ) in the pouch and I can walk faster and twice as far as before and can have a seat when I need to rest. It's a little heavy but that's what makes it so sturdy. I imagine the ones they make out of composite are lighter but I didn't want to spend that kind of money.",

No nuts or bolts to assemble. Just pop it out of the box. It also fits flat in the trunk. I'll never have a different walker again. This is wonderful \u2764\ufe0f.",

Was a great unit but now i need to try and find bolts that fit and a new bag. Drive Medical asked for a bunch of information as if they would help then said not covered by warranty. So if you buy, nothing at all heavy in the bag and tighten all the bolts on a regular basis else someone may get hurt. Oh and a replacement bag is $80.",

Folding with inflexible item (like folding cane) in bag is impossible, unless you remove the bag. Front-hanging bag folds with walker; will break glass on iPads. Incredibly difficult to reinsert the bag back and lock it in place. Another minus; bag has no carry strap. Material on bottom of bag develops permanent crease when folded a few tims. I suspect it will cause a hole in the mesh shortly. Right brake no longer works and won't tighten any more; cable seems bunched up at bottom contact point.",

    "description": "Color:ChampagneIf you're seeking a safe, convenient aid to improving your daily mobility, a rollator can be the ideal solution. Wheels make a rollator a superior option over a standard walker, eliminating the need to lift the device and allowing you to walk with an easy, smooth gait. Plus, rollators are better for traveling over uneven, outdoor terrain, making them great for your active, busy lifestyle. And with the built-in seat found on a rollator, you'll always have a convenient place to rest. Featuring a revolutionary design and eye-catching style, the nitro dlx has exploded onto the rollator scene. The nitro's caster fork design allows for an enhanced turning radius while the 10\" front casters allow optimal steering and rolling comfort. In addition, the nitro dlx locates brake cables within the unit's frame for safety and offers quick and easy tool-free adjustment to the handle height and back support. Plus, the nitro dlx has a firm, sturdy, and durable seat that separates in the middle to allow the nitro dlx to easily fold to ultra-compact size for storage or transport.",
