The zoom is just so fantastic on this thing. From a tiny spider to a moon. The night pictures are as great as the daytime pictures. It's clarity is wonderful also. My camera friends are jealous because they have to whip out all of their lenses where I just zoom and shoot. If I could give this a 10 star, I would!",

You can also turn on the wifi on cam and use the nikon app to take pictures remotely, and zoom in and out focus remotely. Also can transfer pix to your phone ipad while out on location and then upload them to Facebook or Instagram from your device! So cool. These pics are the proof of the crazy amazing zoom. Still have yet to try with tripod. the circled bits are where the next pic is fully zoomed in on. amazing!!",

I totally recommend this camera to an amateur like me who is looking for a lot of camera for a reasonable price.

I had to use ISO800 for most of the shots, and had to focus through the rain. Although the camera was slow to aim and focus compared to a dslr, it was completely usable for bird photography, producing good quality images of far away static objects. Understanding the limitations of the small sensor size, which is what makes the superzoom possible in such a compact package, the only improvement I would have loved is a truly manual manual focus, instead of the slow-acting button.",

This lens is great for wildlife and bird photography. I've goten great pictures of the moon with other cameras, but usually with a tripod and a big lens. This camera is great hand held for some very detailed moon pics. The only 2 downfalls IMO is the low light focus, and zooming on something closer than 15 feet. It doesn't do well at night using the zoom. Overall, it is a great travel camera and for capturing wildlife.",

      "text": "I used a NIKON Coolpix P550 for more than six years with great satisfaction. After years of heavy use, I recently bought a P900. I noticed that Nikon did not include the useful lens cap holder on the lens cap. There is no useful hole on the cap for a connection. is this a design flaw or they have some other intention. I have found my solution by drilling a 1 mm diameter hole on the cap at a ptoper angled location. This solves the problem rather than purchasing separate a glue-on cap holder.I attached a close-up photo. Great camera !",

The 2000mm lens is no joke. -Low light shooting is solid, especially for the money -Video stabilization Cons: -No option to shoot RAW -Viewfinder is not as clear as it could be no matter what focus setting I use.",

My only negative so far (I've had it a few weeks) - it seems slow to focus on movement. So anything that's sitting still is 100% in focus and sharp, but anything in motion has a tendency to blur.

One of the few cameras I have played with (under $1000) that can take GOOD pictures of the Moon (wide aperture, aperture priority, burst mode, fully zoomed out). If you are looking for a good fixed lens camera, then it is hard to go wrong with this one! One downside: no RAW mode. That is the one thing Nikon needs to fix.... Five stars anyway.",

      "text": "This camera was an upgrade from a Coolpix L840 and was totally worth it. Finding subjects in the viewfinder was definitely faster and easier than using the screen on the back, the focus is much more precise, and there isn't a lag time between pressing the shutter and the camera taking the photo. Because the P900 is heavier, it is easier to hold it still when the lense is zoomed in on a subject or when the video mode is used. But it does wear on the neck with just a neck strap. A shoulder harness solves that minor disadvantage",
