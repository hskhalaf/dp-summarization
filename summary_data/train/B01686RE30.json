      "text": "Our small church purchased this as an upgrade to a 12ish year old projector that finally broke down. This was well worth the investment. Our church has windows all around, there's no escaping the outdoor lighting during our Sunday morning service but this projector had no issue projecting a crisp, clear image w/ hardly any color loss. Super easy to set-up. Perfect for our needs.",

I was so excited to try it out I set it up at dusk outside projecting on my dark green siding and I am blown away by the quality. I have no clue how it looks so good on such a crap surface. I'm sure it will be amazing in a dark basement on an actual screen",

      "text": "This Projector is a major step up from my old ones!! Lumens make a HUGE difference. My old VVME was only 1500 lumens, and the BenQ is 4000. Color was vivid, and bright from a long throw projection. I saw all the reviews about the bulb issues, i hope I don't have the same problem, other then that I'm a happy camper. I will be buying another one soon. I'm glad I did my homework in what separates all these projectors apart from one another",

I couldn't figure out what it was until I focused and it appears to be a piece of lint inside the lens. See pictures below. I sent it back and i am waiting for a refund. Hopefully i just received a defecting model. The reviews on it are great and i had success projecting it on a 120\" screen. it was easy to set up. We mounted it to the ceiling. We have a dedicated theater room we are finishing and the image looks pretty good except for that imperfection. I will update the rating once I receive a replacement.",
