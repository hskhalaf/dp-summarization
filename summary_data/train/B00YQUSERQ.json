She LOVES this product!!! It is very sturdy, yet lightweight. It serves two vital functions: a.) it's a great seat or kneeler to sit/kneel on while leaning over in the garden and b.) the sturdy arms assist her in going to a standing position with ease. It folds up easily. Even if you're a younger person, I'm guessing this product would still be very useful. Great gift idea for gardeners!!!",

The product folds up easily and is easy to maneuver for the tasks at hand but is not built well at all. When it broke it was sudden and unexpected and the seat just caved in completely exposing the styrofoam within and the inadequate hardware holding it together.

      "text": "This is a wonderful product. Very sturdy, yet lightweight. I bought one for myself and gave one as a gift to my mother. Excellent for gardeners arthritic knees and hips. Also makes a handy extra seat around the fire, in a pinch. Four stars instead of five because of the folding mechanism. It works fine but it is very easy to catch/pinch your hand in this. Both myself and the kids have been pinched, not too hard, we didn't get cut, but it is a watch out. For me, the tool pouches are kind of useless, because I use this as a kneeler most often, but they are velcro and remove easily. Overall, I highly recommend this product.",

It even folds flat easily and fits conveniently into her rectangular yellow (former largest Preen container) weed bucket. The only design suggestion would be to make one of the tool pockets large enough to hold a water bottle. I would definitely buy this item again.",

When you put tools inside the pouches, they have a tendency to flip over and spill your tools on the ground. I would suggest putting something on the sides to prevent the pouches from flipping over. Minor inconvenience, but great product!!!",

Keep in mind...I have used this product for several years and I weight close to 240 lbs. so a separation of the padding is (in my mind) not that surprising. Still a good product...that's why I bought a second one.",
