Would definitely recommend. Worth the extra money too because you only need a little for it to cover up blemishes!",

Itsy heavy and thick and makes the skin under my eyes look cakey and it's just not the perfect thing the old stuff was for my undereyes. Won't buy again. It's just concealer. For heavy jobs. Not for undereye brightening and smoothing out the skin tone... This is for covering scars or tattoos.",
