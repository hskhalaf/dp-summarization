My first toppers were 4\" deep, and while I loved that they nestled me and I sunk into a deep sleep, you can't wrap half of your body in foam an not over-heat. The 2\" topper brings me the comfort I need to make my old Tempurpedic comfy, but the lower profile and ventilation keep me from over-heating. I have this topper on two beds in the house now. I opened it and allowed it to breathe for a few days - they all have that new foam smell to some extent, but this one goes to neutral really fast.",

Rather than replace the whole thing, we opted to try a topper first. We are not young, and really need a good mattress for our tired, old backs. If you are on the fence about this, don't hesitate. Add a couple of really good pillows to this topper, and you will get a good night's sleep.",

I have a fairly sensitive nose and the smell was acceptable (essentially zero) after week of airing out. I could see some people not minding the smell after a day. Our other mattress has a 3\" thick memory foam of the same type. In hind sight, I think the 3\" is the slightly better way to go. I am considering getting another 2\" piece of memory foam and putting it on top of this one. (Not REALLLLY necessary. It is nice as it is but having the nicer one makes this one \"only\" \"very nice, quite comfortable\" rather than \"ahhhhhhhhhhh\".)",

I like to feel like I'm sleeping on a giant cloud and this definitely provides that feeling. After sleeping on it three nights I feel as though my back is already feeling better as well. PROs -Thick topper -Ventilation holes -Soft, yet supportive CONs -Had a strong smell, but it went away after 24 hours -Mattress is high so this provided a little too much height",

I love how this made my bed feel, but if there is more than one person on the bed its hard to move around. I've had this for a month or two and it has maintained it's shape well. One issue to be aware of is hairs are somehow getting through my sheets and becoming embedded in the foam. Overall I am very happy, but in the future would like a more dense topper.",

      "text": "Epic. That's it. Changed the way I sleep!! Stays cool, 2in is the perfect size. Had a smell to it when it arrived and was only about half an inch thick. Let it sit out over night unrolled and then hit it with some fabreeze (ya I butchered that spelling. Lol) and it puffed up to the full 2in and the smell was gone. Fits perfectly corner to corner on queen size mattress and doesn't move at all. Obviously you'll want to get a mattress cover. Get a pillow top cover and it's like sleeping on a cloud no matter the condition of your mattress.",

This pad has been a great alternative option and has made the older mattress on the bed like a brand new one!",

I am very satisfied with this product. Been almost a year now, and it has kept its shape perfectly and continues to provide comfortable sleep. Only thing I did was to add a mattress pad on top of it that helps keep me a little cooler at night. The memory foam tends to be warm during this hot summer, and this old broad needs some relief! Very happy with this purchase.",
