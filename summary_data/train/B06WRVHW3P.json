But it held all of my products. I could have had more if I used travel size bottles. The sides for makeup and brushes is great. The hanger is nice to keep the bathroom counter clear and be able to see everything. But it can be in the way when you go to zip the bag up... not a big issue. I do wish the bags came in more colors/patterns too. Overall, great bag and good price!",

There's even room to stuff those \"just in case\" things like safety pins and hair clips. When you close it all up the bag fits nicely in your carry-on (I've had bags before that barely left me room for clothing!). The ability to hang it up at your destination is also super convenient. I bought the purple - it's a pretty, rich color and the construction quality is very good.",

I wasnt able to keep everything in its designated category due to size but it is SO much better than my old one. I do prefer a more \"constructed\" look but that is a matter of preference. It is very functional (packed photo here) so I can't complain. I am not done packing it but I am sure it will fit the remaining 3 items easily.",

I don't use full size bottles though, but it seems like there would be enough room for 2-3. I'm super excited to use it next month. The only negative I noticed is when the bag was full and I went to unzip the top make up/mesh compartment the weight of the bag made the zipper \"jump\" and get a little messed up. Once I took the weight off it and re-tried it it worked fine. Maybe just have those compartments unzipped before hanging it.",

Advice to the manufacturer: 1) I do wish the hanging hook was removable - it gets in the way when I zip the main pouch closed. 2) It would be nice if it had a separate lined compartment for a hairbrush as all of the large compartments have the nice mesh lining. My brush gets stuck in the mesh and I fear it will tear it. 3) I am putting a piece of cardboard in the bottom so that it will hold the rectangular shape when I open it instead of flopping around.

This bag was great for our toothbrushes and paste on one side, another side for q-tips, fingerclips and other items, inside great for bottles that you may not have caps for (ex: hairspray, spray deodarant, etc). It held so much for us and made picking up and going to next location a breeze.",

When filled, it tilts forward allowing content to spill. If the bag can't be hung, it is frustrating to use because the center piece doesn't stay open.

Not only do I love the bright color combinations, but it's functionality couldn't be better. It has an amazing amount of products (including standards sized bottles of shampoo, lotion or whatever) yet somehow it seems quite compact in size. It's kinda like an Alice in Wonderland bag that somehow seems to shrink everything down once it's inside the bag. It's also very well constructed with high quality materials. I definitely recommend this toiletry bag, and I would buy it again.",
