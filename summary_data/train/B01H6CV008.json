You can wear them barefoot or with socks and for some reason my plantar fasciitis doesn't hurt at all when I wear these and my Hoka sandals. All of my Hoka sneakers I have had to add dr. Scholl plantar inserts. Very happy with this product. To put on real easy, grab the bottom of the ankle support and pull. Don't use the little hook, it's going to eventually rip and is practically useless.",

Returning them and getting a bigger size was no problem. The size 10's are still a bit snug, but fit OK. I had to loosen the elastic straps completely. Would've been nice to try these on in a local store, but these shoes are not widely sold. So far, all is good. I like how the sole grips well and is very non-slip. I would compare them to Keen H20's",

I had read another review that had concerns about the quality but decided to purchase anyway. I haven't had any problems ... yet. I do worry about the stitching around the top of the interior liner. It seems like it will rip out pretty easily so I'm careful every time I put them on.. That and the slightly awkward way you have to put your foot inside are the reason for only 4 stars. The Velcro closure on the Tevas is a much better design, but the Hokas are much more comfortable.",

This shoe seems to trap fewer rocks, and the heal is more open, which allows them to flush out the back easier. I also like the overall Hoka fit, decent arch support, the cinching system is a bit of a pain if you're taking them on and off a lot, but unlike older Keen's, the strap never loosens.",
