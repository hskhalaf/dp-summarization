      "text": "I purchased this because of its size. You can put a lot of cheese on it. The utensils are excellent. The board itself is a relatively thin slate tile with rubber feet that has a slightly rough surface and very rough edges. The edges are rough and sharp enough that you need to be careful handling it. The board was well packed in an inner box, but the utensils were loosely packed inside the outer box. I couldn\u2019t find the soapstone chalk, but I already have one if I decide to use it. The sharpish edges and the missing chalk kept it from 5 stars.",

When I'm not using it as a cheese board, I have it securely propped up on the counter and use it as a message board. The knives are very nice and a good size. Makes a lovely gift. The only negative is that it is heavy. It doesn't seem fragile so I hope it doesn't crack as others have complained.",
