The chemical treatments have not worked and burned my daughters skin. This treatment hasn't been a miracle cure but we feel better about doing multiple treatments because of the natural ingredients. It smells way better and doesn't burn her skin. The comb is much better than the ones that come with other kits. We are pretty pleased with this product overall and would use it again-but really hoping we don't have to!",

My childs lice was caught early from school teacher so it wasn't an infestation. No one else had it in my home. It worked a little but no cigar. Followed instructions to the T. I'm disappointed, will never buy again.",

I'm not a huge fan of the scent, but it certainly smells better than most treatments you buy. It's also rather hard to wash out and can leave hair a little greasy. However, once you get it all out, hair is very shiney and soft. A huge improvement over the OTC chemical shampoos that leave your hair fried. I would 100% recommend this. It's a great product that works. Very satisfied.",

By the time I did the second treatment, there were no live bugs and the eggs appeared to be dead and empty and fell out of her hair too. Her head is completely clear! This treatment is easy and actually pleasant to use as it smells nice and softens the the hair. Will definitely keep this on hand!",
