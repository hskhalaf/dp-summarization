However, after only two washes & hanging to dry, the material started getting a pill-y appearance, which hasn\u2019t seemed to impact the absorbency, but does bother me as the material isn\u2019t as soft on baby\u2019s bottom. Otherwise, I highly recommend these! The charcoal color has the added benefit of hiding stains better ;)",
