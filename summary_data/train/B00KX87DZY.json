I even did a bird taste test since I wasn't stoked about having to dump 30lb of seed. Brand X feeders were covered with finches, this stuff wasn't. Once the seed dries out, the birds don't want it anymore. So buying in bulk didn't work, even if the price was right and the birds go through 10lb every week - in the end, uneaten seed was just wasted money.",
