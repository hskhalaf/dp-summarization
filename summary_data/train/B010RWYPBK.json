From the time of purchase I have been able to use it probably ten times. Worst purchase ever from Panasonic and Amazon",

The electronics has never shown a flaw. Becuase of the weak hinge, I don't expect this model is last 15+ years as my previous microwave did. But I paid >$350 for my previous appliance.

On the other hand at full power it heats quickly. So far, it has passed all the tests on the normal staples I might consume - hot pockets, eggs, reheating left overs, etc. I like the rotary knob used to set the cook time compared to pushing all the digits.",

      "text": "I've only had this for several days. It replaced a 25 year old Sanyo that kept my coffee hot until it's last gasp. It's a great looking machine - very slick and modern. It runs quietly - it seems like mostly the fan sound. The turntable moves smoothly and, again, very quietly. It cooks more evenly than my old machine. I love those microwave pot pies that brown all over. They come out perfectly :) The price here on Amazon is about 3% lower than most other outlets. Along with Prime Shipping, I feel like this is a great value.",

The numbers on the exterior are dull and you can barely see what they are to set the time or the item you want to cook. It is just poor value and cheap construction. Would not recommend.",
