Super comfortable and sound great!!!!! I have read that after you burn them in a little they sound even better. I have read in some previous reviews they are not loud enough. Let me just say i totally disagree. They seem plenty loud. All around great sounding Bluetooth headphone. Crisp and clean with just the right amount of bass i believe . As far as receiving a phone call on them ......still need to try that feature. Although the reviews say calls sound great. Recommended Sony's for sure.",

      "text": "These sound amazing, but I purchased them primarily for the general consensus that these are some of the most comfortable headphones around. I'd have to disagree with that assessment. I have a pretty big head, and although there are a lot of reviews saying that the MR1R's are comfortable for any head size, I found the clamping force to be unbearable after about 20-30 minutes of use. The sound is great. Overall build quality is a bit plasticky for my taste, but at the same time didn't feel overly cheap.",

The band that goes over my (bald) head is padded and really comfortable. I spent a lot (for me) on these and would do it again in a heartbeat. Their support for the better sounding apx codec was also important to me. Oh, and the battery life is incredible!",

These are special. I also use Sennheiser HD598 and Bose IEM. As soon as the MDR R1 arrived and I used them they became my most interesting pair. HD598 and Bose IEM are very good also.

Highs are just wright, crisp and clear, with no distortions. Lows are still a little boosted, but it is correctable and does not mess up the whole sound picture. Overall this is a solid, well designed product. Wont regret the money I spent on it. It is worth every penny.",
