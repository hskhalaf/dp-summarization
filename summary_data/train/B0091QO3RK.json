TIP I learned from a pro cookie maker: Roll out your cookie dough between 2 sheets of parchment paper. No adding extra flour, which can dry the cookies. It also keeps dough off the rolling pin. If the paper is shifting, you can moisten the surface underneath to help the paper stay in place or use a silpat under the paper.",

There is no locking mechinism to ensure the guides are screwed on completely level, so you wind up with the guide allowing more space on one edge than the other. This variance isn't so great as to cause a problem for the thicker guids, but for the thin ones, it _is_ noticable, and results in less even pastry. Though it is still MUCH better than me trying to guess by hand.",

For those who bake a lot, this is a MUST HAVE. The thickness of the cookies I make are so consistent - you never have to worry about getting some that are too thin or too thick. It would also be a fantastic gift idea to those who are into baking!",
