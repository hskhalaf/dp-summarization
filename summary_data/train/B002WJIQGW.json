My wood burns slowly, and imparts the smoke I want, over a 45 to 60 minute time frame. It holds liquid, so may use as a steamer on one side of grill and my pouches of wood on the other.

That' because the surface of the smoker receives 50% to 75% more heat ..... giving you the amount of smoke you need . This unit is stainless steel meaning it won't rust and will last and last and will never look nasty / rusty in your grill . This unit looks and works GREAT ! ..... why would anybody use any other smoker ? ? ? Buy your Best and Last Smoker FIRST !",

The fit could leave one to think this was made for the Weber. I have only used it a couple of time, so I can't comment on durability, but I am happy so far. Smaller wood chips are a must (like the chips one would buy in the grilling section of a home improvement store). I use branches that fall from the pecan trees in my yard and just cut them down. Pretty good product and like I said, I am happy so far.",

My only gripe and it is a small one, is it is basically a messy thing to clean up. I think a thoughtfully placed handle to grab with tongs would be usefull. Otherwise, it is an essential accessory for your gasser.",

The wood chips did burn up rather quickly (10 mins) but it smoked and imparted some flavor into the chicken.

However, a water filled sprayer bottle should remedy that problem.",
