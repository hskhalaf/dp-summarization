Numerous reviewers mention the racks ability to accommodate the weight plates. I used the two bottom pins for 45 & 25 lbs. plates. If you put a 25 lbs on the second pin, the only plate that will fit above are 2.5 lbs, but for me this did not present any real issue. I gave the rack 4 stars because it could have been designed a little taller with little effort. That said, the rack is sturdy, easy to assemble. Happy with the purchase",

You'll need one wrench to tighten everything after intital setup. Also, I'm not really sure why there are holes machined into one side of the weight bars. I can only assume they were meant to be in the middle, as there are bolts that hold them in place on the stand.",

My set includes 45 and 25lb plates and if you put them on adjoining pegs they barely make it. Perhaps another brand would be more spacious so to speak, but I only have one brand to compare too.
