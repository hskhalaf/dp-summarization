To bad it will not work with my wifi security cameras. The other item is that the pool unit is a closed unit and there is no way to change the battery. I had read that it was interchangeable but it states to return the unit to have the battery replaced. Not even the option of charging it up. This limits the life of a expensive unit, or makes it unavailable when sent in to replace a battery.",

I tell you there is no way that you will not hear this alarm, it is very loud and sounds from both inside the house and at the pool. Easy to set up. Definitely recommend!!!",

Contacted LifeBuoy customer support and they really came through! Although out of warranty, Adi replaced the pool unit free of charge. Great customer service!!!!",
