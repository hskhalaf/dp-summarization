The only downside I have is the lack of tiedowns on the back. It\u2019s designed to be strapped under the boat and only side to side. I may add some rivets to bungee cord down the backside. I\u2019m very happy with the materials and the overall size.",

I did not have to remove the trolling motor with this cover. I did place some foam pipe insulation over the blades for extra protection. The tie down straps are perfectly placed. For the price I don't think the more pricey covers could do any better.",
