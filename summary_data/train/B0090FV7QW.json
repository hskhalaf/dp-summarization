It has to be set up manual with no guide and 4 out of 5 times it falls over before he even gets the set up complete. He has now ditched the original set up and just creates his own, so it's not a totally lost. I would definitely recommend the Death Star version over this one for those looking to buy.",

The pieces don't stand up on the AT-AT walker's back. With the slightest breeze any pieces that you were able to get to stand, fall over and you have to put them all up again. If you are just looking for the characters, then I'd recommend it, but at a much lower price.",
