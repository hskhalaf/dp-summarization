Over-the ear style and padded headband makes them very comfortable for wearing several hours a day. Others in virtual meetings say that my voice is very clear with no extra noise. Two main concerns. First, the volume is very low. I have to turn my computer volume to about 70% to get the same volume as my old headphones at 8%. Second, I get occasional crackling or popping noises, especially when listening to music (doesn't happen often on calls). Jabra is trying to figure it out.",
