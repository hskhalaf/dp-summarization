Good bike just be prepared to adjust crank, wheel, and fork bearings. I expected better from the manufacturer",

The price was better than Toys R Us going out of business sale (no wonder why they went out of business) it was a few buck more than walmart but the delivery was good. I am not a big fan of the special handle grip it seems kind of loose, I wish they would give you an option to have two regular grips.",

The pedals are not interchangeable so we were left with a non-funtional birthday bike. After contacting Amazon customer service, who are amazing, we have a replacement bike on the way. I'm only giving it 3 stars due to the negligence on the quality assurance of the manufacturer, but the bike looks really nice, with cool decals. My 7 year also seems to like the motorbike sounds!",

When you twist the right handlebar it turns on the race car engine sound. My only complaint is that it doesn't spring back on its own to turn the sound off so I often find it on my front porch continuously revving the engine. It's still great quality and a fun bike.",

He outgrew that, but still too short to ride a 16\" bike he has, and so we got him this Dynacraft. The only thing that could be better, IMO, is that the fork are too wide; when screw on tight, it kinda had to bend inward a bit. It's not a deal breaker, as this can be easily fixed by adding a washer on each side of the hub.",

The chain is way too tight and binds even the rear sprocket isn't straight. Why buy a brand new bike to rebuild and fix every component? Paint is decent at least.",
