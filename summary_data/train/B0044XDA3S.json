We have done veggies and meats already. We cut up veggies to add to our meals and we done have to constantly cut them up each time now. Something I didn't know, is that you can use this to reseal chip bags! This is huge for us. Hats off to Food saver!",

I even use it on fresh roasted coffee beans and they stay fresh and flavorful for months. After 3 months, the lid latch doesn\u2019t seem to work quite so well and it pops open mid-seal. I don\u2019t know if this is a common problem or if mine is just defective. Bottom line is that I do recommend the product in theory, but wish the construction was more sturdy as I don\u2019t want to have to buy a new one every few months.",

The first time I used this for vacuum packing mason jars it did almost alright, but I had to reseal a couple out of six 8 oz. jars. The subsequent times I tried to seal jars with the vacuum feature only, the suction wasn't strong enough and I found the jars had come unsealed in the refridgerator the next day. The ensuing attempts were less and less successful. I have an older, larger Food Saver Game Saver that works well but it takes too much counter space, and have to use the older one. I am returning the recent purchase.",

The tray you line the top of the bag on before closing is removable which is really pretty nice is vacuum sealing something like powdered milk or other powdery substances. Just make sure you're sealing a bag inside the vacuum bag in order to minimize the amount of powder that could enter the air pump. Also it will catch any liquid moisture that may seep in from the sealing bag.",
