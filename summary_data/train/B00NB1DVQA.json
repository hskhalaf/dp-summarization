Once the shipping delay had been fixed, my phone arrived within 3 days. Love my new phone. Samsung is the best!",

The bluetooth seems to be disconnecting on regular intervals with my photive btw water resistant speakers, but this might just be coz of the confines of the shower room. For t-mobile I get 4G LTE (one of the reasons I researched and got this particular model). Battery life is awesome. The photo note is great for quick notes from articles and other imagery. I haven't yet seen the note charging faster as advertised. It still takes quite some time to charge to 50% (more than an hour unlike the advertised 30 min).",

Total waste of time and energy plus I had to drive 20 mile round trip to drop off at collect+ store. I also purchased accessories to go with it which have all had to be returned as surpus now.
