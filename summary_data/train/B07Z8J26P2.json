They are very noise cancelling imo. Sound quality is as usual with sennheiser always really good. Its lightweight as well. Mic quality howver could be better overall but still clear",

The firmware updated without issue, the range is a good 40ft and man do these sound amazing. Only issue i have now is i kinda want the 670's just because of how good these are. Buy them, even at full price they are amazing..",

My grandson eventually got it to work having found someone online who advised him to contact Sennheiser Gaming via Facebook Messenger. They sent him a link via email which fixed the issue enabling to customise sound and mic settings from the downloadable program. I awarded a 4 out of 5 stars because I believe this link should have been more accessible. It is a really good Headset and worth the price.",

The sound is clear and the mic works well, although neither are fully noise cancelling. The big downside is the Bluetooth is prone to disconnecting. The drop out can take place at any time \u2013 after 15 minutes or after 4 hours \u2013 it\u2019s very frustrating. I\u2019ve tested them on other machines and the same disconnect happens. It\u2019s a real shame. Without the Bluetooth issue these are great. I\u2019m not sure the battery life really is 100 hours, but I used mine for 44 hours and no battery charge was needed.",
