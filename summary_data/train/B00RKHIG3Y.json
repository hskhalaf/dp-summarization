      "text": "Love it! Super light-weight! It really does feel like water on the skin! Refreshing and hydrating, not thick or slick or greasy. I don't know if it actually helps foundation stay on longer, but it does help create a great canvas for makeup without the thickness of silicone based primers. It has also helped minimize the appearance of my pores. I am enjoying using this product. It also works great as a mid or late day foundation pick me up, and also helps powder foundation look less powdery on the skin...less dry/matte. Gives great luminosity when lightly sprayed over foundation.",

My first bottle was travel size 1/4 of this one and it lasted about 5.5 months so I'm anticipating this one lasting even longer. Bonus to it being a spray - no way of contaminating it like other make up can be.",
