They have light decorative round bubble like indentations, which is simple enough to use with almost any place setting. The glasses are heavy enough to maintain stability, and would not tend to turn over due to the shape. They are dishwasher safe, and look somewhat dainty, but have a good weight. I would recommend these water/tea glasses for almost any table decore due to their durability and beauty.",
