Read other reviews of highly rated cordless vacuum products and most reviewers indicated battery is their biggest issue with lost of powder or stopped working after short-term usage.

I'm not disappointed but cannot really give an outstanding 5-star rating. It picks up spilled Cheerios and peanuts, but I doubt it would lift small stones. Haven't tried, however. A good little portable vacuum. It has never run out of juice on me.",

Fills up and looses suction quickly if used for dog hair. Didn't work too well on auto carpets. Description is confusing ...tag line indicates 12 v while the detail description indicates \"14.8v lithium\". Decals on the unit confirm that it is only 12 volt and I seriously doubt that it has a lithium battery, as the instructions state that it will lose charge over time. Instructions also say not to charge for more than 3 days, so it apparently does not have overcharge protection.",

It also comes with a long hose which I find to be very helpful when you are 39 weeks pregnant and don't want to bend down as low. I like that it has a stainless steel filter, though I haven't tested it by cleaning it yet. Sounds like they also have a very good replacement/return policy so overall I'm very happy with this purchase.",

The decorations on the side was coming off but that minor.",

Power is good, collects any kind of garbage, leaves behind a clean surface. The filter can be washed, which is very convenient. Various nozzles are available. Thanks to them, you can vacuum in difficult places. The vacuum cleaner itself is compact, takes up little space in the car. You can charge the device from the cigarette lighter of the car or from the general network. The total charging time is 3 hours. I am very pleased with the device and I recommend everyone to buy it.",
