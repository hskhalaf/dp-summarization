However an epilator is painful, can irritate my skin and even catch/cut loose skin (like elbows), is time consuming and misses a lot of fine hairs. Also they aren't made for curves (elbows, hands). So I decided to try this and I LOVE it!!! Reasons I love it: 1. Great battery life. 2. Has no problem with the curves of your body. 3. Gets ALL the hair the FIRST time! 4. No pain and no skin irritation. 5. Gets the job done quickly. Basically this shaver is awesome!",

The blade system still offers a good shave, but the case is flimsy and it has no indicator for charge level. Also, the additional trimmers are poor compared with a decent trimmer. Stay away from this model and stick with the ES8103S. By the way, I have purchased three Panasonic ES8103S models over the years and I think they're great. For some reason, Amazon prevents me from doing a separate review on the ES-LL41-K.",

Overall, though, I'm very happy with it. Docked it a point because I do have to go back and forth on my neck a few times in different directions to get it done.",

This shaver has provided a superior head shave for me. It shaves cleanly and gently compared to my previous shaver. I do require a couple of passes with the shaver to get a perfect head shave but this is true with anything I have used on my head. I clean it as directed with soap and water following washing my hair. I have only dry shaved and not yet used shaving cream with it as it is able to do. I would recommend this shaver to a friend.",

But I wanted something that I could use sometimes for a fast touch-up or if I just didn't want to shave with a blade. This works well for that, however I don't think it shaves as close as a blade. It doesn't burn or pull, and the charge seems to last a long time. It's also pretty easy to clean. So I think it is a good reasonably priced shaver, but I don't think I could use it every day. The shave just isn't close enough.",

I've been through MANY electric shavers in my 58 years, and I've settled on Panasonics for a while. The Remington triple foil also does well on a beard with strong grain like mine, but Remingtons are LOUD. Deafening. The Panasonic is as quiet as it can possibly be, I think, and still actually be able to cut through the timber that is my whiskers. The only fault I can come up with is that the popup trimmer does not work particularly well so my sideburns are always a bit scraggly.",

Two suggestions if you buy the ES8103S: First, it gives a very clean, comfortable shave if you use shaving cream as it is a wet/dry shaver. Second, I got very long battery life by not recharging until 10% charge was left, and removing from the charger immediately once it reaches 100% charge.",

      "text": "I've been a traditional shavor with either the Gillette power fusion or something similar, but I was tired of shaving and sometimes cutting my mole (which is very handsome when not gushing blood) and continually going to the store for shaving supplies. So, I wanted to try an electric again. My past experiences with the circular rotating heads wasn't great, as it didn't provide a close shave and irritated my skin. I read some reviews that pointed to this Panasonic. And, I've been more than pleasantly surprised. After a few weeks, I find I'm getting a close shave and no irritation. I am very happy with this purchase, especially for the price!!",

And though this is a wet/dry shaver, it took me awhile to trust taking it in the shower. Using it wet was no problem at all. The only 'hiccup' I can think of is that this will not shave while it is plugged in for charging so if you're in a bind and the shaver needs charging that might be a drawback.",

The flexible pivoting head allows the cordless shaver to float effortlessly along the contours of your face for a clean shave, especially around your sideburns and under your chin.

The convenient wet/dry design lets you shave and trim in the shower or bath with foam, gel or soap lather and dry by holding under warm water to rinse away hair stubble and residue. Like all Panasonic shavers for men, blades and foil should be replaced when dull to ensure the best electric shaver performance.
