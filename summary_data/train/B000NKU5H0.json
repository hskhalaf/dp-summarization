I\u2019m disappointed with this purchase as the power button on one does not work and is turned side ways in the bezel. Neither monitor came with the correct stand. The stands it came with are for a much smaller dell monitor. Because of this it will not hold the weight of the monitor. You can not adjust the monitors up or down. One came with the bezel falling off. Very dissatisfied with this purchase. Seller said these are in \u201cvery good condition\u201d which is clearly not the case. Stay away from this seller!",

Kind of annoying with the true white next to the off white, but I have gotten used to it and use one for videos and the other for everything else. The monitor itself is very nice. Decently sized, the dell mound is very sturdy and offers both portrait and landscape viewing. The build in USB and SD reader are nice. What can I say, its a solid monitor for a great price. If you are looking for a well build not break the bank 24\" display then this is a good buy.",

I wasn't impressed at all with how the seller packaged and sent. Not Amazon but an Amazon seller. Even though the stand was not the origanal and the packaging was horrendous the monitor itself was working and a nice adition to the one I already had.",

I use them six (sometimes seven) days a week 8 to 10 hours a day and they are still clear and sharp (exactly six years later, 2012) with at 1960x1200 resolution with brightness of 1000. I no longer look at any other monitors except Dell Ultra Sharp or better. Used ones at 200-300 are a bargain if you want quality images on a monitor that lasts. But, that's just me :).",

The image quality is very good, the only reason I docked it a couple of stars for gaming is the speed, its a 60Hz max panel and has a 6ms response time. So on modern games it wont be able to deliver the quality available with modern graphics cards, but for a second monitor or watching videos and work related tasks its a very reliable good monitor. I would recommend buying a used one, no questions asked. It will most likely work great for years to come.",
