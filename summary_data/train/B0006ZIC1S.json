No more moving the triangle from one end of the table to the other. Setup was as simple as plugging everything in and dialing. The Mic Pods have their own mute buttons.

      "text": "This is an amazing device. It worked right after connecting the power and voice cables to the wall. No further setup was needed. The microphones catch human voice from every corner or our conference room. Also, the password protected administrative menu is a plus. Managing the phone book is pretty easy, as soon as you get familiar with menu navigation keys. The only thing I'd wish is that it could be able to be used with a PBX direct connection, but unfortunately it only works with an analog telephone line. I definitely recommend this unit to those that have an analog line dedicated to their conference room.",

We purchased the phone with the satellite mikes, because we often have a group of 10-15 people in one room communicating with 8 to 10 people at other locations. The mikes and the phone work *really* well - just as other folks' reviews said they would. Delivery was exceptionally fast, and the phone and mikes were well-packaged, too.

    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\nRemarkable voice quality. The new standard for everyday conferencing. The SoundStation2, Polycom's next generation conference phone, is redefining the standard for business-quality voice conferencing. With industry-leading full duplex for natural, simultaneous two-way conversation, the SoundStation2 will exceed your expectations in medium to small conference rooms. Delivering remarkable voice quality equal to the SoundStation Premier and a 50% increase in microphone sensitivity over the award-winning SoundStation, users can speak in a normal voice and be heard clearly up to ten feet away -- making every call a more productive call.\n\n SoundStation2 provides users with features, including a large backlit display that offers easily visible call information and telephone functions. Smart technology, such as Dynamic Noise Reduction (DNR), provides maximum microphone sensitivity, while reducing distracting room and background noise. And the SoundStation2 offers 360-degree microphone coverage with intelligent mixing -- so only the microphone closest to the speaker is on for crystal clear conferencing.
