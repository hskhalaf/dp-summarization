As other people have mentioned the vents are facing the sides which cause the wind to blow away the debris. This can be improved by making a cover that directs the air flow to the back of the vacuum. I used some brown paper bag to make my own, but you can use any material you like. Ideally this would be a 3D printed piece but that would cost too much. Wish they would fix this design issue in their next model.",

The soft nozzle scrapes the hair up so the vacuum can get it. I also use this on my carpeted stairs and it does a good job. The only thing I don't like about it is that it blows air sideways instead of out the back, so sometimes it blows what I want to vacuum into the air. They could have designed it with the vents angled back instead of straight out. But overall I would buy it again.",

Was a tedius process, same as any other hand held cord vac I've used for this problem, didn't make it any easier. Tried it on the stairs in the house, same mediocre opinion of ability to do something for pet hair. I'll keep it since I currently don't have a hand held cord vac, but if you're thinking this might be great on pet hair - it's not any different from others, disappointed.",

Great suction on this machine! It picks up hair and fur right out of the carpet. The filter is really easy to remove and clean. It does vent/blow out the sides like everyone has mentioned in their reviews, so for that reason, not sure it would work great on solid surfaces like wood/tile. I'm giving it 5 stars because for carpet use alone, this is working out perfectly!",
