None of those items touched the old adhesive that was left behind. With the 3M spray, I would spray it on let it sit for a minute and then wipe off. On a couple stubborn areas I had to repeat a couple times and use a razor blade, but overall this did a great job. After I was done, I washed the area with soap and water and then waxed it and it looks great.",
