It is purple-undertoned which I have found to be so different from other self-tanners that are orange or green. It looks very natural. One thing I wish it did better was not to wash off as much when you shower. Still, though, over a few days of use, it definitely has a very noticeable/natural tanning effect. I recommend to all of my friends.",

I am happy to say the Vita Liberata barely has an odor, which goes away as soon as you wash it off, and the color is gorgeous and natural. I get a nice, even tan. I'm very pleased with this product and if I had to nitpick I'd wish for a bit more moisturizing version.",
