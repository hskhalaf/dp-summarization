I do miss the down needle function and automatic theater but I can live without it. Dropped off a star for this reasons, doesn't come with a cover, and the light can get warm overall, I'm very happy with it!",

It is lightweight, the bobbin is easy to load and unload, changing pressor feet is a breeze, and the dual post bobbin winder is convenient.

      "text": "Out of the box I loved this machine! I took the time to read the manual to insure I got things right...especially threading the machine and winding and setting the bobbin...the drop in bobbin is a great innovation. All three of these tasks were accomplished with ease as the simplicity of the design greatly facilitates eliminating mistakes. I spent alot of time 'playing' with the machine to familiarize myself with the different stiches and was impressed with the staightforward ease of operation. The stiches are consistent and respond to adjustment. Overall function is excellent from hemming to construction. I am very pleased with this sewing machine!",

After exhaustive search I purchased the Janome Magnolia 7318 and couldn't be happier. It has enough of the manual operations that I am familiar with and the automated operations are easy to learn. I have purchased additional feet; It has done everything I have asked it to do and I am getting better and better with practice.",
