After which, every time we start it, it starts updating and after 45 mins, it says not able to update so starts reverting the updates. This keeps on happening the whole day. So logically we have not used this laptop after 6 months. Will never recommend this s*** to any one. The only reason we bought this one was due to good reviews and light weight. Never ever going to buy ASUS products!!!",

The touch screen constantly spazzes out and the screen is so small that it's not as functional as you might hope it to be. Windows 8 stinks. It just does. Of course it's not ASUS's fault that Microsoft made a crappy OS. But you're the person using the computer and whose \"fault\" it is isn't really going to matter when you're using a crappy system.

It's so beautiful that it's almost a consummated art work. The laptop is light (2.9 lbs.) and with a good price ($549). The touch screen is responsive, Windows 8 run flawlessly, came with a 500 G drive, partitioned into two drives, C: and D:. Office 2007 work beautifully with the touch screen. Another nice feature is that with the I3 Intel third generation processor (Ivy Bridge), there is almost no heat emitted. No matter what program you run, it just get warm, never get hot. I would highly recommend it to anyone.",

There is only one downside to this one for me: it's a bit weighty. If you have any particular questions please feel free to add comments.",

I noticed it when I pulled it out of the box for the first time, then my friend walked in and mentioned the pink tone without me saying anything. \"It's kinda got some pink in it, doesn't it?\" That's all I needed to hear to package it right back up and return this for a less feminine color.",
