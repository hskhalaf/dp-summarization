Looks great and when feeling extra OCD, will do again and again. Am thinking stocking stuffers for Xmas because who doesn\u2019t have a laptop/ computer? Works great for getting grime out of the home button on the iPhone/ iPad, as well.",

Nice little tool that I then used on my TENS unit that is 16 years old. Until I began struggling with adjusting the dials I though it was fairly clean too, wrong, I can now adjust the levels with one finger again. Handy tool everyone should have several around the house for all their electronic gadget or other tight spaces.",
