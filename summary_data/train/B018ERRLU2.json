I am really upset and am not sure where to proceed from here, but I do think future buyers should be aware of this possibility.",

However, utilizing the sun visors of my car to secure the panels to the windshield, I was able to position them in a manner that works. While I prefer a sunshade that suctions to the window, I do like that this doesn't require suction cups that are easily lost. All in all, it's useful and does the job.",

Its as if they were constructed without any idea that a rearview mirror just might be in the middle of the windshield.
