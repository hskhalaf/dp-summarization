My kindergarteners couldn't even sit at this with chairs--they had to kneel down. My biggest beef with this micro table is the storage space underneath. You cannot get to the legos without removing the top piece, which always spills your project all over the floor if it isn't 100% secured to the lego board. Awful! The drawer on a lego table needs to be pull out or easily accessible. This table is poorly designed and now I understand why another reviewer turned around the lid and just uses it as a coffee table.

      "text": "Honestly I had higher hopes for this. The table itself it exactly as advertised. Works really well for toddlers/preschoolers and their toys. Storage is more than enough for quite a few Legos. Be careful around younger kids as their fingers can get caught between the table top and the sides by their older siblings. Con: Lego mat adhesive is about as strong as post-it notes, needs something much stronger Pros: Lightweight, easy to move around, stores toys easily. Works with Duplo and Lego blocks.",

Cons - -Made of particle board. -Legs attach with common threaded barrel type hardware.",

After a few days the screws holding the legs on loosened. 2 of the holes were stripped another one ended up splitting to the side piece. The final problem was that it wasn't truly Lego compatible. The Legos held well in some spots but in other places not even an adult could get it to set in place.",
