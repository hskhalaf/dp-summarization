Between the time of purchase and delivery the price decreased to $10.30 and Amazon was kind enough to refund the $6.66 difference. When was the last time an item was reduced 40%? Is it being discontinued? It's made in Mexico. Have wages in Mexico become worse? I'm tempted to order another. As you can from my pictures, the first broom was well used. I would suggest not leaving it outside. When new, the broom is also good for indoor use on carpets as the fibers are sufficiently stiff to remove small debris.",

Despite very limited usage the broom developed visible gaps in the the fibers within a few months and became useless. I would never buy another broom from this company.",
