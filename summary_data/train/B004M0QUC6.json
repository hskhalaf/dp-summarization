      "text": "This dog house is great! We got it for our cocker spaniel mix puppy. She is pretty small so it will give her room to grow into it. It was really easy to put together. It comes in panels, not individual slats. The instructions are not very helpful but it is pretty easy to figure out. There is a pretty good smell to it when it arrives but I think its just the fresh stain and will be fine once it is outdoors.",

Now if I can just find a way to get the cat to use it :)",
