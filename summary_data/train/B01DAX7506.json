      "text": "My son is a 10th grader who runs multiple events. He usually will not use his spikes immediately in a trackmeet. He likes to break them in at practice. When he tried these on, he said they were so comfortable and the fit was perfect... he wore them on Saturday. The picture does not do justice to the shoe. The shoe is a bright yellow (its helps me to videotape him) and the bottom is a metallic gold. Good shoe so far, now I need to see how long it will last. My son goes through a few pair of track spikes per season.",

Grip is excellent, as you'd expect for a 10 spike, full plate. My school unfortunately runs on a dirt/sand track so these have already seen wear on the pike plate after only two 100m dashes during practice, so I will definitly be using these exclusively for meets. Other than that, which is expected, they are pretty light considering they cary 10 spikes each, and feel even lighter when you're sprinting down the track. Definitly recommend these to any sprinters looking for a high quality sprint, full plate spike.",
