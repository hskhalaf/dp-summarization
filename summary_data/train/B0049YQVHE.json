After setting mine up, I can confirm that it does in fact grant an open NAT to two Xbox One consoles simultaneously.

I did upgrade the firmware right out of the box and ran into a minor issue with that process but it was my error and not the error of the unit. I recommend you follow the ASUS instruction and on-screen prompts exactly to prevent frustration. My previous routers had trouble disconnecting and going off-line often. This one is very stable. I am never dropped on any of the devices we have in the house. I highly recommend ASUS routers for fast, trouble-free service.",

Only problem is that the 5GHz signal drops off significantly when I leave the room where it's located, so I use the 2GHz setting most of the time.

I have found a strong correlation between T4 timeout occurring on the DOCSIS modem and RT-56U losing WAN connection. When T4 timeout occurs, cable modem reboots (standard behavior), and this inadvertent reboot seems to be causing a confusion on RT-56U. Hope this helps you fix the issue of this otherwise great router.",

I have a wood-frame house, and the Cisco signal would die off in my bedroom, just over 40 feet away. With the ASUS.. I'm able to stay connected across the street! There is a custom ASUS firmware available from padavan (google it). ASUS makes their source code available for download, this makes it much easier for devs to make custom firmware (unlike other manufacturers). I'd recommend this to anyone who games and plays HD video. It's been rock solid as well, no reboots needed!",

      "title": "Free Dynamic DNS service through Asus!",
      "text": "My old router is constraining throughput to 50Mbps upstream and downstream. Bought the Asus because of its fast WAN-to-LAN switching speed. I'm getting 80Mbps+ up and down out of the 100 Mbps offered by my ISP. Pretty happy. Turned wireless off because I don't need that right now. My favorite, unexpected part about this device is that it has its own DDNS service through Asus. Since the dyn.com's free service JUST ENDED, having the free DDNS service via Asus is great! You get a <your-domain>.asuscomm.com address to map your IP to.",

      "text": "Bought this unit after reading the good reviews both on Amazon and other review sites. It worked as expected and on the 29th day, started to act up. My devices started to lose connection every few minutes. Got an error message about my IP setting which a number of reviewers on Amazon have also complained about. Thankfully, I was still in the return eligible period with Amazon so returned it for a refund. Not sure if it was the particular unit or a bad batch from Asus. I may move to N-900 since I am still looking for a router with above average reach for my wifi intolernt house.",
