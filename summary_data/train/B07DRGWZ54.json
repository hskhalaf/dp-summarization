These unfortunately aren\u2019t really the same. :-/ the stitching inside kinda rubs right around the baby toe and isn\u2019t very comfortable. They are also a bit tighter, and I am not sure if it is because the material is different. My last ones were canvas and these seem to be a smoother material with an elastic stretch, so they are tighter all around. They are cute and cute on, but unfortunately, not comfortable, and I don\u2019t think I will be purchasing another pair when these wear out unless they start to stretch out soon.",

Unfortunately, these have a very poorly sewn and thick posterior seam. Normally, I can wear bandaids to prevent cuts from new shoes a couple of times and then they're broken in. Not these. The seams sliced through bandaids and heel tape and still cut my heel up. This bloody mess was the worst in the first wear but still happened each wear thereafter. They never broke in so I've had to quit wearing them.",
