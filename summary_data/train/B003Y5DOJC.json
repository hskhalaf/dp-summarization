I had my concern that the plastic release lever would be broken by the boys but it held up well even when they really yanked on the string. One Note of Caution: this needs to be used on a level service, if the ground is not level, then use some wood to level the launcher. All its vital that you use the U-clips to secure the launcher to the ground. Finally don't forget to lubricate the o-ring that seals against the bottle. I used a compressor at 30 PSI setting to charge the launcher, the compressor was tremendous time savor.",

We were able to get about 40 ft of altitude instead of the advertised 100. My granddaughter was still thrilled by the device. I am not sure how durable the plastic parts will be but there have been no problems through 10 launches. I am experimenting with the amount of water in the bottle to see if I can get more altitude with the lower pressure. The recommended one-third bottle full of water is just too much. One-quarter, or perhaps less, seems to work better at the lower pressure.",

You may be able to prop the legs up at a slight angle in order to get some distance, but it does not seem to be very stable when done that way. Overall, no complaints! Just an area of improvement after having the launcher. Works great!",

I recommend using something to lube the o-ring on the launcher so that bottle doesn't get stuck. A little cooking spray or something similar works well and only has to be done once. About 1/3 to 1/2 full of water seems to get the best height, but takes more air.",

      "text": "It's better than nothing, but the spring mechanism that holds the rocket down is way too weak. We tried for about an hour and never got a \"proper\" launch sequence to work, despite not even pumping up to the recommended pressure in the provided documentation. A quick trip to the hardware store to replace the spring would turn this into a great product.",

Pressure release valve was supposed to open over 50 psi, and this thing breaks at 25. Trash!",

It worked great, the bottle went very high, and he loved experimenting with varying amounts of water. He even had great success without any water (just air pressure). It comes with a horseshoe shaped wire that anchors it to the ground (great added safety feature). I would highly recommend this......even dads will like this!",
