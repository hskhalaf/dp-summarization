One eyeball is TWICE the size of the other Stitching is sloppy and uneven. It's really poorly constructed. They don't show you the LARGE STIFF LABEL ATTACHED TO ONE SIDE AT THE SEAM, so once this gets pulled the whole thing comes undone.. This should be included in the seller's photos. Not only is it ugly and makes the toy look tacky, but it's the weakest point on the toy because of the construction. Doubt there's any catnip in this \"toy\". What a bunch of fibs.",

Sadly.. \"little shrimpy\" is not looking so good these days so i wanted to get another. The cat was thrilled, i just don't think for the size (smaller then 2\") is with the $7+ that i paid for it. If you mark these down to $3 or so i will order a dozen!",
