It's a very strong toxic chemical smell that didnt go away or lessen even after leaving them outside for 24 hours. I didn't try washing them, but I doubt that would do anything because the smell is embedded in the fabric. Item is made in China and all the tags are in Chinese.",

Very happy with the product. Would recommend it to a friend. Just as a recommendation, measure the child before ordering. They tend to run big.",
