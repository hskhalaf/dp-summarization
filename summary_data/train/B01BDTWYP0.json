      "text": "BUYER BEWARE !!!! These pans will work well for about 4 to 5 months. After that, the ceramic coating or whatever the coating is will start to wear off. Then everything will stick to the pan and good luck cleaning it. The company's response is to soak it in hot water and that will loosen it up so you can scrub the pan. When I asked for a refund or replacement, they just referred me back to Amazon and they reminded me that there is a 60 day limited warranty. So much for the \"MAGIC CHEF\". DON'T BUY IT !!!!!!!!!!!",
