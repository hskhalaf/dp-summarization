I still have to put a thin coat of mascara because my lashes are too light (and tinting didn\u2019t work)... but, so much better. I don\u2019t like the traditional eyelash curlers... too Pinchy! The only downside...been a couple months and had to replace battery already.",

I just didn't see really great or better results than a regular eyelash curler. I also think the regular eyelash curler is a bit faster as I hold the heated curler longer and I do a second pass.",
