The pair I have has what looks like springs that provide traction so I don't know about losing pieces on my walk.

The snow pulls them off. So, they are easy to lose when you are out for a walk in the winter. (2) They do not grip on hard, smooth ice. (3) They don't last. The rubber often breaks and so does the coiled steel cleat. If they were priced at about $5.00 they would be worth it. Lose one or it breaks, no big deal. But at $20 a pair--waste of money.",

The advantages of Yaktrax is that they won't ruin a carpet or wood floor as some of the other products have sharp cleats and thus cannot be worn indoors. The weakness of the product is durability. The rubber underneath and the spiral metal will break with time.",

Took her out a couple of weeks ago and the path we use was completely iced covered due to a couple of warm days leading to snow melt. Uncomfortable and anxious walk. Bought these cleats a couple days later and have used them 3 times since. Feel much more confident walking on that path now. We'll see how they hold up but I have been happy so far. Easy to put on and take off. Should have gotten them a while ago.",

The two sets of yaktrax that I received both broke on the first walk in which I used them so I am back to using my 2014 yaktrax. It is a good product but perhaps they changed manufacturers and now the quality is subpar. If it simply happened on one pair I would chalk it up to unlucky but for it to happen on both pairs strikes me as a quality trend. I will probably go with a different brand going forward.",
