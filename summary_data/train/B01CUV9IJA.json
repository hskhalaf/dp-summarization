It did take a while to lay the wire so that it would cut a narrow strip across the sidewalk and another area on the other side of the drive. I checked it out last fall to be sure it cut every area and got through a narrow passage on the side yard. It has cut my yard 4 days a week from 8am to 6pm and has done wonderful job. I would recommend this mower to anyone too.old or too hot for mowing. My neighbors are amazed at the job it does.",

You spend $1000s on this thing, and it can't keep itself together through MINIMAL use. And Husqvarna appears to go out of their way to make sure you don't get to use a warranty claim, meaning your initial investment isn't even the last of your spending on this thing. Whatever you do, buy another company's product - it's likely less expensive, higher quality, and better customer service.",
