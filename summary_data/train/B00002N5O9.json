The only downside is that I find the bubble level to be pretty much useless and I don't see why it's even included. The axis upon which the level works is based on the length of the black handle attachment...only 3-4 inches. It's difficult to determine levelness of anything substantial when the reference edge is so small. Just get rid of it!",
