A properly hung hammer should have almost the entire surface area of the wood inside the eye in contact with metal, not just a little at the top and bottom. It takes careful hand work to make that happen. The grain orientation was about 45 degrees on my handle which isn't great. If you mention stiletto on any job site you will hear many stories of heads flying off handles, it's because they make terrible handles.",

I babied it at first but then abused it like a regular hammer after the first month or so. I broke the replacement on day 1 I just broke my second replacement 2 wks later. I will not be purchasing another Would rather order a new stiletto and it would be cheaper!!! The original handle was made of stronger wood!",

Currently I am waffling between giving Stiletto one more try or just letting it go. I gave this two stars as the handle has a good feel when driving nails (though most nails are shot in these days)",
