The Follow-Me capability is enough to make me smile in that the older model was a standup unit that continually fell over whenever you moved from one spot to another. That issue is gone! The added pressure helps a lot and the adjustable wand and heavy-dirt wand perform their mission flawlessly. Highly recommend this item for any homeowner who wants a kick-aXX cleanup tool!",

If you're looking to spend a hundred plus bucks and only use one season - you're in lucky, this is what you want. We however thought it would be good for a couple of seasons, washing down the side of the house, maybe the car & truck. NOPE - HUSBAND WENT TO MENARDS, PURCHASED A NEW POWER WASHER... and it was cheaper and works, unlike this pos",

Cord is long, bout 30ft or so. Pressure hose is about 16ft. Vadio nozzle isn\u2019t positional. The Dirt Buster is orbital high pressure wash. Not sure if I will run into other problems like other buyers. Warm Hawaii weather might make it last a little longer. Will update if a problem pops up.",

Has excellent power in a small package -- so far I've mainly used the variable wand to control that. Connections are sturdy and water-tight. Can store two wands, the power handle, and the electric cord -- just needs a way to store the water hose (which must be stored separately and so can be lost in the garage!). Highly recommend it for the homeowner!!",

Same for he vinyl railing. Need to try it out on my new truck. I'm sure it will be great. Also worked well on the aluminum siding on my house.
