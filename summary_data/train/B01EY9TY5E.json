After using it for everyday for the last 16-months, there was a West and tear with the leather buckle, and I feel it was quite normal given the friction that particular part goes thru day in and day out. For the $$, durability, and make of the product, I was extremely satisfied and highly recommend this to anyone interested in a good leather strap. The fit was seamless and product was above and beyond what I was expecting.",

      "text": "This is an excellent quality leather-like band. It looks and feels similar to real leather. Definitely note the brown is more orange-like in person, but this is clear in my photos and other customer images. Installation was insanely easy thanks to Apple as well as this band\u2019s compatibility. I was very surprised by how sturdy the band feels. Putting on the watch and taking it off feels very secure and does not feel like it\u2019s bending the material; a problem I have with many expensive actual watches. The band is tightened, loosened and removed with total ease. Great price, great value, highly recommended. I will update this review should the material prematurely decay...but note the free lifetime unlimited warranty!",

Luckily, there was no damage to the face of my watch. Below is a picture of the watch band after five days. Very disappointed. UPDATE: Amazing customer service! When my review had been published, they promptly contacted me and sent me a replacement band without any questions. I was astonished by how quickly they resolved the issue.",

I will say the leather does scuff a bit because it's so smooth but it doesn't bother me. The scuffs don't show on the black one I bought. They only show on the brown one because of the color. I would buy it again and will probably get more colors. I like to switch them out depending on what I'm wearing.",

I wouldn\u2019t necessarily recommend wearing for workouts as the leather looks unprotected on the underside and sweat will just cause staining and eventually small odor.

I guess it is safe to say that the classic features are the best; this watch adjusts to any size wrist with the belt type closing. I say this because I have bought those watchbands that are magnetic and do not need to be locked, but these are the worse because I move a lot and I have to constantly adjust the band so the watch does not fall off. So far, I have more than 5 months with the same band and I still looks good on my wrist.",

This Alligator grain band seemed like the best combination of quality, style and value. It is a comfortable, well made watchband and looks great with my space gray Apple Watch. I would buy it again.",

After less than two months of intermittent wear, a screw popped out of the watch band. Fortunately the watch fell on a soft surface and was not damaged. I sort of fixed the screw, but it still appears loose. I am afraid to wear it for fear the watch will fall and break. To update, I called Amazon. They arranged a \u201creturn\u201d. The amount of money being offered was less than what I paid for the band and I was responsible for return postage. It was not worth returning it. What a rip off!",

I'm going to order a couple more in different colors!",

If you\u2019re looking for a little more business casual or just casual look, then I think this is the perfect material and color band. Not to mention it\u2019s unisex - several mornings I wake up to find the band missing because my boyfriend took it. I guess it\u2019s time to purchase a second one! Definitely a great product for a great price!",
