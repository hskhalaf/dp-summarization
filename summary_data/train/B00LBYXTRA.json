The shoe around your foot is comfortable but zero shock absorption cancels that out. The leather is cheap pleatherish material and loses its form within days. This shoe is about the same quality as a 40 dollar Walmart shoe. The only differance is the Walmart shoe will have a sole that will fall off and this shoe has a sole that feels like a brick.",

They are SO comfortable--no one notices I am wearing 'tennis shoes'! This is a quality product. Have owned a great many New Balance models--the most expensive are not always the most durable, or give the best ride. Of all NB's owned--this is the BEST IN SHOW.

      "text": "As the other reviews have stated, these do squeek more than I'd like.... The reason is there is a hard plastic \"roll bar\" across the sole in the heal. The soft rubber sole and the harder material flex and squeek... That being said, my feet tend to roll (pronate) when i walk, which over time aggravates my plantar fascitis causing foot pain.... Thanks to this \"roll bar\" technology, it limits that rolling, so my feet don't hurt anymore. I can tolerate the squeek to be out of pain. I expect maybe some silicone lubricant spray around the roll bar insert may help reduce or eliminate the squeeking, so I'll give that a try.",

And, one thing is missing and that is the ventilation holes. The shoes are hot. I first thought they were not real leather, but everything says they are, but they don't breathe at least in a warmer climate. They are not as comfortable or as supportive either.
