But I was at home and hadn't used itin over 12 hours and it came in by itself (no water in it). Thankfully I was home and heard it (it was loud enough my dog was barking at it) and unplugged it.

I really reccommend this product specially for mothers of multiples. I'm using this in Panama (110V). I would say that the only con is that the steam exit can burn your skin (common sense) and be careful, don't direct it towards the kitchen furniture.",

I wish I would have been smart enough to get this or register for this awesome invention. I do like it better than the bottle sanitizer you put in the microwave. I don't recommend leaving the bottles in it after sanitizing because they don't dry. And I also recommend washing the sterilizer a couple of times a week. This is an awesome gift for anyone!

There is residue built up if you do not clean it properly. I usually just take a paper towel and clean it. I'm sure there are more better ways to clean it, but works for me. It doess collect residue which i was able to clean at first but now I can't get rid of it.",
