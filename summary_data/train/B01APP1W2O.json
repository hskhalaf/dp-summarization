There is a cavity there that allows water and presumably food to accumulate. Unfortunately, there is no way to clean or dry this area. That's a deal killer for me, I packaged them back up and sent them back. I like the looks of the set but I don't recommend them due to what these lids can become after collecting water and food for a while. Do yourself a favor and pass on these.",
