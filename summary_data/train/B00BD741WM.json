I'm not sure all these issues were 100% due to the food, but I switched her to a grain-free, limited ingredient brand as soon as I felt I could. (I'll review that product separately.) On the new food, her coat is gorgeous, she rarely itches, and she seems full. Of course it costs 3x as much, but Pointer Sister is worth every penny! :)",
