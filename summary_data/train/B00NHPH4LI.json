And the nostalgia value for someone that grew up watching the superfriends on Saturday mornings is priceless. However, gave 4 stars because the toy is made of really cheap plastic and ultimately it doesn't really do that much (although the hall of doom does more than the hall of justice). But for the price I guess one can't expect great build quality or a lot of bells and whistles. Good buy overall.",

We have the Gotham Jail and Superman playset. This is similar to the Superman set. It has some fun items, but not nearly as much as the jail. I still would purchase again at the price point I did.
