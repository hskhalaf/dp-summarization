      "text": "This is a wonderful medicine cabinet. It's fits perfectly in the bathroom, lots of space for things. The shelves are not adjustable. Why 2 stars? The mirror is defective. I have a beautiful newly renovated bathroom with a defective mirror. I contacted customer support to see if they will just replace the mirror, since the contractor has already installed the cabinet and completed the project. I can replace a few screws on the mirror, but don't want to mess with the placement of the cabinet itself. This post will get updated based on the customer service from the vendor. I hope they do it right :) (11 Jun 18).",

      "text": "The 24x30 inch croydex looked nice. However when my contractor tried to install it, the top hinge didn't click in and the cabinet wouldn't hold up. It kept coming off the hinge. And realized its impossible to reorder just the hinge part as its from the UK. The part alone is like $50 and then to deliver it. Wouldn't make sense to just order the hinge as the whole cabinet cost about $130. So, poor me out $140 and the time and effort my contractor spent trying to install it. Definitely wouldnt buy it again.",

It looks like the glue holding the mirror on the front is giving way and the mirror is going to come crashing down. In addition, we had to get new hinges for this mirror to install it since the ones it came with could not support the weight of the mirror door. Minor hassle, but still something to consider if you don\u2019t have access to a specialty cabinet store that sells theses type of slow close hinges.",

That ran past the return period, else I would have returned this flimsy cabinet. The door is much too heavy for the cheap hinges, so even if you can get it installed, it's only a matter of time before the door sags. That's if you're lucky. In our case, we couldn't even get the hinges to hold at all, and it was clear the door was going to fall off. They're pressure-snap hinges, and the spring wasn't strong enough to \"snap\" the catch into place. I'd never purchase a product from this company again.",
