I'm happy to wear them out and about in bad weather, and they're stable on slippy ground, though for really rough terrain you might want something that also supports the ankels.",

      "text": "These are the most comfortable walking shoes i've ever owned, i love them.The sizes are very generous, so i ordered a smaller size, so it may be advisable to order a size smaller than you normally take. They're also very sturdy & would last for years i'd imagine. I'm on my second pair at the moment, because i made the mistake putting them in the washing machine, big mistake! They shrunk to approximately a full size smaller. They have a faux suede finish so are best brushed with a suede brush.",

      "title": "Lovely shoes, poor fit",
      "text": "I love these shoes. I had a pair years ago and wore them loads so decided to replace them at last. My feet have got larger, due to pregnancies, since I last purchased a pair so initially ordered 6.5. These were too small as my big toes touched the end. Next I ordered size 7. These were fine on the length but they slipped off really badly at the heel so sadly had to return both pairs. My feet are average width in Clarks but these seemed far too wide for me.",
