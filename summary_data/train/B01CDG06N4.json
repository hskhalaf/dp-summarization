The fan is low profile enough that it doesn't make my low ceiling obvious. It is really quiet on all speeds and powerful. Overall a good looking sturdy fan at a great price point. My only concern would be if something happens to the remote there is no other way to operate the fan/light. Another reviewer mentioned facing the Hunter logo away from view which was a good call since I wanted the fan to wash into the white ceiling.",

If the lights are on, they momentarily become brighter. The light flashing issue makes these fans impossible to have on while sleeping.

      "text": "I absolutely LOVE this fan. It works wonders. My bedroom is relatively large, but it keeps the whole room cool, despite what the A/C is set at. I also have never heard it make a single noise. No rattling, no swinging, no screeching. It\u2019s a very quiet fan. The remote is great to have, but I\u2019m giving it 4/5 stars because sometimes it\u2019s not very responsive. Many times, I have to press the light button 2 or 3 times to turn on/off the light. This is my only complaint. Other than that, the fan is absolutely wonderful.",

Not really a humming but more of an odd buzzing. We run our air purifier to drown out the noise because it's highly unlikely we would ever take it down. Wish products would be of quality and not routinely defective. Does Amazon use product testers? With all of the cash taken in every minute of every day I would expect no junk is being sold. But that's hilarious, right?",

If appearance is the issue, locate the switch near the \"Hunter\" logo. Most people make sure the logo is facing away from the room entry to preserve the fan's sleek appearance.",
