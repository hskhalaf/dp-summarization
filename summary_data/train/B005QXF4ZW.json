The length is also great. It covers his entire hips. The fabric is thinner than other rashguards I have bought, perfect for hot weather. My husband is 6 ft tall and weighs 225 pounds. He usually wears a size 36 or 38 pant and a large dress shirt or XL t-shirt. Also, the white is pretty transparent. The new blue is a very dark navy. My favorite was the ocean color. I put a striped colored underwear underneath the white so you can see it's somewhat transparent.",

I'm going snorkeling and kayaking and finally found a rash guard for a girl with, well, \"girls\" (DD). It's long on me, but I'm short, so I'm not surprised by that and I honestly prefer it. I also could potentially have gone one size smaller. I've worn it for aqua fitness and it isn't so loose it billows up, but it does allow me a full range of motion without feeling like a sausage through the bust.",

Accurate sizing if a little on the big side; it fits like a t-shirt so size down if you wanted it more fitted. It also feels a tad softer & lighter than the usual fitted rash guards. These came without stickers or tags, not sure why. Other Speedo products I've ordered (including swim tees) always come with tags and stickers. Not a big deal but something to note if you wanted to give it as a gift. Without tags there is no explanation about its SPF properties.",

I prefer a loose fit long sleeve swim shirt and at 6'4\" and 230 lbs it is difficult to find one that is both long enough (body and sleeves) and loose enough without it being too baggy. After going through a number of brands both expensive and discounted, I'm convienced the Speedo offers the best value for what I'm looking for. My only very minor and admittingly nit picking issue is that the collor of the shirt is a little wider than I would prefer but not so bad that it looks ridiculous.",

After the first wear to the beach and one wash, it started to fray on the sleeve. Speedo was nice enough to replace it even though it was worn (thanks for the effort). The same thing happened to the replacement although it took two or three washes this time. Obviously I wasn't going to try to return it again after 2 or 3 washes so now I have a $25 shirt that I only wear to bed b/c it looks deplorable.

Washing the shirt didn't remove the stains at all. For a product that is meant for outdoor activity, it really should hold up to sunscreen better than it did. The sunscreen was a common brand, so we're not talking about any strange chemicals.",

So much better than the compression and it doesn't look like he's hiding a thing! We ordered him an XL, he normally wears a TL, but could have done with a L.

I'm 5'9\", currently a dismal 185lbs, and the medium gave me a pleasant T-shirt fit. I did not attempt to wear it under my wet suit. For diving, I took it off and stuffed it in my dry bag when I was ready to put on the upper half of my wetsuit. I do wish there were more color choices.",

Also, for sizing, definitely go one size smaller than what you usually wear (I normally wear a Large in all of my shirts, but upon reading some of the other reviews I decided to order a Medium and it fit really well - a Large would clearly have been way too big on me).",

Over the course of two weeks, I got it utterly filthy, and it always cleaned up well and didn't stretch or tear.",

The only thing I could really ask for is a higher neck for more sun protection. It just has a regular crew neck.",

I applied sunscreen to my legs about every 45 min & still got burned but under the shirt was great. It totally blocked the sun.",
