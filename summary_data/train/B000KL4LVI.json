There are places that need to be pruned such as around the propane tank so that I can safely navigate with my walker to check the fuel levels. After reading the reviews for this clipper / pruner, I purchased it and today I used it for the first time. It worked wonderfully for me - - both for the smaller overgrowth like vines and the more fibrous type growth. I highly recommend this product for anyone, and especially anyone who has a medical / physical challenge.",

      "text": "Nice trimmer. I wish it cut larger branches, but works as advertised. Don't plan to cut a branch larger than a pencil, the pruner doesn't have the leverage or strength to cut through. I think part of that is caused by the plastic \"holders\" to grab the cuttings. It looks like those can be removed by screws if you don't need to hold the clippings, then it might cut larger items. For small stuff, like poison ivy vines, it works great.",

The handles for the cutting action are sturdy and comfortable. A new favorite tool for me.",

And you must hold the pruning stick at 90 degrees to the branch you are cutting. It does not swivel. For pruning bushes with soft branches no higher than you can hold the stick level, this might work. But it does not perform well for other plants and trees. Better is to buy the Corona pruner listed for about $45 on Amazon.",

Pruning tree branches was a different story though. I found it cut through 1/4\" twigs very well, but trying to cut anything thicker than that was nearly impossible. I would not recommend this pruner if you need to trim anything thicker than 1/4\" from trees or bushes. JJM",
