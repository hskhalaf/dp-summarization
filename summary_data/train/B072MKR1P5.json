I got this game on amazon here for $28 which seems like a great deal but even at that price its not worth it: HOMOLOGATION That one word ruined the whole game. You'll never be able to mod and then race a vehicle. I'm honestly not sure why they even kept the modification part of the game in as even a simple aerodynamic bumper disqualifies vehicles from races. You're better off finding another game to play. Hopefully Horizon 4 isn't like this.",

Very frustrating to buy a game that is completely unplayable. Edit: There was a 30+ GB update that solved this issue, so the game is playable now. I do really enjoy the game, however now I\u2019ll sometimes start a race and the is randomly no audio for the race. If you quit the race and start again it usually works, so it isn\u2019t something in the sound settings.",

Graphics wise the game is on par with GT sport on my ps4pro but feels a lot faster due to 60fps rendering. I think to benefit from this you have to get an oled tv, my samsung 4k hdr tv is not cutting it. Otherwise, the gameplay is good and I'm ok with car homologation.
