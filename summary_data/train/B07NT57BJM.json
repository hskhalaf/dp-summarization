      "text": "Really disappointed with this item. Bought to aid sleep on hot nights as advertised as one of the quietest available. No chance of sleeping with this on in the room or even in an adjacent corridor. Cools the room it's in reasonably efficiently but not the adjacent room. I live in a small self contained two bedroom flat. If set at max cooling in the hallway it makes the hall cool enough but has little or no effect on the rooms. Be warned, this is also an extremely heavy item and very bulky, especially with the venting hose attached. Tried to return and got a flat refusal from Ryness Lighting & Eletrical",

Unlike a few other budget portable air conditioners this think is remarkably quiet! Not much louder than the fan when the compressor is running. My partner won\u2019t sleep with the noise of a fan so unfortunately can\u2019t leave it on all night. That said the temperature and just as important humidity reduction it brings will be a godsend if we get any more hot nights like we did in 2018.",

At night stick it on 30 minutes before bed and room is nice and cool. Can put on dehumidifier mode for a flow of quieter cool air. Remote range is bad, and it just works quirky, if you press the button but are out of range the remote display says one thing and the unit another. TBH remote is more trouble than its worth. Not having to empty the condensation tank it a great feature. Overall a good solid unit.",

I\u2019m familiar with air con units and haven\u2019t had this problem with other Delonghi units. Very very noisy also - beyond the usual fan and compressor noise: lots of high pitched whines and other sounds. I\u2019ve owned several Delonghi units before and never had any problems.",
