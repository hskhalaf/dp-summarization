      "text": "Awesome desktop speakers. Some complain that other speakers get louder or deliver more bass output, but neither of those are objectives of the MM-1. Rather these speakers are designed to deliver clean sound in a narrow sound field only inches from your seating position. Who wants to be blasted out of their seat while working on a document/spreadsheet or browsing the web? That's what a full fledged receiver/floor standing setup is for; for which B&W also has numerous great sounding offerings. For a high quality/sounding desktop computer speaker these fit the bill perfectly. Highly recommended.",

The clarity and richness of the sound, especially non-amplified polyphonic vocals, like madrigals, are pure magic. I've made only one improvement: put speakers on a thick piece of natural rubber. It helped to get rid of the \"barrel\" effect of the low frequencies resonating in the space below the desk, which was especially noticeable with orchestral and organ music. Probably, a better quality desk wound not have had this problem :)",

String quartets, piano sonatas, choral and vocal music: they all sound clear and natural throughout the dynamic range. You can't expect to blast something but they get plenty loud. The bass does not thump but is clearly resolved. I had a pair of Focal XS computer speakers, which were also very good --and played louder--but I think the MM-1s are clearer and better for classical and jazz music.",

    "description": "Style:Hi-Fi SpeakersTrue Hi-Fi speakers, shrunk to fit on your desktop. \n\nMM-1 speakers are not like other computer monitors. Built with attention to detail and craftsmanship, they transform your computer into a Hi-Fi sound system, using technology taken from some of the best-sounding studio speakers in the world. To match the most stylish of desktop environments, they look great too. The perfect companion for desktops or laptops, enjoy your computer audio as never before. \n\nThere\u2019s an art to producing big sounds from small speakers. Digital Signal Processing (DSP) constantly adjusts sound balance to keep bass effects powerful and music sounding rich and detailed, no matter how loud you play it. Along with built-in DSP, the MM-1 takes audio straight from USB and handles digital to analog conversion itself. This cuts out the soundcard, so you'll always get the best audio quality, independent of the computer output. \n\nComputers belong at the heart of your home and at the heart of your home entertainment. Today's PCs and Macs are used to store and stream movies, high-resolution music and more. MM-1 comes in a small package but it brings true Hi-Fi quality sound to your desktop, so the multimedia content from your computer sounds its very best.",
