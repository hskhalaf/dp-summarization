Now it may hold the gears to the paper but the paper will slide around messing up your little designs. I highly recommend getting push pins and a cork board (or cardboard) to keep things steady.",

It's also made of very cheap flimsy plastic. I couldn't get it to do anything. My niece called it junk and she was right. Just throw your money away at least you won't be disappointed.",

The pens are mediocre and could be better quality, but considering the price, the set is ok overall, although the plastic spirographs are not quite as good as the original that I remember. She likes it nonetheless and is enjoying making various shapes and drawings. 4 stars",

      "text": "This is a fun activity that lets you be creative. There are endless possibilities for designs. The main drawback is the putty that you use to hold the ring in place. It is dry and hard and can raise the ring too high so that the center disc doesn\u2019t work. In the old days there was a plastic anchor you put under the paper that worked much better.",

The only problem with this is that as i'm doing the spirograph deisng the inner gear slides out every time. I'm not trying to give a bad feed back and don't get me wrong, I like it. Maybe I just have to get it right. I will still recommend this to anyone.",
