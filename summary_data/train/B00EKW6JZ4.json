All of the online help is geared for people who are initiating scans from their machine with a connected USB, which I have to assume is approximately zero people. I recently dusted it off again in the hope that new firmware might fix the pile of broken things, but nothing seems to have changed.",

Always feeds at least two or more pages together. I scan so infrequently, I didn't discover this for several months. Because of my lack of need for multipage scanning (very rare), have decided to live with it (hand feed it) at this late date rather than deal with the hassle of returning. Buyers beware. Read the reviews. I'm not the only buyer to experience this problem.",

Lousy document feed scanner for 1-sided or 2-sided scanning of documents. Problem with feed guides that do not keep document aligned resulting in document slippage and bad copies. Have ruined some docs because of this. You need to set on high scan resolution (e.g. 600) and slightly hold doc as it scans which is a disadvantage for wireless scanning. Also had issues with wireless scanning. Only real benefit is is size and ability to do 2-sided scanning.",
