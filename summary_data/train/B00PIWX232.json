      "text": "I'm nearing the end of life for these shoes. They will get 400+ miles without any issues. For me, that's the sign of a good product. I'm a fan of Saucony in general and was able to get this pair at a pretty good price. They are pretty supportive (which I need with my weight and weekly mileage). I have low arches and all the issues associated with them, but find Saucony are about the best shoes for my feet. I mostly run on hard surfaces but have done some trails with these shoes also. They breathe well and are fairly light considering the amount of cushion (well engineered).",

      "text": "I ordered these shoes for my son who is a runner on his high school team. They were very comfortable and gave good support. However, after having them just a week and worn only for a couple of 5-mile runs the green rubber pieces glued on the bottom of the sole started falling off. I checked and found others not so well glued beginning to let go. The failure of the pair I got was obviously caused by a manufacturers defect. Given the high ratings these shoes received in reviews I assume my case was isolated. I am really bothered that the manufacturer would let such a serious defect come through their quality control though.",

This pair however has fallen apart under less than 25 miles of light walking. I am very disappointed with by this. My full review is that I love this model; hence the reason I went back for a third pair. The shoes are extremely comfortable right out of the box and stay breathable and comfortable even 10 after 10 miles of straight running. I am also disappointed with Saucony because they will only return or exchange unworn brand new shoes. I suppose they don\u2019t care much for customer loyalty.",

The shoes fit well though the size is a half size larger than other brands I wear. They are used almost every day to run 2-3 miles distance or intervals. Used only for running and workouts each pair has lasted more than a year which seems pretty reasonable give the price. I retired the first pair when the heel pads began to split and the mesh along the toes starting breaking through. Surprisingly, the cushioning of sole/insole held up really well after hundreds of miles so no complaints.",

The 8 is a great sneaker I just feel that the 6 had a bit more arch support; that\u2019s not to say that Ride 8 doesn\u2019t. The material is thin but not cheap and overall this sneaker is very light. It\u2019s actually very similar to the Guide 8. In terms of competitor comparison, I think it\u2019s on par with the Nike Vapormax Flynit 3. (Just at half the price) It\u2019s very good for long jogs. I would buy this again.",

I was thrilled to find these on Amazon for half the price and re-ordered my 2nd pair as these fit WAY better than the newer model Ride's - seriously, I tried out the new Ride for $120ish and returned and bought the Ride 8 again......love this shoes. It is more cushy and not as aggressive feeling as some shoes though.",
