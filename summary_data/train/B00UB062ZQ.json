Second, I use nylon cable sleeve to hide all the cables; three HDMI, three power cables, one RCA cable and two speaker wires. Also had to use 270 degrees HDMI angled adapters to gain back space due to the speakers connectors & HDMI inputs on the back of the amp.It came out the way I planned it. Few pics attached.",

Also, the shelves are too small for a stereo or av receiver so really what's the point in running wires up to a blue ray player or a cable box from a receiver that's located elsewhere?

Also just got a new motem after switching providers.. but there is wires stuffed into the rack and we plan on putting more. I think its very nice and durable and super easy to put together.",
