I have had this laptop for a few weeks now and I had my fingers crossed that it would get better with time but it has not. I have downloaded the Netflix app and it wont even let me open it. It takes 10 minutes to open internet explorer. The mouse pad is slow and rarely does what you are trying to do. When I bought this laptop I was very excited as I had read most of the reviews online before buying it but, I would not recommend this laptop to anyone. Sorry DELL",

Tried to reset manually and just keeps going through a loop trying to reset. Giving up! Best thing about it is the colour!",
