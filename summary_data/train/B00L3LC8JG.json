At any rate, I will not use it again. Hopefully, my daughter can use it. If not, it gets dumped.",

It doesn't leave a greasy feeling and doesn't leave you looking shiny. It hasn't clogged my super sensitive pores, and has really no smell. A total win for me! However, it does leave a white residue if you're not careful, and can make your face look paler than normal. Since I'm the color of a piece of paper anyway, it doesn't matter to me, but I can see how anyone with a tan might not be happy with this.",

This is the BEST zinc product I\u2019ve found in relation to shearness. If you know anything about zinc based products, you know a white shade is typical. I don\u2019t get that with this product. I deduced a star because I also get the slight sweating mentioned in other reviews. It typically happens immediately to 10 minutes after application but is brief and does not leave film or anything. I do not wear face makeup daily, so it is not an issue for me. Excited about a daily zinc product!",

I literally have to sit in front of a fan and dry my face after I apply it before I can apply my makeup. Then when I sweat outside it burns my eyes and I have never had this issue. I will use up this bottle because of the price I don't want to waste it however I will not purchase it again.",

I also did not find that it had an offensive odor at all. In fact, it has no added fragrance, which is partly why I purchased it. If there is any odor to it at all it is very, very slight and natural smelling. Additionally, I have often found that sunscreens irritate my eyes, but did not find that to be the case with this sunscreen.",

    "description": "Color:Umbra Sheer\n\nTHE DRUNK ELEPHANT DIFFERENCE \nWith a mission to deliver clinically-effective, clean skincare products formulated with both cutting-edge synthetic and natural ingredients, Drunk Elephant knows that every ingredient should directly benefit the health of your skin or the safety of the formulation.\n\nUMBRA SHEER PHYSICAL DAILY DEFENSE SPF 30\nIt's difficult to formulate a physical sunscreen without using chemical screens or silicones, but Drunk Elephant has done just that. This physical sunscreen is formulated without any chemical sunscreens, which can be sensitizing and not as beneficial to skin as the naturally-derived alternative, zinc oxide. Umbra is non-irritating, non-sensitizing and is suitable for all skin tones and types, including the most sensitive.\n\nNO FRAGRANCE \nAfter carefully balancing the best ingredients available, Drunk Elephant doesn\u2019t have to add anything to mask their natural scents. When you smell their products, you will likely detect nothing but a glycerin base with slight hints of Marula oil, Zinc Oxide, Thermal Mud, Fruit Enzymes, and Vitamins for a refreshing and reassuring scent.\n\nBREAK THE CYCLE \nYour skin is left vulnerable with the overuse of harsh exfoliates, chemical peels, expensive laser treatments, Botox abuse, layered foundations and powders, and chemically-laden beauty creams. There\u2019s nothing wrong with an occasional beneficial beauty splurge here and there (when appropriate), but it can be a vicious cycle that is hard to stop.\n\nCOMMITTED TO CLEAN\nDrunk Elephant is committed to using only clean ingredients that either directly benefit the skin\u2019s health, or support the integrity and effectiveness of their formulas. You\u2019ll never find the \u201cSuspicious 6\u201d (Essential Oils, Drying Alcohols, Silicones, Chemical Sc",
