      "text": "I got the one without the touchscreen, because a) touchscreens are a stupid gimmick that our kids will laugh at us for in years to come, and b) the non-touchscreen version is a better spec. Otherwise, nice feel to the keyboard, bit of an odd-looking mouse though - looks like it's fallen off a stealth bomber. The fact that you can upgrade the RAM and things is nice. Oh, and for the avoidance of doubt, it has a wired keyboard and mouse. The wires for these are rather long so prepare yourself for a rat's nest.",

Still trying to get used to Windows 8 so can't really comment on its functionality so I will reserve my biggest criticism to the large number unwelcome apps which populate the homescreen; so much so that I'll need to get someone to configure the computer for the use of a six year old.",

This was a great transition for my mum who is not the best on a computer but can work an iPad (go figure) So this helped greatly! Having the touchscreen allows her to touch it if she needs something rather than using a mouse... and the large tilted screen is perfect for those with poorer eyesight. Installed with windows 8 it is quick as lighting and does everything perfectly. Not that the work my mum does on this is earth shattering... it is still a fair amount , and this computer keeps up with it brilliantly....",
