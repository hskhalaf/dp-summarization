Mine does not, unless I jam it in there with all my might. Mine is also slanted. It is what it is. Just know that this is not top quality, but it will work if it's all you've got.",

I havent had one issue with seals on the glass and shaker part - the slightly off center fit is what is neccessary to create the good seal to shake drinks. It really is a great product. The accessories are not the highest quality but they do the job. I like th emuddler and I actually do like the 25 ml and 50mL measuring cups as many recipes call for mLs instead of ounces. it's helpful.",

I replaced them into the proper cutouts and taped them in place for gifting. I didn't see measure markings on the jiggers so the novice mixologist will need to think about the proper part measure ratios for drink recipes.",

That was an extra nice touch; particularly with their British accent...but I digress. Now I am going to make sure this weekend has a few cocktails included thanks to my Win-Ware Boston Cocktail Shaker Gift Set. You won't be disappointed! Highly recommend!",

The stainless steel shaker and the little measurement glasses were poorly made (we had to use sandpaper on the edges of them so they would not cut our fingers when washing them). The shaker would not fit the glass properly and it would not create the required seal to mix the cocktails. The spoon had black stains on it and they would not come off after washing it. The only good thing about the kit is the glass. I would not recommend you to buy this kit at all.",
