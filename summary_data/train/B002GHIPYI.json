      "text": "The Superlux 681 does almost everything right. Great imaging, good soundstage, good tight bass and sub bass with real impact, and nice smooth mids. But that treble... The treble is like broken glass, nails on a chalkboard and a sharp knife rolled into one. No amount of EQing or padrolling will tame it. So these headphones are a definite no-go for music. For gaming on the other hand.... They're great. Since games are not going to assault you with constant sound, the sharp treble doesn't offend, and the great imaging and soundstage really shine. Unfortunately these don't have a detachable cable, so things like the ModMic or V-Moda Boom Pro are out of the question. You need a separate mic.",

Better sound, quality and add yourself some Brainwavs XL's earpads and you are golden. Best bang on the market right now.",

The comfort really bears repeating! Also, they let in *just* enough of the outside world to let you hear yourself talk, which makes them great for use with a desk microphone (so you aren't shouting because you've got headphones on).",

After a while though, the clamping force is a little too much and the ear pads are uncomfortable and can cause irritation, but with replacement pads these headphones are amazing for the price.",

      "text": "Really nice headphones. I'm actually pretty surprised. I thought my sound card was bad. My speakers always made a hissing sound. Put these puppies on. Go figure, I just have sucky speakers. These are comfortable, inexpensive and the sound quality is amazing. I know there are probably better headphones out there, but I'd be hard pressed to find this quality at a lower price. ($29 at the time I bought it) They might be a tad big. The little plastic doodads stick up a bit. But it's like complaining that water is wet. For $29 the quality is there. I've had $30 headsets that were plain junk. (my skullcandy headphones literally fell apart).",

      "text": "I received these for christmas this year and they've been great. I've used them with my ipad, ipod, blackberry, pc, and my tv for playing xbox and watching tv with them. They have great crisp sound and fantastic bass as well. They're self adjusting which is a nice feature. Comes with a 3.5mm jack with a great screw-on 1/4\" adapter as well. They are made out of plastic, but I'm only noting that in case you were expecting metal. I actually want to get a little headphone amp for these because I doubt my devices are driving them to their full potential.",

      "text": "A surprisingly great sounding HiFi Headphone for 30-ish dollars. Its sound quality is really jaw dropping for its price range. Its sound signature can compete with headphones in the 75 to 100 dollar price range. However, its clear that at 30 dollars they had to cut corner's somewhere and that place is materials. While being pretty sturdy its clearly made of fairly cheap materials. Also the sound while Bright can occasionally on certain recordings can easily veer into the harsh department. However these Can's respond well to EQ so just round that treble off a bit on the end and you get Astounding bang for buck.",
