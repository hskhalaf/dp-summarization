      "text": "I use to hate crack climbing, but then I got these gloves! I would highly recommend these to anyone who uses tape (these will save you time and repeated tape protocols) or doesn't like crack climbing because of the painful pressure spots that tape doesn't help (much). I've had numerous friends try them and buy their own pair. Downsides: 1) it makes your hands wider (which is not always a bad thing, particularly if you're in a slightly larger crack). 2) nothing else",

Obviously they make your hands a bit thicker. Half the time that's great. Half the time that sucks. But it's much easier to take the gloves off to get thinner hands than it is to suddenly sprout thicker hands!",

The tape gloves did the trick, and because I re-used the glove I didn't use too much tape, just enough to tape them to my wrist. However, once I put them on I would leave them on all day even if every climb wasn't a crack climb. I have tried other crack gloves in the past and they always felt much thicker than tape gloves. The Ocun's feel very similar to tape with the added benefit of being able to remove them for routes where they're not necessary.",
