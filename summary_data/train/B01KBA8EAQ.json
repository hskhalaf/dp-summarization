While it's intended use is for my husband, who has no problem trimming and leaving his beard hair all over the bathroom sink, it's technically for me... I get so frustrated cleaning up his mess so I decided to purchase this item is a gift to myself. I was extremely pleased that it really works, there's no gimmick. Comes in very nice packaging so makes for a great gift and small enough to store. Highly recommend. You won't be disappointed.",

I use my Beard Bib anywhere 2-4 times a week and cannot live without it. Not only does this serve a big purpose in my trimming routine but now I no longer have to argue with my girlfriend about all the mess that I USED to create. Also, we ordered a beard oil recently and reached out to customer support about the different scents they offer, they were super helpful! Overall it has been an awesome experience and they\u2019ve truly made me feel like a King!",
