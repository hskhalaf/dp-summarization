I seriously feel like I'm floating in air after a minute or less with this. I only need to use it once maybe every 2-3 days. I have started incorporating it into my meditation routine.

The only problem I've had with the product is the stitching on the velcro needs to be moved or made smaller on the device itself so when it's worn the velcro isn't rubbing into your neck. One last issue is the stitching on the outside is popping and coming loose, maybe from too much inflation?",

DaviSMART does retain its shape when inflated if the metal valve instructions were followed. Instructions were at the back of the sheet. Closing the metal valve after inflating should be part of the instruction steps for use. This is a great device once I understood that the metal valve needs to be closed. Nice product!",

I do not deflate the device to remove it, but still need to repump it in order to reuse it.",

It's obviously not a permanent fix, but it gives me relief when I need it the most. Highly recommended!",

As I struggled to breathe, I dropped the pumpy thing and couldn't look around to find it.

If you think you need something stronger and more automatic check out the $200.00 to $500.00 section. It will take around 40 to 50 pumps, depending on the pressure you like, but I can use the exercise. I think some of the negative reviews may have been due to lack of following directions.",

I purchased this at the recommendation of a friend who is a physical therapist (he suspects I have a pinched nerve in my neck) and am hoping this THIS is the answer to relieving my neck pain/strain. Super easy to use and well constructed although it does get very warm after about 15 minutes.",

Not sure it is doing precisely what a medically traction device does, but it seems to relieve neck and shoulder pain after a few minutes of use. Well worth the price tag.",
