The zipper on the large suitcase (which was not packed heavily and was not therefore under any zipper strain at all) burst open on the last leg of the trip, so after 29 hours of travel I was greeted by a pile of my clothes spilling out on the luggage-claim conveyor. Bonus, a gift that I had brought home for my wife had fallen out and was nowhere to be found. I've returned these and will be buying something that's actually durable for my next trip.",

The walmart set 25 inch was also a spinner, which this set isn't, and came with the rolling duffel. Plus the lining on the inside covered the entire inside and zips shut. This set the liner is a flimsy badly sewn piece of fabric with a few Velcro squares to hold it down.",

The backside doesn't have hard support, it is just the cloth, I don't think it will withstand the harsh handling of airlines. In transit anybody can easily poke the backside and take whatever inside.
