I have to wear at least one more sweater or fleece underneath to feel any kind of warmth in subzero temperatures. My wife has the kind with a puffy jacket underneath and that jacket is much warmer. I\u2019d suggest that jacket over this any day.",

The one thing that bothered my is that the texture of the inner lining is not smooth, so it tends to sticks on your sweeter or whatever you are using under the jacket. Not a terrible thing but annoying after a while.",

    "title": "Columbia Sportswear Men's Bugaboo Interchange Jacket with Detachable Storm Hood",
    "description": "We've added our patented thermal reflective technology to this classic winter Interchange jacket, delivering an even warmer winter weather fighter with layering options galore. The technical outer shell is waterproof breathable, with adjustability at the hood, hem and cuffs and the new zip-in fleece liner features thermal reflectivity, which reflects your body heat for warmth while maintaining a high level of breathability. Each piece works as an outer layer on its own during moderate conditions, or wear them together when you need the jacket's full storm-fighting power. How to Measure: 1. Neck: Measure at the base or thickest part of your neck. 2. Sleeves: Start at the center back of your neck and measure across the shoulder and down to the wrist. Round up to the next even number. 3. Chest/Bust: Measure at the fullest part of the chest, under the armpits and over the shoulder blades, keeping the tape measure firm and level.",
