My only disapointment is that a premium priced Point & Shoot camera like the S60should not have been shipped without a SDHD memory card (even if only limited capacity!). Make sure you buy this camera AND a SDHD card at the same time, without the card you will have only 9 or 10 photos before you must delete or download to your computer.",

I would recommend this to anyone who wants a great picture and is not familiar with having a digital before.",

With 10 megapixels you'd expect a picture to be crystal clear, but our old Cannon was 7 MP and took better photos on a lower setting than this does on it's highest. Also, the touch-screen, which we thought was a great selling point, is very frustrating to use. I would especially not recommend it for older people, just to zoom in and out with the touch screen vs. actual buttons is much more difficult that you'd think. Overall we could not recommend anyone to buy this product.",

    "title": "Nikon Coolpix S60 10MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Vibration Reduction (VR) Zoom (Burgundy)",
    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n Nikon\u2019s sleek, sexy Coolpix S60 combines 10.0 effective megapixels with an amazing 3.5-inch high-resolution, customizable touch-panel LCD that makes composing and sharing pictures easy. The Coolpix S60 has a 5x Zoom-Nikkor glass lens and, combined with Nikon\u2019s Optical VR Image Stabilization system, gets you sharp pictures throughout the zoom range. In addition, Nikon\u2019s EXPEED image processor is optimized for the Coolpix S60 and will ensure high-quality pictures with stunning color and sharpness. Use the camera\u2019s HDMI capability to take pictures in 16:9 format and display them in an HD Pictmotion slide show, with music, on your HD television! \n\nCoolpix S60 Highlights \n\n10.0 megapixels for stunning prints as large as 16 x 20 inches. \n\n5x optical Zoom-Nikkor glass lens lets you zoom in on all the action. \n\nOptical VR Image Stabilization minimizes the effect of camera shake. \n\nNew beautiful, bright 3.5-inch touch-panel LCD offers a 170-degree wide angle of view and enables easy access to all the camera controls without the conventional series of buttons to push. \n\nCustomizable touch-panel display enables easy operation with a choice of three different Home displays, plus allows you to write a personal message on your photos with the included stylus pen. \n\nSlim, stylish, metal wave surface design slips right into your shirt pocket or purse! \n\nAuto adjusts up to ISO 3200 allows you to keep shooting, even in lower light without having to use flash. \n\nNew Scene Auto Mode will automatically a scene and adjust the cameras settings. \n\nSmile Shutter and Blink Warning makes sure you\u2019ll always catch the decisive moment when your subject smiles and blink warning will let you know when your subjects eyes are closed so you can retake your picture. \n\n\n\nREVIEW FROM WIRED.COM\n\n\n \n\nRead more digital camera reviews\nat Wired.com Pocket Digicam Looks Good, But It's Too Touchy \n\nWith its high-gloss metal case and giant 3.5-inch, iPhone-like touchscreen, the Nikon Coolpix S60 just begs to be touched. But your lust will turn to disgust once you get to know this camera's internal quirks. In this case, beauty is only skin deep. \n\nIt's immediately obvious that the S60's touch panel is what separates it from other point-and-shoot cameras. Other than the power and shutter buttons, all of the camera's controls are accessible by touch command. You can give the camera the finger or use the included guitar-pick-like stylus. \n\nTapping the icons, menus and submenus takes you through the camera's many settings and picture modes. While some of the icons are easy to interpret, others require the 170-page manual be close at hand. The Scene Mode alone has 19 icons to choose from, including modes optimized for shooting food and museum art to dusk/dawn portraits and fireworks. You can even draw on pictures using the stylus. Although these sketches can be fun (look! Aunt Sally has a mustache!), they tend to look pixilated when transferred to a PC screen or printed. \n\nAs with the iPhone, a simple flick of your finger on the S60's screen lets you scroll through the images in the camera's puny 20MB internal memory or its optional SD card. And with its gyroscopic sensor, merely rotating the camera will change the image view to either portrait or landscape orientation. But unlike the iPhone, the wide screen (which extends all the way to the edge of the camera's case) offers little space to hold the camera without inadvertently touching a setting or activating the zoom or wide-angle functions. Sadly, there is also a lag of a few seconds for some settings to execute, adding further frustration to the interface. \n\nThe camera's optical image stabilization is a handy--and necessary--feature, along with distortion control and white-balance controls. Still, photo quality varied from sharp for well-lit outdoor shots to not-quite-sharp, unintentionally soft-focus images. The 30fps .avi videos offer excellent sound but grainy images. And you'll probably need a backup battery since the one included can poop out after only about 70 shots, especially if you use the touchscreen often. \n\nFor the casual user, Nikon's Coolpix S60 is a fun camera to use, especially with all its built-in settings for specific shots. It's the perfect party companion--but if you take it home with you, you'll probably wind up being disappointed. \n\nRATING 5 out of 10 \n\nWIRED Sleek and sexy. Fairly easy to use: Its iPhone-like touchscreen is appealing. Respectable 10 megapixels. Compact and lightweight (just 5.7 ounces). \n\nTIRED Images aren't very crisp, unless they're well-lit outdoors shots. Short-lived battery. Overly wide touchscreen leaves no room for your fingers to hold the camera without inadvertently switching settings.  * Read more digital camera reviews at Wired.com",
