It's a non-sense that the product has all the connectors and slot in keyboard area instead of monitor area. When the monitor is disconnected from keyboard, it loses connection to external memories causing the functioning very unstable. I believe SD momory slot and at least one C-type USB slot has to be located in monitor body.",

I love the keyboard. Only the battery life on the tablet alone is far less than I had hoped. I get about 2 hours (new) of use without having to re-dock the screen to the keyboard.",
