The test of a good antiperspirant is: Is there any under your arms when you get your shower at night? If you notice that it is still there, it is still working. I am not talking about caking it on either. I am talking about one or two swipes. Dove lasts all day with an active lifestyle (competitive runner). Excellent product!",
