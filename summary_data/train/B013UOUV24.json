Another important thing to note is that the bristles didn't scratch my shoes AT ALL!! This was a great purchase to protect my investment!",

I only have one pair of tennis shoes that sometimes still have a little mud in them, but I think that has more to do with the shoes. They have really deep rubber treads on the bottom which allows dirt and mud to get stuck in them. This gets about 90% of the mud out of those and all of the mud out of everything else that I wear. This was a huge help as I am constantly tracking mud in the house (It seems to rain almost every day at my house and our grass is patchy).",

      "text": "Dirty boots but too much in-n-out of the ol' household to bother removing your big kickers constantly? Get one of these. Mount it next to a tray of water and dip-brush-done. Works like an absolute charm, and it'll save you tons of time vacuuming up your own mess. The bristles are heavy, the steel and wooden construction looks good and is very sturdy, and the mounting method (4 large wood screws) is mechanically sound. Help clean up your act and get one! You'll USE it...trust me.",
