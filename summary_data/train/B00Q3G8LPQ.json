This mount holds the smaller and lighter S8 well, but the Note does not feel as secure and I am afraid of it falling off (though it hasn't yet). This might be because of the slightly thicker case and I will be trying a different case to see if that helps. I do love the low profile and it attaches very securely to the air vent; it's just the connection between magnet and metal plate that is weaker than I'd prefer.",

I suggest putting the metal plate in the case first and trying a few places before sticking it permanently. I found that I needed the metal plate a little lower to use the NFC features of my phone. I will recommend this to anyone looking for a good dash mount that is stable and not a real big eyesore. Only thing I would do it add the new wireless charging to this, will need to by the new models out that support wireless charging now.",

      "text": "I have gone through several car mounts for phones...some with sticky pads, some with suction cups, and some with adjustable grips that don't work very well. This is so clever. Your phone, no matter how big or small, snaps to it in a millisecond, and you're off! It works best with car vents that are horizontal. It does work on vertical vents, as I tried it in a rental car on a business trip, but the potential for it to slip is a bit greater. Overall, a great product.",

I use the larger metal plate which creates a very slight budge in the back of the case. The iPhone is held securely by the magnets and the clip-on for the vent fins holds the whole setup securely to the car.
