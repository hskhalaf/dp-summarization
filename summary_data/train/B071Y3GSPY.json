For the price, this tracks, though could be even cheaper to the end-user. My pets choked up the larger pieces that were hard, fibrous skin they could not chew easily. Would not recommend for smaller pets and would not be substantial for larger breeds.",

    "description": "Delicious 100% Salmon Dog Treats Created By Real Dog Lovers\n\nAs dog lovers, we want the very best for our pets. Sadly, when we went looking for treats, we couldn\u2019t find it. Mass produced dog treats are often incredibly unhealthy and devoid of nutrition, or made from low-grade ingredients that dogs just don\u2019t enjoy. So we went all the way to Alaska to create the best treats on the market from prime chunks of freeze dried salmon.\n\n100% Human Grade Salmon \u2013 Made In The USA\n\nMost other \u201csalmon\u201d dog treats are made in China from fish guts. We wanted better than that for our dog. So we\u2019ve only used whole, prime cuts of human food grade salmon. You can pick up these chunks and see for yourself that they contain nothing but salmon. You could even soak them in water and see the same type of salmon that you might get on your own plate!\n\nSalmon \u2013 Nature\u2019s Superfood For Dogs\n\nSalmon is incredibly healthy and packed with nutrients, especially Omega 3 and Omega 6 fatty acids. These oils are essential for pet health, and your beloved dog will benefit massively from them. As you use these treats, you\u2019ll begin to see your dog becoming healthier. When you see your pooch\u2019s coat getting shinier and your dog becoming more energetic, you\u2019ll also know that the internal organs are in better health.\n\n100% Money Back Guarantee\n\nWe wouldn\u2019t give these treats to our dog, Ginger, if we didn\u2019t think they were the very best. We\u2019re confident that you and your dog will agree these treats are the healthiest, safest and most delicious dog treats on the market. If you don\u2019t, we\u2019ll be more than happy to give you a full and immediate refund. No hassle, no delays, and no questions asked. \n\nGet The Peace Of Mind That Comes From Knowing You\u2019re Feeding Your Dog The Very Best \u2013 Pick Up These Salmon Dog Treats Today",
