Maybe its just me, but its pretty lame to have extra buttons that dont work. If ur not cheap, go for a Razer instead... ~Viperbird~",

I can say now that I have purchased this mouse without regret. Install is easy though I haven't yet explored all the ins and outs but I am satisfied to say.",

Want to get before they discontinue. =)",

Very annoying - I returned what was left of the mouse and received my money back and all this trouble was in two weeks time, save your money and get a logitech mouse.",

I don't think the third button has a real use, however. The real problem lies in the fact that the left mouse button has become nearly useless. Every other click now either goes unregistered or double-clicks. This is apparently a very common issue, as I have discovered a lot of online forums concerned with this issue. I've gone back to my Dell optical, and will probably never buy a Creative mouse again.",
