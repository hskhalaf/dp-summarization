      "text": "This decibel meter is well built. I use it to measure sounds coming from machinery at work. It does the job. Its rugid enough for field work too. Im starting to see tacklife makes some quality products. To the touch, the meter is soft and buttons are easy to use. My only complaint is that it uses a 9v battery instead of standard AA that i always have a regular stock of. I dont think i will be changing batteries often since this isnt a meter that will be heavily utilized so its ok.",

This meter was well-packed, seems very accurate compared to other consumer-grade products I have, including APPs on my phone, and does the job of occasional level checking in our church sanctuary very well. It would be nice if it provided an \"averaging\" function (one of my APPs does that), but I knew it wouldn't do that when I bought it and am not at all disappointed for this price. Excellent DB Meter - better than expected in this price range.",
