Seems like rechargeable battery technology is a real problem area for a lot of companies. Maybe I should be happy that this thing didn't catch on fire like a cell phone or a hoverboard.",

I love the design of the blower, it is light and easy to use, but the battery is worthless. I have waited to long to return it so I'm stuck with it now and will have to purchase another battery!! So if you have more than 15-20 minutes of work to do I would not recommend this product.",

I can get through 2 or 3 trailers before it runs out of juice plus several days in between before I get to my next trailers. What's awesome is it takes only 30 minutes to fully recharge so if I have to wait I will just wait out the time do paperwork and such and it's ready to use.",

Of course, the battery will discharge after 20 minutes of use, even faster on high speed, which is overkill anyway. That is easily managed with a 2nd battery in rotation, same as one would do with a drill or saw. I am pleased with this product and hope Worx adds a 56 V chainsaw to the line.",

The lowest setting is plenty adequate for blowing leaves, sticks, etc. At that setting it even starts to blow pebbles, dirt, and gravel, which I didn't want. I imagine at the highest setting it's run time would be shorter. I didn't test this. But for the amount of blowing power I need it is fine. Wonderful not to bother with gasoline or cords.",

If you tried to use this to blow leaves out of grass I don't think it will have the power to do this well. Even if you cranked it all the way up the battery drain at the highest setting drains the battery in about 15 mins. It's the best of the battery-powered blowers but battery power simply isn't as powerful as gas-powered. For spots where a corded blower isn't practical or you dont want to fire up the gas-powered --- this works great.",
