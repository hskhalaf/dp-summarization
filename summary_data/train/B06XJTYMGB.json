My wife bought me a single one of these and after two days I bought the 4-pack. Now I keep one at work and one at the fire station in addition to my house. They really work.",

I've had one for over 10 years. Unless you lose it, this is a one time purchase. My dad left his on the roof of his car and drove up the street. It fell off and someone ran over it with a lawn mower. I found it. He still uses it. Works fine.",
