Many of its wearers are in agreement that this low-top is light and comfortable.\u00a0While most of the feedback is about the exterior, a few also commended the moderate cushioning and arch support. While most of the reviews are positive, buyers have to be aware of the possibility that the TOMS Carlo runs large.",

        "Many commenters implied that this footwear is an excellent choice during holiday strolls, specifically on urban areas",

Just something to be aware of - it might be a bit smaller than you're expecting if you order a half-size.",

Odd though, the right shoe was loose around my heel and I squeaked when I walked. The Mrs. made fun of it to the point I bought a heel insert. Anyway, other than that, comfortable shoe, and just a little less casual that the other Tom's I usually buy. Easy to wash, just remove the insole and dunk them in cool water with some mild soap for a few minutes and air dry overnight.",
