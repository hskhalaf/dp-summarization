Driver issues were a headache but even once I got those (kind of) sorted out, the tablet is basically useless. Pen pressure doesn't work in Photoshop, and above, the seller lies and says that this tablet has tilt functionality. It does not. If all you want is a basic, decently sized tablet, then go for it. Otherwise steer clear.",

The pen is light, and the tablet is great quality. I am hoping to buy a parblo monitor tablet soon.",
