It is bigger than I envisioned, but that is fine. Unfortunately there are a few issues. First, the canopy frame is bent out of shape, which I will try to fix myself. Second, the rub rail and one of the seat backs arrived already rashed up a bit; nothing to do about that I guess. Finally, one of the paddles is cracked and broken. I will contact the seller (or hope they contact me after reading the review) and request a new one.",

I bought a cover which seems to fit well but blows up on the sides with heavy winds letting the water in. I took the advice of another reviewer and added velcro which helps. Next year we'll leave it up on shore with the plug out during the rainy season. We have found that it's best to alternate who pedals cause every person has their own speed. And it's quick to respond to the rudder.",

If not, it will be waterlogged and move slowly on the water. It is a bit hard for me to do on my own because it is heavy and bulky but two adults can manage the task easily.

Bought a Minn Kota 30-36 ( 30# force and a 36\" shaft) and it works good, as an assist or by itself. The grandkids love the boat and never seem to run out of energy. We don't give them the trolling motor option....Super price and really fast shipping. we received ours 5 days after on-line order.",

Its small size does not move enough water which makes it harder to go anywhere. The boat itself is not that heavy. However I ended up selling it and bought kayaks instead.",

For two adults, it is balanced very well -- with just one adult however, it seems to lean quite a bit to that side. Not sure how it would be out on the lake vs pond with just one person. It is very lightweight for its size and we look forward to many years of use!",
