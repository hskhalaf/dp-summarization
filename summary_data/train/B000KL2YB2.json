I had purchase my first house at that time and complaining about a \"beat up but sold to me as new\" product was the last thing on my mind. While the product i received worked ok, i was expecting to receive a \"new\" product which is what i paid for. The difficulty of returning something this big is surely what they are taking advantage of. Your QC people needs to be fired. Im now in need of a step ladder. I dont even know if i should go with this company again.",

The ladder is unstable and unsafe because one front leg is longer than the other. The right leg is 72-3/4\" long while the left leg is 72-1/2\" long. Therefore the ladder is VERY wobbly. The feet are riveted to the ladder and are not adjustable, so this manufacturing defect is unrepairable. I would normally have requested a replacement, but Louisville's quality control is so poor that I'll have to buy a ladder in a \"brick and mortar\" store so that I can inspect the actual ladder",

So, if you're hanging a ceiling fan, two people can't be on the ladder at the same time working on something high-up near the ceiling. However, with that downside stated, everything else about this ladder is great! A magnetic areas on the top for nails, screws, bolts, etc. A holder for your drill, screwdriver, and other tools so you don't have to keep balancing them on the top of the ladder or keep getting down every 2 minutes to get a new tool.
