In my opinion, this is a must play current gen game before the onset of the next gen consoles/games later this year. Treat yo self! Even play the game on easy mode if you must.

By not trying to follow the exact storyline from 1998 aids in adding a dark moody story that in itself is not overly original but works well enough to be entertaining and keeps the remake from being predictable. Except for a few annoyances(will not say as to keep this spoiler free) the game is nearly perfect form. If you are a fan of the originals or never played then I would say pick up a copy and plunge once again into the horrors of Racoon City and Umbrella Corp.",

    "description": "The genre-defining masterpiece Resident Evil 2 returns, completely rebuilt from the ground up for a deeper narrative experience. Using Capcom\u2019s proprietary RE Engine, Resident Evil 2 offers a fresh take on the classic survival horror saga with breathtakingly realistic visuals, heart-poundingly immersive audio, a new over-the-shoulder camera, and modernized controls on top of gameplay modes from the original game. The nightmares return reimagined for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Windows PC on January 25, 2019. In Resident Evil 2, the classic action, tense exploration, and puzzle solving gameplay that defined the Resident Evil series returns. Players join rookie police officer Leon Kennedy and college student Claire Redfield, who are thrust together by a disastrous outbreak in Raccoon City that transformed its population into deadly zombies. Both Leon and Claire have their own separate playable campaigns, allowing players to see the story from both characters\u2019 perspectives. The fate of these two fan favorite characters is in players hands as they work together to survive and get to the bottom of what is behind the terrifying attack on the city. Will they make it out alive?. Installing games from disc when you insert a game disc, the console checks to see whether the game is already installed. If it is not, you\u2019re prompted to install the game. Note You may also be prompted to download an update to the game before you can play it.",
