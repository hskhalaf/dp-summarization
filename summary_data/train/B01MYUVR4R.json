I may have had to change the battery once. Original review July 2017. This thermometer takes very quick readings, I also like the display.

It has many other uses as other reviewers have stated, but it shouldn't advertise itself as being able to do something it can't. We will be returning it. False advertising, Amazon!",

      "More Accurate: With built in 12 laser pointers to accurately aim at, non-contact digital laser thermometer only need 0.5s to accurately measure temperature of the target at greater distances; D:S=12:1. Infrared Thermometer could adjust emissivity and set alarm max",
      "HD LCD Display: Clearer and bigger data display makes this ir laser thermometer gun outstanding, especially in the dark; Also has UV light which can be turned on and off independently; Auto power-off activates after 25s of none work",
      "Temperature Bridge Alarm: The indication of temperature gun turns red when the measured temperature exceeds the set range, which could easily detect if the set temperature is reached or exceeded; Support Degrees Celsius and Fahrenheit (Battery is includeded)",
      "Wide Temperature Range: Infrared thermometer accurately test the temperature during -58\u2109 - 1022\u2109 (-50\u2103 to 550\u2103); Accurately and quickly measures surface temperatures, ambient temperature and dew point temperature without contacting",
      "Versatile Use: The infrared thermometer can be used for cooking, home cooling, measuring heating food, barbecue, car repair, home maintenance and repair, or other household tasks. PLEASE NOTE: This thermometer is NOT used to measure body temperature. PLEASE read the website description clearly before purchase."
