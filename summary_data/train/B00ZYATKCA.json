The camera is just way too slow from the time you power on to shoot and the battery life is way too short on both the camera and the phone to simply leave it on all the time. Secondly I find that it's not stable, is fiddly and doesn't always connect. I'm going back to buy another OMD for everyday use and likely sell this one on eBay.",

Problem is that when you buy it from the country it is not officially available you have a problem with software for you mobile device, because both Android and iOS apps have limited country availability. There are also minor issues with connectivity, sometimes image on a screen is freezed for a few seconds, sometimes it disconnects and needs rerun. For nerds there is a big plus of SDK and detailed documentation to create own app for using this camera.",

Also need to be improved is its operation, that is very sluggish sometimes, at the point of become unusable for a short period of time, which can be VERY frustrating if you lose that special moment, but for the specific use I'm applying it, it is awesome. The possibilities of uses and angles you can compose your shots is something to be pointed out, because of its size and the fact it is wireless.",

      "text": "This novel camera is beautifully built and solid,and certainly performs well. It cries out for us to try new things with it, taking advantage off its unobtrusiveness, lack of shutter vibration, and the ability to control it remotely. I hope that Olympus will eventually upgrade the software so we do not have to play with both wifi and Bluetooth. So far I have used it with Olympus 45mm f1.8, the 12-50mm zoom and 12-40mm f2.8 zoom, and focus is quick and accurate, and the photos are as good as from my OM-D. It works equally well with iPad and iPhone. Next it goes on a telescope, but that needs more time.",

Though like the concept very much. Will be taking it on a holiday trip in the coming weeks and will find out how well it goes. Camera needs also a small tripod, got myself a small Manfrotto, believe this will work fine.",
