It's silicon strap is incredibly handy, holds probably a couple of days worth of wipes and the section to \"pull them out by\" (<- techincal term there) works great. If you live in very hot, dry climates, the case doesn't keep the moisture in for days on end, so be aware that if you've packed the case, left it in the car for a week (as an emergency stash) it may not be as wet as you'll need later. However, as your go-to to keep in your daily diaper bag, it works fantastically.",

However, the button to pop open the wipe dispenser is very long, so it will often open up if something randomly hits it. Also, you can't pack it too full of wipes because the dispensing mechanism does not allow for them to come out easily without ripping (I use huggies wipes). If I could get the dispenser from the Pampers Aqua Pure, on the Oxo Tot container, with the Huggies wipes, it would be perfect lol.",

(I didn't want to lug around a completely full package of wipes in the diaper bag all week) Every day before we left our room, I filled this dispenser with enough wipes for the day (it holds maybe 15-20 wipes) and that worked perfectly. It's super easy to open for refills, and even easier to open one-handed to take out a wipe when needed. It doesn't take up much space at all in my small diaper bag and it has a strap if you want to just hook it onto your stroller handle or whatever. I love this thing and will definitely continue using it long term.",
