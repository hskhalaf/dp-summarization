The original organizer I received had one of the Velcro pieces sewed on the wrong side and I didn\u2019t receive a waterproof cover. I emailed the company and got a quick response. They were happy to send me out a new organizer and informed me that they weren\u2019t including the waterproof cover because people didn\u2019t seem to use it / be pleased with it. She went out of her way to search for a waterproof cover for me and send with the new organizer. Excellent organizer, wonderful customer service!",

However, I don't carry fragile stuff in my car, so I'm not too worried about it. I have it in the back of our 2008 Honda CR-V and it takes up less than half of the trunk space.",

The canvass is pretty strong and it seems to hold it's shape well. You can also pull out pieces if it isn't configured the way you want it. As nice that it has the hooks to keep it from sliding around. The velcro help but sometime I like the reassurance of those hooks.",

I know because I used to work in a CD Case manufacturing company and the quality of plastic ranges from Virgin to Recycled A, B, C and .. so forth in terms of grade for impurities... This .. yeah... if you dont really mind the smell then it is not bad. Durability: The overall box dimensions are pretty good. I would say the walls could have been thicker. The cover that it provides is super thin. It is practically useless. Even a shower cap is thicker. Bottom Line: I think you should look at other products...Not recommended for purchasing.",

However I personally was expecting it to be bigger which is the only reason I gave it four instead of 5 stars. Other than that this was a great buy and I will still recommend it.",

I guess I just got too many stuffs, big and small, in the trunk. So now I am very pleased for having the organizer! I may provide more reviews in details after using it for a while. However, one thing I could tell right now what I dislike about the organizer is the handles, which does not feel comfortable enough when holding. I think it would be better if the handles could be wrapped with something like the one on a backpack making the hands feeling more comfortable when holding the organizer.",
