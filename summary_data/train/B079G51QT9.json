It will let you use them for the first 60 days, after which it blocks your ability to print. You are then required to use the Brother genuine rolls, which are prohibitively expensive.

Its built-in automatic heavy-duty cutter is ideal for handling large print jobs and provides a clean, professional edge when using continuous tapes.\n\nThe Brother QL-1110NWB label printer offers flexible connectivity, featuring Bluetooth wireless technology, (Ver.2.1+EDR SPP, BIP, OPP, HCRP and iAP/MFI supported) Wired Ethernet and Wireless (802.11b/g/n) interfaces.
