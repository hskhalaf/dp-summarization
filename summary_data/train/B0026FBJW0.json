      "text": "Pleased with the classic Ugg look; I will wear and enjoy these shoes. Sad that younger people will not enjoy the quality lining that the original Uggs had--the switch to Ugg \"purewool\" is a big disappointment (it seems to be a blend of polyester and something else). Further displeased that the Seller lists several countries the lining might be produced in (only one is Australia) and actually did not include the Phillipines (clearly listed inside my mocs as the place the lining was produced). So.....if you want a pretty comfortable, cute moccasin, this shoe is still for you. I will miss the luxurious comfort of the past!",

First off someone with a box cutter cut through the leather on the side of the slipper that I received- not good quality control. The 8 was too big but instead of getting a 7 I just returned them because the sole- although made of rubber which is why I felt spending $100 on these slippers would be worth it- the sole in my opinion is crafted too narrow. One wrong twist and I felt like I would break an ankle. Very disappointed.",

Very good fit for me as I ordered a narrow , which is hard to find in any footwear. Might be a smidge too large for other wearers, but great for me. Only negative is that the fluff wears down and moves around a bit - bunches up around the toes. Maybe there is a way to fluff it up again but have not researched yet. Also, I sprayed a scotchguard inside and out, just for protection from moisture and soils.",

This means that the rawhide laces sometimes have to be retied, but I don't mind. The soft feel of the sheepskin fleece keeps my feet warm and dry - no sweaty feet. Eventually I know the lining will wear out so I'll need new ones, but as of this writing I'm going on 17 months of daily wear and love them as much as I did the first day.",

I should have returned them but if they keep my feet warm & offer some arch support, it will be ok to keep them. But they won\u2019t be reordered when they wear out.",

How to measure- If you are unsure which shoe size to purchase, please follow the following steps-1.Draw a straight line, longer than your foot, on a piece of paper. 2.Place the paper on a flat surface. Stand on the line with your heel and longest toe centered on the line. If measuring a child's foot, it may be easier to hold the paper up to their foot. 3.Place a mark on the line at the tip of the longest toe and at the back of the heel. 4.Repeat steps 1-3 for the other foot. 5.Measure the distance between the marks. Taking the larger of the two measurements, use the conversion chart to find your correct shoe size. Resistant materials. These run true to size, but will offer some give. If between sizes, we recommend ordering \u00bd size down.",
