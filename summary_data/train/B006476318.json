If you're the type of Silent Hill fan who is looking for a good story, characters, with meaningful themes and powerful drama coupled with smart puzzles and well thought out game design... go replay Silent Hill 2 and try to forget that this exists.",

I wish they would just re-release some silent hill games for the vita. This one doesn't have any resemblance to the silent hill genre. I would even settle for a telltale silent hill game.",

If you're a fan of dungeon crawling games, or looting, you may like this. I was a little disappointed, I was expecting something like Silent Hill Origins. If you're a fan of the series, you may not like it at all. It does have four player online multiplayer, if that's a plus?",

    "description": "Book of Memories is an all-new game in the Silent Hill series, with a unique premise and storyline. The story begins with a strange book that is received, inside that book is your entire life story to this point, everything that's ever happened to you; all of your memories. You discover that by altering what's written you can actually change the past. You can write your own ideal history. Book of Memories is a departure for the series, with a focus on co-operative multiplayer action rather than traditional Psychological Horror. Players can work together as they explore several different Otherworlds, solving puzzles and defeating creatures to advance through the Nightmares and uncover the truth behind the Book of Memories. Scare rooms, limited resources, and dark atmosphere all return-but in a gameplay package specifically designed to take advantage of the PlayStation Vita. Book of Memories is a macabre celebration of the best that Silent Hill has to offer. Players will encounter items and Creatures culled from over a decade of Silent Hill lore, including a special someone who walks softly and carries a gigantic knife.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\nPRODUCT OVERVIEW\nBook of Memories is an all-new game in the Silent Hill series, with a unique premise and storyline.
