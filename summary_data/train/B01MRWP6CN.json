I have to push the power button and then push the open/retract to see if I remembered to turn it off when I used it last. Plays very well and I have no complaints about the quality of the picture. Maybe I'm being petty but I think that Samsung could have put a light in it when the power button is pushed on.",

      "text": "This is an okay product, but a couple very simple things make it very frustrating to work with sometimes. For starters there is no light at all on the blu-ray player... it is a black box with two buttons. There is no way to look at the player and see if it is on or off, or to even confirm that it has power! This makes it very hard to troubleshoot when the player doesn't work as expected. My only other complaint is the user interface of the remote... it seemingly has two power buttons? One on the top left and another on the top right. It is not an intuitive experience.",
