Before inflating put the inner piece inside the cover because it will be almost impossible to place insert in the cover after being inflated. It should give many hours of use.",

It does come with a hand pump that was pretty easy to use. Yes, it takes a little long to do, but big deal. To deflate, instead of using the pump, I just squeezed the valve and had my wife push moderately on the ottoman. For price and looks, I would definitely recommend for the purpose we used it for.",

Best part - you can remove the cover and wash. (I don't dry mine just to avoid any shrinkage - lay flat to dry) Super cute footrest and more sturdy than you would think. Would definitely buy again.",
