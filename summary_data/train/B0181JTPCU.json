Very convenient to carry with us for a vacation. Just plug it in the hotel TV then you can start watching movies online. One other my favorite thing of this one is I can able to install any Android app on it. All Android apps run very smooth. Enjoy !",

The browser that comes with even smart TV's is very limited. This little \"mini computer\" fills in and the TV can pick up our wirless network instantly.",

Fine for email, youtube, and web browsing. Occasionally a bit sluggish, but totally usable considering price.",

It won't set speed records, but is certainly snappy enough to get the job done well (I've used it for web-based presentations, slideshows, power point presentations, etc.). If I needed another, I wouldn't hesitate a minute to buy a second one.",
