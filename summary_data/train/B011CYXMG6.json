Many of the other noodles we have purchased are very short, ideal for kids, but not for adults. These look like they will last quite awhile and are long enough for adult use. They are less porous than the cheaper noodles. The class is very happy with them. I purchased 4 as a start but will definitely purchase again! I recommend them highly.",
