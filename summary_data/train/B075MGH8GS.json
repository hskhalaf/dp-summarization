      "text": "I wonder if the people having trouble with the built-in trim closeness adjustment have read the instructions which clearly state that one shouldn\u2019t attach any of the guide combs without first retracting the adjustment to it\u2019s furthest setting or it will ruin the adjustment mechanism? I\u2019ve had Wahl and Oster, and this Babyliss Pro is beats them, and deserves it\u2019s place amongst the elite professional trimmers. The built-in fine trim closeness adjustment is ingenious. The motor is quiet, smooth, and goes through thick, heavy hair like a hot knife through butter. Another thing they seemed to pay attention to is the size, weight, and balance, all which are just right.",
