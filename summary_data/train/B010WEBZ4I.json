But with my insoles they are even more comfortable!!! They are sooooooooo AMAZING!!! I went up a half size. I usually wear a 8 1/2 but since I had read about the thong part hurting I got the size 9.

They are cute, different than the traditional flip flop and have a slight \"cushion\" which is interesting sense they appear to be made of plastic. I like that they have the backs so that my feet stay in them while walking or going on amusement rides. My only complaint so far is that I wish they were slightly wider. They fit true to size for me (US 7). They are surprisingly comfortable, and I will get different styles and colors!",

Briefly scanning some other negative reviews it looks like perhaps these used to be made with a slightly different material and more comfortable back then.

The only thing is they are very slick on certain surfaces so you have to be careful you don\u2019t go ice-skating while wearing these shoes. If they made these shoes in a wider array of colors I\u2019m sure I would buy another pair.",

If you're familiar with how crocs fit, go with the size you like and don't listen to the reviews here. They're definitely misleading. Other than that... I think these shoes are awesome!

I will say the little heel tab that sticks up in the back at the end of the day started to annoy my heel but honestly it was only at the end of the day and it did not leave a mark or anything. If you have a sensitive heel this may not work for you.",

The -1 star is because the thong can be irritating between your toes after long periods of time- but I'm talking 10+ miles and even still,the support for the rest of my feet was ideal. I would definitely buy them again, even if they don't decide to wrap the thong or make it with a different material. Definitely a good value for the price.",
