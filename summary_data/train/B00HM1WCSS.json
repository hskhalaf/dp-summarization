I probably should have chosen the next bigger version, but then again, it may have looked too overwhelming then ... I think it is a good fit to our breakfast nook. As far as craftsmanship goes, it looks well made from what I can tell.. love the glass part, it just pulls it all together nicely and gives it a unique look.",

My husband had it installed on our 15+ foot vaulted ceiling in less than a half an hour. I used clear 75watt bulbs and they are very brite. I may switch to frosted when they need to be changed, but that doesn't have anything to do with the light itself. The Mercury glass is gorgeous. The over all size is perfect in my 12x15 living room.",
