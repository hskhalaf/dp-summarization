The other neat thing is how it the feet can be separated from the stick and the feet can then be used standalone as a mini tripod. The gopro can mount directly to it with it or a phone can be mounted using the included cellphone mount. I do wish they sold it in different colors, I think this would look very good in red top match the rest of my equipment.",

I would recommend this to anyone looking for something like this. I don't use a selfie stick very often so this will be great for vacations.",

There are no fancy stickers on this stick and the colour scheme is decent. I feel build quality could have been a little better but it seems a good purchase for the quoted price.",

The tripod base main shortcoming is being very very heavy.
