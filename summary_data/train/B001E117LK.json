I used cardboard applicators in mainstream tampons and never had this issue. This company really needs to fix this quite frustrating problem!! I gave them 3 stars because they ARE organic and therefore I am not putting pesticide soaked cotton in my body. But Natracare is NO LONGER the only game in town and I would seriously recommend looking elsewhere. LOLA is the brand I use now. Don't know how this old review magically changed the one star I gave to 3 stars. THIS IS A ONE STAR PRODUCT!!!",

Compared to other organic tampons they\u2019re actually absorbable where others even in super don\u2019t absorb as well and can cause leaks early. Because they\u2019re organic they lessen cramping as well, for years i thought it was my body\u2019s fault for horrible incapacitating cramps, even after switching to a plant based diet (which cut them in half) i\u2019d still get them but switching to organic tampons or the mcuk they\u2019ve gone down to nothing on light days and manageable on heavy days.",

The tampon in the applicator is not the same tampon that your brand uses for the no-applicator package. Why would you not just use the same tampon? The ones with no-applicator are shorter, more comfortable, and open like an umbrella as it absorbs so as to prevent leaks. The tampons in the applicators are so long they are super uncomfortable and are rolled like a cheap joint so that they leak everytime. I'm returning the unused boxes I have and will not ever buy these applicator tampons again.",
