The screw kit is a good value, I haven't really used the other attachments, the wood chips are large and not airborne. I wouldn't really want a vacuum running the whole time I am using this not was clean up hard. The square drive tends to cam out a good amount, I really wish they had gone with a torx head, if I can find pocket hole screws with a torx that would be a good change.",

Like all carpentry work and especially cabinetry, setup and dead on dimensioning and cutting are a must. I found the Kreg paddle clamp helpful but they allowed for more twist in the joint than I was willing to accept. As an additional purchase I would recommend the pocket hole clamp that has a pin that directly sits in the hole. Still need to drive the screw slowly but the twist is eliminated.",

We only used it a handle of times, when some chair we purchased started getting rocky my husband attempted to use this to make them sturdier but it just didn\u2019t work. It could be user error as I said we are not furniture builders but for us, it was just too complicated to figure out. Now it just sits in our garage collecting dust.",

I will seek screws that are cheaper and still work once the ones included in this purchase are gone. Kreg included just enough to make you crazy when you go to use the jig.

So far I have built a workbench, shed doors, and very soon I will be building those picture frames. The master system is a great starting point and I have also purchased the right angle clamp for making boxes. Very ingenious system, works with hard and soft wood of various dimensions. Watch the product videos and I think you'll be impressed with the Kreg system.",

There are better looking, stronger ways to join wood but this is the easiest and you'll learn a lot about woodworking as you use it, so you can move on to other types of joinery if you want to. Regarding the K4 specifically, note that the clamping lever is on the opposite side of the work from the drill. This can be annoying for larger panels. Consider the K5 if you plan on working with big things.",

    "description": "Style:K4MSThe Do-It-Yourself Kreg Jig\u00ae with Bonus Accessories\nThe Kreg Jig\u00ae K4 Master System is a great choice for any woodworking enthusiast looking for a complete set to get started building with Kreg Joinery\u2122. With its solid clamp, large clamping recess, dust collection attachment, material support stop, and removable 3-hole drill guide, this jig truly has it all. The Master System includes a Kreg Jig\u00ae K4, Bonus Kreg Accessories: the Kreg Face Clamp, Portable Base, and more.\n\nLarge Clamping Recess\nThe Large Clamping Recess makes it easy to secure your jig to your workbench using Kreg multi-purpose Face Clamps or any common bar clamp or C-clamp.\n\nSturdy Toggle-Clamp\nThe Kreg Jig\u00ae K4's rear-mounted clamp design has been around since the first Kreg Jig\u00ae. It's a proven design, offering incredible rigidity and uncompromising workpiece hold-strength. Adjustments are as easy as releasing the locknut and rotating to the correct setting.\n\n3 Tools in 1\nThanks to its removable Drill Guide, the Kreg Jig\u00ae K4 Master System can serve as many different tools: a sturdy benchtop jig that utilizes the benchtop base for high speed pocket holes, a contractor-grade jig for work on the road through the use of the portable base, and a high-quality repair jig when you add spacer blocks to the bottom of the drill guide.\n\n3-Hole Drill Guide\nThe 3-hole Drill Guide lets you drill pocket holes in a wide variety of material widths and thicknesses\u2014from 1/2\" to 1 1/2\" in 1/8\" increments. Every Kreg Drill Guide features a hardened-steel core, which carries a lifetime guarantee. The core shrouds the bit and supports the workpiece through 100% of the drill-stroke, resulting in minimal bit deflection, reduced tear-out, and a clean, pluggable pocket hole.\n\nMaterial Support Stop\nThe Material Support Stop can be set at any distance from the jig to help you repeat the same pocket holes over and over again. The stop can also be swung out of the way to serve as a height support for larger panels.\n\nGlass-Reinforced Nylon Body\nThe blue body of every Kreg Jig\u00ae K4 is made from a heavy-duty, glass-reinforced nylon. This composite material offers the resiliency and flexibility you need without sacrificing the strength and durability Kreg customers have come to expect.\n\nSuperior Angle\nUnlike competing jigs with a shallower angle of approach, the Kreg Jig\u00ae K4 Master System features an optimized drilling angle, specifically designed to increase driving efficiency and minimize the overall size of the pocket hole. The result is a compact pocket hole, less than 1 1/2\" in size.\n\nWood-Chip Relief\nThe Kreg Jig\u00ae K4 Master System includes one wood-chip relief hole for every Drill Guide hole, designed to keep the drill bit clear of excess wood chips, minimize drill torque, increase the longevity of your drill bits, and allow you to complete a perfect pocket hole in just one plunge.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nFeaturing a removable drill guide for use with benchtop and portable bases, the Kreg Jig Master System is the ultimate pocket-hole jig, and a great choice for any woodworking enthusiast. For precision and accuracy, it offers 1/8-inch incremental settings for materials 1/2-inch to 1-1/2-inch thick and patented three drill guide fixed spacing on the drill guide. A dust collection shroud means no more woodchips, and the clamping recess allows you to use many different styles of clamps to secure your jig to the workbench. For peace of mind, the hardened steel drill guides are backed by a lifetime warranty.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe Kreg Jig Master System is the ultimate pocket-hole jig and a great choice for any woodworking enthusiast. Between its solid clamp, large clamping recess, dust-collection attachment, material support stop, removable 3-hole drill guide, and seemingly endless adjustability, this jig truly has it all!

Adjustments are as easy as releasing the lock-nut, and rotating to the correct setting. Thanks to the innovative removable drill guide, the Kreg Jig Master can be many tools at once. First, a sturdy bench top jig utilizing the bench top base for high-speed production pocket-holes, then a contractor-grade jig for work on the road through the use of the portable base, and also a high quality repair jig with the addition of spacer blocks to the bottom of the drill guide. The patented 3-hole drill guide lets you make perfectly placed pocket-holes in a wide variety of material widths and thicknesses (from 1/2-Inch to 1-1/2-Inch, in 1/8-Inch increments).
