As soon as I get near here we store \"the gold\" the dogs start barking and running around. Even my 7 year old rat terrier starts jumping up and down! I've had her for 5 yrs. and I've never seen her do that. They literally inhale the dog food and then each run over to the other dogs bowl to make sure every bit was eaten. Of course they are licked clean and doesn't look like anything was ever put in it.",

It was ok for awhile but then the last 2 boxes we noticed she was again acting sick and getting diarrhea. Switched her food to homemade and now she\u2019s fine. Poor quality control or something.
