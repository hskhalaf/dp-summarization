We are a family of 2 with 2 young grandchildren who visit often. The original intended purpose was for pancakes-they do so much better on a non-stick surface. Pancakes are great, but it also comes in very handy for grilled cheese, quesadillas, eggs, and burgers. When cooking burgers or bacon, I place the griddle on a dishtowel directly on the induction cooktop and turn on the fan. I never put it in the dishwasher, although they say you can, but it takes about 30 sec. to wash. Small, easy to store, reliable, what more could you want?",

Heats evenly, and the drip pan on the side catches the bacon grease. This is my 2nd one, still using the 1st one after 8 or 9 years.

The surface measured with 3 different infrared thermometers, one of which is a more expensive, very accurate one, showed the griddle consitantly to be 100 degrees too high. For example with the dial set at 200 the surface would be 300! If you wanted 200 degrees you had to set it on warm. There is some uneveness of temperature, but that is normal for electric griddles like this. But the average wasn't even close to the setting. Great little griddle in all other respects but nearly unusable because of the temperature control (or rather the lack of it) So disappointed!",

Over the years, we've bought 2 Little Griddles and I'm tempted to buy one as a backup unit. While the Little Griddle is easy to clean and store, there are times when it would be nice to have a clean unit standing by, ready to press into service.",

    "description": "Master heat control maintains temperature automatically. Built-in grease tray. Cast aluminum. 1000 watts 120 volts, 60 Hz only\n\nAMAZON.COM\nIdeal for one person or two, this compact electric griddle with its 8-1/2-by-10-1/2-inch cooking surface cooks four fried eggs or two good-sized steaks. Coated with a slightly textured, durable nonstick finish, the griddle requires very little grease, thereby producing healthier food. For fattier meats like bacon, a built-in channel along one end catches drippings. When the griddle\u2019s heat control is removed, the unit is fully submersible in warm, soapy water. The 1000-watt griddle plugs into any 120-volt outlet and automatically maintains temperatures ranging from warm to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Made of cast aluminum that resists warping and distributes heat evenly, the griddle measures 14-3/4 by 10 by 2-1/2 inches (the heat-resistant leg-handle units can be unscrewed for even more compact storage), and is covered by a one-year warranty against defects. --Ann Bieri",
