To make the process even more fun for me, I have two of these, one of them at work and one at home. I wish pogoplug would get around to fixing this KNOWN bug instead of dreaming up new ways to charge monthly fees.",

The presence of USB3 ports was the clencher for this purchase (along with the price!!) though I've heard others have had trouble getting them to perform to the fullest. I haven't fully tested this myself, but even if there is an issue with speed on the ports, the device still works for my needs. Cheap (nigh disposable) backup solution and file server. Perfect!",
