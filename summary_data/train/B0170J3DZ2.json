I found out the hard way that the installation instructions have a point - install mirror at the extreme interior corner (else it can make a noticeable portion of the mirror become obstructed, if you have moderate-sized car sedan mirrors).",

They had nothing to offer. These mirrors do exactly what they're supposed to which is to reduce the \"blind spot\" that occurs with your side view mirrors. I installed them exactly as directed and they work great. The best feature is that they are adjustable once installed so you can further position them for maximum effectiveness. It does take a few days to adjust to the added view on your side view mirrors, but it's well worth it.",
