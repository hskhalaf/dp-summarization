This is the second one I've purchased and they both did the same thing. I'm going to have to try a different product but I'm sad because I really love this one if it would last longer.",

But I must say whenever I tried, and used my conventional oven, the dough just was never cooked enough. So this arrived promptly and really does a fine job. It's simple, easy to wipe the surface clean after use, and cooks the dough nice and crispy. It's hard to go wrong at this price.",

The pizza maker heats up very hot, but if you put frozen items in it they will absorb the heat and won't cook. No Pizza maker is designed to do that. Defrost any frozen items first or use fresh made deli pizzas or pizza dough or tortillas and your favorite items. Also makes Sunny side up eggs great.",

It was small (and square which I like) but the fresh crust was crispy and everything was cooked (I parboil the peppers and onions). So, I guess this unit is a success as such.

It's a great buy if you don't have an oven, or just don't want to heat the oven up in the summer. There's no frills or adjustments here: no temperature setting, no timer, not even an on/off switch. The temperature hasn't been an issue, but needing to unplug it to turn it off is enough of an annoyance to cost it a star.",

      "text": "I buy alot of frozen pizzas and this is the best kitchen gadget to cook a 12\" frozen pizza. Plug it in wait for the green light to come then put your frozen pizza in about 10 minutes and presto best cooked pizza in town. Sorry!!! I said \"Presto\" (Betty Crocker) WARNING...the cooker does not have a on/off switch you have to unplug it after every use. I hung a sign by it \"please unplug after every use\". The top gets very hot too, but I still love it.",

This thing cooks pizza in half the time an oven will and cooks it perfect Everytime. Not only can you cook pizza but I've cooked bacon, eggs, brownies, hotdogs, hot pockets, pizza rolles, french fries, and really anything you want to warm up. It had its own temperature controle keeping it at around 400\u00b0F if I remember right. I would recommend this to anyone that doesn't always have access to an oven. 10/10 LOVE it!!!",

The main downside I found out was the bottom would always brown too fast and the top would still be white ish...not uncooked, but not golden brown yet. The way the lid goes on keeps too much of the steam moisture inside (moisture that would usually evaporate off the top if using a regular oven) so the top of the pizza doesn't turn out that amazing. But overall very fun to use and definitely see this as saving more energy than a traditional oven, so I'll keep using it.",
