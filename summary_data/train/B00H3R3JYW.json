With the regular Tidy Cat no oder is detectable. With this one.... phew. I have to burn incense by both of the littler boxes. Needless to say, I will not buy this one again.

Perhaps he didn't care for the weight of the sand, in combination with the scent. Urine tends to pool rather than absorb quickly into the litter as it would with other clumping sands. Cat would choose to eliminate waste in this litter only 50/50 of the time. Ensured a clean pan/box with no harsh scented cleaners (hosed off, with mild soap at best), but no dice. All-in-all, would not recommend. Perhaps my cat is fickle, as it certainly prefers the regular clumping litters provided by Tidy Cats. But the lightweight litters are a disaster most of the time.",

We found the product was not particularly effective at controlling unpleasant odors from the litter box, even though the perfumed scent was overpowering. Instead we had a blend of stinky perfume that permeated the house. We have 3 cats and 3 litter boxes that are cleaned at least twice a day, with large litter mats in front of them. Even so, tracking of the litter was far worse than with the previous product. Although it is heavier - for price, odor control, and less tracking, I am going back to ordering Dr. Elway's Precious Cat Ultra litter.",
