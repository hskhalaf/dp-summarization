      "text": "Shoes look nice, but when I ran in them I got blisters on the inside of both of my arches. I've had for about 6 months and aside from the blisters they are still in good condition. Update: I've been running more often in these (5+ miles) and they are NOT good support. I brought these into a running shop and they basically laughed at me for using these. They recommend not wearing these for any distance over 3 miles, and that would be pushing it. I noticed my knee has been hurting a lot. I've pinpointed it to these shoes. Despite this, I still think they are great looking shoes for walking around/lounging around, just not for long-distance running.",
