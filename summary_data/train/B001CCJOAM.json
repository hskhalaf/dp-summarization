I didn't spend a lot of money and raise this parrot for him to eat garbage products. I will find another dealer or go to Petsmart who've never sold me anything bad smelling. Toss this stuff its not worth seeing if Andy gets sick or if its just the odor.",

Nutriberries are what I leave in their cage for snacks on off hours, when they're not getting their regular meals of 'people food' with the rest of the family.",

Plus, unground seeds provide the benefits of whole foods like birds have in the wild. Based in the US, we're a second-generation-family-and-veterinarian-owned company in the farmlands of Illinois.
