      "text": "So I have a lot of guitars. And I always buy hard cases for them. They were laying upright on the floor until I got two of these. They are rock solid no worries of it breaking when assembled properly. They are holding some heavy Gorilla flight cases with big hollowbody jazz boxes no issues. The one issue I did run into is with odd shaped cases like a Flying V hard case. It wants to tip forward if you don't spend a few minutes positioning it correctly. Same with a big rectangle Explorer case. Once they're in though I don't worry about it. Recommended!! So nice to have floor space back!",

The carton didn't have packing material around the tightly wrapped plastic stretch material. This unified bundle apparently prevents any damage to the wood. At least it did in my case. None of the wood had any damage or rubbing issues at all even though the carton had some damage. This unit assembles easily if you read the directions, which admittedly I never like to do. But there are only few steps and was easy. To sum it up, this is a good looking guitar case stand for the money. I will buy another when I need it.",

My only suggest is that the instructions let me put the parts together wrongly. Fortunately, I did not use the enclosed glue and I was able to quickly and easily put the rack together correctly. If you buy this, and I do recommend it, do an assembly without the glue first and then put it together with the clue. I have assembled lots of kits and this is definitely at the high end of kits. The parts are very good quality and they are very precisely cut and drilled.",
