After painting the bed purple, I glued multi-colored organza butterflies to the canopy and hung it from the ceiling. It attached easily with one hook. She absolutely loved it! The price is very reasonable. The color was a bit more pink than the picture shown, but that was a plus for me. I cannot yet attest as to how it will hold up, but I am very pleased with the purchase and would recommend it without hesitation.",

It hangs from a hook, so it does move and it can be pulled by girls playing in the netting. We swept the netting back and looped it around the corner of the bed. I was going to tie it with ribbon, but the netting is a solid piece all the way around except for an opening in the front. I intend to make a little slit for tying the ribbon. It is pretty and they were delighted when we surprised them.",

      "text": "The material is very synthetic-feeling. Not a very feminine fabric. This is more like a decorative mosquito netting. It is also very long. When hung from a ceiling hook in our playroom, it drags several inches(possibly a foot) on the floor and our ceilings are 7 ft high. Not what I expected.",

The picture should be changed. Sheer material has a luster tomit as the picture shows whereas mosquito netting does not.",

The product came in the mail very quickly, with directions and only took us about 5 minutes to assemble. I purchased this for my daughter's room and she just thinks it is the neatest thing. It is large- but that is what I wanted. She sleeps in a full bed, and the size of this canopy covers all edges of the bed- with very little stretching.",

The only set back I had was I had to find an extra long string to hang it from as my ceilings are 12' high and it came about a foot off the ground using the string that came with it. It was very easy to put together. Everything came with it and I'm very happy!",

After having for quite a few months I give it a thumps up. You may want to get your own anchor for hanging from the ceiling. I bought a toggle style that was more decorative.",
