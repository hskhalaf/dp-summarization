Sound quality is good for movies, reasonable for music. It does produce deep heavy low frequency sounds, but good for average listener like me. Seller mailed it in a large box, with exceptionally good parking. It took more time to get it out of box than to set it up and start enjoying. Well done.",

When it attempted these long base notes it seems to sound like a flag flapping in the wind going to give it a few days to break in will update if there is any improvement. So far for $600 it's not worth it at all would look for higher quality for the price. Turn on the weekend the hills and listen to the lowest base note in the sequence to know what I am talking about.",

The sound from music played from my phone via bluetooth was awesome, but when I tried watching DVD's the soundbar was really quiet overall.

      "text": "Truthfully one of the worst products I've ever owned! After spending way too much money on two wireless speakers too create a wireless 5.1 system, had the sound bar go into a an endless loop and stop functioning. Tried every trick in the book including various online tutorials on how to hard reset and update the sound bar to no avail, truthfully a waste of money and because it's out of warranty and sony just doesn't care a horrible paper weight. (Save your money for any other sound bar)",

Its decently loud (it is *definitely* not 400w as its specs say) for a small room, but I was expecting a much higher quality sound. There's no warmth to the sound. Very disappointed. I'm returning the unit.",
