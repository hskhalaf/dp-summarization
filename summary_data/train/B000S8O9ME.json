My mom was very fortunate not to have had a horrible fall as she has bad knees and degenerative disc disease. This thing is not making it safer for people instead gives you a false sense of security and definitely is NOT secure. She took it off and threw it away.",

      "text": "I bought this item for use with my 92-year old mom ... it joined the elevated toilet seat and bed rail that I carry in a suitcase when traveling. I've used this type of devise in the past and it has adhered well to bathroom tile walls. However, the surface to which I was limited in the hotel bathroom on this recent trip was a wide wooden leg that supported the vanity. The devise would stay attached to the wooden surface for 2-4 hours and then fall off. I'm fairly certain that had the surface been tile, the outcome would have been better.",
