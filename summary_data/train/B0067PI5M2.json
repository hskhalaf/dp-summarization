I put some river rocks in the barrels and put a few drops of algae killer in whenever I fill or change the water. Lovey addition to my deck.",

Three months later the paint had peeled off the inside of the buckets. So now I have a somewhat white fountain. Ok we could live with that. Despite regular maintainance, the pump died. So after six months, I'm in search of a new fountain that isn't so poorly made. Pros: Cute to start with, price point. Cons: paint peels, pump stops running, little planter feature too small. No longevity. Lasted 6 months total. Recommend: NO. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY ONE IN PERSON, SO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING.",

      "text": "We purchased this in May, and it arrived quickly, and was beautiful. However, it broke down and quit working in less than 6 months. Amazon would not honor the year warranty, but instead only offered a 30 warranty. They directed us to the manufacturer but they would not help us since we bought it through Amazon. Had we bought it through them, they would have honored their 1 year warranty. Now we are stuck with a broken fountain. I would recommend you think twice about purchasing this through Amazon.",
