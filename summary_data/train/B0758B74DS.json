I used several pieces and turned them different ways to be sure they cooked evenly and they did. I used to have the Waring model like this, but they discontinued it. Prefer the Hamilton Beach, as the oven is larger than the Waring. Have to get used to the sound when the toast pops up, it is quite loud and is startling.",
