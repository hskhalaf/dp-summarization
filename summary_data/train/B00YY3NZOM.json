After a month of using I can say this monitor is definitely worth the price. Be sure to read the description well and know what you're getting. Pros- -Great Picture -1080p -Gaming Mode -Nice size Cons- -Only two inputs( VGA and HDMI) -No Audio In or Out -60 Hz (its okay honestly) Overall a great product if you have a small budget or just looking for an extra monitor.",
