We were just so worried that it wasn\u2019t going to be enough, and didn\u2019t want her to end up in a helmet if we could avoid it. We have used this pillow for THREE NIGHTS, as well as anytime she\u2019ll be on her back for an extended period of time (like naps or playtime), and I can already see and feel a difference! I am so relieved that it\u2019s working I could cry. I am extremely happy with the decision to try this pillow.",

However, it could be bigger. It is perfect for the stroller and his head stays on it but during the night, he slipped off of it and I had to put his head back on it a couple times. I would recommend it for babies with smaller heads. His head circumference is (10 weeks) 40.3cm and it is a bit too small. Overall a good pillow though that hopefully helps to get his head a bit more back in shape.",
