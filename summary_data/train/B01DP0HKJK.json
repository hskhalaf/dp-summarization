My PA towers get used once a week so I don't know how well they would hold up in a professional environment where they were used daily but for my application I have no issues what so ever. I will definitely be using Rockville's to replace some blown 15's I have in another cabinet.",

It sounds really good and handles 5 hours of pounding a night, 4-5 nights a week. Seems to be a great buy for the money, far, far better than the Pyle sub that only lasted a few months, despite having higher wattage ratings and a much bigger magnet. Seems to be a solid buy for short money.",
