About 3 months in, I started to like not wearing a hat anymore. Forgot I was using this and forgot about my hair line falling back and my bald spot on the back of my head at age 23. Yesterday I noticed how much thicker my hair is and the new hair on the back of my head were I once was bald. My hairline is back to what it was in high school. You will lose hair in the beginning but keep going. I\u2019m glad I did.",
