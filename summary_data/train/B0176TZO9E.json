I can make it come on with extra clicks - and when I have used it, I LOVE IT! It is light weight and does a great job. Looking forward to using this on my art projects for years to come!",

The valve is much better, the construction is metal, so the whole feel and weight are different And most importantly the gas valve works.",

It\u2019s hard to know how much gas is inside. There\u2019s an option for a torch with a window that shows how much gas, but after a while you\u2019ll get a feel for when it\u2019s getting a little empty. It\u2019ll feel a little lighter.
