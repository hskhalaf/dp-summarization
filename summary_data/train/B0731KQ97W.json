My 4 1/2 yr old toddler (43 lbs) sat and laid in the stroller and I pushed her around the house with no problems. Excited to use it and hook up the car seat in the car at the end of the month. If I don\u2019t update my review it means I\u2019m still more than pleased! :)",

The stroller is very light, easy to maneuver and fold. I wish it would stand on it's own when folded. The fit and finish is excellent. There's plenty of storage underneath to stuff a medium parka and a baby bag. It comes with no accessories (e.g. cup holders for parents) which is disappointing.
