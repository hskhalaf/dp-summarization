It's easier to use than that old one and even lighter weight than the newer one I had gotten when I was in the hospital 2 years ago. I live in a 2 story house and need a walker on each floor. When this one arrived, I chose it for my downstairs walker that is used the most. The width is perfect for my doorways and even though it's lightweight, it is balanced very well and gives me a feeling a stability when I use it.",

The smell gives me a headache. I once bought a pair of pool shoes at a discount store that never lost this same terrible smell.",

For the brief period of time I'll use this walker after knee surgery, though, I have been very pleasantly surprised at the high quality of the design and construction. It didn't cost much, but it's nevertheless sturdier and more reassuring than the one I was trained on at physical therapy prior to surgery. Highly recommended.",

He used his old walker outside so he wouldn't mess up the wheels on the new one, but they still gave out even with just inside use. The walker wasn't very expensive so I didn't expect it to last forever. I just wish it would have lasted longer than two weeks.

      "text": "I bought this to have when I overdo my daily activities and cause my hip to not work properly. What a pleasant surprise! The price was low enough that I won't worry if I never use it but it's sturdy enough that I would get lots of use from it. It's lightweight, folds up easily and tucks into no space at all. I would definitely recommend this product!",

It worked great. he could zip along with no problem. at first he said the basket wasn't necessary, but found that is was a great addition. it's light, folds up compact and easily. a worthwhile investment. the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars: it can be a little difficult to collapse. works best if it can be resting against something for resistance, otherwise it can be tough to fold up.",
