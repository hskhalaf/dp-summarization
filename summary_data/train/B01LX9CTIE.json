For me using a mask a day cleared it up, so this mask pack really helped to reduce the costs. About 50 cents for a mask is a really great price. The seller also gave some freebies like a hand mask, blackhead removal kit, and a large sponge which I currently haven't figured out how to use yet. I am super happy with this purchase and will be buying my masks here from now on!",

Ginseng, meh, blueberry, yaaaasssssss. The free hand sheet mask that came in the box was a nice addition that I wasn\u2019t expecting!
