I did, however, expect it to be a tiny bit more stain-resistant, as it gets heavy traffic when I'm cooking and doesn't ever seem to be quite clean. My mother had something similar when I was growing up that rarely needed more than a rinse, while I have to scrub this with hot water and then dish-wash it after every use to prevent permanent stains. It's also a tiny bit awkward--I've had utensils just fall out, as the \"handle\" of the rest is oddly rounded. That said, it serves its purpose and isn't too ugly.",
