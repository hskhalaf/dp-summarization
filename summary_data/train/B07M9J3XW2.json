The WiFi that worked for the printer is the model number of the router. Once I hooked it up to the WiFi with the model number of the Arris, and hooked up computer up to it as well, everything worked. No pauses, disconnects. It is great.",

I was also very unhappy with their tech support as they were not able to assist us on helping troubleshoot. Do not waist your money or time on this product.",
