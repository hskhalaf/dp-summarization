Headphones disconnect from the earbuds pretty easily (I guess a requirement of having the over/under ear fits but still make me feel like I'll lose them eventually), earbuds come out of my ears very easily, and are tricky to get in (for my large ears, but reading other reviews this seems common). Battery is not great. I've bought \u00a320 bluetooth headphones with better battery, much easier and more secure fit, and better battery. Hate to give a bad review, but not pleased with this purchase",

      "text": "Ease of use: excellent - pairs easily, and comes with an app that enables you to fine-tune sound quality Sound quality - also excellent. Always surprising that tiny little buds can produce such rich sound Comfort - pretty good, but annoyingly they jiggled in my ears when jogging, creating a noise that competes with the music... which sort of defeats the purpose. Maybe I have weird ear canals, or there is a trick to fitting them that I am missing. Otherwise, really good",
