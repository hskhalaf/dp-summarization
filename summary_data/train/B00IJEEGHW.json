      "text": "I have hid this strimmer for three years and its a great little performer, very useful. However, this morning, mid strim, the head came loose, so I took it apart to see if I could resolve it. The main gear is plastic, running against a metal gear, so this is badly worn. The head was loose because the plastic retaining collar into which it fits runs against a metal bearing and has completely melted away. I would have thought both issues were pretty obviously design flaws and both certain to fail in the long run. At best this is poor product quality, at worst, built in obsolescence. I will not buy one of these again.",

REviews have suggested that the strimmer is suitable for such tasks. I have managed to keep the grass and weeds under control quite well with this tool but the battery life is only 10 mins on full power which is needed to cope with the longer grass. The manufacturers state that the tool is designed only for edging for which I imagine it is quite adequate. For tougher jobs a petrol engine powered tool is going to be more suitable and not slow down after 10-15 mins use.",

It is very easy to change from light grass mode to harder wear at the flick of a button. It is slightly heavier than I anticipated but that hasn't stopped me so far. It is also easier to transport and compacts fast to pop in the car. Delighted with my purchase problem is my partner also likes it.",

As both use the same battery, I have in effect a spare battery.The battery lasts a very long time, certainly easily enough for me. The only downside is the self spooling mechanism in the strimmer: it goes thro' a spool after about two battery uses - will end up expensive so I bought a large spool (B&D, same diameter of cord but casing not compatible) and rewound the existing spool. Does now not always self spool but no great deal. I would thoroughly recommend both.",

Smashed through tall weeds no problem and gives a good hour of hard strimming in full power before a recharge is needed. No issues at all with the line feed. If you want to be time efficient then get a second battery, as it takes an hour to recharge. Overall a great bit of kit for the money, and by far the best battery strimmer I've used.",

Once you get to the last few metres of the wire, it comes out at a rate of knots and bits of it come flying off, hitting the legs and arms.

      "text": "after reading all the reviews I decided to order this strimmer ,and I am not disappointed . the strimmer is a pleasure to use as i am only 6` 6\" tall,its a lot quieter than my petrol strimmer. I have used this new strimmer today to cut the grass around my beehives ,not a murmer from the bees, not like when i have used a well known brand of petrol strimmer where i have to be very careful. reading the instructions is a bit like trying to read the instructions for a well known flat pack furniture company, i would have thought better of B&D",

Cutting line feeds as it should automatically. Only drawback I found was it was a little heavy on the arms after about 15 mins or so and could do with a shoulder strap. Apart from this, the strimmer worked very well indeed.",

Battery lasts a good while and does all my large garden. I was going to purchase a second battery but didn\u2019t need to as the battery charges really quickly.

It cuts through thick stemmed grasses and nettles without a second thought and despite heavy use I've yet to have to break off to recharge the battery. It's light, well balanced, a doddle to use and appears well put together. Highly recommended",
