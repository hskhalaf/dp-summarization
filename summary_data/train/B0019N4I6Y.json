It's too short to comfortably fit over my shoulder (even at full extension) meaning it digs into my shoulder-blade as I walk.

      "text": "Seems to be a quality product - lightweight and easy to fold and carry. The downside is that if you are a male, it's very difficult to sit on comfortably. The tripod design means that you end up with one of the legs between your legs. Given that there is no back, you end up leaning forward which creates a \"binding\" situation that can be quite uncomfortable. One other factor is that the tripod design isn't super-stable on surfaces that aren't flat.",

It opens up pretty easily and is just low enough so that he can comfortably do his job without it slowing him down.
