Compared to my Sony MDR-1000X, the noise cancelling ability of this headset is a distance poorer away, but got to sacrifice that for comfort. Battery life is about 3 to 4 hours, probably not enough to last a long flight journey.",

Update: I have had these headphones fail twice in the last year and Sony won't replace them because the original purchase was 1 year ago. Sad, because I liked them so much. I have to say I wouldn't spend that much money on headphones again and the Sony name, which I swore by, is tarnished for me.",

Google assist only works when the phone is close to your mouth, so this function is useless to me when running. Again, great sound quality and good noise canceling. To me, the noise canceling is not excellent because I can still hear things around me. Also, the ambient feature is not excellent because to hear someone clearly, I still have to take the earphone off. Regardless, I think this is still one of the best I have had thus far. I cannot really talk much on battery life because I recharge after each workout.",

I chose it over Bose QC30 since Sony has an optional wired connection that you can use with entertainment systems in the plane. Unfortunately, noise cancellation is not near the quality of QC20. Even at maximum noise cancellation, there is a lot more noise coming through. One issue is the earpieces are simple round silicon plugs and do not attach securely. Which makes the noise cancellation even less effective.",
