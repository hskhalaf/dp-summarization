      "text": "I got sick and tired of phantom beeps coming from my First Alert Smoke detectors. I was reluctant to install Nest Protects since I wanted detectors that work with Homekit. I learned of the Starling Hub that integrates Nest products with Homekit. I changed out the First Alerts with Nest. The install was real easy as was the install of the Starling Hub. Now I see the Nest's in Homekit and I can create automations In Homekit for them. I also like the pathway light that comes on at night.",
