Based on this, I ordered the small to medium size for myself. They\u2019re incredibly soft and just thick enough to make my 74 yo, skinny, achy feet very comfortable in my hiking shoes. HOWEVER, within the package of 4 pair, they vary greatly in size from very small (hope they don\u2019t shrink!) to having a very large toe area. Not pleased with product control!",

Right, my feet was freezing wearing this, and in the same situation, smartwool kept my super fine. However, the fit is very good. I do like it. Nice and soft touch, came with great thickness (that unfortunately can't keep you from cold).",

The problem is that these socks are way too bulky and do not fit snuggly in the toe box area. Therefore when you put your boots on, all the extra material causes socks to bunch up and creates an uncomfortable and unpleasant fit. In my opinion the socks needs to be more fitted for a more comfortable fit when wearing shoes/boots. If I hadn\u2019t washed, I would return. I never ended up wearing them.",

      "text": "Wore this with Winter boots during a recent trip to Mammoth Mountain and they were comfortable, yet kept my feet nice and toasty. Based on some reviewer's concern about shrinkage, I didn't let them get too hot in the dryer...took them out when about 70% dry and hung them up to finish. They still fit perfectly (I got Small-Medium and I wear a 9.5M shoe).",
