Add to those good points the boot\u2019s superbly grippy outsole, and wearers would have virtually no reason to skip on it\u2014except, perhaps, its alleged lack of breathability which some users whose feet sweat a lot might utterly dislike.Overall, the 996 Vioz GTX doesn\u2019t mess around with its set of positive qualities. That said, those who are very particular with ample ventilation in their footwear might benefit from getting a completely different boot.",

I walked in boggy wet ground and in rough terrain and these pair are reliably waterproof.",

They were comfortable straight out of the box and, as always with Zamberlan, needed no 'breaking in'. What I particularly like about the 996 Vioz is the one-piece upper, so reducing the potential for leaking seams in the years to come. If they wear as well as my previous pairs, they will keep my feet dry and comfortable for a long time",

Note on sizing - I'm 6'3\" and approx 14 st, usually take a 9, ordered 9.5 and they fit great. Zamberlan say they are true to size and that seems to be the case.

    "description": "Ideal for tough backpacking with heavy loads. The main areas you want your walking boot to perform are in the upper where you need weatherproofing and a comfortable fit and in the outsole where traction and stability are a must. The Zamberlan Vioz GTX Mens Walking Boots deliver in each of these areas - and more. The upper is constructed with a full grain leather that has been treat with Hydrobloc coating. Hydrobloc is a trademark registered by Zamberlan to identify only the best quality leathers, which are tanned following a special treatment that enhances the water-repellence, resistance and durability. This combination of full grain leather and hydrobloc offers superb comfort, climate control and added water-repellence. Full grain leather is extremely strong and hard wearing, it is also very durable with proper care and maintenance. As opposed to synthetic materials, full grain leather also moulds to your foot ensuring an excellent fit. The upper also features patented Z. F. S (Zamberlan Flex-STM) this describes the unique multidirectional joint that offers great lateral support, comfort and freedom of movement of the ankle and overall stability. What this means is the boot will bend and flex in the correct places while giving lots of lateral support when traversing and on steep and rough terrain. Also forming part the upper are a Gore-Tex Performance lining and Z. A. S (Zamberlan Air System). Gore-Tex Performance lining offers a range of benefits the main ones being it is durably waterproof, highly breathable, protective in the outdoors as well as being fast drying. Z. A. S is Zamberlan's special construction and design method, combined with the best components to optimize comfort and breathability. Boots crafted accordingly are extremely light weight and very breathable. The outsole of the Vioz GTX walking boots is constructed with a Zamberlan Vibram 3D outsole. This consists of 7 areas that combine for excellent traction, durability and comfort. 1-Low density PU mi",
