Product was quite expensive and was expecting a smooth application and effect. Won't purchase or recommend. Perhaps when purchased online the vendor had expired products. Should have sampled in a reputable dept. store. Buyer beware.",

This foundation is super airy and light and gives just the right amount of coverage without feeling heavy. Recommended for someone who is looking for just the right amount of coverage to even out skin tone and to look flawless. This will do the trick. With use, you also see improvement in texture of skintone.",

After 2 uses.....has broken out with cystic acne....and she has a milk white skin tone...so now she had reddish pinkish patches about her face....very depressing for a girl who had flawless skin and never suffered with acne.
