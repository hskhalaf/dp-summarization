They smell great out of the box but when lit, you can\u2019t smell it unless your nose is right next to the candle. The packaging is pretty as are the containers each candle is held it but it\u2019s a bad product overall. No point in scented candles if you can\u2019t smell it and money is wasted on wax that doesn\u2019t melt all the way through. Purchased as stocking stuffer gifts but have changed my mind once I realized it\u2019s a bad candle product.",
