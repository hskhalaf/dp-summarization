I really didn't have high hopes for it, I was worried that food made with diabetic needs in mind wouldn't be appealing and that someone wouldn't be able to stay on the wagon, but this cookbook will turn the tide. With a few exceptions, the recipes are relatively easy to make. The best part - they are DELICIOUS! I've always loved veggies, but we've never been super disciplined otherwise. There are tasty and flavorful combinations. I've only found a couple that I don't like, but the vast majority of the recipes are a win!",
