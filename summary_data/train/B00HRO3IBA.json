Everything about it suits my needs perfectly I have a lifestyle that I do not need to worry about WIFI access.(by the way if I do not have WIFI access I'm sure will survive.) The \"cloud \" concept is new to me and it's great. I can create offline docs and move them to any number of external storage devices. The laptop is supper light weight and the machine is very slim and compact.",

Yes, you can't download any Windows-based programs, but Google has really done well on creating an affordable laptop that will keep you connected. Hopefully as the Chromebook community grows, we'll see even more improvements in the Store and programs available to the platform. I think I'll be able to get a lot of use out of it and it's better than the no laptop I had prior to. Great video playback, decent speakers, huge screen.. I'm pretty impressed!",

Let's just say that it's the ideal laptop for the college student. It will do everything the need for college and most classes utilize Google Chrome's platform for papers and such. As for the boyfriend, he needed a simple laptop that would allow him to do the \"basics\" that everyone usually needs to...email, surf the net, watch movies, etc. Why spend more when you can get everything you need in this?",

If you are already heavily invested into Google's ecosystem, as I am, then you will be happy that you bought a Chromebook, as all of Google services work seamlessly with it. Also, the 13.3 inch screen is a great size for me since I've always felt that the 11.6 inch screen is too small. I can count the number of times I used my desktop PC now that I've purchased this chromebook. And, for less than the price of my most mid to upper-priced smart phones, it's a solid deal.",

A smaller Chromebook, such an Acer 720, is more convenient for road-warriors and couch surfers, but the bigger screen is nice for older (tired) eyes. Occasionally I hook it up to a 22 inch LCD TV (as a monitor) and it drives it just fine. Battery life is very good, but video shortens the battery life significantly.",

Only thing that I miss from my 11 inch before is the lighter weight, this isn't bad at around 3 lb but that is something that I know will happen for a bigger screen. Would buy again in a heartbeat. Would have gotten the newer version with IPS screen but that was too much money for now with my budget.",
