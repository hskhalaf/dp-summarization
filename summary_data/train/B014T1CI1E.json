My other mat with my first machine did not have this problem; suspect this product was stored in extreme heat for a while and it affected the plastic mat. Had to purchase two more mats, which arrived in a flat box so they're good to go. I'd give the product 5 stars except for this mat problem.",

The concept is great, but in reality it will only scan patterns or shapes that have a high contrast between the item and the background. I called Brother and was told that in that case I would need to trace around the item with a fine black marker so the machine could \"see\" it. I told them that kind of defeated the purpose of the scanning function, huh? I get better results with my Silhouette Cameo even if it does take an extra step or two. The ScanNCut has been returned.",

      "text": "This is a great machine for light use . Easy to set up easy to use . The only problem I had was I bought a refurbished unit . Big mistake . There was no deep cut blade holder , the other blade holder came with no blade and the instructions where in Spanish. So for the money I saved I am now spending to get all the correct little parts sent to me . I have had the unit 3 days now and I have cut zero product . Note to self don\u2019t cheap out next time but the new stuff . Now I have orders piling up and no way to cut .",
