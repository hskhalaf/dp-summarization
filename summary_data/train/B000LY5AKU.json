Happy to report that none of this is the case for me. Every tool came (and in the correct size), the box actually holds the tools really well, and there were no holes in the plastic. The tools themselves are oiled as they should be from the manufacturer, so just take a few minutes to wipe them down and you\u2019re good to go. Hoping the dark finish holds up over time, but from a few tests I did on my car last night, this set seems too good for the money.",

I am not sure my last set had that extension piece. I like the nice clear contrasted marking on the socket size. My last set was were etched into the socket withouth writing, and it was hard to see the sizes unless the light hit it at the right angle. Not so with these. Very clear.",

See a video for Stanley Tool Sets. About Stanley Sockets and Ratchets\nStanley sockets feature the proprietary Max-Drive design, a unique radius corner design which provides 15 percent more torque, making it easy to tighten fasteners and simplifies the turning of rounded corners. This technology helps reduce fastener wear without contact on the outer 5 percent of the fastener, so fasteners last longer. This helps reduce slipping on frozen or rusted fasteners. Stanley sockets are manufactured worldwide with high alloy steel and heat treated for performance. Stanley ratchets and accessories are designed to meet or exceed ANSI specifications. All are forged from high-quality steel and finished in high-polish chrome. Selected Stanley high-torque ratchets have a Quick Release mechanism for one-handed use. Sockets and extensions remain locked onto the drive until disengaged with an easy-to-reach, low-profile quick-release button. Stanley Pear Head Ratchets have a slim profile and a small 7-degree arc-swing for accessing hard to reach fasteners. \n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe Stanley Works, originally a bolt and door hardware manufacturing company located in New Britain, Connecticut; was founded in 1843 by Frederick T. Stanley. A few years later, in 1857, Frederick\u2019s cousin, Henry Stanley, founded The Stanley Rule and Level Company. In 1920, The Rule and Level Company merged with The Stanley Works and would go on to become it\u2019s famous Hand Tools Division. Over the years, The Stanley Works has produced some of the most innovative and useful tools ever made. Among these tools are the Bailey Plane, the Surform shaper, the PowerLock tape rule and most recently the FatMax line of products. Today, more than ever, Stanley continues to be an industry leader in tool innovation. In 2001, Stanley introduced more than 100 new products, bringing to 400 the number of new products introduced in the past four years. As a direct result of Stanley\u2019s commitment to excellence, Stanley was awarded the Prestigious Golden Hammer Award, presented for New Product Innovation in both 2000 and 2001.\n\nSee more",
