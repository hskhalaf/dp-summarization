I'm trying to find a place where maybe the Bluetooth won't have to work as hard, but yeah, this is definitely not something I'd buy again or recommend to others. I wanted it to monitor humidity in my basement and use with Homekit, but the battery life is almost a non starter. Since I bought a 10 pack of batteries for it, I'll see if I can find a place where it doesn't eat batteries as much, but if not, into a drawer it'll go :(",

What's horrid about this product is the 1 month battery life and the lack of warning when the battery is low. The battery needs to either last a year or the product needs to be rechargeable.

A $20 weather device seems to display more accurate temperatures. And the battery is already %15 dead. The other product we have from them is accurate and instant and the battery is still full after 6 months. Probably will not buy anything that measures from this company again. Unless a future update allows for the display to show the exact temperature",
