      "text": "I bought this wok in January of this year to replace a wok that I had for over 20 years and figure it's time to get a more up to date and maybe safer in terms of coating. I used the new wok every week. It did a great job of heating and cooking various dishes. But in July while cooking a dish, the wok blew a fuse and stopped working altogether even after I reset the fuse. Other appliances were tested & work in the same wall socket. So I'm really surprised and disappointed that this wok could last beyond a year.",

For cooking for two to four people, the Aroma AEW-306 is the perfect size, and in the few uses so far it appears to work just fine. The only negative is that its electrical power controller is graduated with numbers from cold to hot, rather than with degrees, so one has to learn what number to set if order to approximate the required cooking temperature. Not a big problem, but still a bother.",

Food doesn't stick to this and clean-up is really easy. The power cord is easy to attach/detach.",

    "description": "Style Name:Basic ModelThis sleek metal wok from Aroma is designed to heat up quickly and retain its extreme heat as you cook; sealing in the flavor of your foods for professional results, every time. Full range temperature controls give great versatility. To make clean-up as easy as operation, the inside of the wok and domed lid are nonstick coated. Not just for stir-fry, it's also great for braising, steaming, and tempura. It's everything you need to make all your favorite modern and traditional Asian foods.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nGoing to Mongolian grills and watching them prepare stir-fry right in front of you is always a treat, and now you can provide your guests with that same excitement with this electric wok. Simply put the wok on the table; let guests choose their favorite vegetables, meats, and tofu; and then get the dinner party livened up with some quick wokking right there! (Keep in mind that although the handles and base are heat-resistant, you'll probably want to set the wok on a cutting board to protect your tabletop.) \n\n With a nonstick interior surface that heats up oil in a lightning-fast three minutes, the wok features a low-to-high continuous temperature control, giving you precise control over your cooking. Select a high temperature for lightning-quick stir fries, or the lower \"warm\" setting for serving. With a 6-1/2-quart capacity, it's easy to feed four or more. The nonstick interior is just right for cooking veggies and meats with less oil, although you'll need to avoid metal cooking utensils that could scratch the surface. Since the wok is not immersible, cleanup takes a bit of time with warm soapy water and a sponge. A lid and one-year warranty are included. --Ariel Meadow Stallings",
