However this is NOT the size of the helmet. This helmet is 6 3/8 - 7 3/8 which is NOT the fit I needed for my son. Secondly, he is only into his 3rd game of the season and the padding is already ripping away from the inside of the helmet. Super disappointed. Would return, but have already customized with decals. Will definitely spend a little more money and purchase the Easton helmet next.",

Finally I discovered that if I use dawn and water along with a lot of elbow grease, the stickers will come off with minimal damage.
