The first being mediocre quality, two of the metal rods holding together the clear plastic were flimsy and made it easy for the plastic part of the umbrella to come loose. The second involves the powder like substance on the plastic itself. Unfortunately unlike others, i was not able to clean the powder off mine as it was adhering to the plastic too strongly.

You have to try to cram yourself in the front and hold it super awkward. IF you are using it to walk around with like a purse or nothing, it\u2019s probably fine.

This style is well crafted, large coverage and appears that. it will withstand a heavier than normal (in my state) wind/rainy day. For my age it is reminiscent of what I carried in elementary school while wearing my clear goulashes so it makes for a fun nostalgia. After purchasing I did see this in a wholesale shoe store chain (still well within the spring/rain season) and it was the same price as I paid here; for some reason that kind of surprised me.",

It definitely keeps me drier than my small umbrella - and I don't think the wind will invert it the way smaller umbrellas do. I think I just need to get use to it.",

Large size umbrella that doesn\u2019t collapse - so won\u2019t fit in your purse but this will keep your whole top half completely dry and clear so you can walk and see like normal! I live in Florida where it rains all the time so this is perfect. And good for the occasional cute photos. I\u2019ll come back and update on durability after I\u2019ve used it a bunch of times but so far so good \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",
