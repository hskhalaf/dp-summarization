One hesitancy I have about it is that it is chemically decaffeinated and not decaffeinated through the swiss water method. I started drinking decaf to be more healthy, but then it turns out that I've been getting more chemicals via the decaffeination method. Sometimes it feels very frustrating to never be able to get that right. None the less, unless you are willing to pay a lot more for coffee that is more healthily decaffeinated, this is a very good reasonably priced and reasonably good tasting option.",

I'm not sure how to fix this. I looked at the boxes and they all have the same code so I'm assuming they were made at the same time.

Like the other users, we have cleaned the needles and followed other basic steps. Of note, we have several other brands of pods that work perfectly fine. The only question is whether this is quality control issue with Green Mountain or Amazon. Although the seller is \"Keurig Direct\", I would not be surprised to learn that Amazon's supply chain flows through China, where an inferior product could be substituted without Keurig's knowledge.",

The Keurig system is a better value the less coffee you drink, and the opposite is also true unfortunately. And we drink a lot of coffee. If I can't continue to find quality K-Cups at no more than ~ $0.50 each, it's time to go back to buying 10 oz bags of SBUX at the grocery store and brewing partial pots when I don't need a whole pot of coffee!",
