Maybe because we always had large, solid wood coffee tables with storage. Also, because it is light, it slides on the carpet, a lot! It's a cute, smallish, modern table. Quality: See the pictures. Scratches and bent metal. Honestly, its a great, small, cheap coffee table. Perfect for a small couch, but not great if u have a sectional. Not sure if it will stain, but I'm sure we'll find out soon enough. Instructions don't really match the product, but you'll get the idea.",
