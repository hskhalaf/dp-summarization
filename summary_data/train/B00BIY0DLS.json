They stated that the manufacturer was aware of the problem, but since less than 5% of their worldwide sales are in ethanol states, it was not worth the effort to correct the problem and it is not covered by warranty! They quoted me 30 days to repair the mower. They had it for 70 days! It cost me $285 to get this mower repaired. I thought troybilt was a good name, I will never buy another of their products!!!",

The plastic oil drain sleeve doesn't go on the plug side of the drain tube as shown in Figure 6-1. It goes on engine side. See the attached pictures.",

      "text": "Great little yard mower. Not as wide as my recently retired lawn tractor but the increased ability to get into smaller places is worth it. Less need to deal around the push mower to clean up the cutting area. On really nice benefit is the rear mounted engine makes steering a breeze. Almost like driving a chevy corvair for those who remember driving that car. Glad I chose this as my replacement",

I have used this for a month now (4 mowings) and no complaints. I do feel some \"flexing\" over uneven surfaces that another reviewer mentioned - and I hope that is something that doesn't cause problems down the road. For the price, though, you can't really beat this small rider.",

You need screwdrivers, 3/8-5/8 wrenches and/or sockets. Assemble in less than a half hour, one hour if you are not familiar with tools. Started first try. Cuts clean and you have a chose of mulching or side chute exit. Only negative, it does not cut in reverse. This is not a big deal to me, but some may find this to be important. Very good mower for a year less than on acre. I would buy again and suggest on to a friend.",

No surprises, mower was placed in my garage. It took me longer to unpack it than it took me to get it assembled. After gassing it up, started on the first try. The only question is why did I wait till my 70 year old hips told me to get a riding mower? Don't wait, get this mower now. Perfect for small lawns with lots of trees and a small back gate. Now it's kind of fun to cut the lawn. Also the grand kids are volunteering to cut the grass, imagine that.",

It does not start reliably, it is under powered, and will not take my 140# body up my septic mound (this is not steep), The front wheels seem to pop to the far right or left of their own volition, and any jarring of the exit chute causes the machine to shut down. To restart you have to get down and unscrew two wing nuts and reinstall the exit chute. It chokes and dies on a bunch of dandelions. On the highest blade setting, *5* it scalps some areas. AND I find it is unreturnable full stop, no excuses. I am not pleased.",
