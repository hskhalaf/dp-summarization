As other reviewers have mentioned, the texture is a bit weird. They are a little slimy- especially if you are holding them in your hand for any length of time. This could be problematic for young children, I would imagine. Great simple ingredients concept, mild flavor, but I'd just rate these bars as \"ok.\"",

However, the texture is unpleasant - I'm not even sure how to describe it.
