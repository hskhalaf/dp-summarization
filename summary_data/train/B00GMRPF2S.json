We'd gone through TWO of the cheapo strollers from Walmart/dollar store, and I decided to get something that would last at least until she outgrew/stopped playing with it. I chose this one for her birthday because it was out of the norm of the crazy bright/pink girls' everything that you normally find. This stroller is super-cute! It has a locking mechanism when set up, which is nice to keep it from collapsing during use, but the kids can't fold it up themselves -- but fine for us, we just leave it open, as she uses it almost every day. It's very sturdy, excellent product for the price!",

This one was worth the extra $5 or so. It's very sturdy and it's held up to lots of racing around the house. It folds up just like a real stroller, which is nice. I'd definitely recommend this stroller!",
