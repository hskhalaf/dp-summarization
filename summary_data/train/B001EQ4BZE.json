So, when the battery compartment door would no longer stay tight enough for the camera to run, I blamed myself for letting the camera drop to the floor. Considering myself to be at fault, I bought a second one. I loved this camera as well. I got about 5 months out of this camera, when the battery door loosened and the camera would not stay on. Again. This time, I had taken care not to bump or thump the camera around. But when the camera worked, it was exceptional.",

It seemed I never had my larger camera available whenever something came up that I wanted a picture of. I checked Amazon and found this little Canon Powershot. It takes excellent and clear pictures, and the 6X zoom lense brings in the scenary and wildlife shots to give me beautiful pictures. I would recommend this camera to anyone with similar needs as it is small enough to carry in your pocket.",

I have been especially impressed with the A 2000's more compact size -- even while it retains most of the features that so endeared me to the predecessor. - I especially like the big ZOOM, the high pixels, the ample screen, the ability to use rechargable off-the-shelf batteries. - I'm still getting used to the new proportions of the pictures and the lack of a viewfinder. Strongly recommend this camera for any avid gran'pa's general-purpose, high-volume use on smaller, constantly-moving subjects.",

      "text": "One year and three weeks after I purchased this camera it stopped working. It had been working well until this point. The battery is fully charged. Of course the warranty is up. The camera won't turn on! This camera had come highly recommended and I was very satisfied with it - I had another model of Canon before this and also had problems which is what prompted me to buy this camera. This is the last Canon I will ever purchase. I paid $200 for it and should have gotten way more than one year out of it.",

    "title": "Canon Powershot A2000IS 10MP Digital Camera with 6x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom",
    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n Inside its sleek, pared down design, the top-of-the-line PowerShot A2000 IS is packed with easy-to-use features. Youve got a 10.0-megapixel resolution and a 6x optical zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer for big, beautiful prints and superb stability. To keep subjects looking their best, the DIGIC III Image Processor with Canon Face Detection handles the technical details -- automatically. Easy Mode allows you to concentrate on your scene, while Easy Playback lets you screen your images on a super-sized 3.0- inch LCD. \n\nPowerShot A2000IS Highlights \n\nLoaded with features, packed with value\nA 10.0 Megapixel resolution makes it a breeze to print large size images with clarity and detail. With the PowerShot A2000 IS, dramatic, personal pictures have never been easier to shoot and share. This 10.0-megapixel camera lets you create impressive large photos of family and friends youll be proud display. The high-resolution images taken by the A2000 IS can be enlarged up to 13 x 19-inches. \n\nGet closer with the zoom power\nThe PowerShot A2000 IS has a 6x optical zoom lens that makes it easy to get the inspiring, emotive close-ups that will make your images lasting keepsakes. This magnificent lens gives you the power to shoot distant subjects with razor-sharp precision and stunning lifelike color. So you can brilliantly capture a bird high atop a tree, a childs winning goal from across the stadium or a school play from the last row. Plus, thanks to Canons highly sophisticated Optical Image Stabilizer technology, even at maximum zoom, every image is rock steady. \n\nThe A2000 IS is equipped with Canons acclaimed Optical Image Stabilizer Technology that automatically detects and corrects camera shake -- one of the leading causes of fuzzy or blurred shots. Even when zoomed in, you can get the steady, crisp, brilliant images youll be proud to shoot and share. And Canons Optical Image Stabilizer Technology is so convenient to use. It functions perfectly with or without a flash. \n\nNew slim two-tone design with a large, bright 3.0-inch LCD\nThe PowerShot A2000 IS is a digital camera that redefines the meaning of elegance -- with every exquisite detail. Note the distinctive wedge-shaped body and slim silhouette that makes this sleek, top-of-the-line A-series model as delightful to hold as it is to shoot. Then theres the two-tone styling that even at first glance, sets the A2000 IS apart from the rest. For comfort and convenience, large-sized buttons are intelligently laid out for quick and easy access. Finally, theres the high-quality matte finish around the controls that quietly, yet unmistakably, signals that this is camera like no other. \n\nDIGIC III Image Processor\nWith DIGIC III, your images boast superior quality, the camera operates at top efficiency and battery life is enhanced. Whats more, DIGIC III enables Canons Face Detection, Motion Detection Technologies and Red-eye Correction to give you better, more true-to-life people shots. Simply press the shutter button halfway down, and the camera automatically pinpoints the faces in the scene and chooses the ideal focus point. The camera controls exposure settings and flash to keep every face looking bright and natural. The camera also selects and sets the optimal exposure and ISO settings automatically to keep everything looking sharp and clear. Red-eye Correction can be handled in-camera, in two ways. The Red-eye Correction during shooting uses the Face Detection Technology to recognize and remove red-eye from images as they're taken, before the file is written to the memory card. It's also possible to correct red-eye during image playback, using simple settings in the PowerShot A2000 IS's menu. \n\niSAPS Technology is an entirely original scene-recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos, iSAPS works with the fast DIGIC III Image Processor to improve focus speed and accuracy, as well as exposure and white balance. \n\nDIGIC III features Face Detection technologies, giving you the best possible results in any shooting situation. Face Detection AF/AE sets the focus point and exposure for the faces of your subjects. Face Detection FE adjusts the flash to correctly illuminate your subject to provide the best balance between your subject and the overall scene, eliminating the common problems of over and underexposed faces. \n\nFace Detection WB means the camera concentrates upon faces when calculating white balance for the best possible skin tones. Face Select and Track lets you highlight one face among several in a scene, and the camera concentrates on that person, even as they move around the scene. Face Detection Technology is a powerful contributing factor in Canon's Motion Detection Technology. Simply press the Face Selector Button, then the selected face is double-framed and tracked when the face moves in the frame. \n\nMotion Detection Technology works in the background to instantly evaluate how fast your subject is moving. It automatically selects and sets the optimal exposure and ISO settings to keep everything looking sharp and clear. This feature provides higher ISOs when you need it for action-stopping shutter speeds. But when no movement is detected, it sets lower ISOs for excellent color and detail. Life doesnt give you second chances to capture special times. Thats why the PowerShot A2000 IS features ISO 1600 and High ISO Auto settings that reduce the effects of camera shake and sharpen subjects in low-light situations, giving you greater shooting flexibility. \n\nRed-eye Correction provides three options for removing red-eye from subjects in flash pictures.\n1) The Red-eye Correction during shooting actually identifies and corrects red-eye in human subjects as pictures are taken.\n2) The A2000 IS can be set to automatically detect and correct red-eye during image playback.\n3) You can manually locate any red eyes in a scene during image playback on the LCD screen, and command the camera to remove them. \n\nEasy Mode and Easy Playback mode\nWhen youre taking pictures, the only thing you want to think about is your subject. Thats why the PowerShot A2000 IS is equipped with Canons Easy Mode that works in the background to handle all the technical details for you. Now you can relax and concentrate on choosing just the right angle, capturing the perfect expression, framing your shot perfectly. To make showing off your images just as carefree, the A2000 IS features the new Easy Playback mode that makes viewing single images and slideshows on the camera effortless -- even if youre new to digital photography! \n\nThe Complete Print Solution\nPrint/Share Button for easy direct printing and downloading, plus ID Photo Print and Movie Print with select PIXMA Photo Printers and SELPHY Compact Photo Printers. The PowerShot A2000 IS's Print/Share button makes direct printing easier than ever. Simply connect the A2000 IS to a Canon PIXMA Photo Printer or SELPHY Compact Photo Printer or any PictBridge compatible photo printer, press the lighted Print/Share button and print! Also use the Print/Share button to transfer images to a computer (Windows and Macintosh). \n\nPrint your own ID photos in up to 28 different sizes or use the Movie Print function to output multiple stills from a recorded movie on a single sheet with a Canon SELPHY Compact Photo Printer.",
