I got this because I'm getting married in a week and we are traveling with the groomsmen's suits and needed a steamer to get those wrinkles out. To test the steamer, I took it to an old bridesmaids dress that I had laying at the bottom of my closet. This little guy heats up SUPER fast and steamed out all of the wrinkles in a very short time. I was on a roll so i steamed all of my curtains and a few other dresses. I am so impressed that something so small is so effective. 10/10 would recommend",

I'm so pleased and wish I had thought to order this earlier. I even gave my iron and ironing board away this weekend.",

There would be times where the steam would stop flowing, but there was plenty of water still in the tank. I would let the steamer sit for a few seconds to let it reheat and then continue steaming my shirt. Overall, I would say that this steamer is okay for using on casual wear that you wouldn't mind a few wrinkles on.",

Well now, i can just plug in my steamer, and turn it on, and it's literally like magic. It also heats up pretty fast. It was a great buy over all.",

I\u2019ve had many other steamers from different companies and this was the best one I\u2019ve ever used! I used it on delicate materials as well and they came out like they just got dropped off by the dry cleaners! I would highly recommend this to anyone and everyone and would definitely buy it as a gift for all of my friends and family!!",

The on/off button is a big plus... seems obvious, but many steamers you just plug in and they are on automatically. It is also lightweight and comfortable to use. I can't speak yet to durability ...

I was able to put the steam right next to the fabric for quicker results with no issues. My wife then used it on her cashmere sweater and had the same happy results.
