It is crafted well and feels very durable. It is a nice girly version of something typically marketed towards boys. I like the dart holder too! The one on the Nerf Rebelle Blaster is not as functional and practical as this bow has. I'm pleased to see that the darts fit in nicely, don't fall out, and are not deformed in any way. Very nice product! Lots of fun!",

My girls (ages four and seven) can't fire the dart its maximum distance with every pull of the string -- some come out as duds -- but they are able to send enough darts soaring across my backyard that they enjoy playing with the bow. The bow only comes with five darts, and they travel far enough that they can be easy to lose, get stuck in a tree, etc. Plan on buying a refill pack of darts to go along with it.",

Also makes me wonder how long the one remaining bow will last if the string is that easily snapped. They do not shoot the darts 75 feet even with an adult doing it. They maybe go about 20 feet. They aren't that sturdy so I don't expect it to last throughout the year. I would have given it 2 stars if the girls didn't like playing with the one bow.",

The only one who hasn't enjoyed it is our 5 year old--you have to put a little muscle into pulling back the string and she just can't pull it out far enough to make the dart go very far. Great little toy and the dart holder makes it easy to keep track of the darts.",

Our younger daughter keeps pulling the handle just a little bit too high, but she can still shoot it. This is a great gift for our Katniss Everdeen loving children!

This product proves to be durable And fun which is definitely an upgrade from my previous dealings with nerf. What's better is that the same quality extended to the whole rebelle line. I bought our littlest the mini rebelle nerf shooters and the middle one the crossbow which is great. Bravo nerf on this line.",
