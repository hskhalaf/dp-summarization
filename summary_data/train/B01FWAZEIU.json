Not surprised though at the poor quality of these APC units, had another unit that came with a damaged plug (BE500G). Took it apart thinking I could swap out the cord and found damaged wires inside (see attached photo). So if you value your life and you won't want your house catching fire, I'd find another UPS manufacturer, I know I will!",

However for a $100+ battery backup from the APC brand it should have a 30 cent switch to mute the audio alarm when required. There are situations where you already know the power is off and are managing the situation that you don't need yet another alarm making a bunch of racket. It is ridiculous that there is no way to mute the audio alarm on this rather expensive device when all it would take is a simple button. Had I realized that it was missing this simple and obvious feature I would not have purchased this device.",

Finally, after some time, it started beeping to indicate that the battery was low. I double checked the electrical outlet, and power was good. I unplugged the unit, and plugged it back in but it still did not recognize that grid power was available. Eventually the battery ran down all the way, and it shut down all my equipment.

The software that you can download to monitor your energy use only works and connects data when your computer is plugged into the UPS. If not plugged in, then it's not connecting data on your energy use. Wish the UPS could do that internally and just synch when connected to computer. Hard to beat a functioning UPS at that price though.",
