Fast shipping the material is a sturdy cowhide leather jacket type of material looks very sturdy the arms are a little baggy but very comfortable and they do cover all of the arm area it can fit a 6 foot person. The arms come in 2 sleeves, not one piece. With slings on both sleeves that go over the neck. The neck slings may be a little constricting. But for the price, its a really good products for the protection.",

I ended up loving it so much. Keeps the heat down and protects and after a month or 2 its at all soft and you barely notice its even on. I weld High amperage MIG and I dont weld without this sleeve anymore. I will definitely buy another one whenever this one wears out, probably in like 10 years because its super rugged.",
