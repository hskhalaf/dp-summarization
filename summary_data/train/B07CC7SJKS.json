Perhaps those users didn't wait the full 72 hours - when first opened, the mattress feels very soft. Allowing it to expand gives this mattress a medium to firm feel.

It was easy to open and place by my self and only had a slight odor when it first opened that could only be detected if you smelled the mattress up close\u2014 it needed a day to air out before I couldn\u2019t smell it anymore and was ok to sleep on. Overall, if you\u2019re looking for an inexpensive soft foam mattress that looks and feels like a higher quality mattress, I highly recommend it.",

I'm guessing they sell sheets for this size but I don't want to replace all the sheets I have. Otherwise it's good quality at a great price!",
