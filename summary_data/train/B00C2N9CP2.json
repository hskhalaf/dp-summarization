I did not have access to the fan from above, however the install only took about an hour. The hardest part of the job was removing the old fan, which was nailed in from the top and I had to use a large pry bar to remove those huge nails. I'll let the video speak for the sound improvement.",

Unfortunately, even at 1.0 sonen i can still hear the fan from about 12 feet away and sitting under the fan on the toilet its definitely noticeable in sound. I would compare the sound level close to an old school oscillating fan on medium speed. Other than noise level everything else works great!",

I managed to install with minimal additional opening of the wall, and luckily the kit includes a larger grill cover to cover the additional opening. Other than that, the fan works great, and does move the air quickly, even if my wife doesn't believe it !",

      "text": "Still pretty noisy once you attach an exhaust hose of any length. My unit was nearly inaudible at first. When I finally installed an exhaust hose the noise tripled. I guess the friction backpressure forces the fan to work harder and get noisy. Since mine is only a \"fart fan\" for a half-bath, and won't carry moisture, I cut the hose back to just 3' to get it above the insulation. This cut the noise considerably, but it was wtill 3x louder than with no hose. The noise is not bad, though. It's fine. I'm just saying it's not as silent as the specs would lead you to believe.",
