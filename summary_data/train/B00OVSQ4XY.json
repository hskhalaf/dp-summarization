      "text": "I am a lover of Steve Madden sandals, I think I may own over 15 pairs or more of Steven Madden sandals because they are genuine leather. Unfortunately, this pair of Donddi sandals is not leather. Why? Because I have the tan leather Donddi I purchased from SteveMadden.com. This Donddi's upper is like plastic, its bad, and I'm really disappointed. I wore them to work once (03/22/17) and I called Amazon that same night and told them how poor a quality this pair of sandals is and I am returning it because its not a true Steve Madden.",

I will surely come back when mine break, but since they are so good, I don't know when will this happen. I 100% recommend them. I wear them with pants and skirts and dresses and they look good with everything. Thank you so much for making such a great sandal.",

After reading many of the reviews decided to go up one size as that seemed to be what was most suggested. Having gone up one size, which is perfect, except that left a gap between my toes and the front strap. Corrected that by attaching a thick piece of mold skin to the underside of the strap...worked perfectly. Would recommend it to family and friends.",

Can\u2019t think of anything bad to say. Will buy again in more colors. Also since a lot people are saying it\u2019s fake. I emailed Steve Madden\u2019s customer service with this Amazon link. They confirmed it is authentic. So I don\u2019t know what other people are talking about!",

      "text": "I really liked this shoe but the thing is that if you don't have skinny feet, this shoe would hurt. I have skinny to chubby ish feet depending on the weather and let me tell you. The first day I wore it out, it was ok but as I wore it a little longer, the front straps started to cut my feet. I don't advise to wear this when it is extremely hot. You're feet will swell up and plus this is leather, it will be uncomfortable to walk long distance. Good for those who has skinny no meat feet. I'll give it another go. Hope for the best.",
