I saw the mini for a good price and decided to replace one of the traditional ones, and I'm glad I did. I now have a free plug for my phone charger, or whatever. Set up was literally less than a minute with the app, and it works effortlessly with Alexa. I will probably get rid of the other plugs and purchase more mini ones soon.",

I know the outlets are working because I can see the blinking light on the device. I probably will end up returning this item. Now I wish I hadn't tried to save money and should've just spent the extra money to get a quality device.",
