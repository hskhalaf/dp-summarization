Simple 310lb dead\u2019s and squats and reracks doesn\u2019t need to be bolted down. This is an old picture I still have it. I revamped my garage gym with more rogue equipment this cafe is still awesome. Fake negative reviews be quiet. I have owned this for years now and have used it for some clients. Really great quality. I will update the picture later. I hold a diploma in exercise physiology and hold certification for nasm and health exercise psychology.",

HINT: take the time to buy a racheting box wrench....speeds up the process. A few holes didn't line up completely but overall it took around 2 hours to set up. I *am* using it with my TRX, although I've got about 75 lbs of weights holding it down. I did that mostly because it isn't settled in it's final spot yet. It still feels super stable. For the price (paid about $270 with tax), it is a GREAT value. Highly recommend!",

However, it is not gonna collapse on you. I gave it one star because it was missing one screw along with washers and nut. Then when I contacted customer service, they gave me the screw but NO washers or nut. And when I contacted them again, they just ignored me.",

      "text": "In a day and age where product manufacturers provide very weak instruction and provide poor packaging, this was a refreshing purchase. The instructions are very clear and well illustrated. The individual parts were very well packed, individually wrapped and taped up. So well in fact that it was slightly annoying to have to unwrap every single part, but it\u2019s great for ensuring little to no damage during shipping. The cage is very sturdy and seems to be versatile. I expect to get plenty of use out of this equipment for a long time.",

      "text": "I've seen people say this was difficult to assemble... it's not. Theres only 11 pieces plus the nuts & bolts. The schematic is confusing to read, but if you allow logic to prevail it's simple. I bought this to do TRX in the garage, but at 180 its unstable and I pull it over. I'm thinking I need to anchor it to the ground (with chains or something) so I don't feel like I just wasted $250... Despite what some have said in their comments this is not suitable for TRX movements. It unfortunately falls short of my intended purpose, and that's why it loses a star.",

I am able to to do plenty of exercises on this: floor barbell bench, barbell squats, bent over rows, pull ups. I highly recommend this for a budget garage gym.",

Buying this power cage was a no brainer affordable and I can accomplish what needs to be done for my weight training needs. Provided its not made from superior materials like the racks at the new streamline gyms. This cage works for me. I am very happy with the product.........",
