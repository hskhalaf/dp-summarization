It would be nice if more than one alarm unit could be paired with one remote. Placement of the alarming devices at various or hard to access locations will make it tougher for vandals to damage the unit(s) when sounding. These units are priced reasonably low considering other options on the market.",

I've only had them for about a week, so I can't speak to battery life quite yet. One was mounted on my roof-top cargo carrier. The other was mounted on a small kayak/camping-gear trailer. It doesn't take much movement to set the alarm off...which is good.",

      "text": "I bought 2 of these alarms. So far they r working good. I have it on my E bike. And got one for a extra one. They r pretty loud. Little louder than a smoke alarm. Just a light hit on the bike seat the alarm will make a warning beep. The remote takes a 12v 27A battery. May have to order some from Amazon they have u get 5 12v27A batteries for $6.99. So far they r working good.",

This paired with a throttle lock or disc lock, I have peace of mind when parking it outside.",
