I had to actually use additional tools to try to fix bent pieces that were so ridiculous they couldn't feasibly be properly matched to the respective positions. (Yes I followed the directions, lettering, and common sense.) Would not buying another item from this company unless I want to gamble a decent product against having to return it.",

It's very sturdy and strong enough to support the weights of an original Xbox one, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, a 32\" HDTV, a multitude of game cases, controllers, and two gaming headsets. I have just two issues. One is that the minor attachments like the game case holder and stuff requires a drill to install which was a bit more tedious, but understandable. Also, the table was a little smaller than I expected, but that is my fault for not really thinking about the dimensions of what I was purchasing. Overall great product at a reasonable price.",

The slide out wire drawer my son took off because he kept bumping into it (makes annoying noise too when it moves), but with all that said, it's perfect for him.

Pretty difficult to put together thinking of how easy it could've been with a little better designed. Some of the bolts are impossible to reach with the screwdriver( underside baskets). Cheap metal was made for the baskets but it's kinda cool. One might say that this is flimsy. I give it a three because I feel for 115 dollars shipped it will do us justice for a year",

I had to drill larger holes to fit the screws securely. Then again, I'm not an expert, so maybe that was the idea. Either way, both obstacles were troublesome but not impossible. Other than that, it's sturdy, spacious, and equipped with everything I will need. Definitely recommended if you know how to adjust the parts.",

      "text": "it's a pretty good minimal workstation, excellent for a small space where you need to make good use of the space available. I got it to use as a workstation, and I certainly would not use it as a gaming desk, at least not given the way I play games. It isn't nearly sturdy enough to withstand the kind of strain a gamer would put on it in a high-intensity game. EDIT: Knocked off another star because, for the first time in a decade, I've had to use a mousepad. The surface texture of the desk does not play nicely with a blue light mouse. Cursor jumps all over.",

I am not a very handy person though. It'd probably be easy for someone good at putting things together.",

The reason I have given it 4 stars, is because the monitor stand bounces and shakes a little bit when doing heavy typing as I am doing right now. But for gaming (World of Warcraft) the monitor does not really move while pressing hotkeys and clicking my mouse, so it is not a big deal to me if it shakes a little while typing, I use a headset mostly anyways.",
