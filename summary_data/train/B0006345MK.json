Also, you can roll them on the floor for chasing, or pitch them for a \"mouth catch\", getting both snack and playtoy in one. They are a bit more expensive (30%+/-) than the Kirkland biscuits.",

My 9-year-old, 16-pound Schnauzer mix would just wolf down the smaller kibbles so fast and look for more. Now she takes one kibble at a time, to her \"special treat\" spot. I noticed she takes her time chewing the larger kibbles and they seem to satisfy her, because she doesn't come looking for more when her bowl is empty. My Vet says her teeth are looking great, so I do feel the larger kibbles keep her teeth much cleaner due to all the chewing she has to do. I will continue to buy this dog food.",

He's not crazy about the big kibble. Not.At.All. Then again, I didn't expect he would be...his extreme underbite prefers tiny bites. However comma...he finds the flavour so enticingly palatable that he eats it more readily than smaller kibble he likes less (like lamb...don't even). I can see that the slight workout his jaws get will be beneficial as he ages. For those of you worried about the large nugget size, you might be surprised. Certainly worth a try...I'm glad I did.",

He has done so much better on this food. He looks great, has dropped some unneeded weight, is far more content with feeding and his teeth look great as well. The kibble is large enough to be used as treats; all the dogs love it, even the smaller ones love it for a treat. You feed less of this kibble if you follow the guides, so it's quite affordable.",
