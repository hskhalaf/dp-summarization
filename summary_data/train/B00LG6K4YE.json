Secondly, certain spots around the edge of stitching the fur looked like it was coming off and probably would over time. The fur seemed to have bald rows where fur should have been placed. The wildness of the fur kind of hides it. You can honestly buy a better bear at a local store for the same price. Pro: Soft fluffy fur Cons: Smaller than advertised, not well crafted",
