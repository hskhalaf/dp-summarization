The fit is inconsistent from one production location to another. I had to return these and pay full price in a specialty retail store where I could try on several pairs from until I found a pair that fit. You will find other reviews that go into detail about this, but the net is that if you have been wearing size X for the last 10 years and order a new pair it will not fit like the last several pairs you bought.",

Sadly, these new and (not) improved clogs are wide and provide a sloppy fit, even with fairly bulky socks. I am returning them for a size smaller, although I am not particularly hopeful that this will take care of the problem, since the challenge is the width of the slipper, not the length.",

When measured side by side with my old pair the top wool is shorter, thereby, you have to work harder to keep the updated shoe on. The cork base of this shoe is not meant to be bent as in squatting and the shorter top may accommodate that issue. But I don't squat on a daily basis, so it's never been an issue for me. Also, the size 40 must be a man's size. I wear a woman's 40. All in all, how very disappointing that Haflinger decided to make changes to a near perfect shoe.",

I have foot problems and they are the one thing that always feels good. I wear them in the house year round, and it's like a foot massage when I put them on. SO I finally bought him this pair because he was complaining about foot pain from running 70+ miles a week, and he wears them now too when he's in recovery mode after too much marathon training. He loves them, and I have resisted the urge to tease him. My advice is, don't worry about what they look like, you will LOVE the way they feel.",

      "text": "I've been buying Haflinger clogs for a long time, usually the Grizzly. This latest clog I bought is sized correctly, the insole fits perfectly with great support as always, but the top of the clog is different. The \"cutout\", the part with the embroidery, is much too big for my taste. When seen from above, this cutout is a good inch closer to the tip of the shoe. Consequently, it is much looser on your foot. The clog now flip flops around instead of staying snug. Even a crazy high arch won't fill out the space. Someone who has edema will be helped by this new design, but no thick sock will make a \"normal\" foot fit properly.",

They look almost exactly like these except that the opening on these is a full inch longer, so the top of the clog is now at about the center of the top of my arch (felt on these is approx 4.5\" while on the last pair it was 5.5\" long). This shortening of the wool leaves the entire shoe feeling like it's too large, though the overall length is accurate and I don't think they're actually wider than my original pair. I'm disappointed... It feels like they're saving money on materials and cheapening the shoe, but the price isn't cheap.",
