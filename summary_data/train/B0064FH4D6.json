The materials used are very good, the buckles and sole strap are very nice and they stayed on my calf the entire walk even though I had them over nylon pants. A superb product I would highly recommend.I actually felt a sense of warmth and walking comfort with them on.",

However, after only 1 month of wearing these the metal clasp at the base of the gator which holds the lower strap in place snapped in half. Im not sure what quality the metal clasps are, as the rest of the material used seems to be of decent quality, Considering I buckled the lower strap once, and slip my boots on and off to avoid breaking down the Velcro and buckles I expected something of this quality to last much much longer during my long alaskan winters. Wont be buying these again, I suggest you dont either.",

For size comparison, I am 5.10, weigh 160 lbs and wear a size 11 Danner boot. they fit everything great except they are a little loose around my calf and they really have no way to adjust that. I have considered adding a strap or something for that. However I use them and the stay up. Just not quite tight enough. Mine are the large size.",

Maybe it's waterproofing. Most people won't be washing these as often as I do. They are still working well. Good, sturdy Velcro on the front.

Well worth the price, they have held up well. Only giving 4 stars due to moisture retention inside the gaiters.",
