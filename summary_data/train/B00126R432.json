      "verdict": "Many people liked the Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 35. They welcomed the color schemes, the sturdiness of the engineered mesh, the comfortable underfoot platform, and the traction-ready outsole. Moreover, the versatility of this model was lauded. On the other hand, several consumers complained of an inconsistent fit, as well as a decline in the quality of the aesthetics via the midsole creasing.",

      "title": "Great road shoe - fast and cushioned.",
      "text": "Great as an everyday road shoe. Good grip in the wet. These shoes are fast and as with my other Nike's really benefit from being driven rather than cruising. Reasonably well cushioned though not as well as say Brooks Glycerin. They need to be tied again after about a mile as they tend to come loose. A bit sloppy on the heel without lacing through the second hole. Overall a good shoe for a good price.",

      "text": "Trainers look great. Normally a size 8 UK fits me fine I suggest getting a half size or full size bigger these are a narrow trainer .i have had 100 s of pairs of nike over the years.but these were the biggest waste of money to date for me. I don't have particularly wide feet.the only thing I can think is that these are a woman's trainer.and design is not as a man's would be.after 2 days of wearing I hav knee pain.so now these trainers will be redundant.saying that I do suffer knee pain any way but these amplified it within days.so be aware.",

But for sprinting/fast intervals on the track (for me around 3min/km) they work excellently and surprised me, really responding much more to higher speed and providing great stability. Tongue is a bit long and the heel fits a bit loosely for me (seems a bit of overt design) but think I've found excellent 'fast shoes' when I was expecting these to be more long training-type shoes.",
