But my teeny tiny air plant is cozy and safely nestled inside one now, and seems perfectly happy. I used one to gift a different variety air plant to a friend, and that one is pouring out the opening... so in hindsight I wish I had purchased a larger size. Eventually, my little \"Tilly\" will outgrown her glass living room and will have to be moved to larger quarters. Ah well, parenting is never easy.",

I originally bought these back in summer to stick some succulents in and enjoy, but I procrastinated a bit and fall came around. I bought a bunch of $1 decorations from Walmart, stuck them in the terrariums and now I have an amazing windowsill! Just a few tips on these... - Think outside the box! These terrariums can be used for more than just succulents. - Hang with fishing line if you want to go for the \"floating\" effect. - The terrariums will not stay in place, they spin all day, but I anchored mine to the window with a bit of fishing line.",

Because it is glass, the 3 terrariums were all individually nicely boxed when shipped, so nothing was damaged. I definitely recommend the little glass terrarium.",
