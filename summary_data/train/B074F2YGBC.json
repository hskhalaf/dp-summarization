This vacuum is powerful, lightweight, and comes with 2 rechargeable batteries! It\u2019s so easy for me to grab it from its corner and clean up the house with no fuss with a cord. I bought this vacuum over a year ago and I still have NOTHING but good things to say about it! So glad I talked myself into buying myself an almost $300 vacuum!",

With sewing, there are lots of threads, fabric pieces, etc and this make quick work of cleaning up the area....on carpet or had floor. We don't use it as our main whole house vac but certainly could for quick touch-up. We recommend the 2 battery unit as the batteries don't last all that long. Easy to use and easy to dump. It is a tad pricey for what it is, but we're happy with it so far.",

      "text": "LOVED this vacuum when I first got it. First I couldn't believe I spent $400 on a vacuum, but once I started using it, I quickly fell in love and was happy about my decision. Unfortunately, it started giving me issues only 2 months in, where it shuts off either a few seconds to maybe 2 minutes into using it. I've kept it clean and looked into fully charging the batteries, making sure the entire tube is cleared, cleaning the filter, and everything. Nothing will get this thing to work for longer than 2-3 minutes making it totally useless. So, unfortunately, I have no choice but to leave a 1-star review and warn anyone of buying this thing.",

It would never work for our whole house because it just doesn't have the kick and the suction required for that job. We have an appreciable amount of pet hair and that job is best left to the regular vacuum cleaners. So, if you have a small space with little need for great suction this may work for you or if you have limited use like we have for just spot cleaning.",
