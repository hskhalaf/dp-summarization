The third time the phone delivered to me was getting warmed up during the use. This was happening even if I used the phone for 20minutes. This is really frustrating and irritating. You like the phone but every time there are heating up issues.",

I haven't taken many photos yet but what I have taken look good. All in all an excellent purchase.",
