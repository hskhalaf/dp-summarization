It is great because it has time and temp, plus you can change the sound to go off in 30 or 60 minutes, or continuous play. It is also great that it comes with an AC adapter or you can use batteries for trips. Some of the sounds are weird, and you cant layer them, but my mom friend recommended it and it is definitely a must-have!",

However it has an alarm feature that will randomly go off which woke my kids on several occasions! Nothing in instruction booklet to help figure out why. The alarm would just randomly go off. Thought maybe it was a defect so I got another one because my son lived the stars only to discover after months of use it started to do same thing with the alarm. Oh and if power goes out the battery backup does not automatically keep it on. You have to manually turn it back on.",

And then when I would find one, it would either only play the sound or lights all night; not both. This product gives you the option to cut off after a certain time or leave on all night and separates the choices for the sound and lights so you can cut off one and leave the other on. I would recommend this product to any parent who's young child struggles to fall or stay asleep because of outside distractions or fear of the dark",

I would wake up to my boys laying bed yelling at each other to be the one to turn it off. We basically started every day angry. I decided to find an alarm clock with a better tone. My boys LOVE this new alarm clock, the star projections are fun and soothing, and they take turns deciding which sound they are going to wake up to the next day. I definitely recommend this alarm clock for young children (or anyone, really)",

      "text": "What is up with the cord?? It is so short, barely reaches the wall sockets. It's literally like 8 inches long. USB port only. Also, I hate that the alarm sound is same sound as what you choose to go to sleep with. My son likes the water sound but when the alarm turns on in the morning, you can barely hear it so he wouldn't wake up. Useless as an alarm clock.",

      "text": "Features sounded great with alarm clock, soothing sounds and night stars, but the product fell short on all fronts. The clock kept resetting, the am/pm buttons did not work properly, and the sound stopped working altogether after only 2 nights. We never had a chance to test the alarm because the clock time kept resetting and the time was never correct for my daughters wake up time. The only working feature was the night sky, which was nice; however, even this had flaws as the lock button to hold on a specific color did not work properly. The product was returned after 2 nights.",

Overall, for the price it's okay.",
