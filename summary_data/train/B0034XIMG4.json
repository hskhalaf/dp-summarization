He issued me a partial $10 refund so i could get the strap because thats really just the only part i wanted/ needed besodes the camera because it runs on batteries and came with those. He handled the situation perfectly. I recommend buying from this seller!",

I received this camera and shot a few pics on \"point and shoot\" setting. I was incredibly disappointed. The photos were fuzzy, just flat poor quality. I do not know if this particular camera was a fluke of some kind. I returned it immediately. It was a fraction of the cost of my original Coolpix 5700.

It requires pretty good illumination fot it to take bright pictures. If the room is a little dark, the LCD starts grainy and pictures comes out less bright (yellowish) Flash is manually operated which is a hassle if you in a time senstive moment. Video quality is decent. Although not at par with other HD recorders. Even smartphone's HD video quality is better than this camera. Overall, although not a junk, Could have been better.

I'm using rechargeable AA batteries in it and I was able to take a lot of pictures (roughly about 600 some with the flash) before I had to replace the batteries. I'm glad I switched over to Nikon. I was aware of the brand since I already own a D3100 but I wanted something more compact and lightweight. Plus I really didn't want to use my DSLR on the job site.",

The only problem so far is we're having trouble getting the HD video to play back on our HDTV. This may be operator error but have not had a chance to thoroughly investigate why it is not working properly. It plays alright as a non high-def video though. Overall a great product.",

The camera's new huge bright 3.0-inch high-resolution (460k-dot) LCD lets you compose and share your pictures with family and friends. The Coolpix L110, with Nikon's 5-way VR Image Stabilization System takes incredible pictures, incredibly easy plus you can take HD (720p) video with stereo sound! Nikon's Smart Portrait System which; automatically detects your subjects face, takes a picture when they smile and warns you if they blinked. \n\n\n\nBring special moments closer all day with 15x optical zoom, and a long battery life \n\nCoolpix L110, a powerful photographic tool that blends ease-of-use with advanced shooting functions, a long-lasting battery life, and high-power zoom reach. Combining the precision optics of a Nikkor lens with the image quality and performance benefits of Nikon's innovative EXPEED digital image processing concept, the Coolpix L110 is ready to capture every special moment with quality and clarity. \n\nThe Coolpix L110 features the compositional freedom of a 15x zoom, Nikkor lens. Covering 28mm wide-angle to 420mm super-telephoto shooting, the lens' broad focal range can readily handle everything from landscapes and group shots, to tight close-ups and shots taken from a distance that allows shooting subjects as they move or play naturally. It even covers macro shooting ability from as close as 1 cm (0.4 in.). \n\nThe power-efficient Coolpix L110 can shoot approximately 840 still images or record 7 hours*1 of HD movie footage using the supplied Energizer Ultimate Lithium AA batteries (FR6/L91). Regular alkaline or optionally available Ni-MH rechargeable batteries can also be used, eliminating worries about running out of power virtually anywhere. \n\nThe Coolpix L100 offers a lineup of advanced image stabilizing features*2. Nikon's Image sensor shift and Electronic VR compensate for the effects of camera shake, while Motion Detection automatically controls shutter speed. Extended light sensitivity settings as high as ISO 6400*3 add further capability that helps ensure sharper results when shooting in low light or capturing fast-moving subjects. The secure grip for the Coolpix L110 is also designed to complement these technologies by lending added stability when shooting. \n\n*1 Recording stops automatically after 29 minutes. This figure is based on in-house testing standards and stated for recording at 25\u00b0C with AA-size lithium (FR6/L91) batteries. Actual results may vary greatly depending on factors that include differences in ambient temperature, and the amount of zoom and autofocus operations used.\n*2 The camera selects and uses only the features required to optimize each image.\n*3 ISO3200 and 6400 are available only for image sizes of 3M (2048 x 1536) or smaller. \n\nNikon Coolpix L110 Feature Highlights \n\nEXPEED digital imaging technology\nNikon's smarter approach to digital imaging technology. From image capture to processing, Nikon's comprehensive EXPEED digital imaging concept encompasses the entire picture-taking operation. EXPEED is much more than a processing engine; it is a revolution in digital photography. \n\n\n\n3-inch, 460k-dot TFT LCD featuring Nikon's Clear Color Display\nThe high-quality 3-inch Clear Color Display for the Coolpix L110 features anti-reflection coating and screen brightness adjustment, which greatly reduces reflection and improves visibility outdoors for a more vivid, clearer image preview and playback. \n\n\n\nHigh-Definition movie recording\nEntertain audiences with movies that capture the entire impact of the scene with HD. The Coolpix L110 records up to 7 hours*1 of HD movie footage (720p) with stereo sound with its conveniently positioned Movie-record button. HDMI output is also available for easy in camera playback on your TV or computer.\n*1 Recording stops automatically after 29 minutes. This figure is based on in-house testing standards and stated for recording at 25\u00b0C with AA-size lithium (FR6/L91) batteries. Actual results may vary greatly depending on factors that include differences in ambient temperature, and the amount of zoom and autofocus operations used. \n\nSport Continuous Mode \nSport Continuous Mode offers the added benefit of shooting as many as 20 consecutive pictures at a rapid 11.1 frames per second to capture all the excitement of most action scenes. \n\nFive advanced image stabilizing features* help ensure sharper results\nVR Image Stabilization in action. Compensating for the effects of camera shake to realize sharper results and contribute to a more reassuring shooting experience, Image sensor shift and Electronic VR (Vibration Reduction) frees you to enjoy capturing special moments without worrying about slight hand movements. High ISO 6400 capability at any image size up to its maximum of 2048 x 1536 pixels allows faster shutter speeds when shooting in low light or capturing fast-moving subjects. Motion Detection automatically controls shutter speed and the ISO setting to compensate for subject movement as well as camera shake. And, Nikon's original BSS (Best Shot Selector) function automatically shoots a series of sequential frames and saves the one with the sharpest focus.\n* The camera selects and uses only the features required to optimize each image. \n\nIntelligent automation contributes to carefree shooting\nEasy Auto Mode simplifies photography by taking control of settings; just turn on the camera and shoot freely. Activated in Easy Auto Mode, Nikon's Scene Auto Selector eliminates the need to manually select a scene mode to match the shot, making it faster and easier to capture the moment. This function analyzes the subject and its surrounding settings and automatically selects the most appropriate of the following six scene modes to achieve optimal results--Portrait, Landscape, Night Portrait, Night Landscape, Close-up, or Backlight. \n\nNikon's exclusive Smart Portrait System\nAutomatically detecting as many as 12 faces in the shot, Face-priority AF helps produce satisfying portraits by adjusting focus and exposure. Smart Portrait Mode* helps to faithfully record precious moments by automatically releasing the shutter when the subject smiles. Blink Warning alerts the photographer when it suspects that a subject has blinked. Now featuring faster processing speed, In-Camera Red-Eye Fix automatically corrects perceived red-eye effect before saving the image to memory.\n*The Smart Portrait Mode function for the Coolpix L110, L22 and L21 operates in the same fashion as the Smile Mode function for other models. \n\nNikon Coolpix L110 Other Features  * Macro shooting from as close as 1 cm (0.4 in.) \n * 15 scene modes for optimized shooting in various settings \n * D-Lighting \n * Approx. 43 MB of internal memory \n * Powered by commonly available AA-size/R6 batteries \n\nWhat's in the Box  * FR6/L91 (AA-size) lithium batteries x4 \n * UC-E6 USB Cable \n * EG-CP14 Audio Video Cable \n * AN-CP21 Strap \n * LC-CP20 Lens Cap \n * Coolpix Software Suite CD-ROM",
