The reason I'm giving it two stars is because I've taken very good care of it and after 6 months of use, it's rusting from the inside, and Yeti's warranty won't cover \"breakdown of materials over time\". Not something I expect to see from a $40 bottle. I'll be switching to a different brand for my next bottle, I suggest you do the same if you want something that lasts.",

To compare, the REI Yeti keeps ice over night and the water is still nice and cold. Lesson learned, won't buy a Yeti from Amazon.",

Have the magnetic cap coming, real only reason trying a double in cost vs HiWill. Will update if I loose cold time with the accessory top. Update: overpriced garbage, don\u2019t hold ice for 8 hours. Seeing moisture in my second pic, tells me poor insulation. Without gunkote to seal this would suck more. The name is like buying a apple, overprice with better options at a cheaper price.",

Since it's wide mouth it doesn't lend itself to a dripless pour, so it drips every single time I fill my mug. And the lid is rather big, so it has a lot of drippy condensation to manage when you remove, as well. So basically it works great, just be prepared so you don't drip coffee and coffee-water all over the papers on your desk at work.",

I've had Hydroflasks and some other off brand and Yeti is by far my favorite!!!!",

I also will fill this with coffee at the start of my 8 hour shift and by the end, whatever is left is still hot.
