When it's pressed against wood it nearly stops turning entirely. I spent 20 minutes trying to sand a very small piece of wood and the paint is still on the wood. I used 80 grit sandpaper on it which is more than enough to sand the paint off, but not with this awful sander. It's a big waste of money. Spend a few bucks extra and get one that's worth it.

Biggest deterrent for this sander is the dust collection port/filter wasnt very reliable or sturdy. After emptying it just a handful of times the seal never sat right again. Aside from that i would say dollar for dollar this is a good buy.",

Yes, the 5\" sanding discs are pricey compared to the consumables for rectangular paper sanders but it makes changing SOOOO much easier and faster. The discs last forever, too.

Half the time the sanding disk isn\u2019t spinning, just shaking, because this thing has no power to it.

The other con is that there is no speed-selection. It has one speed and it is a good speed for most projects, but you may want a slower speed for more smaller projects.

Very smooth operation and gliding. Also, little to no sand on the table, so the small suction holes underneath did their job! It\u2019s working great so far and feels solid and sturdy. Can\u2019t beat the price!",

Although it doesn't get the corners of course because it is round. I was researching between this and a squared one, but so far a lot more people said the rounded gives you more of an even finish...I wish I got the square personally, but this did a great job. The dust didn't fly everywhere so much because it vacuums most of it into the bag. Its not too loud either. It has a Velcro so you just slap on the sand paper and go.",
