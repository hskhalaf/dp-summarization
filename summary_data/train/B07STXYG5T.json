On any other keyboard, I'd say \"so what\" -- but this keyboard cost $200, and is sold on how \"well made it is\". Now, all I can do is wonder where else they cut corners (because they clearly cut corners on the foam feet).",

The stand accessory that needs to be purchased separately is not as stable as the pro. By not stable I mean, it sometimes would close just by a slight push, which is a bit frustrating, though it is not too bad. 2. They don't come with Mac Keycaps which the Pro Keyboard comes with.

Typing on a split keyboard is a new experience.

Right now, its so reasonable. When the only worry you have is the possible software on a future iteration, the product is very good. Silver switches don't come on all keyboards too, so pretty happy about that. I have large hands and the rests are fine. Not totally ergo for me (nothing really fits) but much better than nothing.",

Cons: - Lift kit sold separately. Without the lift kit, it's not nearly as comfortable. - No wireless option. Kinesis does sell a wireless split keyboard, but it uses rubber dome keys rather than mechanical keys.

Frosted plastic, extra comfy palm pads, great button response (mx brown is slightly tougher than kinesis pro default switches, but response provides a physical pleasure). The only thing bothers me is an Esc button changed position compare to the Pro model. But it's kind of seats in more logical place right now, so it's not a big deal.",

Pros: - good ergonomics, can position hands in any position - high quality materials - comfortable and responsive typing. Cons: - For Mac users, the command key is too far to the left which actually caused more strain when doing shortcuts like \"Command+T\" for new creating a new browser tab which I commonly do. This is the main reason why I ended up returning this item. - Takes up a good amount of space on your desk. - No bluetooth",
