      "text": "I bought this to make some pizzelles for Christmas presents this year and they turned out great! I am glad I didn't buy one with \"non-stick\" surface. I saw one in a local store and the surface was just plastic (not a teflon type surface like a non-stick pan). Consuming something that has been heated on/in plastic is not good for you. This one is very non-stick. You only need to spray it with a little oil before you make the first batch of the day. I made like 100 pizzelles after just spraying it once. It is easy to clean too. Highly recommended!",

I just finished my first batch of pizzelles and did it in half the time my old baker took. The instructions are simple and their recipes are good. I, too, was surprised at how nicely the grids worked and only needed a spatula (not toothpicks and brute force) to remove the pizzelles. Happy holidays to me and all my cookie monsters.",

I bought this one as a part of \"my favorite baking items\" for my daughter's bridal shower gift basket. The first 2 cookies in a batch are always \"tests\" - and they never stick from that point on. (I've never used a non-stick pizzelle maker, but have to wonder with that high heat,if that finish's nasty by-products would leech into the cookies - Yech!) Great product and would highly recommend it! This is the brand and type that I've bought for several gifts and everyone loves it.",
