I didn't need anything to prevent from sticking they popped right out. The only thing that was a bit difficult was transferring the molds to the fridge after the syrup was in them because they were pretty wobbly but that is to be expected. Next time I will make sure to put them on a tray before pouring for easy transfer. Thank you!",
