I contact them to advise but they refused to do anything stating I am by far past the 90 day warranty (I was over by a few weeks) and they couldn't be sure I did not damage it even though I had already made a charging issue complaint with the company. They do not stand by the products they sell.",

If I take away my spoiled rotten, it's actually a good phone and serves the purpose I purchased it for. Timely delivery. Thank you.",

The keyboard on the touchscreen is in ABC form, not QWERTY form like on most touchscreens.

We couldn't even charge it up. The company did treat me well though. I was able to get my card refunded and when I complained about paying the postage for its return they even paid for the return postage.",

I have also saved money as I no longer pay for the insurance every month, because I know I can just go on amazon and find a phone that is better, and costs only as much as the deductible. Texting is great, with no problems, and gets a massive work out as this is my 13 year olds phone. Camera works well.",
