I will give it 3 stars though- because for a sulfate free shampoo, it does clean your hair and scalp adequately and without leaving behind an oily build up like most sulfate free shampoos. It doesn\u2019t lather or spread easily, so if you have long hair, you will need 2 pumps or you\u2019ll have to shampoo twice to get your whole scalp covered. The smell is pleasant, it\u2019s a light herbal type scent. I doubt I\u2019ll reorder because of the expense. I really wish it did work for me.",

I'm anxious to see if it does anything for my rapidly thinning hair. The label says to wait at least three months of continuous use for noticeable effects, which is very fair considering how slow hair growth cycles are. I actually love the odor and how my hair feels after using it.",
