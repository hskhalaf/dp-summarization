After the assembly, the couch looks good, and the fabric seems to be durable (however it's too soon to tell).. will update this post in a couple of months if anything changes. overall I love my new couch :)",

Nothing I\u2019m complaining about, just push it back over. It is very hard and the back cusions are short. We needed something affordable for our first home with our new massive expenses, so this works for us. The chaise is long enough for my 6\u20193\u201d husband. And that end to lounge or sit in the corner isn\u2019t that uncomfortable! I added pillows for back support. Our space is big and this fit perfect! Came with throw pillows I will use elsewhere.",

The pillows (which are removable) are very comfortable and cushy but with them I do wish the seat were deeper so that I could really lean back into them and not feel like their trying to push me off the couch! The material feels like good quality and it looks fantastic. Overall great buy!",

This was a very bad purchase on my behalf and is so broken we can't even use it! I wish I knew better and went to Jordan's or Bob's etc as the quality is 1000x better than this.

The sofas is not bad for someting temporary not long term.",
