      "text": "Of all the useless things I bought or received after having a baby, this tops the list. First of all, if you run the warmer without water in it (by accident) it's programmed to self destruct and break. You can reset it but only 3 times then it's just permanently broken. Also if you're trying to warm the kiinde milk packets, they don't even fit right. The top of the milk packet stays frozen and you have to open the packet and push thr frozen chunk through with a knife. Honestly...save the money and just warm bottles under warm running water or by putting them in a pot with warm water. This product is a huge waste.",

It was great for breastmilk but I wouldn\u2019t advise it for formula, it\u2019s way too slow for that. *UPDATE* Two of these that have broken in only FOUR months. I\u2019m amazed at how poorly this is constructed. We used this strictly for one breastmilk bottle per day, so it\u2019s definitely barely used. We constantly watched the water level and cleaned it. DO NOT BUY THIS WARMER! It\u2019s 2-3X the price of other warmers out there and it only works for about 1-2 months. It\u2019s so frustrating buying something (when you already have to buy so much) and it\u2019s not dependable. Save yourself the heartache.",

I cleaned it exactly like it was suggested. One morning I went to heat up breast milk to add to baby cereal & it never warmed up. The heating mechanism went out or something. Of course at that time I was out of town with my baby so I just threw it away. Now to look at my Amazon account & I could've return it - shame on me. I should've listened to the reviews!",

The lines to show full is very nice and the line that shows where to fill for smaller bottles. Warmer doesnt get to hot like steamers. Clearly. I will admit I had to get a new warmer because my first warmers timer was not working properly. But working with the company was fantastic. Quick response and so kind. I've bought alot of other kiinde products I love their warmer so much.",

My 4 ounce bottles take 4 minutes to warm from refrigerator to room temperature. Longer time for warmer. They have a chart as a guide for other warming requirements. I am totally happy I spent the extra money on this warmer.",

It's pretty simple, there's just a timer setting and that's it. The warmer isn't \"fast\", but it doesn't flash steam the bottle, it's a gentle warming mode which is great for breast milk, but will also work for formula.

Though the water reservoir can only be cleaned by sloshing soapy water and can\u2019t be brushed and the crappy knob broke really early on and we had to use a soda bottle cap to replace the knob but the actual unit worked for 2 years warming up milk for 2 kids daily before it died.

    "title": "Kiinde Kozii Baby Bottle Warmer and Breast Milk Warmer for Warming Breast Milk, Infant Formula and Baby Food",
    "description": "The Kiinde (pronounced kind) kozii allows parents to safely and quickly warm breast milk, formula, and food in storage Bags, bottles, or jars of all shapes, sizes, and Materials. It is the first and only warmer designed specifically to follow all guidelines set forth by the CDC (centers for Disease Control) and the USDA (United States department of Agriculture) to safely thaw and warm breast milk using warm, flowing water. Patent pending safe heat technology allows high-speed warming using a low temperature, nutrient-safe water bath that is safe for breast milk. The built-in timer eliminates the risk of overheating. The result is an infant bottle warmer that is safer, more precise, faster, and easier to use than conventional warmers that use high-temperature steam. The high temperature of these types of warmers can be damaging to the antibodies and nutrients contained in breast milk. Kozii's warming chamber is designed to accommodate a full 8-ounce bag of frozen breast milk and to quickly bring it to serving temperature. Safe heat ensures that the contents of the warmer are brought to the same temperature every time as easily as possible. A simple, easy-to-read timer allows parents to set the desired warming time by simply turning the knob. When the time is up, the warming stops completely, eliminating the risk of overheating, even if the bottle or bag is left in the warmer for longer than intended. Here at Kiinde, we take customer service seriously. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact us (our support email address can be found on our website). feed your infant the quick and easy way. Try kozii today!",
    "rating": 3.7,
    "feature_bullets": [
      "SAFE & EASY WARMING: The Kozii baby bottle warmer creates a flowing warm water bath (NOT dangerous steam) to quickly and gently thaw and warm breast milk according to CDC and USDA guidelines. Unlike other warmers, Kozii does not require that you measure or add water with each use. It uses an auto-shutoff feature, so when the time is up, the warmer shuts off and completely removes the heat source from the bottle.",
      "A GREAT BABY SHOWER GIFT: Every new mom knows convenience is key when it comes to feeding a baby. Kozii is a great way to heat up expressed breast milk, baby formula, or baby food as safely and quickly as possible. It\u2019s an excellent product to use alongside other accessories, including a breast pump, bottle sterilizer, and bottle set. Put one of these baby registry best sellers on your registry today!",
      "UNIVERSAL WARMING CHAMBER: Kozii\u2019s warming chamber is designed for bags, pouches, bottles, and jars alike and it\u2019s great for first-time moms. It\u2019s gentle enough to thaw frozen breast milk and powerful enough to heat up pureed baby food. It heats foods to the perfect temperature for Baby so you don\u2019t have to worry about overheating. You\u2019ll be able to use Kozii from birth through the toddler years.",
      "PRESERVES NUTRIENTS IN BREAST MILK: Breast milk is full of the great stuff! That\u2019s why Kozii uses gentle heat to preserve the unique set of nutrients found in breast milk. You won\u2019t have to worry about the integrity of vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and white blood cells naturally occurring in a mother\u2019s milk.",
      "WARMS MANY CONTAINERS & MATERIALS: Kozii can heat up virtually any reusable or disposable container including milk storage bags, milk pouches, baby bottles, food jars, or liner bottles. It can handle both frozen and thawed breast milk and is great for heating up baby formula. Bottle steamers can overheat easily and aren\u2019t effective for all materials. That\u2019s why Kozii uses gently flowing, warm water."
