I have the 12 and 36, and may get the 24 or 30. The 36 is 6' long and good for press or curls. So pick 3 different bars for different workouts, if I were to only have one, probably the 24 or 30.",

It's just right for the arms and back and then squats. For 18lbs there's some weight but just right for me. I used it in the park this past weekend and it was just the right thing.
