Its upper offers a supportive wrap on the feet while the added texture detail improves ball touch and boosts performance. What reviewers love about this soccer cleat is its broader fit that caters to players with wider feet. However, some noted that it runs a bit large, particularly around the toes. In terms of pricing, this is one of the more affordable options out there.",
