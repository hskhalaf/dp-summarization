He doesn't like the taste of the water in them and says no thanks if I offer him one. I don't feel safe drinking out of anything that makes my water taste bad. I definitely wouldn't recommend giving them to children, they don't know any better and could be being harmed by the chemicals leaching into the water.",

Love the size of the opening, the others I've tried are quite big and take away from the purpose, to roll down into a small size for packing and traveling. These stand up very solid with or without liquid. Intended for travel, but have replaced my every day water bottle.

      "text": "So I love how these fold up small, and they are great for traveling through the airport and not wanting to pay full price for water (fill up at the fountain), but besides that...they are just ok. The bottle is soft, so as you drink it\u2019s harder to grip and hold onto. I have to almost blow air back into the bottle to get it to stand up, and the squeeze the water out when I\u2019m thirsty. Not a terrible product, not my favorite. Might be good to keep on hand, but I don\u2019t expect I will use if for more than having a backup in my purse.",

Best of all it comes with a carabiner clip for hands-free transportation I love the feel of the water bottle, feels like light-weigh silicone.",

They fold up so nice when they are empty too, allowing you to have room in your back pack for other stuff.",
