Judging from the reviews that I read prior to making my purchase, it's evident that JPWL takes their customer service seriously and they do a great job of following through on customer concerns. Two thumbs up for the paddles and the customer support.",

And other became loose just hanging but sure tomorrow it will loose (may be I need to glue). will contact vendor. Another thing is noticeable thin paddle handle grip (thinner handle wood). This is response from Vendor:I read your review about the grip wood, I am in the process to increase the thickness, but the thicker grip paddles will need 6 months to the market. The owner sent another set with refund which is extremely gracious. Will get back new set when thickness is increased.",

Not sure yet about durability since we've only had them a week, but they were used by a bunch of kids with minimum supervision at our cookout, and none of them have any damage besides some scuffs on the rubber. That tells me they're durable enough!",

Seller has gone above and beyond to stand by the quality of their product. We\u2019ve had this set for a little over a week and one paddle already is splitting near the handle. We were really pleased initially, but to have the paddles already falling apart so quickly is extremely disappointing. The other paddles and the balls are holding up and working well.",

      "text": "Overall I'm happy with the product and believe it was a good value and would recommend. The handles are unfinished wood and while not smooth is probably a plus for keeping a grip on the paddle. A couple of the name inserts on the handle are not set correctly causing there to be a slight uneasy feeling while playing. One paddle arrived with dents all-over the paddle face, looks as if someone beat it with a hammer before shipping, though I assume it was a problem with the adhesive. I believe the company has put out a very nice paddle set but needs to work through assembly problems.",

I don't know if is because my hands are big for this kind of paddle but my wife has same problem. The other thing i noticed paddle grip should be more smooth but not big deal Overall the ping pong set is really good ...will buy again !!!!",

I don't see any added value to actually using the mesh inside the case, much easier just to throw the balls into the empty space, can fit at least 20 this way.",
