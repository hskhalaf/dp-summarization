One shows a dark rod-thin lamp/socket connector between the shade and base that is in keeping with the modern mid-century style, enhancing the look. The other shows a BIG, ugly chrome socket connector (with white socket) that totally ruins the mid-century modern style and look of this lamp. Regrettably, we received one with the big, ugly chrome connector - which I will try to paint dark brown to diminish its size and industrial ugliness that turns an otherwise nice, inexpensive lamp into a jarring dollar store item.",

It has a switch on the cord for turning the light on/off, which I prefer to the lamp styles that have the switch in the stand. (Or one of those dreaded twist ones.) And it looks great with my cozy decor. I've actually paired this with a WiFi-enabled plug so that I can schedule the light on/off and tell Google to turn it on the rest of the time.

And the switch is a really good one, not the kind you have to roll with your thumb. The wood bottom is the same outer measurements as the shade. And the shade gives a nice warm glow to the over all aura. The base is a soft wood, but plenty adequate. It will take regular bulbs but not over 40 watts.",
