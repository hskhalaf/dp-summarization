This is a special touch required to feed the manual paper but with practice you'll master it. Wish it had a lighted information display otherwise it has been a great printer. I've been using generic toner for years and see no difference from the expensive Brother toner. Just be sure to buy OEM toner.",

      "text": "I have had a Brother Multi-Function printer/scanner/fax at my office for 4 years. The thing is great! We then bought a small Brother monochrome laser printer for our reception desk... flawless! Meanwhile, we have had numerous, top name color laser printers and all have had problems and had terrible customer service experiences.... So I bought this as a replacement. I don't think I'll ever buy another printer except a Brother. Output is typical for a toner-based color laser, but I'm happy after the disastrous experience I've had w/ my 'top-name-brand' wax-based color laser printer. For the few times a month when I need near photo quality output, I just use a Kodak inkjet. For everything else, the Brother is GREAT!",

I googled this and tried a few things to no avail. I contacted the company, and they said since it was over a year old, it was no longer under warranty. Then they gave me a list of authorized services providers. I would have to contact one and pay then to come fix my printer. So, I guess I paid $270 for a printer that worked for a year. I won't be purchasing brother products in the future.",
