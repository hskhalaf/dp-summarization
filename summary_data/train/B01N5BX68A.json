Your only option is to do a complete reformat and install of the RAID. Meaning TOTAL data loss. The OS has no warnings or safeguards. This is with the latest firmware 4 as of Sept 2018. Buffalo Tech Support will tell you to send the drives out to a third party for data recovery! That is their best fix. So I'm doing the amazon return right now on both the units I purchased. Glad it happened when the units were only a week old so hopeful I can purchase something more normal.",

This device is clearly not made well if components that are required to keep the drives healthy (preventing overheating) fail within two weeks of receipt.",

CIFS (Samba) mounts work great, but the NFS support has issues with long file names, especially those with unusual characters in them. Unfortunately the CIFS support doesn't seem to report directory updates to connected servers. Overall, the product does what it says on the box. Lots of storage with RAID5 data security, which is great, i just would have thought that since the box seems to be linux-based, that the NFS support would have been better. Just to deflect the immediate question, switching to NFS on kernel mode actually made the support worse. Still, for 12TB of usable storage, the price is pretty reasonably.",

Note to others: I kept receiving security credential error when attempting to map drive in windows. After beating my head into the wall - finally found that problem was because user had PIN log on. Once we logged on with full password, issue was gone. That's a Microsoft issue - not NAS. Great product. Highly recommend.",
