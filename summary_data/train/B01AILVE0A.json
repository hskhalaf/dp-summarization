The color matched perfectly, there were no broken pieces, and only a very small amount of scratches that aren\u2019t noticeable. The plastic is whitish around some of the seams, bit that\u2019s just the nature of thin and translucent plastic. And also because it\u2019s thin plastic it is going to scuff a bit. But it\u2019s absolutely perfect for what I needed it for, and because the color is exactly as advertised it fits in perfectly with the color scheme of my bathroom.",
