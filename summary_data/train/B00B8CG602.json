She started running into walls in our home and became very delirious. Contacted Bayer on their emergency telephone number on a Sunday afternoon and they were very helpful. Had to bath Zoey three times with Dawn detergent and remove the other collar off of Gabby, who had no reaction, but had the oil from the Bayer collar. Poor Gabby also had to be bathed three times with Dawn detergent. After three more days Zoey fully recovered. Be very careful with this collar. It put us through pure hell.",

With the out break of deer ticks, and dog ticks, I might find one or two attached. But rest assured they are dead! My little guy is Twelve now and switching to a collar was difficult. But it works and he has a clean bill of health! I take it off during baths and put it right back on. It starts working right away! Remember, if it is really hot and for your dogs protection, I suggest renewing it in 7 months ( 8 months in should be replaced), but use your judgement!",

Only docked a star because it had to be tight enough to fit under her regular collar, which had to be fitted enough so that she couldn't slip out of it, which led to the Seresto collar rubbing some fur off in a patch on her neck. I ended up only using it for three months because of this but maybe a dog with thicker fur or a different collar setup would not have the same problem.",

I do take it off for baths as I hear it doesn't last as long. I will buy this again. No side effects, no smell. We are all happy.",

      "text": "A complete waste of money. Got this for our 55-lb Husky mix after trying two different topical liquid flea treatments with limited success. Gave her a thorough flea bath, washed all her bedding, and vacuumed the house thoroughly before fitting her with the collar. After a couple of days, fleas were back. Gave it a few weeks to work, but her flea problem continued to get worse. After almost two months, we were getting dozens of fleas off her daily with the flea comb. Worse than ever before. Gave her a flea bath, tossed the collar, and went back to the marginally effective topical treatments.",

    "description": "Size:Dog- Over 18 lbsThe Seresto 8-month flea and tick collar for large dogs provides continuous 8-month flea and tick protection. Unlike oral flea and tick prevention products that require fleas and ticks to bite your pet to work, Seresto flea and tick collar for large dogs kills fleas and ticks through contact\u2014no biting required. Seresto flea and tick prevention is also available for cats. Seresto flea collar for dogs is water resistant and remains effective after swimming, shampooing, or exposure to rain or sunlight. (Dogs must not be bathed more than once per month. For dogs that swim once a month or more, the control duration is reduced to five months for flea control, and reduced to seven months for tick control.) Seresto Flea and tick collars for large dogs contain two active ingredients: Imidacloprid to control flea infestations and flumethrin to repel and kill ticks. These active ingredients are slowly and continuously released in low concentrations, spreading from head to toes, even the tail, over your dog\u2019s coat and skin. Seresto 8-month flea and tick collar for large dogs can be used alongside other identification collars. Avoid the hassle of messy monthly treatments and get the effective protection of Seresto flea and tick collars.",
