      "text": "This is the last over-priced big-name ear piece I am buying. To be fair, sound quality is excellent in my ear, but others complain they cannot hear me well...even when I am sitting inside my home office. Fit is not very comfortable, but not the worst either. Battery life is brutal - device claims a talk time of six hours but starts to go low after two+. Find myself charging it more than any other earpiece I have ever had. Amazon seems to have a ton of sub-$30 earpieces that claim the same benefits as this higher-priced Jabra - how much worse can they be? Why pay twice the price for what is likely the same mediocre quality?",
