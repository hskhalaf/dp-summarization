I find it surprising for fireplace tools to catch fire while using, esp. when described as \"Black Wrought Iron\". This is clearly not iron, but black painted steel! The fumes from the paint were awful & smelled up our entire house. Poor quality!",

Assembles in 5 minutes with just a Philips screwdriver and a good grip on the hex nut. No wiggle!! Holds a full stack of wood, top and bottom, like a champ. Bristles on broom are a little haphazard and plasticky, but it works great. Shovel is nice and tight against granite to sweep up the last of the ash. Very solid purchase.",

I solved that lining the shelf with newspaper or you could us aluminum foil, whatever works. I am most happy with the product.",

This unit will hold about 6 x 8\" round logs, split wood, and if you go smaller will hold a lot more. We do a lot of fire pits so for us I found that we would be filling it 2x per night so I needed one larger. But overall the quality is fine and it fills the need that we purchased it for.",

It seems to be well-constructed (just got it so we\u2019ll see how long it lasts).",
