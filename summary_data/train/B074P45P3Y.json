Fit great, something new...make sure u get the actual size because it's just the skirt around it and the elastic on one side like a tu-tu lol...but for your bed. It covers nicely too. It was wrinkled but I can definitely put in dryer and fix that.",

However, it says it has a 16\" drop so I figured it wouldn't fit .. until I asked a question and a few customers told me it WOULD fit and they were correct. I thank them. It fits just fine, is a bit wrinkled but I'm very pleased and you can't go wrong with the value for the money.",

I bought the white one. It took about 20 seconds to put on... no issues at all. You can see through it a little bit, but not bad. It hangs perfectly and ruffles right where I want it to. I was also worried about it fitting too \"straight\" instead of ruffling since I have a king size bed. I would definitely recommend this product to others which is why I took the time to write a great review.",

Granddaughter wanted to hide the bins she has stored under her bed. Fabric seems relatively durable given the cost of the product. Design is well thought out too.",

The answer to my problem, was a wrap around skirt. I love this thing. It was very easy to do. I was able to put it on our king bed by myself. Which took me maybe ten seconds to do. My only issue is it does slide down. But I purchased some bedskirt push pins and that holds the skirt in place.",
