The stability is good but not great for exercises with your chest on the bench (rear delt work, spider curls). I would think twice before adding the preacher/leg curl attachment. It is cumbersome to store and the leg exercises do not allow great range of motion. This bench may not be suitable for taller or wider folks due to its size.",

However, it is almost impossible to get it to lie completely flat. All positions are either inclined slightly or declined slightly. The product picture is a good example. Set up like this, if you lay the back down flat, it is slightly declined. If you put the support on the first notch, it is slightly inclined. I have yet to be able to get it completely flat.",

The length of the back fits me pretty well. If you are tall, this unit may be too small for you. 2. No heels support. But we are talking about a bench around one hundred bucks.

Even though the construction is light, the bench gives you the feel of a heavy commercial stationary bench found in most pro gyms. You have the option to stabilize the legs with standard bolts (included) if you want to be stationary or with fast removable pins (included) to make it portable. I use the fast removable pins so I can quickly throw the bench under my bed when my spouse doesn't want to see it and/or toss it in the back seat of my car when we go to our weekend home.

Also, as others have noted, it is very narrow. Good quality construction and very easy to set up. The low price simply reflects fewer materials resulting in smaller size.",

Very easy to move from position to position. I even went so far and blogged about it: Fixing A Spatial Dilemma By Malik Abdul Rasheed [...] I'm 5/10 and about 175 pounds. I have no issues with the surface padding area. Get this bench!",

On top of the 5 or so incline adjustments you can make, you can also adjust the legs (using the safety pins) for further adjustments. It's a little uncomfortable in the decline position (no where to wedge your legs) but other than that, a really nice bench. Feels very sturdy and fairly well padded....goes great with the Best Fitness rack!",
