Eventually it just wouldn't turn on but I used it nearly every single day for four years so I expected it.

      "text": "I had Remington hair straightened that my daughter had and left for me. It was at least 10 years old. But recently, I noticed that it was not working likes it was. So, I looked under Good Housekeeping for good ones. It was ranked #2. The rest were almost $100. I opened it up and it was so light weight. I had my doubts at the point but, my hair turned out great. It looks so much better and smoother. I made a great choice. There's only one little thing that I wish was different. The display would be a lot easier to read if it was lit up. It's totally worth it.",

      "text": "I was very excited to order this straightener as it's the number 1 seller on Amazon. However I wasn't very impressed by it. It is hard to keep it standing on any flat surface, it keeps rolling. The plastic is a matt dull purple, not vibrant and shiny as pictured and the plastic heats up and it's hard to hold and press to make ringlets. On the other hand, it does heat up fast. I can imagine that this would be a good option for someone with thin hair.",

I have thick hair but I am able to straighten my hair with only two passes, three at the most, but I don't usually need a third pass). This product is light weight and east to handle. Oh and the long plate is an extra bonus I can't believe I ever had to live without.",
