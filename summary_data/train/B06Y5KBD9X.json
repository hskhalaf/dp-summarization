At the time of purchase a pair of Maxxtrax was $340 and these were $110. You decide if the material difference is worth $230 or not. Price considered, this is a 5 star product. Maxxtraxx can be used for bridging, but you need to stack a few of them to get the strength required. Like you're going to spend the money to have that many right? These should really not be used for bridging at all given the material. It's a traction board, not a ramp. Would buy again.",

I drive a 94 Land Cruiser that\u2019s petty well loaded and these had no issues in snow or mud. Was able to make a nice mount for the arb roof rack for about 70 bones. All in all I couldn\u2019t be happier and for a fraction of the cost of their competitors. Highly recommend these boards. I have the gen3 and they measure 41 7/8\u201d long x 12\u201d wide x 2 1/2\u201d high. Roughly 4\u201d high when stacked.",
