All of the little ornaments are the same shape and having this in my home gives me a sense of nostalgia and comfort. Thank you to this company for giving me that. I am forever grateful.",

It says that \"Lost pieces are replaced promptly and free year after year\" which is good. Most likely my boys will lose the pieces years time and we can still get the replacements and keep using it. I'm hoping this will become our family tradition. Thank you for such a great product! Love it!",
