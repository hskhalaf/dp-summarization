I also like that the stainless steel doesn't smudge easily, so it still looks great after using it for a few weeks.",

I guess I was hoping for a lid that didn't open unless you stepped on the pedal. My dog likes to eat diapers so we have to keep this on top of the dresser. For the price, this was a great purchase!",

Thanks for all other reviews pointing how good the bin was as a diaper pail! It is a much better investment, which will last past the baby!",

However, the step/lid opening feature works well--and it definitely clears without hitting the underside of the desk, so having to empty it a bit more frequently is not too big an inconvenience. Appearance is sleek & professional--which is what I was going for. May be a bit pricey for the size--but the quality is Simplehuman--& I can't quibble with that. Delivery time was as quoted.
