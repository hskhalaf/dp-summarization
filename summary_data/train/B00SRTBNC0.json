      "text": "for the price, a good deal. Mine are a little too short, as I ordered 10.5 M instead of my actual size of 11 N, because they didn't have 11 N available. But they fit exactly like a 10.5 M shoe usually fits me, just barely too short and just barely too wide. So I would say their sizing is spot on. They are also not white or gray, which pleases me because for many years the only shoes that fit me were white or gray.",

Nice breathable sneaker, that washes well- not much arch support, but a snug sneaker that will let you run well- just order up a half size.",
