      "text": "The ATS-1060 sounds good at low to low/medium volumes. Crank it a little bit, especially in Bass Assist mode, and the low end drivers produce a very annoying buzz/ distortion. Yamaha clearly knows how to produce the drivers - these guys move a lot of air - but they didn't house them properly or perhaps power them properly. Also found what others have found - one needs to be directly in front of the unit to get the remote to function properly. In addition, there are times when the app just doesn't control the unit. Yes, my Bluetooth is on and WAS paired. I could live with the finicky remote, but the distorted bass makes this a return for me.",

      "text": "Ok this sound bar is the model from a couple of years ago so I bought 2 of them recently dirt cheap on Amazon. The condition listed was \"used - very good\" but they were more like \"used - like new\". Great sound, great functionality especially when used with an HDMI (ARC) input on the TV. It's not a substitute for a Home Theater setup but GREATLY improves the sound compared to internal TV speakers -- there's bass now! As of April 2019 you can still pick up \"used - very good\" ones with \"Fulfillment by Amazon\" for 1/4 the original price. The newer models have better Bluetooth, that's the only difference I can find over the ATS-1060.",

The surround is not quite as good, (simply because the speaker can't project sound behind you), but the quality is great, the volume is ample for my medium sized living room, and I have even turned down the bass. Plenty good for my needs, no separate woofer is required. Nice rich sound and a quality product. From everything I see on the spec sheet, this is identical to the YAS-106, but for less money.

The ATS 1050 delivers a bit of more bass, however the ATS 1060 sound is more balanced, more detailed and with a small sub woofer the sound is better in comparison to its older brother the ATS1050. IMHO Both are excelent systems to replace your TV speakers and to be used in small spaces. Combined with a small external subwoofer you have it all. And the app, works excelent I compared the Yamaha sound bar vs Bose, Polk and Jbl. Yamaha is the best value hands down and sounds is excellent. You wont be disapointed.",
