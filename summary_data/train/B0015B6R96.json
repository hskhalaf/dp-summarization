That was a nice bonus verification of this products capabilities. I just purchased my second bottle, the first is almost gone.

Best of all, seems like life stresses are not getting at me so much, feel more stable, relaxed and peaceful overall. Also, have given some to my hens, who have not been laying well. Now I'm getting more eggs and they seem happier, too. (Silicon interacts with sulfur in the body, and eggs contain sulfur, so maybe they were deficient in silicon?)",
