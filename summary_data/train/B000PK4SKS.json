So I wanted sturdy poles without a base, this is perfect! I read the reviews that said the instructions were confusing, which they were, so just use common sense. Then my hubs was smart and bought clamps from the hardware store so we can easily hook up the net or take it down. I attached pictures so you can see. We love this retro fit set",
