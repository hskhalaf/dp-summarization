Overall these have been fantastic and I ended up buying another pair for one of the other soccer players in our family.",

Since his calves are skinnier, he slips the sleeves from his other shin guards over the gforms for added security. The only minor complaint he's made is that it is harder to take off. Other than that, it's been great for him! Joe",

He loves these and he even leaves them on after practice sometimes for hours because he says he forgets he even has them on. He has been kicked a couple times and they are as effective as other shin guards in that regard. They do require some help to pull off though but its not hard for me to pull them off (he just can't get it over his foot by himself).",

However, they are very hard to take off, more so than to put them on. Especially if you are sweaty or wet. So this part is really frustrating to my son. We both think that they are not really protective either. So is you are playing a really rough game, this may not be your best choice. Since my son is U10, the kids are still restrained from hitting others, so its still ok. But when he outgrow them we may have to go back to the bulky ugly traditional ones for the sake of protection.",
