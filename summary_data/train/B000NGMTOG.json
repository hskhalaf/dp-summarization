This has been my 1st purchase of their product line. The peachy lip gloss is very subtle but gorgeous.

So I thought maybe Nars was onto something and this shade would go perfectly with my semi-fair olive skin tone. Well, they were onto something. It is the perfect shade of pale pink. It goes with anything and I love wearing it as my \"everyday\" go to lip gloss. It has a very subtle non-perfumey smell which I really like. I don't like really strong scented lip glosses that you end up smelling all day giving you a headache. Get this gloss, you won't be sorry!",
