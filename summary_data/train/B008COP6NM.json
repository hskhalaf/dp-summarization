The gel really dries your hair out so if you need extra moisture definitely use the cream first then the gel then possibly another cream after. Then when you toss your hair after air drying, make sure to toss with an oil or anti frizz to help with the dryness.",

A light pick softens it and my curls look great. I really love this stuff!",

I've always been wary of gel products because I hate the crunchy hair look, but this gel leaves your curls soft and defined. If you have curls from root to tip like I do, this will help them keep their shape all day long. The cream just didn't have the hold I needed, but this gel definitely does. Highly recommend it!",
