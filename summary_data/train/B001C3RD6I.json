I rolled over and saw Madrock so I decided to look it up. After seeing all the building vids I took my pad out. Now I'm sending 25ft v15s and v16s.",

It's good quality for the price but I can't help but think it will wear out quickly with the terrain we use it on. Overall, I feel it was a solid purchase for the use we will get out of it.",

If you are getting a pad for little ones, look for something softer than this. Although it's not at all what I want, I suspect it still works great for the target audience, so I'm still giving an overall positive star rating.",
