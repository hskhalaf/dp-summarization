It also has key entry and numeric touchpad entry. Lots of options depending on your preference. I have room for a full size Beretta 96, extra mag and a small wallet in my safe. It also works with my smart phone for opening, battery status and more. The only thing that was not completely clear was how to secure the smart phone app with pattern locks. I went to the Valuteksafe.com site and this was easily explained. Happy with the product.",

Bio is a little touchy. Upon product registration I emailed them and asked them to make it in America! (told them I would pay more).

The lid opens abruptly (and loudly) and causes the whole safe to jolt off the table. This is even with heavy handguns in it. There are only two screw holes to fasten the safe to a table or wall. If you use the locking cable, it uses one of the holes. One screw will probably not work over time to keep the safe from jolting off the table or if someone tried to move the safe. Overall it's a good idea but fixing those minor issues would make it better.",
