When I finally put this one up I have been asking myself what took me so long. This one is so very nice. It makes the showers feel so luxurious and so relaxing. The head is almost the size of a dinner plate. It allows so much water to spread around my body all at once. I get cleaner faster, and it keeps me warm throughout. The water pressure is very nice. It feels really incredible. Sometimes I find myself staying in the shower long after everything it is clean just because it feels so delicious.",

Only downsides would be I think it drains my hot water much faster than before, making for a shorter shower and when you turn off the water it takes a few seconds for the water to full drain from the head.
