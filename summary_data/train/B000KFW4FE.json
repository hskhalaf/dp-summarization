So far, still have bat poop in front of my door and an empty bat house. If my bat relocates, it will instantly become my favorite birthday gift ever. Guess I could give it 5 stars, it was a great value for the money, I did not want a huge bat house that cost mega $$$ like many of the others - my husband said it went up easily, but I really do not know if it works yet.",

She gave the class lots of information as well on the life of a bat. It turned out very well especially when all of the children were able to come up and have a hands on experience with the bat house. Made all the information come to life. We love the bat house and will be putting it up in our yard as soon as the weather permits. Thank you for a quality product.",
