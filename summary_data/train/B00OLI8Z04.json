We make cinnamon rolls, croissants, pies, pizza, cookies, etc. The low temp setting is around 350 and high is 450. Low temp seems to do well for about anything. It is a good idea to spin what you're cooking about halfway since the back gets a little hotter than the front of the oven. Definitely one of the best employee incentive items we've ever bought, everyone absolutely loves it! Product is well made, easy to keep clean and can be put away easily for storage.",

After several months it has become clear that this is not a good oven for frozen pizzas. It does not get the pizza crust crisp without burning the pizza - regardless of whether you use the high or low heat setting. it is not better, just more expensive.",

The double element in the top and bottom of this oven cooks fast but evenly. I've reheated leftover pizza and other foods and it taste just as good. This device is a winner. For anyone who buys one ...I assure you won't be unhappy with this baby. Try oven roasted potato skins in the unit. The thing has a cook living inside of it watching your food and making it taste like your at a great restaurant. Like Applebee's . Makes the very best chicken wings I ever had too.",
