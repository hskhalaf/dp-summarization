The night before I had injected the meat with a marinade. Meat was moist and delicious. It did take 2 gallons of peanut oil to cover the meat, but the Turkey couldn't have absorbed much of that, since the residual after cooking was nearly 2 gallons. Clean up was a breeze. So glad I bought this.",

The stubby power cord proves it's made for countertop use just like a slow cooker. But who wants to risk heating that volume of oil indoors. If you use it outside and it's cold, it takes forever to get a turkey fully cooked as was my experience. Buy a larger one made for outdoor use unless you want to fry whole chickens in it which I did. It worked fine with the much smaller bird.",
