When I put them on- it almost felt like they were on backwards for some reason. They weren\u2019t tho. Overall it\u2019s a beautiful colored suit and looks exactly like the pictures.",

The straps are somewhat adjustable, but when extended or lower they don't do much because of the cris-cross pattern of the straps in the back. It fits fairly well, and is nice and loose in the belly area. If you have larger boobs, order a size up; as someone who is pretty average I was squished in a little more than I would have liked.",
