After happily owning Samsung Televisions and phones, exceedingly disappointed with this and will never buy another Samsung refrigerator again! Read so many poor reviews since experiencing these issues. Now that I'm out of warranty, I'm not going to pour more money into this unit.",

I'm not sure how I lived life without it before. The interior is well lit and spacious. I highly recommend this to anyone. I did heed to the bad reviews about Samsung customer service however, and purchased a Lowe's 5 year extended plan.",

      "text": "Samsung has no quality controls, were a hard working family that refitted our house with this refrigerator, a samsung tv and two of this companies washers and dryers. We have had nothing but problems with all 4. The refrigerators shelving is constantly breaking ( after holding minimal weight). We have now replaced the shelving and drawers 4 times. I will never spend money like this on a samsung product again. The customer service is horrific as well. The CEO last year made 4.25 million on making products that don't work and by never replacing anything for free.",
