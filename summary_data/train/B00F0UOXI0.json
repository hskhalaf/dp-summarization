We chose this mat because it has both water (that we can play with the ferry boat on) and the train-tracks (where we can play with the train and why my son chose this one), but the 3x5 version is only the center of the image, not the whole picture. The roads are huge and since it's just the the center it's all roads and parking lot and no grass or anything. Have to get a different one, my son is so disappointed. The only reason I'm not giving this 1 star is because if this was what we wanted, it would be a decent mat.",

      "text": "As JN32613 said in their review, the rug is slightly different from what is shown to the consumer. There are no Great Lakes outlined on the rug and no rivers noted. Since I am a Michigander, the Great Lakes are kind of important to me. I'm using this rug in the kids room as a teaching tool. Other than no Great Lakes, or major rivers noted on the rug, it's a perfect fit for the room, colors match the walls in the room and the size is just perfect. Quality also seems pretty good for this rug. Have sent the seller an email noting this and hoping for a solution to get the correct rug shown.",
