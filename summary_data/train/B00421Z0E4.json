In different lighting the hues definitely change but it\u2019s a very beautiful polish! I applied Bogata blackberry and CND Vinylux top coat six days ago and it still looks great! I\u2019ll definitely be back for this color!!",

Never chips and stays shiny from first day until I remove it. Can't beat it...may cost a bit more but well worth it IMHO.

I tried two colors, and both deliver the same results\u2014by day seven, you can kiss your manicure goodbye. However, I really like the color, and OPI's smooth application makes it worth it. If it weren't for the chipping, this lacquer deserves high marks! So, 4 stars . . .",

Some reviews mention glitter but really it's shimmery rather than glittery; it has a very subtle frost effect. It's a beautiful color. The wear is typical for OPI, doesn't chip too easily.

The only bone I'd pick with it is that is isn't really Coca-Cola Red, it's much more muted, but the color is still fantastic. I love finding OPI on Amazon, because while I don't usually purchase this brand for myself, I do for my family (nail polish snobs), and the price is so much better here than in the store.",

I have Big Apple Red as well which is a flat pure red that doesn't have the jewel tone, the depth, the richness I was looking for. This one does.
