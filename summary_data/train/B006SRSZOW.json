If contemplating a medium, compare above with a garment that fits well. Feel of fabric is very soft and light, altogether quite comfortable. Seems warm enough for normal daily outdoor activities in 30 to 40 degree weather. I would encourage others to post the before/after washing dimensions of articles of clothing they review. Much more useful than statements that it shrank up to one's knees etc. etc.",

So I think its probably better to have long johns that sit a little higher so when you bend over on some cold and windy day you won't feel the North wind blowing down your b.c. !",

They are comfortable even if the ambient temperature gets too warm. Having the two layers, cotton inside and the Merino wool blend outside is truly amazing. They wash and dry well, though the care instructions are semi-cryptic with international symbols and various languages. Turn them inside out to wash, warm water, dry on low heat, do not use chlorine bleach. Shrinkage from washing is minimal. Turning inside out is pretty important, it seems to prevent pilling and felting. I will never waste my money on any other type again",

I just took my precautions and I am washing it in cool water only and not using a dryer but rather dry it flat. Fabric is really soft both outside and inside and is just thick enough that it doesn't make you feel you are wearing layers at all but still keeps me warm. I recommend it 100%.",

If you're currently wearing waffle weave, bite the bullet, spend the extra money and buy DuoFold. You'll never go back, trust me. Waffle weave always fit me sloppily, and if you get the right size, DuoFold is like a second warm, THERMAL skin. I could not give this product a higher rating. If it were a 10 star system, it would be 10 star thermal underwear. Buy these products. Period.",
