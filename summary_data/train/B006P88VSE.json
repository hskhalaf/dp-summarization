I think the setup was fairly simple and intuitive. My only beef is that there is no local network mode. If you want to connect it to a local NAS for recording, it wont do that. You will have to look at a Foscam or the like for that. This camera uploads video to the cloud with a fee. Its nice having that stuff offsite for security and remote access, but it would be nice to have the local recording option as a choice instead of having that decision made for you.",

Hard to justify the price of being more than 2x times that of a comparable D-Link camera. Based on the failure of the camera within 18 months and the price relative to comparable products I cannot recommend. The video and performance works well - no complaints there.

But after having one for nearly 4 months, it constantly disconnects and sometimes requires a power cycle to reconnect. For an always-on device where you rely on the cloud storage - I would say it's not very reliable. It is neat to have for on-demand access (assuming it will work for you when you need it). But after paying for the cloud storage for a month and the camera constantly disconnecting (even though all other WiFi devices work fine in my home) I really can't recommend it unless you want a cool toy.",

Can send iPhone/iPad/email notifications for movement or sound, and a screenshot is sent to your email with those notifications. Easy to turn those off though if you don't want them.

My only beef is that the video quality at night is very poor. Actually, when we got it the quality was pretty great, but quickly (over the matter of a month or so), the quality went down pretty drastically. Going from a good silhouette to blurs. Again, the service is awesome, and if the area you're aiming the camera at is well-lit, the video quality is good.",

The other complain is that you cannot do local recording of your video, thus without the iCloud service you can only review realtime action. This is definitely not very useful for surveillance unless you keep checking you video constantly and risk your friends telling you \"get a life man, stop staring at your damn phone\".",

We opted for the 7-day plan rather than going for the 30-day one, but may upgrade if we deem it necessary. The two cons of the Dropcam: 1. No outdoor Dropcam version 2. Sometimes unknowingly drops video feed",

Sure, it eats up bandwidth, but if I ever need the footage, I trust it's safe. The unit does tend to get a bit hot, so be careful where you put it. Try to make sure it gets ventilation.

It frequently pauses and displays in the screen a message that says \"loading....\" and I cannot see or hear what my baby is doing. Today this message appeared EVERY OTHER SECOND. I went to the settings and turned off the Alerts and it continued doing it. I called the dropcam customer service and after 15 minutes waiting on the line no one took my call and I was requested to leave a message. I will be returning this product. I just got it a few weeks ago and it doesn't reliably work for its purpose.",
