I buy these over the more inexpensive one because it can handle the heavy chemicals without deteriorating or clogging. It is also easy to clean. I would recommend this for any hard chemicals!",

The pressurized chamber will give a good amount of spray before you have to pump up the pressure again. The spray nozzle could be a little better, but like a spray bottle the tighter the nozzle is the finer the spray. So, test with water first for the spray of your liking. Like others said, cleaning is very important. Just fill it up with water, warm or hot water is best, and spray out the old stuff to clean it.",

The nozzle can get a little crazy and you have to fiddle with throughout the spraying process but it gets the job done. The latching mechanism is a pain in the butt to figure out but once you do it's smooth sailing. I would like to caution users - make sure you spray out until it stops before you open it. I managed to force it open and got a mist of poison in my face which sent me running for the bathroom in a panic. I know, stupid mistake, but we all make them, right?!......right? ;D",

      "text": "This sprayer has been very reliable over the years. I used it for weed control, vegetation killer, and pesticide (lawn and home). The Viton seals prevented leaks and pressure loss. The sprayer stopped working because the hose line got clogged. The clog was inaccessible, where the hose connects to the shut-off handle. I learned the hard way of the importance of an in-line filter. For my replacement sprayer, I decided to buy a different brand which has Viton seals and costs less. Another key factor that made me not buy the same model: the recent $9 price increase.",

The sprayer is a cheaper model, but I still feel that the gasket shouldn't have shredded so quickly. I only ever used it with a mixture of vinegar, and dish soap, no harsh chemicals or bleach. I wonder how quickly the gasket would have lasted if I regularly ran chemical through it...",

We use a great pest spray mix in a packet that we just drop in the sprayer, fill with water which disolves the packet, and start de-bugging our house shortly thereafter. We havent had to spray but once every 3 months. Easy to use, easy to fill, empty, and clean, and light weight.",

      "text": "Worked as advertised. Assembly took maybe five minutes and was very intuitive. You have to keep pumping the handle to keep the spray pressure up, but fully pumped the pressure was enough to shoot a stream maybe ten feet, which isn't bad given the price of the unit. If you spray bleach or some other corrosive material, remember to rinse out the reservoir and run a spray of water to clear the lines afterwards. This is definitely no pressure spray cleaner, but if all you need is the ability to spray a liquid while standing out of the splash zone, this will do the trick.",

I like this one a lot better for the following reasons. 1) The nozzle and tube do not leak 2) The handle snaps into place securely after pumping in the air 3) The size is perfect. My last sprayer was larger and kind of a pain to carry if full. My last sprayer's handle would not lock securely and come loose as I carried it around the yard. My last one also leaked a little, and would cause a mess wherever I stored it, if fluid was left in it.",

It is better to have water leak out than a chemical, so make sure you test it with water for leaks in the hose or the hose to tank. also gives you a chance to check out the spray pattern. worked flawlessly. no issues. gives a pretty good spray with very few pumps. Locking the handle helps when moving it, and since it only contains a gallon it's not heavy to carry. I plan to pick up another to spray weed killer.",

Cons - You have to turn the handle tight so no air escapes., You have to pump often. The 4 stars is because overall, for the price, its hard to beat, but it is mechanical and not for everyone.",
