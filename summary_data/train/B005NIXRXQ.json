After using this toaster for over two years and fishing out lots of bits of toast with the tongs, I finally threw it out this morning in disgust.",

Remains cool to the touch and the included tongs are nice for small pieces of bread that settle back in after it pops up. What seems to be amazing is that the product can self-regulate temperature; I haven't had to use the temperature control button on either fresh or frozen bread. I've just got it set on \"3\" and in a short amount of time, the bread is ready. Nice pop-up feature that works perfectly. I also really like that crumbs remain in the toaster and don't fall out until the bottom pan is removed. Great color (black and silver) that doesn't absorb fingerprints.",

I was shocked that a $25 toaster could brown my toast evenly on both sides EVERY TIME. If you are in the market for a toaster that works better than cuisanart haierer, Magic chef, etc stop right now and buy this toaster. I fits bagels and can be used with frozen products. Like I said be fore no more burnt spots then non-toasted spots you get a uniformly toasted piece of bread. Best $25 I've spent in a long time.",

It even comes with the little plastic tongs to pull your toast out with. I would definitely recommend this product. Just be prepared for a taller toaster.",

No more sore finger tips from hot toast. I just wish I could have had it in a different color than red. Most of my small appliances are grey or white. Oh, well. A minor inconvenience.",

Now it seems to be stuck on the bagel (one side only) setting, which I have never used, and it barely toasts the other side of a regular slice of bread. Even after adjusting the temperature setting, the toaster still has this problem. Sometimes, if I insert a slice of bread twice, I get something representing a slice of toast. This was a replacement for a 10 year old, poorly performing toaster. I guess I should have held on to the old toaster.",
