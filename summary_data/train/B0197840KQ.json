The color part is really useful. You probably will not use any of the crazy colors on a day to day basis, but being able to chose the right color temperature of the light to match the surrounding really helps.

It's reported as offline in the SmartThings app, although I can still turn it on and off and make other changes, strangely. Voice control via an Echo device reports that the bulb isn't responding. It seems others have seen this issue as well. As a result, the bulb is worthless to me and I'll probably send it back as defective.",
