Pros: - great punchy bass - incredible build quality - great accessories included, carry case, shareplay cable etc. Cons: - headband can get uncomfortable after extended use - basic cups are not comfortable, highly recommend buying the XL pads as they are much more comfortable and more isolating - as with most overear headphones, can get hot under the pads",

Truth be told, I had never bought a proper pair of headphones ever, so this was a big step forward. The only downside of it, is that I feel that it is quite tight on my head. I get headaches after wearing them for more than an hour. I tried stretching the material as V-Moda also suggests, but it hasn't worked as far as I can tell. All in all, great product, just make sure you don't have a huge head like me :)",

I bundled mine with the Fiio Q1 AMP & DAC and it just adds that extra something to the music that seems to get an even better experience from these already amazing headphones. Bass is the best part of these with tight but thumping lows plenty to make bass heads happy but also not too over the top that someone who prefers a flat signature would be against it.",

      "text": "Almost perfect. Sound quality is amazing. Build quality is top notch. However, if V-MODA is going to include an inline microphone, they should use a quality component. The inline microphone is just plain garbage. The recording quality of that microphone is one of the worst I've ever used. Fortunately, there's the V-MODA BoomPro upgrade that makes all the difference. Also, for my head and ears, I found that the V-MODA XL Memory Cushions were necessary for proper comfort and sound. Honestly, I think the XL memory cushions should be included with the M-100. For the price paid, I suspect the original cushions don't really cut it for most customers.",

Not only are they t-coil compatable, I can FEEL the bass which is SO SO so... dude.. so nice. I can finally wear a headset with a mic that works really well. I can't *really* tell you how good the audio is since I'm... we'll... hard of hearing. But it sounds great to me and I can hear everything clearly.",

They seal outside noise well. Although not a deal breaker, the reason for the one star deduction is the cheap headphone cord with the VModa locking mechanism.

Because of that, I would not purchase the M-100's again. After hearing the Blue Lola's at CES 2016, I think they will be the next headphones I buy at this same price point. The Lola's are super comfy, sound even better than the M-100's in my opinion, but most people would not consider the Lola's \"portable\".",

These are big and heavy looking headphones but they are really comfortable ( If they aren't at first they will once you break them in). These headphones are stylish and in my opinion looks a lot cooler then Beats by Dre headphones with its almost all metal build. These headphones fold which makes them a lot better transporting them since they fit in a small case I can easily put in my bag.",

I just don't see why they don't come included in the box, or be an option to have a version of these headphones with them pre-installed, seems like quite a few people have had issues with the default ones as well.

Everything about these headphones screams good design, and the sound quality is great.

Cons: I occasionally note muddy mids in bass-heavy rock/pop music. Original ear-pads were comfortable for short listening sessions, but hot spots occurred where my ears hit the drivers; the XL pads (available on the v-moda website for $20) completely fixed this with no change in audio quality or headphone appearance.",
