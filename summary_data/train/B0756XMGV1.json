Sent back same day! No very good given their price point. Went to John Lewis, bought another pair and the case was a newer softer look (not the hard case that Amazon sent).

Not cheap, but awesome for audiophiles. Ignore the comments about comfort, the PX are plenty comfortable. No they are not exactly discreet, but I don\u2019t care how they look, because they sound great! (Which is why for the price they are worth every penny. Supported by a great App, these headphones are a must have for anyone serious about sound rather than fashion",

Excellent timing and precision in the sound. I am hearing depths and details that I have not heard before. They really make the music more enjoyable.",

They constantly pause music for no reason connected to different devices, they drop Bluetooth connectivity to a brand new iPhone. Now I struggle to get them to connect, when I do they are connected but I get no sound through the earphones. I'm massively disappointed, IF amazon will refund I will go back to the BOSE earphones I previously had. They just work.",

I have mixed many albums too. These are not a patch on the older model in terms of sound and build. Also they start and stop all the time if you wear glasses. Really not keen but they still sound better than any Bose ones. Sound quality suffers terribly when you engage the noise cancelling too. Also the cloth is coming off. Cannot recommend them I\u2019m afraid and I\u2019ve really persevered and burned them in etc",

Discovering this when out and about is not ideal as it means I have had to go without music for days at a time until I\u2019ve been home and found an object small enough to fit in the reset button. Not impress by the noise cancelling, it did not drown out the hen party on my train at all. They reduce the noise on planes a little but I could still hear the crying babies. They are very heavy so can\u2019t really wear while walking as they fall off my head.",
