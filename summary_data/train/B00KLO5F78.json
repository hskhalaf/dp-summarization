My wife routinely laughs at me for the delight I take in pushing around the jogger/stroller and my need for an accessory pouch - the need is definitely mine, not hers. I love it. It comfortably holds my cell phone, a tall water bottle, wash cloths/rags, pens, pencils, markers and all the things a guy would want for his jogger. I like that the velcro straps grab hard and like the quality of the zippers and pouches. Extra credit goes to the communication, responsiveness, and service of Ethan and Emma who followed through on a carabiner that Amazon forgot.",

I haven't even filled all the pockets -- there's so much space!

Even when loaded with multiple beverages, toys, phones, napkins, you name it, it still hangs true without worry of tipping/spilling the drinks.

The fabric is thick and the seams well sewn. It has really strong velcro and the straps are nice and wide. It fits my BOB jogging stroller perfectly.

I find myself constantly adjusting and fiddling the straps to keep it secure while in use.

The velcro straps work perfectly on my Uppababy Vista and attach super tightly so the organizer doesn't slide around. The cupholder is large enough to hold my camelback water bottle, which hasn't fit in any other organizers thus far! It's very well made, and the zip-off pouch is pretty handy too! Definitely recommend this for all new and seasoned parents!",

They would have to be bunched up to fit/attach to the handles of the stroller (the only place to attach a parent console is where the handles attach to the frame). As a result, the console appears crooked. Also, the material is thin and feels cheap to me. At this price point I expected more quality material.",
