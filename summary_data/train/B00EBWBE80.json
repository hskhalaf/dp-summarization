So much so, that the lid did not line up correctly. There were also 2 missing utensil hooks. Overall, the quality of the grill was very good. I was able to regulate the temperature easily using tips from youtubers. One thing to note is that the grill is heavy. Made the mistake of assembling far from where it would sit. Even with wheels, it was not easily rolled to destination. Not a bad thing, just a note.",

Temperature control is very easy as long as you close the dampers at the right times and learn to make minute adjustments. Quality was very surprising for a $300 grill that includes a cart. Downsides is that with all the accessories I wanted/needed total price of grill is over $500, but of course it works as a regular grill out of the box. But if you want to capitalize on all the features, you'll need the upgrades. Grilling and smoking have come out well so far, need to try still baking and roasting. I have high hopes.",

But my research tells me that these fail only if you run them at high temp for grilling. I use a standard grill for high temp grilling and only use this for low temp long smokes. No paint peeling or metal strain if you keep the temp in those 350 degree and below ranges. I've used a Big Green version many times. I've now used this a dozen times and it works the same. This will smoke equally as good in every way.",
