The umbrella part often got stuck and was hard to fold in, Sometimes it would jam and not fold at all. The wheels are tiny and would barely take a rock or lip in the pavement. I threw this guy away. I do know how to work umbrella strollers btw (I have had a few in my time) Super cute but I would pass because for me use is the most imortant (we travel, go to Disneyland, parks etc.) so our strollers get a lot of use",

It is a shorter stroller and this is coming from a 5 ft 1 person . My husband can push it pretty easily but has to slunch and reach down to do so . The color is super bright and is such a super cute stroller because of the monster theme . I love the horns and little eye ball on top as well as the bright stripes and additions to it . Definitely worth the amazing price",

Also, when sitting in the seat the baby leans forward some and is very uncomfortable. If I could figure out how to return I would! Very disappointed!",

This product definitely is on the inexpensive side, and if you are looking for a quick solution for a short time period, this might be the choice for you. But, the stroller is definitely not on the comfortable side: my daughter didn't find it comfortable to sit in, and for the adult pushing the stroller, it was hard on your back and your hand due to the position of the stroller handle. The wheels keep turning and were especially challenging on rougher surface or bumps. I wouldn't recommend it if you plan to use it for more than one month.",
