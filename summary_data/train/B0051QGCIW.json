I was a bit worried about these because they are fairly large and I knew they would detract from the appearance of the watch. However, I'm happy to report that the watch now has updated side fasteners that are completely different. They are extremely tiny (perhaps 1/4 the size of the ones in the pictures/video), and are hardly noticeable at all. Love this watch!!!",
