The set screws that hold the handles to the base will not stay tight, causing the bars to slide and \"go crooked\" while doing push ups. I would not reccomend this product if you are planning on doing alot of push ups.",

One thing I liked about the design has been commented on in other reviews as being bad: With the bolts fully tightened, the feet on these will shift if enough pressure is applied. I like this because if you fall over while doing a hand stand, they'll give just enough so they won't break. That said, your mileage may vary. Given the choice to go back on buying these? I would make the same decision and get them. Absolutely worth it.",

The reason a purchased these push up bars was because i injured my wrist and was unable to do \"normal\" push ups without feeling pain in my wrist. With the push up bars i can do puh ups without having to flex my wrist. This has made push ups pain free... thanks j/fit!!!",
