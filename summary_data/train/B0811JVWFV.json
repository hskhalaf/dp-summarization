It is VERY difficult to repack these items for return, will not buy again.",

It tells you when it needs cleaned, it\u2019s easy clean. I honestly don\u2019t have a negative thing to say at all.",

Always love this feature. -Permanent filter, hooray for not buying filters! -Measurements in the filter to help you know how much coffee to use. Seriously love that. All in all, a beautiful, solid, well-made coffeemaker with real metal on it (not just a bunch of plastic that looks like metal).",

Surprisingly, the coffee tasted very good. Not as good as my pour-over but still very good and enough that I don\u2019t feel the need to make any more pour-overs most of the time. I really love this coffee maker and highly recommend it.",
