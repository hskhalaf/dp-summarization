      "text": "Bought unit to localize potential low level leak that several visitors have brought to our attention over the years. Unit not only detected methane in the entry to our home, but localized it to the gas line leading to the kitchen range from behind the fridge. The user calibrates the unit outside, where the ambient methane level is very low. Unit shuts down automatically after five minutes, which I find infuriating, especially when I'm under the house tracking down each gas line connector and the unit times out, requiring me to crawl back outside, re-calibrate then crawl back under the house to, hopefully, finish before the next timeout.",

Wanted to ensure my ventilation system was sufficient. Appears to function well. Tested using Butane from a lighter. It appeared to function. I then re-zeroed and tested the Battery compartment readings from 160-320 PPM dependent on proximity to the batteries. As the batteries gas hydrogen and hydrogen sulfide, not sure which it is reading but both are of concern, so testing is worthwhile. Very Happy with my purchase.",

From day 1, this detector never picked up a single thing, even when a gas leak was confirmed with a different unit. The final straw was when I held it up at the vent hood on a gas water heater and it didn't go off at all. Luckily, I was able to get a refund for the unit, even 6 months after I bought it. I am replacing it with a TIF8900 for only $5 more.",

    "title": "RIDGID 36163 Model micro CD-100 Combustible Gas Detector, Gas Leak Detector",
    "description": "Effective and easy to use, the RIDGID 36163 Combustible Gas Detector provides simple and quick readings to identify the presence of combustible gases. This gas leak detector is designed to detect Methane, Propane, Butane, Ethanol, Ammonia, Hydrogen and many other combustible gases. For safe and accurate detection, the micro CD-100 is the ideal tool to ensure proper gas line installations, check for maintenance and repair needs, or quickly pinpoint combustible gas leaks.\n\nIt features a rugged yet ergonomic design that offers comfort while at the same time withstanding rigorous jobsite use. The Tri-Mode Detection offers flexibility, allowing you to select between visual, audible and vibration alerts, and a 16-inch flexible probe allows location and detection of leaks in hard-to-reach and confined spaces. With adjustable sensitivity settings, even low-levels of gases can be detected in seconds. The gas detector has a field replaceable sensor for more up-time and less time waiting for repairs.\n\nThe CD-100 features automatic calibration, a detection range of 0 to 6400-ppm (Methane), an alarm sensitivity of 40-ppm (Methane) and uses 4 x AA batteries (included). Detects Methane, Hydrogen, Propane, Ethylene, Ethane, Hexane, Iso-Butane, Benzene, Ethanol, Acetaldehyde, Toluene, P-Xylene, Ammonia and Hydrogen Sulfide.\n\nRIDGID covers its products with a lifetime warranty against defects in material or workmanship for the life of the tool.\n\nSince 1923, RIDGID has remained the symbol of certainty to dedicated professionals of the expert trades. Every tool that bears the RIDGID brand is engineered to the same high standards of quality, strength and endurance, as was that first heavy-duty pipe wrench more than 80 years ago.",
