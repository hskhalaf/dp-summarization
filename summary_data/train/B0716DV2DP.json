There are a few flaws in the wood on the top, but that just adds to the \"farmhouse\" feel and look. And I, a 79 year old lady, put it together, easily, by myself in a matter of minutes.",

Quality wood, easy to assemble with 8 bolts, 2 on each leg, very sturdy and stable, fast shipping, excellent packing. The white on this one is slightly yellowish in tone but it does not look bad in a cream room. Would not look good with pure white decor though. The wood on the top is lovely and genuine wood. The height is perfect for eating and doing projects. It makes a great sewing table for me. Fits into any little nook, but be sure to measure your space.",
