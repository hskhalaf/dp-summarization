There are rumors, but I can't confirm there is a service department. I was on hold one day long enough to drain 40% of my phone charge. I heard a few different recordings saying how much they valued my call, but they never valued it enough to answer it. I own four pair of Smith Optics sunglasses, and I doubt I would buy another. There are other companies with the same technologies used by Smith. I paid too much for the sunglasses I have to get that poor quality of service.",

Don't be afraid to go with the Parallel Max D if you want full coverage. I originally bought the Parallel and found they left a HUGE gap at the bottom for light and glare. The Parallel Max close most of that gap, but they still leave some room at the bottom of the lens. I'm 6'0 and 200 lbs, if I ever get another pair, I'll be going with the Parallel Max D for full coverage.",

On very bright days, the Parallel Max could use a bit more coverage. However, the Parallel Max lens size probably fits a wider range of light conditions better than the D Max.",
