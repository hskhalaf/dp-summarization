They roll great and my kids were able to handle their own luggage. As you can tell from pictures, the smaller bag fits on top of the bigger bag perfectly.",

The only real issue I had is that when it is full to capacity, the zippers on the outer pockets tend to separate when zipped. It wasn't a huge issue and I was able to get things re-zipped, but the zippers may not be super high quality.",

It works with small, spring loaded metal pins that actuate with a button on the top of the handle. The metal pins stick in place either preventing the handle from extending or preventing it from collapsing. The fix: open the bag, run your hand down the metal down tubes, find the stuck pin, and manually depress it. I returned this bag and bought another brand w/a more robust handle. It's inexpensive because the handle is cheaply made. Would NOT buy this bag or brand again.",

No issues with zippers, wheels, or handles. Easy for even my youngest (< 48\") to pull. I can fit about 4 days' worth of adult clothes plus shoes and a full week's worth of kids clothes, shoes, and more in them. Colors are true to advertised pictures for green and orange suitcases.",

The first thing I checked when I pulled the bag out of the box was telescoping handle and when I pulled it up it was not attached on the left side to the bag. It also appeared that the box had been resealed and the bag was scuffed so it appeared to me to have already been sent back to the manufacturer, re-taped and sent back out. I guess with this company it just luck of the draw as to whether you get a new and functioning bag or not.",

I like to put everything in a carry-on to avoid the carrousel of checked bags after the flight, and this is the perfect size to pack everything for a trip if you're the type who packs light. But some airlines won't let economy class bring a carry-on, and will only allow a personal item/shoulder bag/under-seat luggage. What do you do then? The smaller bag is the perfect size to fit under the seat! Check your individual airline's dimensions, but it should be the right size. Such a great price, you're basically getting the under-seat bag for free!",

That's about what I'd expect at this price point, and I'm happy with what I got out of it. I feel like some redesign could be used for the wheels. I'm not sure why, but this bobbles about on its wheels sometimes which other luggage has never done for me. This is by no means a deal-breaker though.",
