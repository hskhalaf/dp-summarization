I tried to use this with a riser for my 85 yr old mother in law and the mount failed before I got it tightened. I had to duct tape the riser and seat to the toilet until I get a new one.

These also don't have a gap between the fasteners when the seat is up so it prevents stuff from falling into that little hard to clean area between the fasteners which is my LEAST favorite part to clean. I would highly recommend these seats.",

It was $14 so I guess you get what you pay for. But I'd rather pay twice that amount and just get a decent toilet seat that cleans well and doesn't feel like a flimsy piece of plastic.

However the 4 star rating is because it is attached to the bolts with special adapters so you can easily remove the seat for cleaning. Cool idea but I am worried that over time this could wear and perhaps cause the seat to slip off when someone is using it. Time will tell I guess.",
