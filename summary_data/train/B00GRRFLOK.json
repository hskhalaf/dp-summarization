Once bolted to the wooden floor, they would not bulged at all. When the front wheels are inside, they feel securely lock to not roll back and forth. But it feels like the motorcycle could easily fell of on one side or the other. With tie downs and canyon dancer, this won't happen during transport. But I would not recommend this product to anyone who just want to roll their bike in their garage. Good product if you want to transport your motorcycle with tie-downs.",

Only big problem is getting my Harley Road king out of it. I had to pull so hard and yank so many times I pulled a muscle in my neck. I am 5' 8\" and 165. Maybe a bigger guy could, but I left the choke off and used as a stopper in my trailer for when I strap it in.",

      "text": "Good motorcycle stand but same one as harbor freight\u2019s. $10 more than harbor freight but with prime i didnt have to leave the house. Good product, a little upset packaging was broke and the top support got scuffed and mared. Between its lack of padding in package and Amazons delivery team of hulks the box tore and scratched it. Otherwise seems like a good product.",

I transported it in the bed of my pick-up, so It gave me the added security and stablity I was looking for. Also, made the tie down process easier for one person. Main reason I didn't give a 5 star review is because the instructions were purposely left vauge due to the companies perceived liability and I had to figure out myself the correct way to assemble it for my bike.",

    "description": "Style:StandardThe Extreme Max Motorcycle Wheel Chock is sleek, stable, and solid. Drive your bike onto the chock and the rear wheel cradle locks the front wheel securely in place. One person can safely and easily secure the motorcycle without tipping. Made of durable steel and finished with a textured matte black powder coat, this wheel chock will look great in shop or trailer. The chock is designed to take up minimal room on the mounting surface while providing maximum stability for your bike. By combining a solid front cross bar with a solid boot, this chock uses floor space more efficiently than any other design. This space-saving design is great for storing or hauling multiple bikes or for mounting on a lift. Multiple rear wheel cradle adjustments allow you to fit wheels perfectly for stability during storage, transport, or maintenance. Fits 17 inch - 21 inch wheels between 3-5/32 inch - 7-3/32 inch wide. Note: Motorcycles with front wheel fender skirts and/or front wheel fender extensions should not use the wheel chock with the pivoting cradle set in the fourth hole (longest position). Use caution during the initial setup to ensure proper clearance on all bodywork.",
