      "text": "Do not buy! Just like some of the other reviews the booster packs were all tampered with. My son opened them and they were all junk cards and pulled no gx cards or any other quality cards. Instead there were repeats of junk cards. Lots of duplicates of cards which seems odd consider the packs included were different series. Very suspicious, avoid buying from Amazon and get this from Target or Walmart. We back similar booster packs there and they were better quality and less duplicates.",
