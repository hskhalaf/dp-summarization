Seemed like a well made grate and expected a long useful life, but within a week of having a fire, a noticeable sag occurred. Maybe this larger size grate requires some middle support. \"The four strong legs help to prevent sagging due to heat and the weight of the firewood.\" is their claim but evidently this isn't enough. Pretty disappointing to have a product fail this quickly.",

The only problem I had was that the front legs were a little too wide. The description showed it to be 21 inches, which would be fine, but the one I received was about 22 1/2 inches. I have torch so I was able to adjust it to fit. I would recommend this.",

I would prefer to have the 3/4 vertically. Very little welding material was used to build this, the welds are literally just dabs. I've only been using it for 8 weeks now so it's to early to evaluate if the welding is sufficient. On the plus side, the price is fair for what it is, even if not perfectly described.",
