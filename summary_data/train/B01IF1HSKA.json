I have typically used mesquite, apple wood, etc, but these pecan chips add a sweetness and a deep smoky flavor to meats and seafood that is hard to beat. If you let the meat smoke long enough, you'll get a really nice, pink smoke line, deep into the flesh. I've used it on shrimp, scallops, beef burgers, rib-eyes, chicken, and brisket. Try it if you haven't before. People will be asking you what your secret is. Don't tell 'em, though; make them wonder.",
