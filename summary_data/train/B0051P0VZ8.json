I left them in until they were all cool to the touch, and they still did not curl my hair. I have a lot of layers and my hair is not heavy, so this should have worked. Still, my hair was barely wavy.

      "text": "One thing I have to say is that I have EXTREMELY straight hair and live in an EXTREMELY high humid part of the country. These curlers heat up wonderfully and are designed with a felt that won't cause much heat injury to the hair. My hair turns out beautifully but the style does not last at all. I am still keeping the curlers because at least they do give my hair some body. Otherwise, my hair would just hang there flat, frizzy, and straight without any fullness and I would look like a witch or a scarecrow.",

      "text": "This is great for travel and fits snug in my suitcase. This doesn't heat up to scorching hot but a more then warm. If I need a tighter curl, I use Kendra Thermal Styling Spray. If I want more body, then I just use a root lifter ( right now I'm trying out Pureology ) and Kendi Oil from the Bamboo line on the ends. I have long straight hair and use the regular hot rollers to hold all my hair but needed something for travel and as we all know, a full set of hot rollers is way too bulky and take up too much room in a suitcase. This is perfect.",
