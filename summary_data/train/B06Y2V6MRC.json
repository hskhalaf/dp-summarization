I\u2019ve used mine on my IFish Pro with an Okuma ABF20 baitfeeder reel as well as a dead stick rod and jigging Rippin Raps, Jigs, various spoons etc. 4 stars only because it\u2019s not a high end graphite rod with that kind of sensitivity. I own some higher end TUCRs but I don\u2019t believe you need that to fill every role. That\u2019s were this 36\u201d Elite Tech comes in.",
