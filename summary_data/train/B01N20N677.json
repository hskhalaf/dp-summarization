Nothing was helping. I received this face wash this past Wednesday and 6 days later, my face is FINALLY going back to normal. I\u2019m shocked. Picture is not of my original break out, but just the condition my skin was in on Wednesday when I received the product in the mail, and then this morning, 6 days later.",
