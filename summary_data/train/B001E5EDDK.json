Even after my last desperate try when I left it in for 45 minutes. So if you want something that doesn't sting or burn, but doesn't color your hair, this is what you're looking for. But if you want something that actually colors your hair, you're going to have to use Just for Men and put up with a little temporary discomfort.",

BTW...For best results, don't start at your Sideburns where the gray is strongest or, leave it on for the whole 10: minutes as instructed. Instead, start at the height of about the top of your ears and work up and back from there. And, them do below that worst part last. Start your clock when you first start putting it on and rinse it off in 6-7: minutes. Yes, you will still have a little grey left but, at your age you should have at least some :} I promise it will look much more natural than the \"Helmet\" look of Dyed Hair.",
