The TP Link falsely advertises speeds of up to 50 MBPS but it's a total lie. The TP Link only access the 2.4 band so it's no different to the wifi capability of the HP laptop. It's a cheap piece and my time is worth much more than the time it would take to ship this POS back. False Advertising. Don't buy it!",

While the description currently says that it supports \"Linux Kernal 2.6.18~4.4.3\", the box that the adapter comes in says it only supports up to Linux 3.19.3. After some research I discovered this is because the drivers for the higher kernals are still in beta, meaning all the bugs aren't worked out yet. I downloaded the official tp-link drivers off the web and followed the instructions, they failed at the \"make\" step. The instructions that worked from me on 4.18.0 kernal were: sudo apt install rtl8812au-dkms sudo modprobe rtl8812au Hope that helps!",

Cons: short sange and a bit slow connectivity Perfect for those on a budget",
