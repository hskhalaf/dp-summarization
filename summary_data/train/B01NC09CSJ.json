The slide tracks dictate that your wall on either side should be clear and free from things mounted to the wall, giving the mirror the area to open and close. the led lighting is bright, vivid, and a wonderful color. It lights the room nicely and makes me feel like I'm in a hotel bathroom every morning. This is a very nice product and my wife and I have been enjoying it. Keep up the good work HomCom.",

      "text": "It looks nice, but the mirror is rather deep. It won't work to inset it either because of the switches, wires, and sliding tracks. It slides only partially both ways so it would not do well to have it next to a wall. It has an exterior plug, black, that you need to run to an outlet. Not the prettiest looking set up. I'll live with it for awhile and see it I can learn to like it better.",

Glass and electronic components shipping such a distance can be tricky. These guys nailed i! The item was a bit bigger than I expected. Let's face it, a bathroom vanity can NEVER be too big. It's a great size with tons of internal storage. The glass & sliding mechanism are very high quality and the light it puts off has a nice cool hue. I would definitely shop with these guys again.",
