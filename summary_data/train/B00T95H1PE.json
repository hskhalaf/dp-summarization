We use it on a cast iron grill also and never seen anything work as well as this!!!",

This is a recommended purchase. Grab one and get grilling.",

One big difference in the way that I used this brush and others is the recommendation to dip the brush in water as you're cleaning the grill. I don't know what I never tried that before, but it's a serious game changer. That said, this brush is great for the price. It features a nice long handle so you can stay (mostly) away from the heat. The brush head is wide and lets you easily get in between the grates. Overall - I would definitely buy this again.",

When I bought my original product about two years ago I thought I had purchased the ultimate brush for cleaning my Weber gas grill cast-iron grates. But I was wrong! This new \"Triple\" grill brush is superior. Not only is the construction on par with my previous purchase, but the design of this new and improved grill brush is beyond outstanding! Somebody really thought this through. This clever design really is a quantum leap in grill cleaning. The emphasis is on cleaning not only the surface but deep down the sides of each grate. This makes the yearly maintenance and cleaning of your grill so much easier. Well done alpha!",

I'd definitely recommend it to a friend!",

It would be nice if it came with a scraper attachment for things like stuck on cheese (still got it off just needed some extra elbow grease) will definitely be recommending this!",
