I am on my 3rd replacement and I still can't get the thing to connect to the internet. Support doesn't even answer my emails anymore, I just apply for an RMA and send it back. The trouble is I am paying for shipments and could have bought something else by now. I have also helped a friend setup and configure a WRT54G with no problem! Linksys is trying my loyalty. As other reviews have said: great product on paper, terrible implementation.",

There are also 3rd party versions of code out there which add on a ton of functionality, but you'll lose your support from Linksys. Selected this unit because it can be used as an end-node vpn (vpn from your remote laptop to your home pc, for example). Only dig against it is that it does not have dual antennas to eliminate multipath. Buy it again? Sure.",

Look at the other reviews and think. Why does everybody say stay away? There must be something wrong if this many people complain. I live in Japan, and the Japanese retailers have already pulled it from the shelves due to the number of complaints. This is the SECOND time mine has locked up today. It WILL be replaced.",

Pros: Can't really think of any. I'm going to return it anyway, and hoping to get the refund asap :) Cons: 1) This router needs constant human supervision to power restart every now and then. Did Cisco/Linksys even bother to do an internal QA on this product? 2) Routing functionality doesn't seem to be good either. Just average. To top it all, they advertise on the cover to run your own wifi-spot with this junk ;) Yea right!",

But there are a few downsides as well, namely: - the VPN endpoint does not like remote endpoints with variable IP-addresses. You can use FQDNs, but he built-in DNS-Client does not really recognize a change of the remote IP-address, even if you choose \"any\" for the remote endpoint the problem persists. - the included DynDNS-Client does not work - Wireless performance is extremely poor in a mixed environment (11/54Mbps) Besides these flaws a really great product.",

Because if you are going from one wireless network to another, who wants to force G on their laptop to work at home, and then constantly reconfigure the wirelses card in your laptop to hand the B bands at the airport every single time you leave your home!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

IPSec tunnel just allow the connection between specific local subnet and specific remote subnet and remote IP addr. ANY to ANY IPSec Tunnel would be available after 2.2X d.
