The seats in our car do not have a gap and we did have to adjust the straps a bit to make it secure. However, it's worth the effort. The size and clarity of the mirror are great and unlike the ones we tried before, we don't have any issue with the mirror falling because the ball joint is flimsy.",

The frame is made of plastic and the mirror is not a real glass piece. It's a reflective mirror that's clear enough for you to see your babies when you need a quick check. A downside to the mirror is the strap. There are two straps that buckle in on the head rest. They move around easily at the slightest touch and would eventually slide down. We had to adjust it constantly. This item could easily be a 5 star if they made slide proof straps.",

The company responded very promptly and issued a full refund. I was very happy that it wasn't an issue. I won't buy the mirror again, but I would buy other products.",

For the self-aware helicopter parents such as myself, you can see not only your wonderful offspring's face but also their entire body, the car seat, some of the door and parts of the back seat. Quite an impressive span! I would highly reccomend!",

I only moved the mirror to another car once! Considering an infant will probably be rear facing until about 1.5 - 2 years old, lasting 8 months doesn't cut it. I would need 3 of these per child! This company's warranty is only 30 days, probably because they know their cheap materials will be able to just last that long! Do yourself a favor and buy a different product.",
