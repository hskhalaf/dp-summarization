      "text": "LOVE this tablet! Though I've never had T-Mobile in my life (I'm a long-time Verizon girl) I chose this item for all the great features and the low price, and since I'm using my own WiFi to connect to the internet the carrier doesn't matter. This tablet has a clear, vibrant display, expandable storage, great sound from the speaker, and it's so slim it barely weighs anything ...even with a case around it! I've had several LG products and they've never disappointed me - this one is no exception. I'm very happy with this purchase and I would recommend it to anyone.",

You can find apps in Amazon or Google Play by searching app 2 sd. After the update its a much more pleasant experience using this device.",

The SD card can store photos, but not apps. It gets slower with time. But for $240, it was worth the money.",
