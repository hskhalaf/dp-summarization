When I first received the box in the mail and I opened it up, there were 2 boxes inside. I first thought to myself I hope I did not just order pillow cases. Thankfully I did not since Ive5done it before because I did not read the description. When I opened the boxes they pillows were vacuum sealed. Every easy to open in out into cases. Other then the the pillows being very thin these are a great buy . I just order some thicker pillows off of Amazon for $7.99 to replace the ones that it came with.",

Inside, is the cover w/zipper and the pillow part is in a non-reusable space bag and shrunk to fit the box. The pillow is form is cheaply made but fluffs up to a nice size. These would not be sturdy enough for a sofa or place that would get everyday use, but since I'm using them in my guestroom as decorative throw pillows on the bed, they are perfect for my needs. Price was right, and I can't make them for this. Again - these are just decorative.",

They do come double vacuum packed and I only opened them tonight. It's possible that they will fluff up in time. Finally, they seem smaller than 18 inches. I ordered 4 pillows to cover a 72 inch bench and I'm about half a pillow short. They were really inexpensive so I'm sure I'll find something to do with them.",
