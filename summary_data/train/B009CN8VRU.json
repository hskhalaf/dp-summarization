I have four of these cameras (and yes I own GoPros also) and love the Contour. Biggest advantage is the shape and size and mounts (and VERY clear video image). I bought this one as a gift and they love it. I use the model with GPS in my car as a dashcam. They are getting harder to find since the company went out of business, but I think you will like these little cameras (they use mico SD cards).",

I've found that the Mic on the camera can become distorted very easily if it has been submerged in water or been dropped in sand or mud. Other than that it's really awesome that it can go under water, even if only a few feet, so you don't have to put a bulky case on it. You can purchase a case if you want to go deeper than about 3 feet though. The reason I bought this was to record Airsoft and Dirt Bike videos and it serves it's job decently.",

    "description": "The ContourROAM2 brings brilliant updates to our most loved camera, while retaining the features that made it a best seller.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\n\nLive life in color. The ContourROAM2 brings brilliant updates to our most loved camera, while retaining the features that made it a best seller. Still the simplest camera to use on the market, the locking Instant On-Record switch makes it easy to get the perfect shot. While black is always in style, we've spiced it up by offering the ContourROAM2 in two additional colors: red and blue. We've also upped the frame rate to 60fps at 720p, and fine-tuned the picture giving the video quality incredible clarity.\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTOURROAM2 PRODUCT FEATURES:\n\nLOCKING INSTANT-ON RECORD SWITCH\nNo power button, no problem. Simply slide the Instant On-Record switch into its locking position to ensure you shoot exactly when you're ready.\n\n\n\n\nVIBRANT COLOR OPTIONS\nWe understand that style matters and color can make or break a look. Match your kit, or bring in a little contrast by adding a ContourROAM2 in one of three colors: red, blue or traditional black.\n\n\n\n\n60 FRAMES PER SECOND\nAs requested by our customers, we've bumped up the frames per second to 60 when shooting at 720p, meaning you can now get that smooth video quality you've come to expect from Contour cameras.\n\n\n\n\nWATERPROOF WITHOUT A CASE\nGood things come in small packages. The ContourROAM2 sheds bulk by working underwater without an extra case. Minimalism is a good thing.\n\n\n\n\nLOW PROFILE DESIGN\nContour cameras have won numerous awards for their stylish, yet functional, low-profile design. The ContourROAM2 is exceptionally designed and lightweight. With the ContourROAM2, less really is more.\n\n\n\n\nVERSATILITY\nWhether snorkeling, snowboarding, or tearing up single track, the ContourROAM2 is ready for any adventure. It's compatible with every Contour mount giving you unlimited angles. The 270\u00b0 rotating lens means no matter where the camera is mounted, you'll always get the perfect, level shot.\n\n\n\n\nLASER ALIGNMENT\nGet the correct angle any time with the built-in laser level.\n\n\n\n\nLONG BATTERY LIFE\nShoot up to 3.5 hours of footage. The Instant On-Record switch means there is no standby mode. The battery is only in use when shooting, giving you more bang per charge.\n\n\n\n\nMICRO SD CARD INCLUDED\nWe've added a 4GB MicroSD card so your camera is ready to use right out of the box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIDEO FORMATS\nVideo Format Resolution Frame Rate Full HD 1080p 1920 x 1080 30 fps Tall HD 960p 1280 x 960 30 fps Action HD 1280 x 720 60 fps, or 30 fps 5MP Still Photo 2592 X 1944 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, of 60 sec \n\n\n\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX?\n \n\nContourRoam2 Camera\nMicro SD Card (4GB) Profile Mount\nRotating Flat Surface Mount\nQuickstart Guide USB 2.0 Cable \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMPARE CONTOUR CAMERA MODELS\nCONTOURROAM2 Dead Simple Action Video CONTOUR+2 The Next Evolution Instant On Record Switch Record Lock Switch Waterproof to one meter Built-in Tripod (1/4\" - 20) Mount Flush Front Lens Still Photo Mode Laser Alignment Removable Lithium-ion Battery GPS Bluetooth HDMI USB Connection Internal Mic External Mic Jack microSD Memory Card Included 4GB 4GB Wide Angle Lens 170\u00b0 170\u00b0 Lens Rotation 270\u00b0 270\u00b0 Weight 5.1oz 5.5oz Dimensions (mm) 100 x 55 x 34 98 x 60 x 34 Included Mounts Profile Mount, Rotating Surface Mount Profile Mount, Rotating Surface Mount (2) Included Cables USB USB, Mini HDMI, Mic Cable Included Case Waterproof Case \n\n\n\nCONTOUR RECOMMENDED ACCESSORIES\nCONTOUR VENTED HELMET MOUNT \n\nCONTOUR PROFILE MOUNT \n\nCONTOUR FLEX STRAP MOUNT \n\nCONTOUR WINDSHIELD MOUNT \n\n\n\n\n\n\n ACCESSORIES FOR EVERY SEASON \n Shop Contour Recommended Accessories by sport: \n\n WINTER SPORTS \n AUTOSPORTS/MOTORCROSS \n MOUNTAIN BIKING \n HUNTING/FISHING \n SURF \n UNDER WATER \n PAINTBALL/TACTICAL",
