I was in a motorcycle accident recently. ended up flying through the air 60 feet away from point of impact. busted my knee. but the top half of my body went under touched. no broken bones, no road rash, no anything. 60 feet and not a scratch. this jacket worked a lot of magic that day. I am so very glad I bought this jacket and was wearing it. best investment of my life. will buy again in a heart beat, they did end up cutting it off after all. thank you for ever sold this to me.",

With 12 front, 10 back, 2 shoulder, 4 side and 6 arm pads, you'll feel pretty safe, secure, and warm as toast in a cold wind. I can't wait to take it on a ride with Sporty.",

The leather itself had the additional protection of being raised to provide cushion. It has reflectors on the pocket seams. Size is true to fit your regular measurements but will feel really fitted. Cons, it was very stiff and will need some conditioning and a break-in period. I returned mine for three main reasons: Right lower sleeve was already scratched up, the back looked melted/sticky, and the reflector on the right chest was already wearing away because of the zipper.",
