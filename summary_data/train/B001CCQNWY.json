Minor detail, but there has to be a way to deal with this.",

I had an older DSC which took better photos on moving subjects, (I NEVER got blurry photos for real) that's why I thought it would be the same. All the other features are great like the in-camera retouch, and the huge touch screen. The looks won't disappoint you. I'm just not sure if all these technology and looks could compensate for some blurry photos.",

    "title": "Sony Cybershot DSC-T700 10.1MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom with Super Steady Shot Image Stabilization (Red)",
    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-T700 is an ultra-slim digital camera that combines Optical SteadyShot image stabilization and Smile Shutter technology with the convenience of a portable photo album. Take your entire photo library with you and share your pictures on the dazzling, ultra bright 3.5-inch high resolution touch-screen LCD display. \n\nCyber-shot DSC-T700 Highlights \n\n10.1-megapixel Super HAD CCD image sensor\nA powerful 10.1-megapixel, 1/2.3-inch Super HAD CCD image sensor helps you capture gorgeous images with superb contrast and clarity down to the finest detail. With 10.1 megapixels, you can create stunning, photo-quality prints up to A3 size, or crop your images and still come away with high-resolution shots. \n\n3.5-inch Xtra Fine LCD touch-screen display\nCompose images on a dazzling 3.5-inch LCD display and use the touch screen to navigate menus, specify focus points, and more. When you've finished shooting, show off your images with spectacular clarity. Featuring 921K pixels, the ultra-bright, high-contrast LCD screen with a wide viewing angle is among the highest resolution screens available on a compact digital camera, and displays your images with astonishing visual clarity. \n\nCarl Zeiss Vario-Tessar 4x optical zoom lens\nThe newly-developed Carl Zeiss Vario- Tessar lens enables close-up shooting up to just under 1/2-inch (1cm) from the subject (in Magnifying Glass Mode), while the optical 4x telescopic zoom offers superior visual acuity for a compact digital camera. \n\nBIONZ imaging processor\nThe BIONZ Imaging Processor delivers the high resolution and fast performance you expect from a Sony digital camera. \n\nUltra-slim design\nThe DSC-T700 packs a lot of performance into an ultra-slim design. Measuring just over 5/8-inch (16.4mm), the DSC-T700 is slim enough to slip into a pocket, so you can take it with you wherever you go. \n\nFace Detection technology\nFace Detection technology detects up to eight individual faces and controls flash, focus, exposure, and white balance to deliver accurate, natural skin tones with reduced red-eye for beautiful images of family and friends. Face Detection can even distinguish between children and adults, so you can prioritize the camera\u2019s focus on children in the scene for clear images of their memorable moments. \n\nSmile Shutter technology\nThe popular Smile Shutter technology automatically detects and captures smiling faces. Simply choose the Smiley Face feature and the camera will capture a smile the moment it happens. You can also select subject priority (Adult or Child Priority or touch subject on screen) and indicate the degree of Smile Detection Sensitivity to high (small smile), medium (laugh) or low (grin). \n\nDouble Anti-blur Solution\nThe combination of Optical SteadyShot image stabilization and High ISO sensitivity helps compensate for shaky hands, minimizes blur and allows flash-free shooting to preserve the mood. \n\nOptical SteadyShot image stabilization\nOptical SteadyShot image stabilization uses a built-in gyro sensor to detect camera shake and automatically shifts the lens to help prevent blur without sacrificing image quality. \n\nHigh Sensitivity ISO 3200\nHigh ISO allows for faster shutter speed, so you can take pictures indoors or in low light without the need for a flash. In addition to High Sensitivity Mode (ISO), you can select up to eight ISO settings (Auto, 80, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200) when shooting in Program Auto Mode to adjust sensitivity to your shooting conditions. \n\nIntelligent Scene Recognition\nIntelligent Scene Recognition (iSCN) Mode automatically detects eight different types of scenes and selects the appropriate camera settings: Backlight, Backlight Portrait, Twilight, Twilight Portrait, Twilight using a Tripod, Portrait, Landscape and Macro. iSCN has 2 modes: Advanced and Auto. In Auto Mode, the camera takes a single shot using the optimal settings. In Advance Mode, the camera takes a picture with the current settings and only if necessary takes a second picture with optimized setting. \n\nDynamic Range Optimizer Standard and Plus\nDynamic Range Optimizer (DRO) Standard and Plus uses a sophisticated algorithm to determine the best exposure and contrast settings for almost any shooting environment. The result is more natural images with clearer details that more closely match what your naked eye sees. DRO is particularly effective when shooting backlit portraits or any scene with a dramatic contrast between background and foreground lighting. DRO Plus allows for even greater optimization by analyzing each region of an image and performing additional image processing. \n\nAdditional Features \n\n * Anti-blink Function \n * Red-eye Correction \n * Convenient photo modes \n * MPEG Movie VX Fine Mode \n * Semi-manual focus \n * 9-Point Auto Focus \n * Burst Mode \n * Function Guide \n * Easy Shooting Mode \n * 16:9 High Resolution Mode",
