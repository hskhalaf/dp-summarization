Having earbuds that provide a fuller range are a necessity. The wired ones fit the bill there - so how well do the wireless ones hold up? Excellently. I've not really heard any degradation of audio going to the Airpods. Haven't really challenged the battery life yet as I have chargers at home, work, and in the car.

I found myself having to stop listening to music for a few minutes or switch to another set of headphones while they recharged. That has not been an issue with these! The battery life is much improved. Also, the Bluetooth connectivity has been improved so that switching between devices is much faster.

Big plus is the great compatibility with my I-phone. Got lots of ear buds; these are the best. Wish the life of the pods out of the case was a bit better, as I wear one most of the day for occasional listening to book and answering and making calls. I get about 5 hours before they need to go back into the case.",

Tried contacting Apple support but have been waiting more than a day for a response. There goes my money down the drain (again). Thanks for nothing Apple!",

It's been about 60 days since my son received the AirPods. While he was excited when he first got them, he's no longer excited. He's not pleased anymore. Within the past month, the left ear dies much faster than the right. Also, he's not able to hear in them as clearly as he did when he first received them. Unfortunately, we've missed the window to return them. Now, I'm forced to use the warranty. No telling what's next....",
