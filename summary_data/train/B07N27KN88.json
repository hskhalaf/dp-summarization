However, not even a month after usual wear, the fabric on this shoe has started tearing on the sides. First it was only on the left shoe, and then the right side one also ripped open. If I had damaged the shoe some way it would be one thing, but I noticed it just after walking around town. I cannot recommend this shoe for its poor materials in use. They are not durable.",
