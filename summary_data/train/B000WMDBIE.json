      "text": "Needed to replace a 30 year old saw. Wanted left sided cut. This saw is a great value at $100. I have a Bosch jig saw, very happy with that as well. This circular saw is well made. The blade wrench is included and mounted in a bracket on the saw, which is very handy. The power switch is an \"over center design\", so you have to initially press a bit harder, then it turns on saw, and holding pressure is light. Much better than having to press a separate safety button. More powerful than the saw I replaced. I would buy this saw again.",

My first impressions when opening the box was that there were some small chips out of the plate and some scuffs on the housing. I was not thrilled but this does not affect the performance of the saw, which is quit well. I just ripped some mdf to try it out and it was great. I have a big deck job coming up and will put the saw though it paces. Overall a pretty good saw for the money and if you want a left hand framer without buying a worm drive saw.",

It was repaired -- under warranty -- at the Bosch service facility in Anaheim, California. After another two months of normal / typical use, the carbon brushes and armature need to be replaced again. WTF? Is there an issue with the quality of the components Bosch uses for this particular saw? For five months of ownership and use, I expected something a bit more reliable. Not many choices for blade-left circular saws that are affordable, so I'll get this CS5 fixed again while it's under warranty.",

One other thing, I was a little more aggressive than I would've normally been when putting it on the ground (full hands) one time, and it actually bent the plate that slides along the wood. That was extremely disappointing because it's a tool, these kinds of things happen but for it to bend so easily.",
