Only thing I didn't notice until I needed it was there are no philips head screw driver bits! There are regular, start tips, and allen tipped bits, but there is also and allen wrench set that comes with it, so I think the allen screwdriver heads is a little redundant, especially at the cost of phillips head bits. other than that its been handy.",

The mini screwdrivers feel a little flimsy but they've been okay. The case is handy for storage, although I was tired of trying to manipulate all the tools back into their proper places so I ended up putting the tools in a tool bag. Regardless, though, if you need some decent, yet inexpensive tools, this set fits the bill.",

The screws are already warping after I built my TV stand. The box cutter is a bit unstable and you can cut yourself if you're not careful. I guess I can't complain about the hammer or the measuring tape?",
