Let me be clear, the unit is precisely the same with a higher BTU rating. Besides the fact I feel slighted it is a good AC. The manual is very poorly written but the build quality is high. The lights flicker in my room every hour due to this running so I'm not sure how I feel about energy efficiency. The window kit is painstakingly bad. Poorly written is really an understatement as I had to improvise with the parts included.",
