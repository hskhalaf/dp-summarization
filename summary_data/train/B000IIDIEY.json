I've downloaded and tried the drivers from Trendnet and Ralink, but received errors with both. I'm going to continue to try to make it work with RedHat 5.5 on an Pent4 machine and hopefully it works soon, or i guess I'm going to have to return it. I don't use MS Windows at home. Right now the error is dpm.o is not formatted correctly.",

However, in comparing this card with a Cisco Aeronet wireless g it is not faster in the N-mode than Cisco in the G-mode. I am using a Belkin Wireless router to a cable net. Perhaps the drivers are not up to date. The transmission speed says 170-230mbs vs cisco 54mbs but...the upload and download speeds measured from Time Warner Cable are less for the N-mode than the G-mode. I don't get it. Maybe noise impairs these speeds, but the bottom line is that is not faster.",
