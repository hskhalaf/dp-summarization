I do not know the reason for this increase but I am assuming it's due to Covid-19 and they are price gouging!! What a shame. At this time when people aren't working and do not have money coming in, they should be, at a minimum, keeping prices as is to help people get through this difficult time. The Perrigo Company should be ashamed of themselves.",
