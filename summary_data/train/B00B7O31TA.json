It can be very sharp f8+ 18mm on a full frame is plenty wide enough for most situations and everybody loves 35mm It\u2019s very light weight and does feel a bit cheap but I\u2019ve had it 4years with no issues. No vr but tbh it\u2019s either going to have a high shutter speed or be sat on a tripod. I\u2019ve made my money back on this lens but there\u2019s no much resale value on these so consider a used one before going full price.",

Do your self a favour and forget about the 16-35 VR and the 14-24 as this lens is perfect for an amateur like me, see examples of this lens on my D750",

After owning both, I would suggest still going for the 20mm 1.8G, a because its a 1.8 aperture and its a sharper lens and second it does amazing close shots. Now, the two don't really compare because one is a prime, other is a zoom but they are constantly put in competitions but for me the 20mm wins in sharpness and its a 1.8! Its a great lens for those who need a little stretch and won't go for a prime.",

I can't understand why some reviews I have read complain about the weight of this lens where 'lightness' is perceived as being less robust or more suited to amateur use. That's nonsense, think about a light or heavy object hitting something hard. Which might come off worse? Don't hesitate purchasing this lens, you will not be disappointed!",

    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\n A versatile, affordable wide-angle to standard view FX-format zoom lens.\nNow you can cover the highly useful zoom range of 18mm to 35mm (27\u201352.5mm on DX-format cameras) with a great performing full-frame NIKKOR lens that doesn't carry a professional's price tag. Shoot beautiful wide-angle architectural shots, landscapes, group portraits and more; then zoom in for a natural field of view that is slightly wider than what we see with our eyes. You can even get as close as 0.92-feet from your subject! And since the AF-S NIKKOR 18-35mm f/3.5-4.5G ED is powered by Nikon's Silent Wave Motor (SWM) for ultra-fast, ultra-quiet autofocusing, it's an ideal choice for video applications. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUSE IT EVERYWHERE\nWIDE-ANGLE TO STANDARD ZOOM VERSATILITY\nThe AF-S NIKKOR 18-35mm f/3.5-4.5G ED is an excellent travel and all-purpose lens. Its 18mm wide-angle perspective brings more of what you see into the frame, ideal for shooting indoors or in close quarters, capturing architecture and landscapes as well as group portraits. But zoom all the way in, and you get a natural 35mm perspective that mimics the field of view of our eyes, ideal for just about any photo or video application.\n\nEXCELLENT FOR VIDEO\nULTRA-FAST, ULTRA-QUIET AUTOFOCUSING\nThe AF-S NIKKOR 18-35mm f/3.5-4.5G ED is powered by Nikon's innovative Silent Wave Motor (SWM). This extraordinary focusing motor uses ultrasonic vibrations\u2014rather than a gear system\u2014to spin the lens barrel, resulting in nearly silent and ultra-fast autofocusing. If you want to override the AF system, simply take control of the focusing ring\u2014M/A mode enables a seamless transition between auto and manual focusing.\n\nA LIFETIME OF GREAT PERFORMANCE\nNIKON LENS TECHNOLOGIES FOR CONSISTENTLY STUNNING IMAGES\nNikon's innovations in optical design and lens technology have paved the way for more affordable high-performance lenses like the AF-S NIKKOR 18-35mm f/3.5-4.5G ED. Two Extra-low Dispersion (ED) elements produce superior sharpness and color correction, and three Aspherical Lens (AS) elements virtually eliminate certain types of aberration. A rounded 7-blade diaphragm produces softer, more natural backgrounds, and Internal Focusing (IF) keeps the lens compact and lightweight.",
