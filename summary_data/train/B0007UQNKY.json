But I did follow advise in this thread and, after removing the correcting lense and by virtue of a laser collimator, get it done. I first collimated the collimator (?).

Since we don't have a place (like a second floor or higher balcony, where it can be set up and left (hint, it's not weatherproof anyway), it's just taking up space in our living room until we can sell it.

The tripod is not the sturdiest, either, and it wiggles quite a bit when you move it.

The equitorial mount requires some getting used to, and the mirrors had to be aligned (which I was prepared for since it came UPS). Both have plenty of online resources and how-tos (Youtube, forums, etc..) Its been cloudy lately, so I don't have any decent photos of any planets, but the moon is gorgeous. Great product :)",

Jupiter is ok and can see the dots of its moons. If you're buying this for a kid or dabbling in backyard astronomy don't buy an EQ mount like this, look for an alt-az mount. EQ mounts are a pain if you're unfamiliar with them. Only complaint specific to this scope other than the mount is the thumb screws are really, really easy to lose when setting it up outside or taking it down and getting replacements from celestron is a nightmare.",

      "text": "Well for starters it was great at viewing the moon, jupiter as a small white dot and it\u2019s moons, mars is a red blob, and Saturn is a small dot and a ring around it but very blurry. I see some of the pictures on here looking very sharp and I can\u2019t get my Celestron 127eq to match it. I live in Colorado Springs so it may just be the area in which I\u2019m viewing. The adjusting pieces rent too good they are hard to turn and shaky. The finderscope is decent once set accordingly. Can somebody help me so that my images could get as sharp as other viewers?",

So I'm working on what I need for magnification, and it will the one I use the most.............and now I have a question. I'm wondering for those using this model. I want to know if anyone has added extra weight to their scopes, and if you have does it help the scope stay where you place it?? I know it all depends on the weight of the eyepiece, but I think there's just not enough weight on lightweight eyepieces. Thanx........Dora",

The other thing is the main eye piece - you have to hold your head steady with your eye perfectly centered or you won't see anything through it. Nice views of the moon, but after about 1 minute it's too tiring to keep looking. Anything smaller than the moon is just going to look like a slightly bigger light in the sky.",

After lining that up I adjusted the sighting scope on the same spot or barely above it. Now we have a very functional telescope that gathers a lot of light and provides good magnification.",
