Was shipped in its original manufacturer's box in a flimsy foam mold that did not seem to protect such a heavy object from careless handling. Installed it anyway because of the hassle involved in a return, and because the major damage was a the rear. The template instructions are ambiguous for a recessed overhead cabinet install. Also, there are 3 screws to hang the microwave but the template shows only the 2 outer ones. The rear wall bracket positioning is easy, however. The machine is quiet and has more features than average for its price.",
