Despite the memory size and processor, it is not particularly fast. The placement of the USB and Audio ports are ridiculous, just poorly thought out. The Wi-Fi reception is worse than my old phone and the speaker quality is atrocious. The screen is bright and crisp and the laptop is relatively sleek and light when closed. If you plan on doing a lot of typing you should invest in an external keypad. The keys on this laptop are clunky and actually start to hurt your fingertips after an hour or so constant speed typing.",
