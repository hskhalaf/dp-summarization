Unlike other products, where a replacement pole can be screwed into the head, this is an all-in-one unit with a highly-specific part on both ends. Everything \"clicks\" together with spring-loaded parts. And, the extending pole does not extend far enough to be anything really special. Finally, one end of the unit is an ice-scraper. So, if you need to hang onto the end, to gain the extra reach, you'll be hanging onto the blade of the plastic scraper. That being said, the unit is an acceptable quality to make it through a winter or two.",

It has to either go in the trunk (inconvenient), or stand vertically in my vehicle. As for the effectiveness as a snow broom, it is very good.

I tried to reinforce ot with my glue gun and tons of strong tape, but it snapped again. It should never have been dedigned with flimsy plastic in a strategic spot that instead needs extra strength and reinforcement. Really disappointed since I was using this for what it is designed for. I need a reliable snow removal device. This is NOT reliable. Now my xterra is covered with snow and a broom doesn't work. Piece of JUNK!",
