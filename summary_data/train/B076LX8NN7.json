Now for what I didn't like. It didn't remember my settings after it was turned off. Under powered. Sounded like it was in a box. Not only very little bass there were very little high Freq as well. The remote was awful and flimsy. You had to get within 5' for it to work. No amount of playing with the setting ever got close to a good sound. However, you could understand mid frequency voices above the music unlike some sound bars.",

Polk told me this was a known problem, but not frequent. And then dealing with POLK CS was pretty awful - long waits and I could never get to a supervisor.

We were SO bummed to possibly have to spend $300-$600 for a new TV. But ALAS! Thank goodness for external audio systems! We didn't need bells and whistles, just something to actually *hear* our TV again....and this little gem absolutely delivers. We're not audiophiles or into surround sound, movie quality TV experiences, etc...so this Polk Solo might not be the \"best\" audio option out there if you're into multiple levels of sound. But for us, it's a definite improvement! And it was waaaaay better than purchasing an entire new TV for one little issue! Thanks Polk!",
