This camera runs on 2 AA batteries which will always be available world wide. Its runs a long time on high capacity rechargabe batteries. Generic AC/DC AA chargers are very inexpensive. A good little camera that also has full manual control if you want more creative control.",

It fits easily in a pocket, but yet it has features that will satisfy a sophisticated photographer. And people love the photos I've taken with this camera. As far as I can tell, Canon has not produced a better camera since this one - I've owned two Canon cameras since, but this one is by far the best. This camera has a viewfinder, which I love. I wonder why so many cameras don't have them any more. You can't see LCD displays in bright sunlight.",

Even with it broken we tried using rubber-bands to hold it closed so we could keep using this camera. It takes great pictures and has great manual controls. After about 3 years of use, it did develop hot spots (pixels that were always white), but I was able to use CHDK (Canon Hacker Development Kit--from online sources) to highlight and remove the bad pixels from the pictures. Need to get another Canon SX150 or 260HS to replace this awesome camera.",

This camera has all the versatility of my Leica m-3 (all manual) but I can use a whole collection of focusing routines as well as exposure tricks. The image processor and image stabilizer are quite good. The color is natural. The technology is fantastic. I just wish the shell was made of metal and more lenses were available. I've got 3 kids in college, so our budget is tight. At this price. the only better deal will be its Cannon successor.",

I did use the Kingston Elite Pro SD card and was not shooting at maximum resolution. The lag obviously isn't related to writing the picture to the card as there is no lag when shooting a picture without the flash. My previous Canon was a four-battery model and didn't have this issue. So I bought a new Canon PowerShot A630 which is a four-battery model and the problem is fixed. I would give that camera five stars!",

With the A75, I was limited to 3x because I could never get a crisp shot with the digital zoom. The A720IS image stabilization allows in-focus, crisp zoom shots (6x optical/up to 24x digital) in addition to all the other good things the PowerShot A-series provides and at a good price.",

It comes with a lot of options, modes and features like Image stabilization and face detection. If you are looking for a point and click camera, this is great and you are looking for a little optimization, its all there too. It is a good mid range camera. The pictures are all very sharp and clear. Would recommend to anyone looking for a decent mid range camera for a cheap price. If you want a really good camera, SLR is the way to go.",

The stabilization took over and I got unblurred picture without flash or tripod.",

    "description": "CL) PS3) Canon A720 IS DISC BY MFG\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nManufacturer Description \n\n The PowerShot A720 IS is the quintessential A Series camera in a popular line that matches high-end image quality with fun, easy-to-use features that deliver excellent cost performance. Top-notch specifications include 8.0-megapixel resolution and a long 6x optical zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer Technology for sharp images throughout the zoom range. Canon's DIGIC III Image Processor offers advanced Face Detection technology and Red-eye Correction for fantastic images. Even expand your creative possibilities with wide-angle and telephoto converter lenses. \n\nPowerShot A720IS Highlights \n\n8.0-megapixel resolution, high-power 6x optical zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer Top-notch core specifications allow the PowerShot A720 IS to produce a level of image quality that\u2019s fully competitive with that of much higher-end cameras. A full 8.0 megapixels of resolution ensure rich depth and detail, and let you enlarge and crop images freely. \n\n\n\n1x zoom/6x zoom The camera is equipped with a genuine Canon 6x optical zoom to get you up close when it counts. Canon\u2019s sophisticated Optical Image Stabilizer Technology keeps your shots blur-free, even in low light and at the long end of the zoom range. Miniature gyroscopic sensors detect motion, then send a corrective signal, effectively reducing camera shake. \n\nDIGIC III Image Processor with Genuine Canon Face Detection Technology With DIGIC III, your images boast superior quality, the camera operates at top efficiency and battery life is enhanced. What\u2019s more, DIGIC III enables Canon\u2019s Face Detection Technology and Red-eye Correction to give you better, more true-to-life people shots. Simply press the Shutter button halfway down, and the camera automatically pinpoints the faces in the scene and chooses the ideal focus point. The camera controls exposure settings and flash to keep every face looking bright and natural. Red eyes can be corrected during playback. \n\nDIGIC III features Face Detection technologies, giving the you best possible results in any shooting situation. Face Detection AF/AE sets the focus point and exposure for the faces of your subjects. Face Detection FE adjusts the flash to correctly illuminate your subject to provide the best balance between your subject and the overall scene, eliminating the common problems of over- and underexposed faces. Face Detection in action \n\nRed-eye correction detects and corrects red-eye during playback. In unusual cases where red-eye is not automatically detected, it can easily be corrected manually during playback mode. \n\niSAPS technology is an entirely original scene-recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos, iSAPS works with the fast DIGIC III Image Processor to improve focus speed and accuracy, as well as exposure and white balance. \n\nEasy-to-use Mode Dial with a wide range of shooting modes With a simple Mode Dial, the PowerShot A720 IS makes it easy to access the features of the camera you\u2019ll use most. Select a scene mode, and the camera automatically sets shooting parameters to get you the best possible shot in that situation. You can also access Stitch Assist, Auto, Movie and Manual modes from the Mode Dial. And the convenience of using AA-size batteries, no special power adapters or chargers are needed wherever you go. \n\nWith 19 Shooting Modes including 7 Special Scene Modes, you\u2019re ready for whatever shot comes your way. \n\nCompatible with a wide range of accessories including wide-angle and telephoto lens converters The PowerShot A720 IS is compatible with many of shooting accessories such as wide and tele converter lenses, High-Power Flash designed for all of the PowerShot models. Also, a waterproof case is available for your underwater shooting. \n\nPrint/Share button for easy direct printing and downloading The PowerShot A720 IS's Print/Share button makes direct printing easier than ever. Simply connect the A720 IS to a Canon CP, Selphy or Pixma Photo Printer or any PictBridge compatible photo printer, press the lighted Print/Share button and print! Also use the Print/Share button to transfer images to a computer (Windows and Macintosh). \n\nPrint your own ID photos in 28 different sizes or use the Movie Print function to output multiple stills from a recorded movie on a single sheet with a Canon Selphy Compact Photo Printer. \n\nDirect photo printers For desktop large-format printing, try one of the direct photo printers that allow you to print without a computer in one of two ways: plug your compatible PowerShot camera into the direct photo printer using the supplied USB interface cable, or simply insert a memory card into the supplied adapter. You can also connect the printer to your computer for more options. Print high-resolution, borderless images as postcards or 8.5 x 11-inch sheets within minutes. \n\nCompact photo printers Compact photo printers let you produce versatile, fun 4 x 6-inch postcards, 4 x 8-inch wide greeting cards or credit card size prints in just two easy steps: connect and press/print. Control the printer right from your camera's LCD screen. You get durable, dye-sublimated prints quickly with or without borders. Assorted paper types let you create mini or credit card size labels.
