The clips are great too!! They really hold the roller in place! They heat up quick and make perfect curls!! This is by far the best hot rollers I've ever had! Way better than expensive ones I had before this. Love these!!!",

However -- after using it a couple of times, I used it again today for first time in a month and there was very low heat and the heat seemed irregular between the 2 sizes. And -- that was after several minutes. Return window is closed, but I'm going to order another one in hopes that it won't be a lemon. Low risk at $15, but annoying that the first one started acting up so soon.",

I was able to plug the curlers directly into the \"american\" like outlets and they heated up great. Then I went to another place that only had the Peruvian rounded outlets. Used an adaptor and they heated up fine. The curlers are smaller than what I typically use. I bought two sets, put larger ones in one and smaller ones in other...they all fit either way. These curlers are lightweight and take up little space in the suitcase. I would ask the manufacturer to make 1 1/2\" curlers for travel....for us longer haired people!",

For international travel, I use just one base. I remove the base from the other case (it slips out easily), and use the 2nd case just for the spare rollers. As I use a roller from the base, I replace with a spare. By the time I use the first 10 rollers, the others are almost hot enough. These two compact cases can be tucked into small spaces in your luggage and don't take up much space.",
