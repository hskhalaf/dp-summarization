I\u2019ve generally found a lot of artificial ingredients and chemicals in the other brands. With Kasein shake, that\u2019s not the case. You can feel it in the texture of the powder itself. Typical commercial casein shake powders will have a sandy texture that feels like artificial fabric to the touch. However, Kasein powder has a smooth texture that feels like natural cotton to the touch. The taste is amazing. A perfect pre-bed meal after a hard day in the gym - whether you\u2019re building muscle or leaning out.",

What a shame, I really wanted to like this product as all the other cold processed casein proteins are more than eighty dollars.

I have not tasted Casein from anyone else, so I can't compare this to anything else, but I am satisfied with my purchase.

It still tastes weird, but it grows on you. I tried many protein powder before, this is the only one where when I scoop the powder out, the powder sticks to the scooper and doesnt come out. all other protein powder I have used has never encountered a problem like this before. Its really messy. The website says it has 10g of amino acid, but on the supplemental fact or anywhere on the container, it says nothing about it. So does it or does it not......",

    "description": "Flavor:Chocolate Shake| Size:2 Pound (Pack of 1)Manufactured using an innovative micronization process, Kaged Muscle casein is an ultra-premium cold-processed micellar casein protein powder that delivers a sustained release of amino acids to help prevent muscle breakdown.* This filtration method preserves the structural integrity of the protein, ensuring that the finished product retains the natural micellar structure found in milk. Because casein proteins are ph-sensitive, the sustained release of amino acids makes this product ideal as a nighttime meal or during prolonged periods throughout the day without protein intake. Kaged Muscle casein is a true game-changing anti-catabolic protein that slowly and continuously feeds the muscles a steady supply of muscle-building essential amino acids for several hours. This allows your body to maintain a positive nitrogen balance and long-term anabolic state that can help prevent muscle protein breakdown.* the days of gritty-textured casein protein powders are gone thanks to the Caged muscle\u2019s R&D team, who used natural flavors and colors to create an incredibly smooth and delicious protein, available in Chocolate and Vanilla flavors. Quality is enhanced by The fact that all ingredients in Kaged Muscle KASEIN are third-party tested or purity and potency. Casein contains no soy lecithin, is Gluten Free and banned-substance free, and contains less than 1 gram of Lactose per serving. Each tub of Kaged Muscle casein has 100 percent ingredient transparency on the label so you know exactly what you\u2019re putting into your body. These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.",
