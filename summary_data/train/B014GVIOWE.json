At first, I would have given these five stars, but they begin to fall apart (only on the inside though). regardless, I'm still using them. I punch very hard, and these guys offer enough protection. The fit is snug, and the overall design is perfect - there are no strange spaces inside the glove so your hand fits in very well. Unfortunately, Venum should invest in some slightly better lining for the inside. Otherwise, this would have been a five-star review.",

The VENUM patch on the strap was installed upside down on one of the gloves. Took me a while to notice it, so it's not a glaring issue. But for the price I paid, it doesn't bother me. And if my opponent notices, it just means I'm not hitting him hard enough :)",

The palm section in size/spacing, does not match the hand size/spacing section. Meaning- if you have a large hand, the palm section will fit nicely and the fingertips may be more cramped. Similarly, if you have a small, the fingertip section will fit snug and the palm section will be too large. Must wear wraps with these gloves. The wrist wrap section does not take into account for small wrists so does not close tight enough without major overlapping of glove flaps. Everest better quality and make for same, if not lower, cost.",
