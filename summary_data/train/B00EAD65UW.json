Yesterday, it decided that one of my two garage door sensors was malfunctioning and prompted me to test the system. It the automagically deleted one of the doors and the app locks up when attempting to re-add it. Tried on two different android devices. This product is not ready for prime time and is too buggy to something as important as control access to your home. Also, the MyQ Android app is not capable of auto-rotating the screen, you have to hold your device in a single orientation. Dumb. You had ONE JOB Chamberlain.",

Despite the products claims to the contrary, the scheduling feature doesn't work, which is a main feature I discovered I wanted. This means I cannot use the 'smart' app to ensure the door is closed at night. I was also hoping to use the GPS and voice commands in my phone to close the door, but again, the app doesn't handle delayed instructions. I am finding the idea of a smart door opener, accessible through my phone really useful, even more so than when I bought the unit, but the software associated with this unit is pretty bad. Meaning, this is not the unit you should buy.",

After screwing the unit to the ceiling and plugging it in, you connect via WiFi and pair it with your garage. The separate sensor sticks to the garage door to tell if the garage is open (laying flat) or closed (standing upright). The app responds within 1-2 seconds when opening, but closing it gives a buzzer (for safety?) for a few seconds before closing. The iPhone method of connecting didn't work, but the alternative web approach worked great. The unit has survived -15 degrees in the garage without any issues so far.",

Now, having said all of that, i have not yet checked to see if you are able to \"override\" or \"modify\" the closing process in anyway. It may be customizable and I'm just not aware at this time.

The app that shows the open/closed status of the door is one of the best features. You'll always know if/when your door is opened/closed.",

I have to say, if it's not the frustrating setup process that we had experienced, this product, when it's working without application errors, it's a very convenient product to have for one's garage.
