The alert button was in her pocket and she immediately pushed the button to alert my sister who was nearby. She spent the night in the hospital while they ran tests and held her for observation. She was discharged today with an impressive shiner. Without the logicmark alert system she would have laid on the floor for hours until my sister returned from work. It worked perfectly and I am so proud of Mom for keeping it on her person all of the time.",

No need to buy from them but they must be exact. The unit works great and saved my Mom (91) from a fall where she needed help. 4 Stars due to DOA Batteries",

This dialer will provide the same emergency assistance, without the monthly fees...and eliminating the middle man of those services. It dials your choice of contacts or emergency numbers. Not sure of the full range capability, but it worked well at the 100 ft. range we tested outside her house. It has a very clear and loud volume, also. I think anyone, of any age, living by themselves would find this to be a very valuable safeguard to have.",

The pendent\\system called the first person on the call list early the 1st morning with a cryptic message we could not decypher. Called Freedom Alert Customer Service - turns out the system thought there were 2 pendants (no idea why) and they walked me thru deleting all & getting the correct one (and only one) setup. Even programed all the call numbers for me !! Great Customer Service so far.",

It is very light weight and small enough to wear comfortably around the neck. The speaker is loud and clear enough for a real conversation. Overall, it seems like a very good value considering that you only pay for it once.",

You would think that a unit that cost as much as this would last more than two months. Don't buy this piece of junk!!!",
