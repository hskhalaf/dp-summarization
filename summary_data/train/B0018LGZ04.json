      "text": "If you are looking for a replacement for the Speakman Anystream 2000 like I was, you'll need to find another brand. I particularly liked the massage jets on the older model which produced straight forceful streams of water, but now the openings are smaller and the jets are designed differently such that they make a widely scattered (and annoying) spray of very fine drops around the less forceful massage streams. Both the older model and the new have flow restrictors, so it isn't just that. It's so bad I contacted Speakman to ask if there was something wrong with my particular new shower head. They're the ones who explained about the \"upgraded\" design that isn't nearly as enjoyable to use.",

The five jets spray in a comical pattern, as a result they converge in the center to produce a much stronger stream than the outer edges, even when not in \u201cmassage\u201d mode.

Installation was very simple and the inclusion of the thread tape was a nice touch. When combined with the new shower filter, I am very happy with the shower upgrades.",

I'd noticed the Speakman brand in hotels during business travel, so we decided to give them a try. While not super fancy, this is a good showerhead. The water flow is good, and the different spray/stream options accommodate different personal preferences (from light spray to pulsing stream). It's easy to adjust the stream options, using the knob on the bottom of the shower head; and the head accommodates some swivel to allow you to direct the stream per your preference. We're very happy with the Speakman S-2005-HB.",

The restrictor is mad to be tough to remove, so once you remove it, it is not going back. I did put the mesh filter back and it had a strong flow with the filter. Showers are wonderful again!",

The water pressure really seems to be much higher with this new shower head, and it makes showering go from something that is mundane and necessary to almost like a little luxury every day! There are three different settings, which are easy to flip through my turning the side dial. The \"massage\" setting has the highest pressure and is REALLY great. I'm considering buying another one of these for our guest restroom ... it really is a very nice addition.",
