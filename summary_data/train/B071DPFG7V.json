This does what it says, seems rugged enough for garage/power tools use, and has an attractiveness all it's own. It's a little pricey but as an early adopter I'm okay with that. Once Echogear amortizes its engineering costs you should see it from them for half the price.",

      "text": "We put out a LOT of Halloween decorations (inside) that have large adapter style plugs. Because of this, you can't fit very many of them on a standard power strip or extension cord. Six of these outlets rotate so that you can move the plugs out of each other's way. There are 2 more outlets with plenty of space, but they don't move. With this one device I replaced two power strips and an extension cord. I didn't do any research on the surge protection feature, but I feel like this is a great product. Especially if you're dealing with large plugs.",

Where I have this power strip located, the area is very limited, and it fits perfectly. Over all, I'm very happy with this purchase.",

I plugged in large power blocks with no ground plug upside down on plugs with the ground to the bottom of the surge protector, so that I could save upside down plugs (ground facing up) for large power blocks with a ground. This was all so that I could make sure the surge protector could lay flat on the ground. It\u2019s a great space saver, allowing you to plug in multiple large power blocks next to each other.",

The best thing about the Power Strip is that it accommodates the large plugs that otherwise take up a large amount of space. The cords are now organized and out of the way!",

Looks great and cleaned up a whole tangled mess behind the desk. The longer power cord was a bonus, although I didn't need it - some people may.",
