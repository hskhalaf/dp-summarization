First off, it cuts very thick brunches, i think up to 2\", and it cuts like a butter, second it is such a breeze and ease of cutting with no any struggles, and thirdly which is the best part i that it is extendable for ease of storage and carrying. Additionally the fact that it is extendable doesn't reduce the power and quality of cutting in fact it might actually adds to cutting by adding the torque. Simply put, it is just the best product ever, don't look for anything else, this is it, you found it.",

I tried them myself and was astonished by how easy it was. We cut branches up to 2.5\" easily. The telescoping arms also give you a good four foot reach and lock nicely. Well designed, easy to use, relativley light-weight, these are great. I would definitely recommend these.",
