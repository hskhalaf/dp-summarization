      "title": "The removable plates are nice, but this cooks better than a Foreman",
      "text": "I'm thrilled with this grill! After wearing out many small Foreman grills I decided to try this one mostly because of the removable plates. This feature IS nice, but I'm mostly impressed with the cooking quality. I only really use this for big thick burgers. The Foreman grills always cooked too fast leaving the inside pink. This grill may take a little longer to get up to cooking heat, but once it's there I just put the burger in, press the lid down to conform to the burger and walk away for 4 minutes. The burgers are perfect every time, cooked uniformly throughout.",

The piece was on platform holding plates so I didn't even have a chance to wipe it off before it broke. USED ONE TIME! What happened?
