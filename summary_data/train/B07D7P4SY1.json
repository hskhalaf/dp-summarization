I thought it was a HDD failure, but it wasn't. The right fan was failing. For $2,000 dollars that is unacceptable considering the GTX 1070 and i7 8750H NEED proper cooling. I returned this item for a full refund. I'd buy another one but, as a college student, I can't risk having this thing failing me when I'm away from home. My case might be a rare one, but I can't take that risk.",
