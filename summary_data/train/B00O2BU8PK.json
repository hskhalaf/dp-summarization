That didn't work so I returned it. I purchased a second one from DBroth and it had a scratch on the lens and a white dot. Those both showed up on all the slides I scanned. There is no way to clean those items off because they are on the inside. So I returned that scanner. Now I am buying my 3rd scanner from DBroth and hoping the third time is a charm. Kodak should be a good product, but obviously the quality control is not there.",

JPEG compression is very poor. 4. File resolution is 14MP or 22MP, but the 22MP is \"interpolated\" according to the users manual. 5. Actual scanned resolution is much less than the file resolution.

So a warped slide will not feed smoothly across the insert-guide. With some frequency, I had to manually single-feed a slide (due to warping). But overall this didn't slow me down.

Very rudimentary, and using it has the feel like a jerry-rigged (and jury-rigged; there is a difference) set up, but it does work. The picture quality is satisfactory, and probably more dependent on the condition of the slide or film being copied that the fidelity of the copying process.",

The image quality at 22MP is good, but certainly doesn't approach the quality of a high-res film scanner. For what I was using it for, capturing memories, it was absolutely good enough with the added benefit of very fast scans - just a couple seconds, vs minutes for a high-res scanner. The included carriers worked well for negatives and slides. Old glass slides were too thick for the carriers, but slid in without a carrier and scanned fine, as did larger 120 negatives. They just took a little manual alignment.",

I get around that by pulling the tray and manually encouraging the slide past the hang-up. Scanning negatives, both black & white and color worked surprisingly well. I was able to zip through a box of old negatives in a reasonable amount of time.",

The unit can be powered via USB cable. You do not have to have 110 VAC plug necessarily. Now you will NEED a SD memory card in order to save your imagines BEFORE uploading to computer/PC. So for an amateur picture person like myself, it is OK by me. Remember to avoid touching your negatives. Finger prints tend to ruin the film as well as the scan.",

Kodak has a well designed loader that allows you to simply slide in the next slide. Wolverine requires loading slides into a three slide cassette, which is slow and cumbersome. Average time per slide is about four seconds with Kodak and about twenty seconds per slide Wolverine. This is huge when you have thousands of slides. It may have changed with the newer Wolverine but the Kodak has a very short exposure time, which was a major impediment to fast scans with the Wolverine. Highly recommend Kodak over Wolverine.",
