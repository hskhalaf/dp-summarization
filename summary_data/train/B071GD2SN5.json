I finally admitted defeat, put the old equipment back on the car, and ordered this kit. Without this kit, I would not have been able to compress the piston. It worked exactly as advertised. One thing to note - it comes with instructions and a listing of manufacturers that each piece typically works with. The fitting that I ultimately needed was not listed as compatible with Ford, so some trial and error may be required depending on your vehicle.",

      "text": "The cargo net arrived quickly and it was exactly as advertised. I haven't had a chance to use it yet, but it appears to be well-made and sturdy. I had one a few years ago for a different truck and the bungee cord that the new one is made of is definitely heavier. I also like the carry case because it will be a lot easier to keep it in the back of the truck.",
