This one, however, is awesome, and I absolutely love it. The handle turns smoothly. The cheese grates with little resistance, and then you just throw it in the dishwasher for the quickest clean-up ever. Seriously, it cannot get any easier than that, and I would recommend to everyone that this is definitely the cheese grater to buy!",

The real problem is with another part of the rotary mechanism. The way the metal blade attaches to the plastic is not built to last. First pieces of the plastic started to break off (yes, into the grated food), then, finally, the metal blade detached completely from the handle and it is now unusable and in the trash.",

I would never think of eating a block of cheese yet the grater works so well that it grinds so effortlessly you have to realize that a block of cheese or a grated one is the same and then accept the fact that you are a fat ass now.",

The three pieces that it breaks into are annoying to clean and there's usually a thin sliver of whatever you're grating stuck between the barrel and the body. It doesn't handle carrots/vegetables well, either, like a juicer more than a grater. It hasn't messed anything up royally though, so it's not terrible.",

Because of this I don't plan on using this for anything but cheese. I probably should eat more cheese anyway. Easy to clean- pop it in the dishwasher. Easy to assemble- helps me get cheese on my food quicker. Overall... I am happy with my purchase!",
