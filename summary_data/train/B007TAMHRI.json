It is small and lightweight. It works great with my tv and DVD player. The only problem is, there is no function such as left and right arrows to allow me to choose episodes through the DVD menu. The arrows only control the volume on the tv, even when I have it on DVD and VCR settings. I'd like to be able to go through the menu using left and right keys. But other than that, everything else works.",

This TV toggles between antenna and firestick, so being able to select source is crucial. So this device is a fail for me. BUT I did get instant refund from Amazon, so no harm...except the hour.",

Any DVD player remote in the last 20 years has 4 arrow keys. In my case, I couldn't control my 4 year old Sony Blu-Ray player. Spend a few bucks more if you need to control any modern device.",
