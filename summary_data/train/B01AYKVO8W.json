I have wide feet and normally love Sam Edelman shoes, but these were actually less wide then the \"regular width\" Hunter boots I bought. I also felt like these boots were too long and I was going to trip in them. The photos are comparing the two. I would recommend the Hunter boots over these just based on fit and comfort.",

They are stylish, but they are not that flattering because of the awkward height of the boot. I really regret wasting $60 on these boots and now I have to purchase a different pair, mostly because they are painful and definitely not healthy for my feet.",

I re-purchase this at the beginning of the year to replace the pair I bought in the fall. But once boot season comes around again, I plan to look for a more durable pair. Also, because this is a synthetic waterproof boot, it does not breathe. Perfect on really rainy days but not great for everyday, all-day, repeated wear.",

They aren't chunky or squeak like typical rain boots and for the most part kept my feet warm. I wish I had found this earlier in my life!",

Finally, the elastic part on the side of one of my boots ripped after just a few wears. I didn't wear them for anything heavy-duty, and I have narrow ankles, so not sure why this happened other than poor construction. Disappointing.",

Trace the foot by holding a pencil vertically and outlining the foot. The longest toe and back of heel are the most important measurements. Using a ruler, measure the distance from the bottom of the heel to the tip of the longest toe. Record the result in both inches and centimeters and use these measurements to find your size in the chart. If one foot is larger than the other, the measurements for the larger foot should be used.\n\nSam Edelman shoes epitomize chic comfort. With exceptional materials and fine styling, each pair of Sam Edelman shoes is an affordable luxury that cleverly combines a youthful outlook with a worldly sensibility. Sophistication with down-to-earth appeal mean that these shoes are made to be lived in. Whether it's a classic revisited for a modern interpretation or a cutting edge design, Sam Edelman shoes always keep an emphasis on comfort.",
