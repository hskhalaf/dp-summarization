It fixed that problem too. I run this fan 24/7 on both and I have had to reset my system only once since then. And that was due to a city power outage. I set the modem on a shelf near a wall, then the nighthawk router screwed to the wall above it. The fan blows air over the modem and up the wall to the Nighthawk router. Two birds, one stone, and it runs off USB power from the Nighthawk. No extra outlets required.",
