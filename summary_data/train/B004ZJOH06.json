      "text": "I deployed this in my garage, out of the elements. For that use, or perhaps on a protected porch, it is just about perfect. The heating element will not overwhelm, at 20W it gives just enough aid to the cat's own body heat to keep them comfortable - and at a low cost. In a very cold environment, you likely need both flaps installed (cats do not seem to like this too much), and even then my suspicion is it will not be comfortably warm - you would need a higher wattage heated element. For places with few or no bitterly cold nights, strongly recommended.",

After a few days, the roof was then propped over half of the house and half alongside the house. After he accepted this much closing in, the roof was put on correctly and the final step a few days later, closing in the front panel without the removable clear plastic door. With this slow approach to sleeping in an enclosed space, kitty is now warm and happy!",

The flaps on each entrance to the house are sturdy and effective in keeping cold air out. The pad inside is super soft. I highly recommend this product!!!!",

We have some harsh winter's so I'm thankful to have something that keeps them safe and warm. This is going on the 3rd year of use. Every spring I take it apart and hose it off.
