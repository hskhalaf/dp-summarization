The best app to install is Tom tom GPS. It works perfectly and the radio handle it without issue. In this way no Internet required. So far is a good radio. UPDATE May 11th. Radio works great.

      "text": "I love my ATOTO A6 but when I got new polarized sunglasses I experienced severe red interference banding when glancing at the ATOTO LCD screen. My solution to the problem was installation of a NuShield # NU366RA \"DayVue\" Polarization Filter for seven-inch displays from NuShield.com. Cost of the filter and shipping was $24.68. The interference banding has not been removed 100% but I would estimate it at 95%; the LCD screen is entirely viewable and usable with my polarized sunglasses. Apparently different sunglass and LCD screen combinations call for a specific angle of ploarization correction. NuShield customer service walked me through a simple test which seemed to indicate I needed a 90-degree NU366RA \"DayVue\" filter. Installation was simple. Highly recommended!",

The fact that it also comes with navigation, internet connectivity (wifi), phone casting, and obd2 capabilities is a great bonus. Installation, in my particular vehicle, was a bit of a hassle. It required a bit of dash modification with the dremel and an additional trim kit (the 2-din in the 2002 f150 isn't quite 2-din). I've only been running it for about a week, but, so far, I'm pretty happy with the purchase.",

How can you beat that? No radio comes close. Although I will say with other brand name radios like pioneer you will get better sound quality and a better equilizer. The bass on the radio is deep and lower from volume 5 to 14 then it almost completely cuts off once you pass that, that's probably the only downfall.",

For the price you really can't beat all the features, and I am just blown away at how much tech you get in this unit for under $200. Install took me about an hour including bezel replacement and wire soldering. Absolutely worth it.",

There have been issues with the WiFi not reconnecting (25 feet from the router). The biggest issue has been Bluetooth related. When uploading contacts, it has scrambled them twice. Also, when a phone is connected and a call comes in, it takes the ring and voice volume to MAX. This is probably related to the actual phone volume setting. Both issues seem to be known problems. Firmware update maybe? Is it worth what I paid for it....yes. But it\u2019s not perfect.",

I honestly never thought I would even use it but it comes in handy so I can keep my eyes on the road! I highly recommend this to anyone who doesn\u2019t want to spend 800-1000 on a name brand radio.
