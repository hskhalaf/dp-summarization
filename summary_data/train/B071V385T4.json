      "text": "I saw one of these used at a local restaurant and decided to get one. When I saw on Amazon that they were only $5.99, I couldn't believe it. I ordered it that day. When it arrived I discovered for $5.99 I actually got TWO of the slicers for the price of one. If you enjoy avocado's as much as we do, and hate the entire process and mess of cutting them with a regular knife, this is a must have. I think I'm going to order a few extra for Christmas presents this year!",

I like that it was an all in one tool, but there were some issues: the \"knife\" part isn't very sharp, which has already resulted in an accident. And the \"slicer\" part has plastic fins, which are a bit too wide to make nice slices. Going back to my paring knife.",
