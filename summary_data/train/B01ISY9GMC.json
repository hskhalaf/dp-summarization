All together, its a cheaply made toy more suited for collection in a dusty box in a.m attic, than for actually using. A waste of my kids' allowance, and i'm returning it.",

The roof of the car is an important piece but did not stay on. It's like the ball joint on it was too thin and made it keep falling off. They really don't make them the way they used to. Parts are made from more brittle plastic and things just don't hold up all that well. Honestly, If your kid is like 8 or older, this is probably a fun toy... but for us, it just wasn't great. The seller was great to work with though with returns.",
