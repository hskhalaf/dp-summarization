This helmet would get five stars from me except for one important shortcoming: The plastic guides on each side that are used to adjust the straps do not lock, so the straps can slip out of proper adjustment. Since proper fitting is critical for any helmet to protect you in a fall, this oversight makes the helmet less than ideal. Depending on the size and shape of your head, the design may work okay for you.",

Even if you *do* tighten the straps (which is the only way to keep it in-place+safe), it chokes you and doesn't stay tight for more than a minute. I've tried adjusting the straps in every way possible, but it always chokes you and becomes loose within a minute of putting it on...
