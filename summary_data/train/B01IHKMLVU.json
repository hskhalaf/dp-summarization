      "text": "I've had my eye on this table for awhile, ever since starting life on the road in my little RV. I needed a table that could fold short enough to fit under my bench seat, be sturdy enough to use inside and outside, have enough surface to eat and work AND most importantly, raise to a normal height. My biggest struggle finding a table was they were all too short! This one give you an easy-to-adjust option. The table materials are amazing, all the fittings are sturdy and metal and the table top itself is beautiful bamboo. It's easy to fold out or fold away as well. Couldn't be more satisfied!",

It still looks great other than a huge dip in the middle of the table.",

Card tables are not big enough to contain a whole puzzle. This table however is perfect. I can get it out, work my puzzle in a chair with good body posture, and then easily fold it up and stow it when I am done. It has a very smooth top that you can hardly see the middle line it folds at. The adjustable height is wonderful too. It is easy to fold and easy to set up. Very sturdy and looks well made. Very good purchase and I highly recommend.",

The top is also pretty soft (as one can expect from bamboo), it's pretty easy to scratch if you're not careful. Overall, I'm please with this table.

      "text": "I bought this table based on the product reviews from others. The very first time I lifted to table with the plastic handle, the handle broke. Nevertheless, rather than return the table, I figured I could live without a handle. This past week I was going camping--finally my chance to use the table--alas, it was so warped that it was unusable. The glued joints had all but come apart. I'm fairly sure the dry climate here in Nevada didn't help, but this was ridiculous. $139 and never once did I get to use the table. And I'm sure it's now been too long to return it. At least I will try to contact Amazon next week.",

I am keeping it because functionally this one seems good, but i expect more out of new products.",

No one was even sitting at the table when we heard a sound and realized after searching the apt that the table itself was was cracking ? THe bamboo tabletop is literally splitting? It's least of all ODD and has barely been in the house 3 days before this odd occurrence. As USUAL, I tossed the box and packing once I inspected the item and now I cannot return the item without the packing and box? I am now stuck with this table that's cracking all over; waiting to go home and find it in pieces on the floor truthfully - VERY DISAPPOINTED - Heavy Duty ??? NOT",

There are many locking mechanisms to make sure the table stays steady, a great plus!
