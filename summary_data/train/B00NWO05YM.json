I didn't think about this, but the first thing my daughter did was try to open the door and she is easily frustrated. Since this is a smaller vehicle for a single kid, the doors are not functional. The primary reason I liked this car because I didn't have to spend over $200 to get a decent motorized vehicle, and it got good reviews on amazon and on external sites.",

The car holds a charge really well and my daughter loves it. I took away one star just because the charging mechanism is SO annoying to get to. You have to use a tool (we use a flat head screwdriver) to disconnect the battery - I actually can't even do it, I always have to ask my husband! Very annoying. Make it easier to charge and you get 5 stars!! :)",

It\u2019s slow but not too slow. Not wanting my child to crash or get away was important to me. Tires are pretty good. I may upgrade tires too but this seems unnecessary. Our Main use is on sidewalks. It bogs down on grass but i think that\u2019s a battery power thing.",
