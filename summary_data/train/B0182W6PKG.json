Mostly natural colored feathers which look like a lot like low/high lights but extra plus 4/5 teal feathers for a pop. At first I thought I would have to have someone put them in for me, but after reading the directions i decided to give it a try myself. It comes with the beads and a threading loop and was really easy. All you need is needle nose pliers. If you don\u2019t have any, I really bet you could clamp that bead with a decent pair of tweezers. I am more than happy with my purchase.",

I'm very happy with the product! Great quality and beautiful variety! Will be ordering more as my friends and family think they need a couple in their hair now too. ;) Also, when installed properly with the correct end of the feather(s) in the bead, and crimped to the angle of the scalp, they have stayed in just fine and for weeks so far.",

The are packaged (neatly) in a small ziploc. However because the ziploc is small it caused creases in the feathers. It's not a huge deal because you can straighten them.",
