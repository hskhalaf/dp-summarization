I also don't have to dig through stacks to find the can I want. Fitting this many cans on a shelf would need half the shelf, double-layered, to hold as much.

Certainly will consider adding additional units should I become obsessed with buying caseloads of canned goods. Why not? Not I\u2019ve the storage!! <wink, wink>",

It comes with instruction but it's pretty easy to figure out. Had I not been so concentrated on the instructions I probably could have assembled it on my own in 5.

And then there are always those cans that don't stack (the bottoms aren't designed to stack one on another). This just looks more attractive. Other than the really small cans (such as olive slices, chili peppers, chipotle peppers), the rack adjusts nicely for different size cans - or even small jars.",
