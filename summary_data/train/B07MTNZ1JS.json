The nozzle has several functions on it, so that is handy as well. My daughter just couldn't believe how long the hose expanded to. This will really help with their chores, watering our animals, and then later this summer when we need to water the garden - no big, bulky hose to lug around! I've just to watch my dog around it, because he thought it was a toy when we went to use it. :o)",

      "text": "This hose is awesome! I wanted a hose to use for my front flower beds and potted plants but that wouldn't be a pain to roll up every time. Reels are expensive, so I thought I'd try this hose out. Comes with a storage bag, multi-function nozzle, and 2 washers. I couldn't believe how small it coils up to! Quickly expands with water pressure and then condenses back to normal size when finished. What a time and space-saver! Nozzle attachment has 8 different spray types and also works great. I think I'll be coming back for the 100 ft hose for my backyard!",

It is definitely worth the extra $4 for another 25' of hose. When I'm not using the hose, I store it in a plastic flower pot under the spigot. I have used the hose with a sprinkler, a Miracle Gro feeder, and a hand-held trigger sprayer, and it works perfectly! To help not crush my flowers, I put hose stakes at the edges of my garden around the perimeter of my house. I will also be storing it in my shed over the late fall/winter seasons. Definitely recommend.",

For my own overall use, I probably prefer the 25 foot length, but 50 feet also works and I am sure I will get plenty of use out of this hose - as long as the quality holds up!
