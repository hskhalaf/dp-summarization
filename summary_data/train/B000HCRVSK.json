      "text": "I've had 2 of these keyboards and mice. I love them. I've literally worn the mice out gaming...the scroll wheels no longer work. The keyboards, I've dropped a thousand times. They both work fine. The price is outrageous, but you get what you pay for. The only thing I don't like is where the sleep button is on the keyboard. My computer set up is in the living room so the keyboard roams. I still occasionally grab the corner with the sleep button. I looked for a mouse that would work with the keyboards. Too bad they don't sell the pieces separately. There's probably a method to the madness. 2 mice in 8 years...pretty good for today's throwaway society.",

Would highly recommend users also install the third-party UberOptions SetPoint enhancements ([...] This lets you program just about any key on the mouse/keyboard and have it apply globally or per application. So in iTunes I can use the mouse alone to skip forward/back, change volume etc. In Word I can use the same mouse keys to do Cut/Paste instead. Very customizable.",

Pros: -Keyboard keys soft and quiet -Mouse comfortable to use -Reception perfect -Keyboard and mouse design -Clock/timer built into keyboard -Software allows mapping keyboard keys and mouse buttons to different functions Cons: -Battery life for mouse. Advise using rechargeable. I'm only 1 month in and am getting critical battery warnings (although they seem to come and go) -Had to install the software a couple of times to get it to work. Still get startup errors sometimes when booting into XP. -Still getting used to the design of the delete/home/end/page up/down grouping of keys (different than standard keyboards)",

I read all the horror stories about the drivers so decided to forgo the possible headache. I just wanted to write a quick review for anyone that was on the fence because of all the bad reviews reguarding Vista issues.....I believe the driver disk is the problem and not the keyboard or mouse.

No bottons to press, it was all automatic and fully compatible at the PC's BIOS level. I highly recommend this outfit.",

The zoom on the side is really great for presentations of spreadsheets. I am very happy with this product. It did take me about 1 -2 days to get used to the keyboard, as the keys are slightly in a different muscle memory area than my last one.",

The reception is good as long as there's nothing blocking the front of the keyboard. The revamped editing keys might take some time to get used to if you use the standard layout a lot. Overall it's a very comfortable and stylish keyboard with more programmable hotkeys than a standard user will probably ever need.",

      "text": "Unlike every other mouse/keyboard combination I have seen, this product does not permit the user to flip the left/right mouse buttons to facilitate use by left handed people. Also, the keyboard will only lay flat on your desk, with extremely limited options for angling it upward for comfort. Logitech customer support is nonexistent. I gave up on their help line after 37 minutes. The left/right restriction is only hinted at in the manual, where it states that \"some models\" are for right-handed use only. Logitech does not have any indication on its packaging that the product cannot be used by left handed people.",

But considering the increased price of the MX 5000 and the connectivity issues, the MX 3200 by far shines ahead. The mouse precision is very exact also. Overall, really like this combo.",
