However, the range isn't that great and does not work well in older homes with plaster walls. It also did not play well with our range extender. We ultimately returned this and opted for the Orbi WiFi system which is AMAZING. If you have a relatively small place and don't have plaster walls, this will probably be an absolutely perfect product for you.",

So it was pretty essential that I be able to reboot the router remotely, in case something goes haywire. (Of course, if my ISP goes down - there's still nothing I can do about that.)",

Some people don't like that there's only one wired port on the back of this router, but I imagine this product would serve the needs of 99% of all people. Would definitely recommend.",
