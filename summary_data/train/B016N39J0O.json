      "text": "A camera I'd wanted for years. Finally got one, but returned it the next week. Simply too small for my XXL-glove size hands to work the controls comfortably or casually. I probably should have figured that out before I bought it, but the heart wants what it wants... Oh well. The A7 series cameras are still excellent and work very well for me. My A7RII is my mainstay.",

      "text": "Took this to a concert that started in daylight and finished in the dark. I was 10 feet from the stage. You can crop aggressively if need be. Colors are great right out of camera, very little done in post. Of course for concerts having no zoom will not be good when I am 200 feet away. Easy to use, well made and the autofocus is much quicker than expected. I could not be happier. Perceived value does cover the high price tag.",

      "text": "The battery life is abysmal. That is the main problem. Stunningly short-lived. Using primarily the EVF and conscientiously turning off the camera between anticipated shots (due to the poor battery life), one seems to get 100 to 120 shots over a few hours of a day. If you are traveling, sight-seeing, shooting regularly and ever use burst mode, you will need several batteries per day. It's very frustrating, especially coming from larger systems with much longer-lived battery lives. On the other hand, the image quality produced by this camera is quite nice. It really stands out. The EVF works well and the focusing system is much improved compared to the first generation RX1R.",

Battery life is less than pathetic. I use wi-fi SD card which sends pics to my Mac as soon as they are taken and this thing overheats and shuts down. I barely get 15 mins of uninterrupted use from a a single charge. Slippery. Impossible to hold without some type of grip or two-handed handling.

Its absolutely best in class. The battery issues have been highlighted before but carrying 1/2 spare batteries is no big deal to me as they are cheap. I used to own a Leica Q which I resold and I feel the Rx1R2 is better in many ways most notably in Dynamic Range and low light. But they are neck and neck in most aspects - in size and price the Sony wins out as well.",
