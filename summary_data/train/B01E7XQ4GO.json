I wanted it for a bird feeder but while the birds feed, cats may feed on the birds - it is THAT low to the ground.

These are just like my old ones from Lowe's and I believe these will last a long time, too. I use them to hang my solar garden lights on and they are more than adequate for this task. We have really strong winds here, too, and these hooks never move. A really good buy!",
