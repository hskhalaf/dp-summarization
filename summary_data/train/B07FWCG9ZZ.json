      "text": "I love this little TV - I use it on my drawing desk and plan on buying a second on for my work table. My regular TV is out of eye-sight so these little sets are perfect. I have the 12\" and its large enough to see the picture well yet small enough to fit on the tables. The external antenna is small but powerful enough to pick up a lot of stations. And the sound quality is very very good. It has other options that are available which makes it not just a one trick pony. HIGHTLY recommend it!",

Do a channel automatic programming setup (Menu selection). The antenna that came with my unit didn't screw together. The suggested antenna works great. Very good picture and sound. Haven't had this TV long enough to review battery life. Bought to have local stations when we have power outages. So far, very satisfied. Probably guarantees our power won't go out again.",
