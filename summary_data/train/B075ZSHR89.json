      "text": "Really wanted to like this--bought it for a home office where I don't want to attach a white board to the wall. The concept is great and it arrived quickly, and very well packaged. Assembly was easy, although do yourself a favor and throw away the included wrench (flimsy and useless--use either a 12 mm or 1/2 inch thin wrench). The base is not perfectly flat and the whole thing is not entirely stable--it's good enough, but still need to be careful about it tipping (a slightly wider, flat base would be better). The height adjustment is good and easy enough. Overall, not bad for the price, but could be more stable.",

He already used it for a meeting and said it worked out great and others were able to see his notes. Overall, everything came in great condition and it was pretty simple to put together. It appears pretty study and easy to move around and you can lock the wheels in place if needed. It's a really nice glass whiteboard, we highly recommend it!",

The only other complaint I have is that 3 of the corner protecters were broken so that stinks. But overall I am really happy and excited to use it especially now with remote learning!!!",

We had used this whiteboard for quite some time and really liked it. I reached out to the Company and they offered to replace the whiteboard free of charge. I was not really expecting that, as I was hoping maybe they could just send me a discounted board without the stand. Anyway, it is fantastic to see a company that really stands behind their product.",
