So i cant actually review the product but the packaging is awful. If the plastic stand that was attached is actual packaging, its stuck and the force caused the bottle to break, if its not part of packaging then ya may want to redesign the bottle and omit tht square base",

Super disappointing to say the least, and definitely not worth the money.",
