Gotten a poor example of the machine or B. Didn't set it up right.

Also, when it does cut, the motor bogs down till u stop moving piece of wood and then begin again or the blade will just stop if u don't pull wood back....sooo slow to cut anything. I have tried other reputable blades and that is such a chore getting that blade centered on the wheels. I gave all I had to get that blade adjustment right and it keeps popping off the wheels. Original blade broke after cutting a couple pieces of wood. Worse thing is - I cant return it!",

Also tested it on some 2x4 scrap I had laying around and it worked like a charm. The table was solid when adjusted to an angle and the fence stays securely in place. The fence is adjustable on both sides, so it does need to be adjusted to square manually, however with rulers on both sides of the table, that was an easy task to accomplish. This bandsaw is great for the small projects I have around the house and look forward to using it more in the future.",

However, Skill has a two month back order on replacements. This is further complicated because this saw doesn't use industry standard wheel tires. This experience is the complete opposite of what I have experienced with WEN, a competitor on Amazon with similar products. Their customer service is very helpful. Further, I've needed several parts for a WEN product and they have always been in stock.",

Trying to do rips or cut larger pieces are a no-go. I've stopped the blade trying to cut through a 2x4 on the short side.

      "text": "It handles cutting wood fine (I've used pine, oak and mahogany) although it seems to cut very rough. The specs for the blade guides state that they should be .020\", I've narrowed it to .016\" hoping that would clean up the cut but it is still very rough. I have to clean up the cuts with my belt sander, I have not used a band saw before but I wouldn't think the cut should be so bad. Not sure if the blade I got with it is bad or if one of the wheels is out of round. I will buy a new finer tooth blade and see what happens. Anybody else have this issue?",
