This expansion is no different, sure you only get one new act and one new class but you also get to do rifts and bounties which add more to the game. Plus the one new act you get seems to be longer than the first ones but that could just be me. The only thing that I can really complain about doesn't have to do with this expansion it's self but the entire Diablo III and that is you have to have the internet to play which limits where you can play or you get disconnected a lot if your internet is acting up.",

Diablo III is just plain disappointing. It is very limited in play time and lacks challenge at normal difficulty. I beat the game with my 1st character without coming close to dying. My saved characters are not transferable, I might as well delete them. I am currently trying Grim Dawn and can say; just starting to play it, it is a much better game. Don't waste your time and money on Diablo III.",

In this game, the magic users only seem to use their spells to attack even if they have a big club in their hand, and sometimes you just need to bash the creature instead of blasting it with a spell that is meant to take down much larger monsters. Still it's fun to play, so far my favorite character to play is the Demon Hunter. This expansion adds quite allot to the game play.",

The real money auction house detracted from the experience rather than adding to it - nevermind the ridiculously atrocious droprate of legendary items. Thankfully, Reaper of Souls has changed all of that and made Diablo 3 a modern day classic. If you are still undecided, there is no need to be - this expansion makes up for the misgivings of version 1. You may regret getting addicted to the point and click of an ARPG, but you won't regret spending the money on this.",
