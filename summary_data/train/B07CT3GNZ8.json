I wasted a lot of time attempting what should be a simple process. Technical support quickly determined that the product is not compatible with my rather common Fios router. They told me that there are several routers that Kono is not compatible with. Too bad so sad send it back. They said the company shows no interest in solving these issues. Don't waste your time with this dog.",
