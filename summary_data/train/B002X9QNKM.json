Actually, it's much faster than drying it. I thought straightening it would take so long! Not so!",

It absolutely does what it says, it gets hot and stays hot, and I am able to do both straight and curly styles with this flat iron. I will keep buying Hot Tools for years to come. I still have an original flat iron from the early days that's almost 20 years old. Works like a charm!",

Fast forward 6 months and all of the sudden, I go to use it and it gets BARELY hot. Not hot enough to do anything to my hair. Had to go out right away to replace it. So considering that several others have had this issue with this product... I do not recommend it. (Though, I give 5 stars to Amazon for always being wonderful!!)",
