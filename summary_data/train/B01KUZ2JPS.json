It look a little bit of work to get the sensor lined up to the reflector, it seemed the double sided tape needed a day or two to \"set\" and not move anymore(the laser kept going off the reflector tape after an hour or two). Once the tape \"set\" and did not move anymore after a day or two it has worked without any issues and the laser stays right on the same spot consistently!",

    "title": "Garadget - Remotely Control and Monitor Your Existing Garage Door With Smartphone, Voice, Home Automation and Other Devices",
    "description": "Garadget is a simple and elegant way to breath a new life into your existing garage doors opener. It helps prevent mishaps so familiar to many of us: having to drive back to double-check if the garage door is closed, wondering if anything is missing after realizing the garage was left open all night, getting dropped off at home by the mechanic\u2019s shuttle to realize that the garage remote is back in the car, etc. With Garadget, the gut sinking feeling is replaced with the satisfying \u201ca-ha!\u201d.\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\n\n\nEasy to get, easy to own There is no need to replace a perfectly working garage door opener or spend hundreds on new gadgets and installation to enjoy the convenience of the cloud-enabled garage door opener. At the fraction of the price, Garadget includes everything needed for an average homeowner to have the system up and running in under an hour. Once setup, it requires no batteries to replace or bills to pay.\n\nYour house - your rules Typically consumers have to choose between the stand-alone garage controllers and those that can be used with home automation networks. Garaget is not limited to a single option: it comes with the mobile apps for iOS and Android smartphones, web app for computers and less popular phones, wearable apps and home automation plugins. As an open source project, it empowers developer community and encourages the third party software contributions.\n\n\n\n\nIt got lasers Garadget\u2019s innovative laser sensor ends the dilemma between the maintenance free but difficult to install wired sensors and easy to install but battery dependent wireless sensors.\n\nIt got power Featuring a powerful Cortex M3 processor, supporting over-the-air firmware updates and running as an open source product, Garadget well equipped to fight the premature obsolescence by learning new protocols and playing nicely with the new systems.\n\nIt got love Garadget is not another mass consumption article produced by multi-billion dollar corporation. It started as a single engineer\u2019s project to improve the daily life of his family and friends, and it grew into a community driven, open and environmentally responsible product.\n\n\n\n\nMeaningful Home Automation Most of us are not quite ready for Internet-enabled toasters and refrigerators placing grocery orders. Here at Softcomplex, we strive to create products that bring the improvement to everyday experiences, with benefits lasting beyond just the excitement of unpacking a new toy.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Startup Describe your product in 3 words.\n\nGarage door futurizer\n\nHow did you come up with the idea for this product?\n\nThe idea for Garadget was born out of several real-life situations that I didn\u2019t want repeating. First, it was the time when we went to friends\u2019 house leaving the garage open... on the Halloween night! Later same fall, I forgot to close the door overnight and had to spend following days getting rid of rodents. We still forget things sometimes, but thanks to Garadget there are fewer consequences for being an imperfect human.\n\nWhat makes your product special?\n\nHome automation has its great benefits, but until recently it was only the domain of geeks, early adopters and hardcore DIY enthusiasts. Garadget aims to be a low cost practical introduction into the smart home technology for the general public while providing open platform and flexibility for advanced users and the developer community.\n\nWhat has been the best part of your startup experience?\n\nGetting from a personal project to a consumer product is a long and ever-deepening quest with challenges and setbacks at every step of the way. It would be impossible to stay motivated and push it all the way through without the unconditional support of the family, enthusiasm and encouragement of the fellow developers and excitement and great feedback from the Garadget\u2019s users.",
