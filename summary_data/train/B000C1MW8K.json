Stopping power is good, although not as strong feeling as the Raybestos EHT pads, which have a higher GG friction rating, instead of FF, these Akebono pads replaced. The only negative is Akebono doesn't include replacement caliper pad clips. These are usually included with even the cheapest pads, so I removed 1 star from value. I re-used my old clips, as they were in great condition, but new clips are cheap, and should have been included with a \"ultra premium\" pad set.",

Left the rotors as is as they only had 60K miles on them. The rotors will likely be replaced the next time. Update at 3000 miles - This week I completed 3000 miles on the new brake pads and they are holding very well. Braking is good and dust is lower than original pads. Very happy with the product so far.",

Rotors were warped, put new rotors on, so also changed the pads since I was in there and everything was apart. These pads had 85,000 miles on them and were only about 60% worn. Still had 40% life left. These are the best pads you can buy for Honda/Acura vehicles in my opinion.",

Reading that the combination of Centric rotors and Akebono pads were good I decided to try this. The set up is great, there is no vibration only smooth quiet braking. The only extras I had to buy were brake pad spreader clips. Check the Centric website to do the proper bed in of the pads to the rotors. I usually use Honda pads but they cost more and I'm sure that Akebono is the OEM. The Amazon price was the best on the web. I recommend these pads. Make sure to grease all the pins, ears, shims.",

My rotors were constantly warping, even the OEM and even drilled and slotted ones. Was using the Autozone premium pads. They lured me in with the promise of lifetime replacement (I have over 200K miles and am going for 300K). The free replacement wasn't worth it. These pads are so much superior. I don't know if the warping was caused by the pads or the rotors, but so far this combo is perfect 7 months later.",

I bled the brakes and I did do a standard break in procedure. The brake pedal feel isn't different or anything. But no noise no squeaks. And I did use the grease provided on the contact points. And then silicone on the back of the pads. And the price of these are to good compared to 70 bucks else where.",

They are super quiet and feel smooth, kinda like new brakes (sarcasm), I also paired them with the Centric Premium Rotors and it is nice not to have brakes that shudder and pulse every time you use them. I bedded them in and they are great so far, I will get back with longevity.",

Ultimate Performance with OE Quality\nCruising along the interstate, creeping through rush hour traffic or navigating through your neighborhood, you count on your brakes to stop your vehicle every time with smooth, quiet assurance.
