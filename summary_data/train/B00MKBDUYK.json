I've used three syringes so far and usually do two treatments back-to-back, which may be a bit much. Doing two treatments back-to-back leaves my gums feeling somewhat raw and the taste is pretty bad. BUT ... this stuff works! After three syringes, I'm amazing at how white my teeth are (and I'm a 50 year-old who drinks coffee every day). My teeth are now sparkling white. I highly recommend these and plan to order more.",

It's powerful, but it can hurt the gums/teeth if you start out with too much for too long. I wouldn't go any longer than 10 minutes, maybe 5 to 7, the first time. Then skip a day and do the same. I won't go longer 15 minutes, so it took longer to get the end results. But there is no comparison between this and the 35% peroxide which didn't do anything for me after using it everyday for 30 minutes for 5 days. Just start slower and get your gums conditioned for the higher peroxide. It works!!!",

However I would have given 5 stars if I had received all my syringes, I only received 4 out of 10 and feel like I didn't get what I paid for. I did contact the seller and nothing yet?",

      "text": "I'm surprised how well this product worked on it's first application. After using Crest whitestrips for two weeks and not seeing any noticeable improvement, I tried this. Wow! My teeth were visibly whiter after the first try. I have an invisalign retainer and this works perfectly with that. After reading the reviews I was careful not to use too much product and wiped my gums well after applying to remove excess residue. I did not notice any burning. I have not noticed any tooth sensitivity either, although I do use a toothpaste for sensitive teeth. I would highly recommend this product. It's a bargain and it really works!",

Since I'm not a dentist, it took some time to figure out the RIGHT AMOUNT + LENGTH OF TIME that was comfortable for me without burning my gums. I only put a little amount on both trays (less then half a syringe), then spread it around with a Qtip. I use it once a month to brighten my teeth. As a smoker, this helps whiten my teeth again. I also have sensitive teeth (hurts to eat ice cream, but I still do) & these don't bother me at all.",

    "title": "Teeth Whitening Gel Syringe Dispensers 44% Carbamide Peroxide Tooth Bleaching Gel Dispensers 10 pcs",
    "description": "Includes 10 whitening gel 3ml syringe dispensers in maximum strength 44% Carbamide Peroxide. High viscosity gel formula provides maximum adhesion. This is crucial so that whitening gel remains suspended on tooth surfaces. Many thin and watery whitening gels \u201crun off\u201d teeth during the whitening process, which compromises a uniform and consistent bleaching of tooth stains and discolorations. Whitening gel quickly and safely removes stubborn stains due to coffee, tobacco, red wine, tea, foods, yellowing from age and more. Most people see noticeable whitening results after the first treatment. Experience a radiant smile without an expensive trip to the dentist. Your satisfaction is unconditionally guaranteed. CAUTIONARY: The 44% Carbamide Peroxide strength whitening gel is the highest strength peroxide based bleaching product available. It has the potential to irritate gums or cause moderate tooth sensitivity for some users, especially if too much gel is applied to dental trays. Use whitening syringe nozzle to apply small dots of gel along dental tray impression and then spread gel evenly across impression using syringe nozzle. The gel will expand when activated and any excessive application of gel will result in gel remaining suspended on gums, causing potential irritation. It is highly recommended that users perform short 10-15 minute whitening intervals to start in order to ascertain tolerance to the 44% whitening gel. The following is recommended to address gum or tooth sensitivity issues: Decrease the duration and/or frequency of treatments allowing gums to recover between treatments. If you are considering peroxide based teeth whitening for the first time, you might want to purchase a lesser strength whitening gel like 22%. We offer lesser Carbamide Peroxide concentrations through Amazon. Just click on the seller name Bleach Pro to view.",
