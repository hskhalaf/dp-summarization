Fit as expected! Holds onto your leg well! Comfortable and I actually like the strap! It has the stopper on it too. The boots packaging was very well! Each boot was inside plastic. Sometimes the strap will loosen but that's a given. Overall for about $40. This is a good pair of boots! Perfect for the weather!",

These boots are comfy but not the best quality for harsh weather or for activity like running or going for long walks. They are more like a fashiony for a casual outfit. I already got compliments at college and work. If your looking to save some money. I definitely recommend these.",

I have a hard time finding over the knee boots that fit my calves without slouching or looking bulky. These fit all the way up and look neat, not sloppy, and they are sexy. I got mine in the suede tan and get so many compliments I will be ordering the black. They are super comfortable to wear with a flatter, more functional heel. I walked for hours in these the first time I put them on and they felt like slippers. This is my favorite boot yet.",

They fit my calves perfectly, they stay up pretty well, and they go about 4 inches above my knee with is exactly the height I wanted! Good quality too! If you have larger calves, don't worry, they have great stretch so they should fit great! I fount they were true to size, I wear a size 9 and purchased a size 9.",
