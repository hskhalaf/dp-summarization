The close-to-the-ground profile and roomy toe box were both much appreciated by the weight training enthusiasts. On the downside, there were complaints about the insole sliding around. But overall, it was still the shoe of choice for many fitness aficionados because of the grippy outsole and the protective rubber panel.",

        "A majority of testers liked the minimalist design of the Inov-8 Bare-XF 210 v2",

I\u2019m not going to cross train in them so I won\u2019t be able to see how durable they are in that respect. Having said that they do have a sturdy feel to them. I\u2019ve seen other reviews that say they are uncomfortable but I don\u2019t feel that way at all.",

I really like the feel of the shoe, it has the feel of a toe shoe without the odd looks or hassle of putting them on. I've only had them for about a month so I can't say anything about durability but they seem to be well made and I expect them to last a reasonable amount of time.",

These shoes are terrible for walking, and I would never run in these. However, these are spectacular for weightlifting!! Way better than my actual weightlifting shoes. The are basically a low cut wrestling or boxing shoe. Anyway hope that helps. I will definitely buy these again, but only for this very specific use. I'm sure normal size people would have a different opinion.",

The sole is far too rigid which is uncomfortable to wear and entirely useless for some exercise movements. The overall shape of the shoe bares little resemblance to the human foot. Perhaps this shoe would better suit a goat or larger ungulate. FEEBLE. Thanks for nothing Inov-8",

Just enough cushion so when you stomp your feet getting hype it feels great!! Only possible drawback is the sole bends, but that's just because it's so thin and making it thicker would take away from the minimal feel.",

My only complaint is they are a little tight in the toe box and I have fairly narrow feet, so if you have wider feet I'd stay away.",
