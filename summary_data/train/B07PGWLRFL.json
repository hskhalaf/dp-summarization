    "description": "Style:Non-WheeledThe Earthquake MAC is great for weeding, mixing and aerating your garden or flower bed soil. Weighing in at only 24lb, the MAC can easily be transported to your garden bed. When not in use, its stable upright \u201cparking\u201d stance allows for compact storage. The MAC stands at attention, ready to get back to work. The grips and handlebar tubes are positioned to give you the greatest amount of control. This enables you to remove the weeds, not your plants. The rigid U-Turn handlebar design reduces vibration and gives you a greater sense of confidence in your garden. In contrast to wheeled units, the MAC allows gardeners even clearer line of sight near and around plants and makes it a superior option for those primarily interested in the cultivating function. By removing the wheels, the MAC is also lighter than wheeled counterparts which contributes to even greater maneuverability and control. With a US based support team and industry leading 5-Year Warranty, this cultivator will perform for years to come.",
