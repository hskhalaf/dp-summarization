The official Roku software feels dated, and the 3rd party stuff is worse. Netflix on the Roku is not as nice as it is with the Chromecast or Amazon Fire Stick.",

We tried several remedies (e.g. unplugging everything, removing the stick from the USB port on our TV, etc.) with no success. So after reading reviews various places we decided to purchase a second Roku Streaming Stick. It works almost flawlessly so far. I say \"almost\" because we still get a weak signal message now and then but have learned to work around it and with a few simple and quick adjustments it is back on beam. Both sticks were easy to install and both allow us a clean uncluttered look.",

      "text": "I loved this device so much I bought two! First Device: Family Room I plugged this into the HDMI input on my Xbox One. I use the Xbox One to have a single power-button on/off that synchronizes all inputs/outputs properly. That may sound like over-kill, but to me its worth it. I have found that the user interface for the Xbox One is entirely too sluggish and too unfriendly. Hence, the Roku handles 99% of our daily interactions: Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Video, Google Play, Tablo DVR, etc. Second Device: Man Cave This is straight into an older flat screen. For an affordable upgrade, I now will be able to use this flat screen for another 10-years or more.",

The streaming stick definitely has a faster processor that my Roku 1. Netflix and SlingTV stream a lot better with the upgrade. I do prefer the operating system on my Amazon FireStick over Roku",

      "text": "This is my 2nd ROKU streaming stick.. In the last 10 years I have purchased 4 ROKU media boxes, I have one on every TV in my home. The ROKU interface is far and away the best. ROKU is quality and dependable. The ROKU stick I have now is about 60 feet away from my Netgear wireless router and I rarely have a streaming issue such as lag or won't connect. A simple restart always solves that problem anyway. I would highly recommend any ROKU product.",

      "text": "I am on my second stick within less than a month and like others the stick keeps freezing, even the new one I have had less than 24 hours froze and all I could do was unplug it. This is the worst piece of technology I have purchased in a very, very long time! Clearly it is not fit for purpose and there is no way of turning it off without unplugging it. It is going back today!!!",
