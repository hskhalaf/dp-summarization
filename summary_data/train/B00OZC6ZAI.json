      "text": "Absolutely love the picture quality. I'm adjusting to the time it takes to turn on, its not instant like regular TV's but its worth the wait. I only gave it four stars because I had to replace the bulb within the first month. It was covered under manufacturers warranty but that process was time consuming so we bought a bulb to have as back up which I would suggest or you're without TV until the bulb arrives. Each bulb is a few hundred dollars so I'm hoping this isn't a problem again.",

      "text": "I think this unit had potential but i ended up getting a defective one where the picture was blurry and there were some spots on certain portions of the screen. The startup screen looked very nice, clear and detailed, though. Much better than my old 720p sony 3-lcd projector. Just didn't look right when i put it on a source such as tv receiver or dvd. Spoke to Ben q directly and they advised to exchange it. I'm going with just replacing the OEM bulb for my sony projector for now, but will definitely reconsider this in the future. Also, if you have a long throw distance, this will be a good one to look at under $1k.",

The 1.5x throw ratio is very convenient for accommodating various room sizes or projector mounting locations. Some of the other sub $1000 projectors have limited throw ratios which would not work for my room layout. WIth its sub $900 price, it is a screaming bargain. My only complaint, is the fan noise that is often audible. Since I tend to have the volume set to higher volumes, this noise does not detract from the overall viewing experience.",
