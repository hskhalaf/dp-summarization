Unfortunately, my latest order of this product gave me a different experience: I noticed that the product is now much more watery (I can only assume that the makers of this product added more water and less of the charcoal to save money), and the smell is much more fishy. Also, the amount in the jar is less. When I use this mask now, I can't see the difference between before and after washing it off my face. I wouldn't recommend this charcoal mud mask unless the makers go back to their primitive ways.",

The only reason I\u2019m giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because the brush that came with this is no where near the quality of the brush in the photo. The brush I received looks like a reject from a dollar store multi brush pack. It has a hard plastic support in the middle of the bristles that render it useless for applying product.",
