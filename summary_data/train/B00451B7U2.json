I like the 3 dials - one for temp, one for time and one for convection or regular toaster oven cooking. I've used the convection oven setting and it is pretty quiet and completely cooks like a regular oven and at a much faster speed. This one is jujst a bit deeper than the old one so you can put a small pizza in it or a pie! I'm happy with the unit all around - no complaints.",

Very easy to use with no digital electronic controls- all hand rotated knobs. Heats well and quickly, I haven't had any bad experiences with this. Would I buy again? No - because - size is very small and it would be nice to be able to use more than one shelf at a time. One suggestion: The arrow marker on the dials is Not easily visible, so I used a permanent red marker to highlight it and it looks surprisingly good and works. I suggest they do better to indicate the arrow position.",

If you have the slightest bit of butter or oil on your fingers, you'll go nuts trying to turn these things! Maybe the next iteration of this machine will have textured or ribbed knobs.

Turn the gauge a bit more and it will completely burn your toast and possibly more! The picture here is after one piece of toast on medium setting. I really wanted this product to work since it is attractive, and Oyster generally has good quality products. However, after several near miss burning issues, it is going straight in the dumpster.",

You need an oven mitt to open and close the door, unless you enjoy burning your hand. Guess I will keep my older Oster until it no longer works at all.",

Not having to crank up on our regular sized electric stove/oven to heat two servings of tater-tots or french fries, cook a small meat loaf, bake a couple of potatoes, or what ever, it really saves both time and energy using the confection option. Cooking times are a bit shorter as apposed our conventional oven, so have to watch and adjust actual cooking times, but haven't had a burnt meal yet. Using foil on the included drip tray and roasting pan saves messy clean-up too.",

    "description": "Cook with the convenience of an oven on your countertop using the Oster 6-Slice Convection Toaster Oven. Featuring a sleek brushed stainless steel housing, this toaster oven uses convection technology to distribute heat evenly for thorough cooking and excellent results. The oven's generously sized interior offers enough space to accommodate a large frozen pizza, while its adjustable rack can be placed in two positions, so you can customize the space whether you\u2019re cooking a tall roast or baking chocolate chip cookies. An energy-efficient alternative to turning on the full-size oven, this countertop toaster offers three user-friendly control dials for selecting the cooking function, adjusting the temperature to up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit, and setting the 60-minute timer. The timer can also be turned to the stay-on position for continuous cooking. The Oster 6-Slice Convection Toaster Oven also features a transparent door for checking the status of your food at a glance, a wide easy-grip door handle, an easy-to-clean interior, and an internal removable crumb tray for convenient cleaning. It comes with a durable baking pan.",
