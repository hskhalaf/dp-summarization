      "text": "Allergy season is in full swing around here, so like any good parent I decided to help my sneezing/sniffling/itching allergy-ridden children by spending 6 hours (yesterday) vacuuming and shampooing over 1200 square feet of carpeting. It seems to have helped a little, and the cloyingly overly-fragrant scent has subsided into the usual ADMS allergy spray scent that we have come to know and love. The girls spent an hour on the carpet this afternoon, and there were no signs of itching and other symptoms seemed to have abated somewhat. The carpet is a little \"crunchier\" than usual (I normally use the Bissell Pet Stain & Odor Remover), but I am sure it will soften up over time.",

So, I was given a brochure of different products to buy to help get my home allergen free and this company's name was listed with different products and I decided to see what all they offered. To my surprise, they made this carpet shampoo. Hallelujah!!!! This would solve my problem and I ordered it. Love the product and will continue to order it until we decide to spend the money on a new floor in the home.",

I shampooed every carpet in the house and sprayed the mist on every wall, baseboard, and furniture. AND I got rid of it all. NO MORE ALLERGY!!!! Unbelievable. I am so happy.",

It smells fresh without any of those horrible scents they add to most carpet cleaners. I takes very little to do a great job and gets it done. I even put a little in my mop water to do the tile and vinyl floors, and a little in my dog blanket load to wash. These products are the best. Can't say enough.",
