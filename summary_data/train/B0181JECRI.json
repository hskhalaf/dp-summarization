      "text": "Wow! I was gifted a kindle fire 10\u201d and even though it is not heavy it is Large. I got tired of holding it up while reading and typing and hated propping it up on a pile of cushions on my lap. Using my cover\u2019s kickstand didnt help while on my lap so I am so glad I ordered this ( great priced) lap pillow. It will hold up my kindle portrait (upright) and landscape (on its side) without falling over! Keeps my hands free to type and stays put! AND the beautiful red cover zips off for cleaning. Thank you for offering good quality at a nice low price. I can afford to buy several for my buddies!",

I didn't give it 5 stars since I had to make one adjustment on it to make it work because my iPad fell too deep into the slot for me to see what was on the bottom of the screen. I took yarn (because regular thread didn't hold) and threaded it through each end and tied a bow so my iPad wouldn't fall into the slot too far. A simple knot would work also for those who don't want threads hanging down the side. Works like a charm.",
