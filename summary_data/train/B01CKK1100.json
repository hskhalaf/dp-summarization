I wasn't expecting for the price that I would have to fix a seam. None the less he didn't notice and didn't care now he is snug with his \"hotdogs\".",

Not like he's a big boy and is moving around a lot in his sleep. He just turned two and is under 30 pounds. Don't waste your money would be my advice.",
