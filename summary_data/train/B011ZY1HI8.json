The head was misshapen near the top of the blade, and it looks like whoever did the grind noticed it and decided not to grind that area... probably because it would snap the top part of the blade right off. The head was also seated crooked onto the shaft. Poor quality assurance for such \"prestigious\" tool maker. My plastic Fiskars x7 at the $20 price point feels like a better quality tool.",
