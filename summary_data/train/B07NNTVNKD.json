Bigger players and even older hoopers who require more cushioning may want to think twice before copping a pair.Overall, these Under Armour basketball shoes offer good value for the money. However, it may be a good idea to try these on first to see if it has enough cushioning for your liking.",

Previously I was using Nike shoes the PG3\u2019s, my feet would always hurt running up and down in them to where I would have a sigh of relief after taking them off. I wear Under Armour for lifting weights and thought Nike was more basketball oriented but boy was I wrong, I gave these a go tonight and they are great. They fit just right and are lightweight the shoes don\u2019t feel so tight and have good traction. From now on I\u2019m sticking with Under Armour for everything!",

Lightweight is a positive but they are thin on the sidewalls and do not give as much support to lateral movements as the Nike shoes we bought. I think they are pretty good for basketball practices but, for the games, I would recommend a stronger shoe made of thicker material.",

Other than that the glue has held up, shoe laces hold strong, and the rubber all around is intact. I\u2019ve had under armour shoes before that were junk but I\u2019m gonna get another pair. Only reason for new pair is my current ones stink. Cant get rid of the smell. My fault for not washing them.",
