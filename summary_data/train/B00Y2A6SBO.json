Some were ridiculous inflatables that are embarrassing to try to get going. Finally, a chair. It's very portable. I throw mine into my backpack and go. You will be amazed by how comfortable these are (unless you are very tall or otherwise very large). I appreciate the brilliant design that fits my needs.",

You do need to be careful that sparks from your campfire don't hit it or you will get melted holes. Randomly the zipper on my chair's case broke this year but my husband's is still just fine.

Be aware the bag is difficult to compare the size to but if you are looking to take this backpacking it will take up a bit of space in your pack but you can minimize space by just bringing the poles and seat separately. ***Note: The pole construction is all one piece that is broken down similar to a tent pole and compacts nicely.",
