      "text": "I received my Yeti 20oz with Mugslider lid. Looks great, well built. But after a hour or two, coffee is cold. While driving, the coffee will leak past the lid, and proceed to drip, all over your cars interior. I was hoping for something better. I also liked the information pamphlet that can with the cup talking about liquid viscosity, and how cold liquid is thicker, than hot, so hot liquid will have a tendency to leak around our Mugslider lids. Here's and idea, how about making a lid that doesn't leak when you put hot liquid in a cup??? I digress, TLDR don't buy if you want to use it for hot liquid i.e. coffee.",

Also, when you drink from it, some liquid pools up in front of the hole, so if you snap the closure shut after drink it it can splash up. I got some on my glasses while driving, which was NOT COOL.

      "text": "I ordered 2 of the YETI Rambler 20 oz tumblers, but after reading reviews on Amazon, I was worried about \"counterfeit\" YETI products or cups that arrived without the Magslider lid. But my tumblers arrived perfectly as described, new, and with appropriate magslide lids. Quality product, mostly leak proof (but I wouldn't turn it upside down), and my new go-to water cup that comes with me everywhere! Fits easily in the cup holders in my car, but just barely (and not very securely) fit in the cup holders in my partner's car.",

The lid fits snugly and it is easy to clean. The size is perfect for 16 oz coffee. I also purchased a handle which is convenient.",

We overpaid on our coffee for a week before realizing that the thermos fits only exactly 16 ounces if you're actually going to screw the top in (and, aren't you?) I can't understand how they're marketing it as a 20. Go get your measuring cup and you'll see for yourself!",
