After trying some of the more higher priced bird foods, which, in some cases, my bird refused to eat, I've returned to this old standby. No reason to spend money on the higher priced brands, if your bird refuses to eat them. Yes, I've heard all about how seed diets aren't right, and that pellets, or crumbles are better, but my bird has lived in this food for seventeen years. He likes it, and that is that. Have always been pleased with Hartz products. Always have been a good value bird food.",
