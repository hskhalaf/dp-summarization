Reviews stated the bristles were weak. After a week the bristles don't seem to be falling out or becoming weak. If this changes I'll update my review. I don't think I'd want them any stiffer than they are now, for fear of the brushes destroying other footwear such as my leather cowboy boots or any shoe.",
