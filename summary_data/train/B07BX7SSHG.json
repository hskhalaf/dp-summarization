      "verdict": "Based off the Lakai favorite Griffin, the Porter is a freshly polished silhouette. It rides with a cleaner, slimmer, and more seamless upper construction than other Lakai shoes. Aiming to be more minimalistic, the Porter sports an embroidered Flare logo on its sidewalls and settles atop a white midsole.With its candid, plain styling, the Porter is perfect for those silent skaters who want their tricks to do all the talking. It has a trustworthy level of comfort, board feel, and grip. Lastly, the Lakai Porter sits friendly at $58.",
      "pros": [
        "The Lakai Porter is very budget-friendly",
        "Nearly all the reviewers dig its simple, clean, and fresh-looking design",
        "Its level of comfort proves superb, according to most testers",
        "A few skaters commend the Porter\u2019s flexibility, board feel and grip, which make it suitable for technical ledge skateboarding",
        "One reviewer like that the laces were set up pretty high and the seams set far back as that kept them away from the flick and rip-and-wear areas",
        "Quite a few Lakai first-timers feel happy to have started with the Porter",
        "The Porter breaks in nicely, a user remarks",
        "It has a cushy heel area, a reviewer notes",
        "Some buyers regard the Porter as a fantastic showcase from Lakai"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "A fair number of customers agree that the Porter runs small and suggest going up half a size",
        "The metal eyelets began pulling out after a few skate sessions, base on a review",
        "Some wearers report that the canvas upper is difficult to keep clean as it also gets discolored when wet",
        "A few skaters mention the Porter needs more arch support",
        "The collar and tongue are thinly padded, a reviewer points out"
