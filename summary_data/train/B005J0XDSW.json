The longest I was able to hold onto one was 8 years! I like to take pliers and gently squeeze the end where the blade come out, this keeps the blade from slightly moving back and forth when cutting pinstripes and such. I keep a hand full of stainless blades for when I am cutting on windows and I use the black high carbon blades for table work and general cutting. High carbon blades cut windows. Stainless won't.",

Only downside versus the OLFA is that the tip of the OLFA is more pointed, which can be useful as a screwdriver or poking device. Modifying the tip of the NT is easy enough with a Dremel or similar tool though.",

I THOUGHT this was going to be a much more ergonomic, semi-oval barrel/body with storage for a few extra blades, but this is single, thin, and unfortunatley, quite flat. There's not a great place to snap blades off, which is another disappointment. I'd much rather have a $2 plastic one that I can lose or throw away instead of this. I paid for what I thought it was, and it's not that, sadly. (helpful?)",
