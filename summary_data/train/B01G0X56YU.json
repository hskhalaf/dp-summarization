Notes: depending on the car you really need to make sure the location of your vents are in a good spot for these, also that they will fit the vent well enough to hold the phone. Like my 2016 kia optima it fits perfectly and is in a good location to view the phone when driving, but with my 2004 subaru forester xt the vent is much lower, so it makes it harder to look at the phone and pay attention to where you are going if you have your GPS on.",

Probably would be great for a lot of other cars and cases though.",

When your cars vent is tilted, the phone is also TILTED so much and it is so hard to see anything and use. I find this product a bigger distraction than help.3. magnet is not strong enough to hold note3 or one plus 2 phones. they keep falling.",

This is very easy to use interchangeable with the phones. For my work phone, I don't want to stick the magnet on the back of the case, so I put it in between the phone and case and this magnet is strong enough to still work. They have two sizes on the plug that you attach to the vent so they can attach snug. Good price, good product. would buy again",

      "text": "Have had this mount for over a year now and it slowly starts failing on me. Whenever I need to get a mounted phone from car it comes with the magnetic mount itself. Unfortunately the rubber grip looses its durability and does not connect the base of the mount to a car air vent as good as before. Gotta replace it with the same or similar product. Wish it lasted longer, but WizGear has to make money from you to!",

I was happy with it for the first 3 months and then all of a sudden it completely lost its adhesive and fell off my dashboard. Now that I have purchased this one I will probably never go back to one that adheres to the dashboard. The fact it hooks onto your vent is much more of a guarantee that it will stay. So far so good! Plus the fact this pack comes with 2 magnets you can hook into your vent is a much better value.",
