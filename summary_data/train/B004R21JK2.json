It is 1/2 the size of regular small compressor-less refrigerator. 1.7 CuFt and can fit under most dorm beds that are on risers or under a dorm desk. Holds enough stuff for any college kid. Comes in black or white and has really good ratings. My daughter loves it. Amazon has the best price and it ships with Prime also. A college student can get a trial subscription free with a college email address. I ordered hers on a Sunday night and she had it on Tuesday with my Prime membership.",

It keeps everything ice cold and is virtually noiseless. Every now and again, I hear it kick in, but not loudly. By the way, the box was torn open and all dinged up when I got it. It looked like it had taken a bad fall. However, the refrigerator was so securely packaged in a box within the box that it didn't suffer any damage.",

It makes a quiet little shudder when the compressor shuts down a minute or so later. This unit is not annoying or distracting to me. Be warned, I think peoples' experience varies by unit.",
