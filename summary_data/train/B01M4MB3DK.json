The pricing is a little more palatable now, but I spent $2k for mine a few months ago and I have no complaints. Everybody likes to complain about the \"limitations\" of M43, but after spending a decade shooting with full-frame pro Canon bodies and L lenses, I am happy to be using something 1/2 the size and 1/3 the weight. I will still whip out the 1D body and 85/1.2L for those rare, special occasions, but otherwise, it's M43 for me now.",

But feature for feature, ergonomics, responsiveness, and system integration. Esp lenses, far exceeds mirrorless Nikon and rivals Sony. This camera is superb and is the culmination of engineering and experience that Olympus has gained from decades of making cameras (and I come from a Nikon and Sony user background). There is a lot of media propaganda about advantages orb full frame and imminent demise of M43. Use the camera and look at the results. You won\u2019t look back.",
