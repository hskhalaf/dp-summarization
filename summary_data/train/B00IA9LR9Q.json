Not a scratch on the camera and I managed to save myself from injury. Fabulous photos and perfect for an on the go couple/family. Looking forward to canoe trips, camping and family fun. Definitely exceeds my expectations. I am attaching a photo that I took underwater 45 ft with the camera and another of above water.",

If your in a wet environment but not actually underwater, keep in mind that you have to clear the lens of water drops before you take pictures to prevent distortions. Be sure to get some practice with the settings before you ruin that \" one time only\" photo. Up on Mauna Kea, our iPhones took better pics. I did really like the location tagging feature, even if the altitude readings were usually off (both at sea level, and high altitude)",

My wife says she thinks the photo quality is sometimes poor, and it doesn't have as good a zoom as non-shock/water proof cameras, but especially for kids this is the camera to buy. My daughter (6) is a camera nut, and you can just give this to her and let her run with it. I have dropped it (with my heart in my throat) several times on purpose and no problem. The kids immediately wanted to go to the pool and swim so they could be filmed. Plus its small enough to easily fit in your pocket. (I am a guy, with practical pockets.)",

      "text": "Wonderful little camera. I'm writing this review after only having done minimal testing. I'm a bit of a camera geek. The controls are a bit clunky for doing more sophisticated stuff, but I bought it expecting it to be optimized as a point & shoot, and that's what it is / does. The only caveat so far is that it comes in an excessively \"dummy\" mode that doesn't let you do anything, and it takes a bit of poking to find your way out of that mode.",

I'd done a lot of research into waterproof cameras before purchasing and definitely not disappointed.",

It's got just about everything going in it's favor with one significant downfall for those who are accustomed to shooting with a Nikon DSLR which is image quality. While it's not terrible and the video quality is surprisingly excellent, the pixel quality is a bit disappointing when you regularly shoot with a dslr. Most people will not even notice, but shooting with a D800 and switching to this is a huge difference and I think I'll just take along my dslr anyway for the quality.",

The gauge shows 2/3 power and then click, it says 'Battery Exhausted'. That having been said--it took a lot of pictures before that happened. But, buy an extra battery and keep it with you.

On rare occasions focus in video mode will screw up. This seems to be related to starting video focussed on something close up (possibly getting set in macro mode), then quickly moving to something far away. Stopping and starting the video clears the problem, though.",

It takes fantastic still shots and videos underwater, and the night shots with the delayed flash, are just perfect! It's very lightweight, and the accessories kit that we got in addition, were perfect also. The large screen was great to be able to look at pictures even in the bright sunlight, and we took about 250 pictures and videos before the battery needed to be recharged! Highly recommend this camera.",
