Besides looking cute, they're absorbent as burp cloths, they wash up really well, and they are so soft and snuggly that my 6 year old son still uses them as blankies that he sleeps with every night. So when baby #3 was on the way, I picked this grey set that goes perfectly with other grey striped and star-patterned blankets, and they're just as nice as the ones we bought 6 years ago. Love them and definitely recommend!",

I'd give these as a shower gift inthe future.",
