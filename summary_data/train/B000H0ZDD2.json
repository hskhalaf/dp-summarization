Knowing that there is a significant amount of moisture in the air but this unit is not collecting any demonstrates that in my mind you are better with a unit with a compressor even with a smaller water collector. The cost of this unit is such that you, in my opinion, you are better with a \"real unit\".",

      "text": "I read the other reviews on this product but took a chance. I wanted something small for my bathroom as there is no other ventilation. The product worked great for about 1.5-2 weeks. I would mostly run it for a couple of hours at a time in the morning after showering. One morning I went to turn it on and it was completely dead. I tried unplugging everything, I tried using different outlets in different rooms of my house, nothing worked. I ended up returning it. It was disappointing because it did work really well for me up until it died.",

Obviously a larger, more expensive unit would do a better job at dehumidifying but this one works well enough that I'm comfortable while working at my computer. I have this dehumidifier seated on a table about 12-15 feet away from me and next to a fan so that the fan blows drier air towards me. I've only been using it for about a week so I can't comment on the durability of the product but as far as effectiveness goes, it works for my purposes.",
