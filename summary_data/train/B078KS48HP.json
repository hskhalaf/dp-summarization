The first time I tried to use it there was nowhere near enough suction to pick up any abrasive. I have another gun that does that just fine. Then the air screw at the grip end of the gun began to leak air. A minor adjustment destroyed the leaky rubber washer. I hope they will take it back. Avoid this one, keep shopping.",

      "text": "This gun is a good value. I have used it about 1 hr. Getting it going was an issue. There were two problems. 1. There was a wasp larva in the sand suction tube 2. The sand suction tube was had a thin layer of metal sealing it off from the main air flow. This should have been removed during manufacturing. Once I figured out what was going on the gun worked fine. The nozzles are solid and for the little bit I used it, it works well Update: I have blasted with this gun for aprox. 10 hrs. It works flawlessly. Well worth the money",

Using a punch I knocked it out, and was in business. This thing now works WAY better than the junker gun that came with my HF blast cabinet.",
