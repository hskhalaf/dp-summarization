      "text": "The Logitech (really SlimDevices) family of products were light-years ahead of their time. Relatively easy to set up and maintain, technically accurate in sound reproduction, and and tremendously useful. And the Boom Player is no exception, although it's just not as perfect a LAN music distribution platform as the Touch. Still, it's easy to set up, its sound quality is fairly good (it's even better when you add a subwoofer!), and it's still a useful device, something like 15 years after the original SlimDevices Duet device was introduced in the market. It's a tragedy you can't buy these things new today; I still use them every day for music distribution over our local LAN.",

Getting it to work initially and after you moved wifi networks can be a bit of a pain and I found that factory reset is the way to go in such cases. Half a star off for this. The sound is amazing. Very competent bass. It is indeed a mystery why Logitech chose to discontinue this superior product. The good stuff always gets the boot (think Kinect for Xbox).",

I also have second and third generation Squeezeboxes which were originally made by Slim Devices, before they were purchased by Logitech. They are in the Master Bedroom, Living Room and Family Room. Initially, I was a little apprehensive about the Logitech buyout, but after I bought my first Boom, I felt confident that Logitech was getting it right (so far). My only hope is that Logitech continues to expand and improve the Squeezebox line. As for me, all I can say that for the money, what this great device can do is incredible!",

However, I also own a Squeezebox Radio on which Rhapsody works great. So this leads me to believe that it is the device and not a Rhapsody problem. Either the Rhapsody app needs to be updated or the device firmware needs to be updated to fix those issues. Songs will sometimes stop in the middle and no sound comes out. It is an expensive product so I would recommend you make sure you will not have those issues before you invest in it.",

The box is easy to control with touch controls, remote control, or with my computer (while i'm working). I paid $279, but it's on sale this week for $189. It's a bargain. The quality of the controls and the sound are much better than I expected. I use it with a subwoofer - which really makes a difference. Buy It!",

      "text": "Its like a world radio except, it brings the world to you. Pros: Great sound, fast setup, powerful web interface, powerful front panel interface, can be used with pretty much any free/subscription music service out there. Alarm clock function has a battery backup. Cons: Line in and out don't work that great. For the price, I'd expect optical I/O, but no. No internal battery for music.",
