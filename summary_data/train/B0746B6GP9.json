The stand for the base is so flimsy that it won't support the stand let alone anything that you want the stand to hold up. It is also impossible to get the top portion to stay in place. Once you get your projector aligned like you want, you tighten the knob. When you let go of the projector, the knob won't tighten enough to stay put. It moves, the stand at the base wobbled, and it all comes tumbling down. I am really surprised bc I read good reviews for this product.",

The selfie stick is poorly made, wobble and one of the level does not open smoothly, making setup very uncomfortable. The 1/4 screw head is very loosely and introduces extra camera shake. The remote control came dirty with small cardboard particles and feels like a cheap toy. For the price I expected more. A selfie stick i got for 5 usd is better made from this one.

      "text": "Very light weight, but sometimes it is hard to get it to lock into place when extended. Remote will shut off if not used for a while which is good if you forget to shut off but if you are trying to video not so much as you will not be able to shut off camera. You have to man Maneully connect blue tooth every time you use it if you have turned off the remote. After all is said and done I am very satisfied with product for the price.",
