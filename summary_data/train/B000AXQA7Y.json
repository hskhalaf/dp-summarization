It suggests using cool, clean baking sheets, stoneware works best. It comes with recipes, however, I used my grandmothers favorite and it works just as well. I even colored the dough and it still perfected each cookie. This press is well made and comes in a great storage box that I will be sure to pass on to my daughters.",

To add insult to injury, the cookies were hard as rocks within an hour of cooling and I did not over bake (they were barely brown).

      "text": "Excellent design! My daughter is so happy that she can now create designs NO SWEAT! The workmanship seemed solid. I say 'seemed' because this product is made in China (now PRC) and anything made in China is often single use. With this in mind I told my daughter that we should not refrigerate our sugar cookie dough before using because then it will be stiff and might break the plastic. Some reviews here complained of the cylinder breaking. It will if you're not careful. Overall the product is very good buy. I am happy I bought it. I just don't know how long it will last (made in China)",
