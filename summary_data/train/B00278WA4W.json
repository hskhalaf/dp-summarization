They work perfectly without ANY leaks. I read that other people have leak problems and I'm wondering if they knew to use the removable spill-proof seal. I love the shape, it makes it really easy to hold and harder to drop. I personally use these sippies as a calming technique at night for my PTSD and insomnia. I prefer these without the leak-proof seal because it works TOO well. It's hard to get alot of liquid at once, which I'm sure is great for kids and small children.",

Unfortunately, there are spots that will grow mold if left uncleaned and it\u2019s nearly impossible to get to these spots once they\u2019re affected. The spots are within the filter, right around the ring of plastic that alllows flow when sucked. Other spots are in the inside of the nozzle, right around the opening to the nozzle. Also, there are pockets around the cylinder where the filter pops in that will grow mold if not cleaned immediately. If you\u2019re diligent on cleaning dishes, these are great. If you let dishes sit for a period of time, you\u2019ll be throwing out moldy tops and filters.",
