Unfortunately, In the past 3 months I have had 2 of the Voyager Legend's. One failed to keep connections with my phone. The second one the speaker failed after 5 weeks. Also the programmer forgot to leave a space after the the word \"To\" so when it responds it says, \" Calling ToJohn Smith.\"",

My previous employer had some high end Plantronics headsets that were great. This product isn't the same quality but it's also quite a bit cheaper. However, even given the price point I think the audio quality is still not up to par. It isn't super loud, the audio is tinny and then there are pops and crackles like you're listening to a record. Could I do it again, I'd probably go with something better but I'm out of my return period now so I'll live with it for a while.",

It is no longer possible to just plug it into a normal small end charger--you have to have this magnetic attachment between. The more compact magnet will not stay connected to the earpiece without masking tape; an all-in-one is also available, and works better, but has a cord 6\" long. I do not know who the rocket scientist is who thought up this little, unnecessary addition, but perhaps they should consider a new career where they can make more devoted customers miserable.",

I spend a lot of time conducting field work, so any headset I own gets subjected to some pretty rough treatment, and more than a few have found themselves going through the laundry. It is a pretty decent bluetooth headset. I have found that for some reason the outgoing voice quality the other end receives is affected by having 2 phones paired at the same time. When the person I am talking to complains about my voice quality, I simply turn the bluetooth off on the second phone, and they report that they can hear me better. The noise cancellation is adequate for most purposes.",

      "text": "This is my second, so I am posting based on my original purchase. The background noise cancelling works wonderfully and it picks up my voice perfectly. I have owned other headsets which just cannot compete with the ability of this headset to pick up my voice. I purchased the first Legend in 2014 and when the original started having problems picking up my voice I needed to replace it. I did find videos on how to replace parts inside the boom but decided to purchase new headset and because of the battery life and the voice quality, I decided to purchase a new Legend. I expect this one to be a great as my first.",

Down side well sometimes the noise cancellation isn't the greatest especially in the wind... but then again what is.",

Also, if you purchase this you absolutely MUST get the matching charging case. Trust me on that one, you won't regret it.",

Samsung phones aren't too good at voice dialing but at least the predecessor could do it. Non of the other reviews mentions this. I guess I'm the only one who likes voice dialing. There is a proprietary magnetic plug. It could be seen as an improvement except for its incompatibility with all your existing plugs. A big down for me. The oddball plug isn't mentioned in the description. Their more expensive unit uses micro USB. I'm returning it.",
