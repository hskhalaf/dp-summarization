It was the first time I purchased a glass protector versus a plastic one, and this was more effective compared to plastic. However, I had to keep replacing it and eventually tried a different brand of glass protector to compare lasting power. Compared to that, this one was much less durable. I didn't know about the warranty before and that's why I bought a new one every time it broke (which was pretty much every time I dropped the phone). Would recommend taking advantage of the warranty program if purchased, but keep in mind that it does take time to get a replacement.",

No damage at all to the phone, for which I also have a Spigen Slim Armor case. I immediately ordered a replacement and installed it in under five minutes. The screen protector is functions just as well as the unprotected screen, with no installation hassles (easy to align, no bubbles). Well worth the price. I previously used Tech Armor's plastic film screen protectors, which I really liked, but when the last one was damaged by my keys, I decided to try the ballistic glass. It's easier to install, clearer, and has a better feel. I love it.",

This protector takes the first shot- when she drops her phone hard enough, it cracks and leaves her phone safe. The product even has a warranty so if you break the protector- which my daughter successfully did within the first 2 weeks of buying it- they will send you a new one free of charge! It is much less expensive than repairing the screen which usually costs upwards of $80. I highly recommend this product to anyone who is considering purchasing it.",

Get used to how much space there is around the sides when it is perfectly aligned. This can make it easier to install it once the adhesive is exposed. The only area I could suggest an improvement is in the optional adhesive buttons. If they were higher quality that'd be really nice. They feel pretty cheap.",

Seriously consider purchasing these, because it is more of an investment instead of having to replace broken screens for hundreds of dollars.

It did NOT make it easier to see the screen outdoors. And In a short time it started loosening at the edges. I let the company know and questioned what I could do to fix the problem. I did get a response, but Tech Armor had too many steps for their suggested replacement and I didn't have the time, or desire, to deal with it, and there was no mention that it should perform better outdoors. My choice - I tossed it",
