Do it wrong, and you will have to make new ones, because taking it apart to correct this would be a pain. Other sections too. It is versatile, in that you can put whatever stuff you like on it.

I\u2019m afraid I just wasted almost $400 and 5 hours of my times. Also pieces came in damaged, and they were painted over with white... so seems like they shipped it out that way. Also I am a small female so it\u2019s not like I am drilling into the materials. Furthermore I have assembled a lot of furniture- the instructions don\u2019t have words, very confusing and not clear causing the assembly to be near impossible.",

It wasn't so damaged that it couldn't be assembled, but I will have to touch up several areas with paint to cover dings and cracks.

Overall it looks nice, but I'm not sure I'd buy from this company again.",

One of the feet was per-drilled from the wrong end and I didn't notice until too late. I turned a screw into it and it split in half.",

Solid wood- and pretty easy construction- just make sure you have space to spread out and follow the pictures closely.",
