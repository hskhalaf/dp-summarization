Negatives include not having adequate over-sized wax paper included (can be purchased separately), also the knob on top is difficult to press with force. The product could be improved by making the patty size 6\" instead of 4\"--the burgers shrink so much that we just use slider buns. It is nice to be able to press a whole bunch of patties and freeze them in bags with serving size bunches. The patties remain thin enough that if they are frozen or partially frozen, they can still be fully cooked with ease.",
