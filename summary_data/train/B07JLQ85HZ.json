First time my kid peed the bed she was near the edge. WARRANTY DOESNT COVER THE EDGE. Warranty only covers the surface. Useless. I ordered these this time. They are exactly the same as the $100 ones. There's no crunching sound, they're a soft terry cloth like material with a waterproof backing. Kids have peed on them, sadly, 4 times now. Doing well in wash too. This is all you need to protect your mattresses.",

It\u2019s the perfect size, snug but not hard to get on the mattress.. also, My mattress is about 1 1/2 feet tall and this protected still has plenty of fabric to tuck under. It could definitely fit around a standard box spring AND mattress. (The gray part of my bed is the frame)",

To my relief, it did not allow anything to seep through- I am 100% pleased and would recommend this.",

No stain or smell left behind. As for softness, its perfectly comfortable, in fact I think it's made my bed cooler. However, it does make some noise. About as much noise as a 1980s taffeta prom dress. So not too bad. I've not washed it in the machine yet. But I'm pleased with it so far.",
