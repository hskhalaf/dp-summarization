Note of advice: If you get size large or bigger, put it together outside since once together it does not fit though most doorways.",

The stubs aren't threaded so there is nothing for the wing nut to grasp so the flaps fell off on day two and the wing nuts are lost somewhere in the straw that I put in the house.

The house went together very quickly and with little effort for one person, but two people would make the roof connection easier. One comment someone made was they though it was flimsy and coming out of the package I see what they mean but when you have it all assembled its very sturdy. I fastened it to a raised plywood base for insulation and to make access easier for my dog to get in and out. Great product and great price. Thanks, Rich",

It was relatively easy to put together and looks just as good as it does in the picture. The flaps at the opening are very cheap and fell apart very easily. One of the flaps I was never able to get connected correct as the hardware provided would not stay in place. I ended up just removing the flaps as they looked ugly all torn up. Good house if you are not looking for something insulated and do not care about the opening flaps.",

It is made out of plastic but it's pretty tough, my 10 month old husky has been trying to bite it any chance given. I would recommend for anyone who has a heavy chewer dog.",

However, our athletic 35 lb beagle likes to jump on its roof, which then separates and has to be reattached by DH. Doors/edges not \"dog proofed\" against chewers. A simple metal strip around door would prevent chewing on the plastic, I think. It is also very light-weight. We live in middle TN, but our moderate winds during rain, as well as the dog herself, easily move the house around the kennel. I think this company gave a good effort, but should consider building only for very small docile dogs. Will go back to a wood dog house when this needs to be replaced.",
