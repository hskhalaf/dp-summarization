Seemed to struggle as if dull but then proceeded with average pressure to wobble then totally bend. May be a quality control issue since the other three I have used have performed as expected under far more stress. Will update if Dewalt responds or if the remaining bits also struggle.",

Still going strong after 50 some holes (use of anchors and screws with picture hangers and right angle hooks into anchors for hanging pots and pans etc.). Liked the variety and lengths as in some cases I needed the full length of the drill bit. Slow and steady and the holes were perfect. Nice snug fit for anchors. Wish they made the packaging friendlier for opening and reusing, but an Exacto worked fine to open for easier removal and storage. Must be an anti-theft thingy.",
