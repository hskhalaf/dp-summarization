As with all wireless chargers, you need to place the device centered on the ring. On this charger it's indicated by a stamped ring pattern. With practice, this becomes automatic. If your phone/device doesn't come with wireless charging, there are aftermarket add-ons that are little more than a sticker with wires. I'm using a converter on my Pixel with no problems other than it blocking the USB port when I want to d/l pictures to my computer.",

You do have to pay attention when you lay it down, and make sure you have it in the right position. All that involves is looking at your phone and making sure the charging screen comes up.

Less cables in the kitchen and less clutter. No issues with the product and we've been using for 2 months.",

We leave it on our kitchen counter top and when we have guests or my Wife forgets to charge the night before, they just toss it up there for a while. I was also surprised that even with a wallet case for my phone, this still penetrated and charged. Overall great buy",
