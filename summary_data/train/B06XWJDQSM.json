Would have liked them to come with a carrying case. Found and ordered one separately that they fit in. Overall, I'm happy with the earbuds. They're my go-to for sound.",

I would be less frustrated if their website actually helped you understand why this happens but there is next to no information on the skullcandy site.

The problem with the battery is that if you are moving around, it shifts to one side or the other, pulling on the opposite earbud.

      "text": "I received these headphones a WEEK ago. Honestly, they were working really well and I was happy with the purchase. Sound quality was really good, the only thing I could complain about was the battery life - it lasted only 2-3 hours before needing to be charged again. And I found that if not charged all the way it was worse (if it was at 20% it would die within 10 min). When I tried charging it one day, the red charging light no longer came on and it no longer charged. I used the charging cable given with the earphones so I'm not sure what happened. They don't last save your money.",

Only time they dont fall off is if I'm listening to music laying down. I almost lost them out side running errands cuz they fell off.",
