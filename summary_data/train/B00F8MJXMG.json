There is a visible mist that you can see coming from the top when you turn it on. Even on it's lowest setting you can see it. It really makes the air bearable in the winter time when often times the air becomes very dry here in North Texas. When you use the Vick's Vapor pads it emanates throughout the room(in a good way) and will make the air even easier to breathe in.",

When turned on high, could easily see moisture being pushed into air. This is 'cool' mist, and seems to work very well. Would recommend this to others. Regarding the VapoPads - we did try the samples provided with the unit, and didn't think it added much. Do not recommend the VapoPads.",

The first night we used the rub and the pads in the humidifier, we thought she wasn't sick anymore. Huge difference. Two nights later, we forgot to put the rub on, but figured we were OK because we put the pads in. They seemed to have zero effect. Next night, rub, cough gone. Conclusion - OK humidifier, but not worth the money. Did I mention how ridiculously expensive those pads are?",

Be careful using the scent packs around animals.. meaning probably don\u2019t if they\u2019re in the room. Works well however so I\u2019m not too disappointed.",

No salt, no waiting for the steam to come out, no putting a towel down so the machine doesn\u2019t spit water all over the floor while trying to make steam. And because it\u2019s cool, the vapor doesn\u2019t burn if you get too close to it. Perfect for someone who has kids or pets. I would recommend closing the door to whatever room you\u2019re using this in, though. It is more effective that way.",
