Battery life seems good. A little bulky, perhaps, and mounting isn't perfect, but it gives you options of clip-on vs. permanent. The curve in the permanent mount doesn't fit my helmet, but a hammer and punch might fix that. I'm giving 5 stars because, while not perfect, at this price point it's dang good.",

Only took me less than 10 min. to get both headset paired and ready for use. The sound quality is fairly decent for the price being more than half off some of the name brand out there. I have a 3/4 helmet and the sound was still loud enough to hear. But have to have the visor down to able to talk. I guess that would be standard for all headset..LOL. I would recommend this headset for anyone. Good price for the quality.",

The good is that the buttons are big and easy to find and use with winter gloves on, and it uses non proprietary micro USB for charging and 3.5mm audio.",

Easy to set up and well worth the money. Highly recommended for a quality, cost effective basic intercom system.",

Crystal clear mic and speaker sound quality is better than anticipated although not top of the line. Allows some road sound if wanted, which is nice because I don't want to be 100% isolated from road noise. Also has FM receiver built in which is awesome. Haven't tried intercom yet but I don't think I'll use that feature much anyway. Changing songs, pausing music and turning on/off is super easy and simplifies the phone situation on the bike alot.

I followed up by plugging a known good pair of speakers into the unit, and that sounded like crap as well.
