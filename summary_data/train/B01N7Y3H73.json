They need to ridge up the cup because it will slip out of your hand easily if wet and held upside down to place on the base. That's a design flaw they should have caught and would cost them nothing to fix. Whenever I find design flaws, I wonder what else they overlooked.",

My smoothie this morning did not have any clumps of frozen fruit - truly a smoothie! I will update my post if it fails to perform long term.",

Definitely very happy with this buy!! Only used it once, I'll try to come back and update in a few months. First thing: all the reviews are right - this thing is LOUD!!! Plug your ears loud. Seriously. My toddler was scared and ran away also lol But it's easy to clean, suctions to your counter top. I'm looking forward to using it everyday for lunch smoothies!",

I wash the cup and the blade every morning after use with very hot water and liquid detergent and 2-3 times a week I run it through the dish washer. I have even poured vinegar onto the lid and let it sit for 15 minutes. And you know what, it still smells like ROAD KILL, seriously. $80 down the drain. Disgusting.",

Leaving it in the RV I miss it at home. I like using this for smoothies much better than my large ninja blender. Simpler to clean and very quick. I did purchase the 32oz bottle so I can make smoothies for both myself and husband at the same time.",
