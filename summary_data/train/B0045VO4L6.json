I thought I was ordering two and even then, this was overpriced for two. I became suspicious when I had to sign for the bread at the door. I have never had anything stolen. I plan to eat the bread and enjoy it but unless I win the lottery, this will be a one time purchase.",

I wish the company itself would put this bread in many more regular stores at a fair price.",

It's not 2010 anymore, Udi's. Are you even trying? Have you done literally ANY market research?? I don't understand how Udi's is EVERYWHERE when they produce this garbage and brands that make awesome GF bread like La Brea are so hard to find.",

But they hadn't, and thus began my love affair with Udi's bread. My husband doesn't have celiac disease but he still loves this bread. The only reason he doesn't eat it all the time is because of the expense. The ends/heels of this bread can be hard so I grind them up in my food processor and freeze them for later use in recipes that call for bread crumbs. Highly recommended!",

It is good enough that my wife and kids actually love eating it. They say that, while it is a little different than regular bread, they very much like it.
