I bought this for home use, I have about 1200 sq feet of linoleum flooring, and for that task, this is perfect. It would be ideal for small office restrooms, hair stylists, professional offices, waiting rooms. If you are looking for something for restaurant, production facilities, or other larger scale operations, this bucket and wringer will be too light duty to last very long. For that, step up to something labeled \"industrial\".... Pros: Light weight, maneuverable, quality no-mar wheels, functional design, easy pour to empty. Cons: Light weight.",

Very good quality, sturdy build, rolls easily but the wringer only gets 4 stars. No place to hold mop so I added a mop holder to it. Works great. Bought at Home Depot for $1.98 ( Model # 24215) and installs in less than 5 minutes. Simply drill two pilot holes first and install. Very sturdy and a convenient place to store mop (dry first). Just be sure when mop is pulled out, rubber holder is straight across (pic 2)",

The product seems to be sturdy enough for home use. Assembly was no problem. You simply install the casters and place the pre-assembled wringer unit on the bucket, done. I would suggest once you have tapped in the 4 white plastic spacers into the bucket for the casters, you add a very slight amount of dish soap to the caster stem before you insert it into the plastic spacer. It will make installing the casters much easier. Overall very pleased with the product.",
