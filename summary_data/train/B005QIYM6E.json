I researched and found people have been adapting this pump to their pools... it was not just exclusive to the Intex Brand. For almost half the cost.... and for a stronger pump... this is the way to go!! All hoses were the same size and we were able to hook it up with little effort. The weight of the output hose was heavier than the old one, so we used zip ties for extra support.",

Repaired new fitting with tape. few weeks later anther leak, lost another 500 to 800 gallons. Not sure the pump will last 3-4 seasons as others have said. Biggest issue is with the fittings constantly re-tightening and leaking water or sucking air. Would highly recommend coming up with your own heavier fittings. Will see how long pump last.",

Doesn't matter either way as both work fine. I just preferred the toggle switch because it was easier to use for where I have it located.",

It does work and turns the water real well for our pool but will it last?",
