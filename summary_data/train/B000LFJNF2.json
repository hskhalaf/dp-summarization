Dual injected rubberized and textured battery covers are comfortable to hold onto. 2 NiMH rechargeable batteries. You can see when batteries are done charging with two LED indicator lights.",

I then put AA batteries into the controllers so I could play the WII. So basically I spent $39.00 dollars for nothing. I would return the items but had to destroy the packaging to open.",

A few weeks after getting it, one battery pack just stopped holding a charge and would only show one bar of power left if it did try to recharge. About 3-4 months after that the other one stopped working and would just die after a minute of use. Not only that, they were a pain to get to charge, as the controllers would have to be in precise position to charge. Do yourself a favor and look at regular rechargeable batteries. You'll be better off on avoiding headaches with this junk.",

      "text": "This is our second Nyko charging station, which is a GOOD thing. We purchased our first about 5-6 years ago. The batteries have lasted that long! Great performance and easy to use, I highly recommend this. The only reason I bought a new station and batteries, is because it was about the same price as buying the batteries by themselves. Nothing is wrong with our first charging station, but now we have an extra. Sure saves a lot of money on batteries.",

This kit contains the 2 rechargeable batteries for the 2 remotes that come with the WII system. We bought an extra remote which does not come with the rechargeable battery pack, so it uses regular AA batteries. Needless to say, the AA batteries never last long so we rarely use the third remote. The WII Charger works fantastically and the battery pack holds a longer charge as well.",

Then gravity takes its course and the back of the controller touches the metal charging section of the charger. Seems to hold the charge pretty well. I've had this product for about 2 months.",

We're not hard core gamers but do play almost every day for at least 30 minutes. We've had this product about 1 month and only charged remotes twice. We don't put them on it every day to prevent over charging but when the batteries start to look low, we stick them on when we're done playing. Works great!!!",

It literally took me 5 minutes to do all of that and these worthless chargers went from blue leds (means charging in progress) to green leds (meaning fully charged) in 2 minutes???? I messed with them for 5 minutes trying to get em to stay blue and actually charge the dead batteries.................NOPE...worthless chargers (or batteries)????. After looking at mostly positive reviews I figured i'd take a chance on these. SHAME ON ME!!!",
