I have to admit I was not happy to have to switch because I loved those tires but I am pleasantly surprised by these wheels so far! About 200 miles in - nice smooth ride!!! Hopefully when it comes time for new tires again, I can find these as I will most definitely buy again!!",

And I like the puncture resistance which reduces my worries of a flat, though I do have a spare inner tube in case of emergency. After several hundred miles as of 8-28-18, everything is fine. I weigh around 150 lbs, the bike around 19 lbs, grand total maybe 180 lbs if include clothing, gear, and hydration. All riding is on roads, mostly asphalt, occasional concrete. I will try to remember to update this post with tire lifetime mileage.",

    "title": "Vittoria Rubino Pro G+ Road Tire",
    "description": "The Vittoria Rubino Pro is probably one of the most popular tires off all time. Few other tires come even close to matching the Rubion Pro in weight, durability, all-around performance and grip. But Vittoria is never one to rest on their laurels, which is why when they came up with the G+ IsoTech concept for the Corsa tire, it was only a natural extension to flow that technology down to the Rubino. The result is that one of the best all-around tires has now become even better. The all-new Vittoria Rubino Pro G+ road tire brings the same handling and durability you (and everyone else) loved about the original, but now has a graphene carbon compound mixed into the rubber layup for increased mileage, puncture resistance and durability. That all sounds great, but the G+ compound goes even one step further and improves the cornering grip and rolling resistance as well. Combine that with a 3C three-compound rubber layup which helps give the different areas of the tire different handling properties, and a thicker tread with a high TPI casing, and you now have one of the best all-around performing tires ever. So whether you're a \"super-commuter\", putting in some big miles, or even racing, the Vittoria Rubino Pro G+ is a tire that lets you do it allG+ compound adds graphene to the tire rubber for better wear life and puncture resistance, as well as less rolling resistance and superior corning grip 3C four-compound layup gives you three different rubber compounds for different handling properties Thicker tread and supple casing improve puncture resistance and ride feel Easy and convenient clincher tire",
