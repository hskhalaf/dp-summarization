And we all know how rough this world can be at times. So I just did away with the security bar. 2cnd the wall mounting holes are on 16 inch centers, top and bottom. Very convenient. I pre drilled a little bit larger hole to keep the wood from splitting. 3rd, very easy to put together. Very nice product for the price. I'm happy",

I deepened it about 3/16\" with a vibratory cutter and a half moon blade. I did have to alternate guns with scopes with those that don't. With our fall seasons I needed rifle/shotgun and black powder ready and this rack saved me looking for the right one as I like to have things ready to go and sighted in on a moments notice.",

The finish is good but the pine is soft so you have to be careful not to damage it during assembly. A few of the holes did not line up so I had to use my cordless drill to correct that problem. Be prepared to use your own screws or anchors to hang the rack. Cabela\u2019s carries the same rack for a higher price. I had a hard time finding a three or four gun rack so the bottom line is I am very happy this American Furniture Classic 840 Gun Rack.",

The saw doesn't sit flush against the unit, but does stay closed when locked, so it's not a functional issue, just annoys me. Also could be my error because some of the holes were not drilled so you had to figure out where they went to line up. Overall though, I am very happy with product.",
