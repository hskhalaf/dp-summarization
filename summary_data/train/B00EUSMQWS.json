I love the material and design. The ear pieces are not quite tight enough; you'll need to be constantly adjusting them if you're moving around at all. This does not bother me because I'm sedentary when using them for music and/or games. I don't think I could use them for exercising, though.",

I am also very good at trashing headphones and have only had these a short while so it will be interesting to see how long they last , that said the construction is pretty sturdy and battery life is really good",

In the wireless headphone landscape, which is surprisingly sparse, these are standouts: compared to Bose (oversized), Beats (overpriced), Harmon-Kardon (also gigantic) and some other generic Best Buy experiments (low quality), these fit the bill. They have everything - great sound, comfort, uninterrupted connection and style. Unlike most wireless headphones, they aren't bulky, the controls are seamless and they even fit my notoriously small head (and snugly inside a small messenger bag). My non-audiophile assessment is that my privates rock... (sorry)! Oh and the video sent me over the edge.",

The other thing that surprised me was that they very comfortable on my ears, even with glasses and hearing aids on. I would recommend these head phones any time. Thank you for a great product.",

Only real complaint I have is that the volume settings are a little wonky. There is no middle point for volume with the headset - swiping up at a certain point is too loud, and swiping down results in audio that is too quiet. Considering you can hand-adjust the volume on your device, it's only a minor nuisance, but still a bit of a nuisance all the same. Granular volume control would be nice. Also seem to hiccup/skip every once in a while for no (immediately) apparent reason. Would recommend them for comfort, price, and general reliability.",

I do not know how to explain it other than I get the same sound from 12 dollar headphones. If you are buying this for your kids it is perfect, the ear pads do not cover your entire ear so it would fit a smaller head nicely. Unfortunately I am going to give mine away to someone in my family who would appreciate it more than I can.",

First, the cord stopped working so I had to hold it in a certain position to get any quality sound. Then I used them wirelessly, which worked great until the right ear just stopped working and you could hear the parts just shuffling around in there. I don't put my headphones through any serious wear and tear, so they shouldn't have been rendered useless in this short a time. I'm extremely disappointed because I know these would've been my go to since I liked the sound quality for the price.",

I typically have these on when I work and I have to give my ears a break after a bit so they can recuperate. I've even left them stretched out over a box for a day and it didn't help. It's a shame I can't keep listening to these headphones as long as I'd like because I do enjoy the sound it produces.",

    "title": "Outdoor Tech OT1400 Privates - Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Touch Control (Black)",
    "description": "Color:Black| Product Packaging:Standard Packaging\n\nOUTDOOR TECHNOLOGY OT1400 PRIVATES HEADPHONES\nTHE FREEDOM OF TOUCH CONTROLLED BLUETOOTH\nThese are the Privates, Outdoor Tech's touch control Bluetooth wireless headphones. They feature a touchpad interface on the right earpiece that allows you to change tracks and control volume with the swipe of a finger, built-in call functionality, a 3.5 mm AUX jack for plug-in capability and a tough canvas wrap around the headband. The Privates are better-looking than a glass of scotch after that middle-seat flight between Sweaty Mister Johnson and Screaming Baby Timmy and more convenient than a twelve gauge when the zombies end up at your house.\n\nFULLY WIRELESS, FULLY PORTABLE\nThe Privates cordless headphones wirelessly connect with your smartphone, tablet, laptop, or any other Bluetooth enabled device, and operate via a touch pad on the right earpiece. Simply swipe your finger left or right to skip tracks and up or down to change volume. The Privates stream crystal-clear audio for a range of up to 32 feet for 10 hours on a single charge. So yes, you can put your phone on one side of a river, take a boat across and listen to music on the other side, but in all honesty that's not a very good story or an effective use of your time.\n\nBUILT-IN CALL FUNCTIONALITY\nWhen connected to your phone, the Privates' built-in microphone allows you to make and receive hands-free calls from anywhere, anytime. One press of the multifunction button allows you to answer or hang up a call without ever touching your phone, so you can use your hands for more important things, like digging for treasure.\n\nTHE SKY IS THE LIMIT\nThe Privates Bluetooth headphones come with lots of extra little features. A 3.5 mm auxiliary jack allows you to use them in situations that don't allow for Bluetooth connectivity, like on an airplane or with a non-Bluetooth device. This port also lets you use them if you forgot to charge them. The Privates also project a fuel gauge onto your device that actively tells you how much juice you've got left. Integrated hinges allow you to fold and stow your Privates when they are not in use. Swivel ear pads make for the most comfy headphone out there. Finally, they come with a signature ODT carry pouch. Details count. You don't get a toy with your Happy Meal just arbitrarily.\n\n\n\nDETAILS. DETAILS. DETAILS\n * 40 mm drivers for clear mids and solid bass Real, real comfortable ear pads \n * Built-in microphone for making and receiving calls \n * Only ONE button (yes, really). The rest is touch control, pretty cool \n * Foldable and flexible \n * Works with any Bluetooth-enabled device \n * Bluetooth version 3.0 \n * Battery level \"fuel gauge\" displayed on source device \n * 3.5 mm AUX jack \n * Play Time: 10 hours \n * Package Includes: USB to micro-USB charging cable, 3.5 mm to 3.5 mm color-matched cable and signature ODT carry pouch",
