      "text": "The device works very well. I just used it for a presentation in a fairly large room to a group of 80 people, and it boosted my weak voice nicely without feedback, which was my only concern. The device ran at full volume for an hour lecture, and seems to have plenty of power left. The headset band is a bit small for my big head and hair. The photo shows the device on my pant, just a white ring really, and the headset with the band buried in my hair. This is a really great aid for doing presentations or running meetings, particularly if one is having trouble with one's own vocal volume.",

It took a short time to charge it and then figured the volume since it does have feedback. I just use the clip to the belt since I am in bed or in a large chair. It has so many other features that my son (who is a musician) was impressed. My family and friends are thrilled since they don't have to sit as close and ask me to repeat myself.",

      "text": "Worked well the first time I used it. But when setting it up the second time, I got the microphone too close to the loudspeaker. That caused the usual very loud feedback-squeal. But the squeal suddenly stopped and the Amplifier was dead. The amplitude of the squeal was too much for the electronics to handle and the circuit failed. I later learned that this is a common problem with this sort of amplifier. Put the mike on your head and the speaker in place (not too close to mike) before turning on the power! The new one I got made a big point of this in the instructions.",

So bring your back up charger with you, and know you may have to pause use of it until it is recharged. Other than that, pretty good.",

It's no substitute for good breathing and speaking technique, and you still have to train yourself not to shout or strain the vocal muscles when you hear the background noise level rise, but it certainly allows you to use resting volume and still be audible. Haven't tried the other functions yet, but the battery lasted through my entire first week of classes and only gave out the Thursday of the second week. Great value for money.",

The battery lasts through a full day of teaching; we have yet to drain it completely.
