This walker was easy to put together(match the letters to the letters). For 3 plus weeks, I leaned alot of my weight on this walker and there was never a problem. I felt very comfortable regarding the walker's ability to support me as I moved about. I did not use any wheels, however, I did use plastic sleds on the back legs which made it easier to slide across all surfaces. This walker did it's job wonderfully. Excellent quality and at a good price.",
