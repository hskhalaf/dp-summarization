Had multiple friend's, loggers, recommend Stihl brand. Should have listened. Husqvarna was appx $100 less for comparable (we thought) product. Not worth the downtime and headache. Sad. :(",

I tried to reset the clutch as others have done using brake handle. The clutch plate barely gripoed the handle gear so the handle gear plastic stripped out. It should be metal gear on brake handle as a a backup for resetting the clutch plate.",

Oregon chain stayed sharp for an incredibly long time, once re-sharpened, it is staying sharp for a long time again. Something weird about chain installation on the saw. After installing original (junk) chain and Oregon chain, the saw wouldn't start. A dealer had to get it started both times. Once I got the right brand chain and the dealer got it running, it has been working good ever since.",
