Now all the pieces can live on the fridge!",

We have 2 daughters and a son so this isn't a problem for us because having a 1 year old boy running through the house naked evading his diaper change, they know what a penis is haha but important for adults who may not want their daughters learning about penises in preschool or vice versa.",

My only complaint, as is with all these Melissa & Doug play sets are the fact that they don't ever have a lid and therefore lend themselves to some serious closet spills and messes. The use of wood rather than plastic is also nice and makes this a bit more durable and eco friendly.",
