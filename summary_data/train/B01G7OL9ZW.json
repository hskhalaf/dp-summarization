I can only imagine the smaller pieces are in my stomach now. How on earth this filter can just disintegrate like that is beyond me.",

It's super easy to start and set, and we especially like the \"keep warm\" button that holds it at our preferred temperature for 2 hours. My only complaint is a minor one: I wish it would remember the previously set temperature when it's turned on, instead of always starting at 212. But I look forward to using this for a long time, and would definitely recommend it (especially if you can get it on sale like we did)!",

We boiled water for tea and rice and noodles and cleaning projects. The Stay Warm feature meant that we could start the water boiling, run down the street to the neighbors\u2019 house, and return to hot water ready for tea. After 2 years, the filter fell out. After 3 years and 9 months, leaking began. Now, there is no heat. I just read reviews for 20 other kettles on Amazon, and nothing compares to you. <3",

Also nice that I can set on lower settings for my daughter's oatmeal in the morning so it takes less time to cool. I am very very happy that I bought this kettle. I have had it for 2 weeks now and I use it several times every day. It actually does make the tea taste better when I use the lower temps for green or herbal teas. Of course the auto shut off is great so I never have to worry about boiling over. Highly Recommend!",

      "text": "After sorting through all the electric kettles I picked this one. It has all the features I wanted including multiple temperature settings and a keep,warm function. I've been using it for a little over a week now and it had been preforming perfectly, I've measured the actual temperatures and they are holding within a couple of degrees of the set temp. All in all, this is a great kettle at a great price. The shipping was very fast (Prime) and it arrived in great shape. I'm very happy with this purchase.",
