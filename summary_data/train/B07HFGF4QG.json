We walked all over the ski village and trekked through plenty of snow and no issue with water getting in or feet getting cold. Just to clarify I wasn't walking through the back country just walking though the ski town and walking in snow that was just a few inches deep and for that purpose they were great. Also didn't have any issues with them slipping on ice, will be using them again next season.",

My one concern is the quality of leather and stitching but time will decide that. Overall a great boot at a price that can't be beat (I got them for under $30)",

If I try to walk any real distance in these the bottoms of my feet hurt. So far the only good thing is that they keep the water out. They also keep sweat in, so you have to put them by a fan or heat source to dry after wearing them or they develop an odor.",
