HOWEVER, after only a dozen or so carafes/cups of coffee, the water reservoir leaks and floods the countertop and floor (it has buckled our hardwoods as it leaked a carafe+ of water that sat on the wood overnight). So, we can't use the timer any longer because the coffee/tea must be brewed manually to prevent leaks. Not a fan so we will be replacing it with something that won't cause a few hundred dollars in damage to our floors. If I could return this device, I would.",

The ice tea choices, iced coffee choices, and all the rest, yes, I have tried them all. Drinking them you feel you just order from a coffee shop.
