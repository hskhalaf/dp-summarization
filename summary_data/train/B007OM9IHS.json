Fit into my lightweight, small, nearly empty backpack without being too cumbersome or throwing the weight off balance as I walked. The photos on the listings of this product and the rigger's axe are mixed up, the carpenter's hatchet is all steel with blue on the handle only, while the riggers has blue paint up the neck of it. Riggers axe is longer and has a waffle face in the hammer while this Carpenter's Hatchet is a smooth face. All in all great product and maintains it's edge!",

It is perfect for doing this, at least in this novice axe throwers opinion. It is well balanced, a good weight, solid and the rubber handle provides good grip. Being a solid, single piece axe means I will never have to worry about the head coming loose or falling off.",

I always liked the design and the way it worked. I needed a hammer and, on looking around, found that the Estwing design, from 1923 is still being manufactured. Naturally I bought one, and was so taken with the idea of owning something of such classic and proven design that now I own practically a complete set of Estwing leather handled tools. You can't buy an American made \"Perfect Handle\" wrench or screwdriver anymore, but Estwing keeps right on making their striking tools to the same standard as when they designed their original 90 years ago.",
