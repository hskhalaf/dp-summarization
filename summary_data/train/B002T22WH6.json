She really likes snacks, so whenever I find something in a flavored chewable, I try it. While she doesn\u2019t like these as much as her other snack/vitamins, she will eat them. They seriously work (or I have lost my sense of smell due to the onslaught of IBD poop). I wish I could knock off half a star b/c she doesn\u2019t gobble them, but I think rounding down would be really harsh considering how well they work.",

      "text": "I have one cat and can't really hide our liter box due to the layout of our house. There was a noticeable decline in liter box odors after our cat had these treats daily for about two weeks. Originally I gave the cat 2-3 treats every day. After about two weeks, I tapered off to the same number of treats but only once a week. Still same favorable results. They're definitely worth trying out.",

Is it because they are young? Even at this young age they are very smelly. The ONLY way I have been able to get one of them to finally eat this chew was mix it in with their meal. They mostly ignore it, even picking it out of the rest of the food. But eventually and still hungry, one went back and ate them. Not sure if this will continue to work. But, quite disappointed. Will have to look for something else.",
