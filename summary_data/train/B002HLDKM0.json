      "text": "I originally purchased this as a Christmas present for my mom a few years ago. She's not super techy but needed speakers to play her iPod shuffle when she had guests. It also travels easily. I recently purchased one for myself to use in my office/craft room and to take with me to scrapbooking crops and other events that allow me to play music for a small group. At the time I purchased it, it was on sale for $19 dollars and I could kick myself for not buying an additional one for our guest room and my office.",

      "text": "I bought this to take on vacation and also bought a male/male audio adapter because previous reviewers complained that they were not able to manipulate the volume controls satisfactorily. The adapter allows you to use the volume control on your iDevices rather than the one on the speaker. While I don't find the volume control on the speaker as horrible as some of the reviewers have said, the adapter really does improve the performance for an extra $2. Overall the speaker is light and small and puts out decent sound at a small price. I'm happy.",

It was not labeled just for \"iPod.\" It also charged my iPhone while it was inserted into the dock playing my iPod on my iPhone. I was disappointed that this device did not charge my iPhone while iPod was docked and playing. Even though the speaker in the older model was \"busted\" -- I assume from playing it too loudly -- I have retained it to use as a charger for my iPhone. All else is satisfactory in this newer version.",

I'v also used both in the car (on the passenger seat)and they were OK. For the rest of the house I like the Bose Sounddock.",

My daughter's iTouch fits fine in the dock but if you move the speaker or accidentally brush it, the darn thing stops playing and you have to start it again. Kind of annoying. I do like the fact that you can dock it with or without the cover. I also think it's a little pricey for what you get. I got it before Christmas at a much lower price.

So to avoid the hassel of returning it I just brought it into my office. Also the blue light for the clock is irritating and bright, I had to put a cloth over it.
