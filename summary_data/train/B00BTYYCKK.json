Wahl back in the day used metal or aluminum for shavers and such which I use.

The price and value is great. It has multiple attachments and various speeds, which allow you to have more/less pressure. The nice thing about this one is when you press harder it doesn't stop (other ones get weaker or stop all together when you apply more pressure). It also doesn't vibrate your hand too much. You should give this a try, I think you will like it. Thanks for making a good massager!",

If the deep tissue is on your back, you cannot get both hands back there to press hard enough. Also, I have a well padded bottom (fat buttocks) and even on high pressing with both hands, it doesn't do much for it.
