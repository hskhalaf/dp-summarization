      "text": "Bought this thinking it would be a great 'manly' diaper bag for my husband. The material is durable and easy to clean; there is plenty of space and lots of pockets, but the zippers are terrible. First one I ordered, one zipper would jam and split open every single time you used it, luckily it wasn't the main pocket so we just didn't use that pocket while waiting for the replacement. When the replacement arrived one of the zippers stuck often but a little patience and it would work again but then it too started jamming and splitting. So I returned it and decided on a different backpack. Sad because I really liked this one.",

I ended up returning it and purchasing the all gray one and that one was MUCH better. Zippers work great on it! The other comment I have is even when the bag is completely empty, it isn't the lightest bag in the world ... probably because of all the layers and padding needed to make so many pockets. Either way, the replacement bag has been good. Just fair warning that you may get a defective one and need to exchange, BUT amazon does have wonderful customer service and doing that was pretty easy.",

Bag has nice pockets for pretty much all of the essentials one would carry on a long flight - the ipad fit nicely as did some bulky food items. The wipes pocket is VERY handy. The two sidepockets held a flask of hot water for formula and the bottles to make it in. The thermal pocket held a couple of \"stay cold\" items for the first leg, after which it became the pocket to hold an unfinished bottle while giving breaks to baby. The straps are well thought out - fit the back nicely so your hands were free.",

It has so many compartments that she just leaves her purse at home and tucks away what she needs in this bag.",

The stroller clips on the top are also great to use on shopping carts. The pocket for bottles is insulated. And I gotta say it again...pockets galore! Lack of pockets is something I hated about every other diaper bag I looked at or owned. The back pack style makes it hands-free. Who doesn't like hands-free, right??",

Couldn't zip it because our things wouldn't fit (we take our milk and bottle warmer with us). But with this Jeep backpack diaper bag we can fit EVERYTHING. I also love how I don't have to search and search because every item has its own pocket!",
