All the parts are easy to clean and stack together nicely when not using. We juice a lot of celery and love that we are not heating up the nutrients too much. Along with this product being just what we needed, the company selling it has been really helpful with tips on how to use and checking in to make sure we were satisfied. I would recommend this juicer to anyone looking for a space saving, quiet, and quality juicer!",

This is our second SKG juicer, and this one has some improvements, as well as fewer parts and pieces to clean. Overall, I believe this is a good choice, and a good value for the money.",

The celery pulp is not exactly dry, so I run it back through after juicing. For example, after juicing enough celery to get 20 ounces of juice, running the pulp back through adds another 4 ounces of juice, which is about 20 more. It only takes another 3-4 minutes to do, but I wonder if this would be necessary with the more expensive units. Since this was most I wanted to spend on a juicer, I'll likely keep it.",

I enjoy it and the easy cleaning makes it much less of a hastle. Once you get used to it you can clean it in about 2-5 minutes.",

      "text": "Okay I gave this 3 stars only because its okay, I am a big juicer person, had 3 previous, As far as this one goes, I wouldn't recommend putting whole fruits and veg, without cutting up in smaller pieces even though it says you can, if you are looking for juicing more veg, & greens this is not the juicer for you! takes longer and can Easley gam up. As far as the cleaning goes, this one is easier, and easier to put back together, This on does make the juice taste better if your looking for that as well.",

The leaves get stuck and it\u2019s just not functional. Would be better to just be open. - The bowl for juice has no handle so it\u2019s hard to hold. Overall: The juicer juices well, leaves dry pulp and the juices taste good! For the price, this is a good option.",
