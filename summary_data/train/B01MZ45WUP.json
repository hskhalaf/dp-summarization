We talk about what people do at certain times, to give reference points. Unrelated to the memory issue, he has a hard time reading across/or jumbling the lines and transposes numbers. After the fact, I thought that a scroll of one line at a time (and holding each line for a minute) would be helpful. Maybe it exists - but if not, something to consider!",

      "text": "This clock is amazing especially for someone with dementia. Even thought I don't have dementia I bought it for my bedside clock because when I wake up without my glasses it is sometimes hard for me to see the time on my old clock, not with this one. My sister recommended the clock and once I set it up I told her I had a billboard on my nightstand now (I was just pulling her leg). I wish I would have know about this clock when I was caring for my MIL who had dementia and would ask all day long what day it was or what time it was. Great clock! Large print so it's Super easy to read!",

Six months in and it has fallen farther and farther behind the time on my cellphone. This is a clock for Alzheimer\u2019s patients!!! Last thing they need is a clock that have to dork with. Alternately, one could find a silver lining in the thought that days are actually getting longer....",
