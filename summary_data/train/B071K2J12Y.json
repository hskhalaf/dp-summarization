The orange markings at the head and tail lights and on the mirrors are great because they let you know how to orient the cover on your car. Very smart! It's not 100% waterproof but does a darn good job. I purchased it to keep sap off the car and it works perfectly for that. I recommend and would buy again. - Oh, there's elastic around the bottom front and back which keeps it on snuggly along with \"ties\" that help in windy conditions. Haven't used those yet. The elastic so far has held it in place.",

As brittle as it is, I don't see it standing up to the force of nature. Sitting out in the sun, it would become more brittle. Why didn't they use rubber for the locking mechanism? There's no quality control. It would take a second to lock it before shrinking. I can't comment on fitment or any particular.",

Also, the zipper on the side is useful when you quickly want to get in the car for something. The major problem is that it lasted only about 4 months in the SoCal sun. The cover became too fragile in the sun and ripped easily . Its definitely not water proof either. One or two hours in the rain and your car will be soaked. I know this is a price friendly cover but I expected it to last at least 1 year. Will probably try out a different cover.",

Slightly disappointed that the new one is missing the D rings to secure it under the car in the center. But I cut out patches at the D rings from the old one and my sister-in-law sewed them onto the new one. Should do the job.",
