I was using the Swiffer dust mop daily, but it was too small, took too long and had to change the cloth at least twice. Waste of time and money! Then I decided to go like the pros, I got JinClean\u2019s 24\u201d busy mop. What a great tool! Takes me 10 minutes at the most to do my house! Can a person love a cleaning tool? YES! You can\u2019t go wrong with this product!",
