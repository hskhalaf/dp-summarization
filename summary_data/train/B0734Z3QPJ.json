So it fits and works great. The issue is the base is slippery, you have to hold it down when you remove the phone. It slides on every surface too, so I think they need to improve the bottom rubber. It also needs a concept to pull the phone out with needing to use two hands. When you pull the phone out of the charger, of course the whole stand comes with it.",

It comes with its own cable, but know that it won't fit an Apple USB-C cable (hence the 4-star review as I was hoping for that). I'm able to charge my iPad 7 with its case on, which is really nice. It is a little flimsy with an iPad on it, but as long as you're not moving it too much it's fine. It's great with an iPhone, very sturdy then. I wouldn't use it with an iPad pro, though.",

I like the mechanics of the back - that you can adjust the depth of support, the cord catcher underneath to have it stay in place, and the various black cord tip \"stays\" for different types of phones with different cases. Unfortunately, the two stays for Lifeproof cases were not allowing the cord tip to perch high enough for my Lifeproof case, so I will write to Rerii to send me two more (perhaps they were flawed.) Overall, though, I really like my stand!",

      "text": "A total disappointment. You can't remove your phone with one hand, because it will up root the base piece, which is just hanging in the slot like a loose lego. It doesn't even lock into place. And the back screw holding the resting board doesn't even lock into place. Nothing locks into place. This is a very insecure charge stand. It doesn't come as one piece, so it totally misses the point of having charge stands: the convenience of having charger and stand in one consolidated piece. Shoddy little product.",
