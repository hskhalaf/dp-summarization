      "text": "It generally works well - the squueze buttons are a bit awkward, but relatively easy to use; the tube reaches nearly to the bottom, so most of the oil is used; and the poring feature is well placed and balanced. However, the measurements are inaccurate, as the oil pours not just from the reservoir at the top, but also freely from the tube, resulting in major overpours. For example, I measured 1 Tbsp into the reservoir, poured it into a 1 Tbsp measuring spoon and stopped when it was full - which left what registered as 1/2 Tbsp in the reservoir.",
