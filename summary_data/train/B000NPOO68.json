All of the pre-drilled screw holes lined up nicely, the wood in finished in good fashion and is a solid, heavy wood. Rolls easily, 2 wheels have locks on them to prevent unwanted movement. Took about 15 minutes to construct.The only thing I am not sure of is the slide out cutting board but I did not get this for a cutting board, it is perfect to keep my induction cooker on and to store my induction cookware. Probably the best quality import piece of furniture I have seen.",

      "text": "First small issue is it was missing a couple little hole fill knob things. The wheels took an insane amount of force to insert and one wheel holder cracked on insertion - I superglued the crack and it seems to be holding up. Upon close inspection with a flashlight, I could see there was some unextruded plastic in the wheel well housings that I ended up filing out for the other 3 wheels (which all had it somewhat). The wheels clicked in securely with the amount of force expected after that. Also did not include banana peels or tortoise shells so for a Mario cart I was somewhat disappointed but I can overlook that in lieu of the real issues.",

There are cheaper too, but not at this quality. Big enough to place a medium sized microwave on, which is what I use it for. Knife holder is optional, it doesn't need to be installed. Tip - When assembling any kind of piece like this, never fully tighten anything until you have it all together. This gives you the chance to set it up, shift it around, and get it nice and level. Once you've taken as much of the wobble out as you can, tighten.",

My only other complaint is more ascetic than quality related, the wheels supplied belong on an office chair and not this beautiful cart.

We roll the cart across a thick carpet and across the boards of the deck. The wheels can handle the weight and the various surfaces. The product has great craftsmanship and is properly designed. There aren't any hair-line cracks in the board. A great product all in all.",

Built in knife block and slide out cutting board are a nice touch too. I don't move it around much so not sure how long the wheels will hold out if moved a lot but so far so good. The natural wood look is very attractive. Definitely recommend this for small kitchen chefs.",

      "text": "After moving into a smaller apartment, I found myself in need of a small microwave stand. I searched around at several retail stores, but couldn't find anything that didn't seem super cheap and unstable around this price point. Long story short, this particular cart is much, much better quality than the other carts I've looked at in this price range. It looks great, seems very stable, and was easy to assemble by myself. Can't ask for much more for $100. The bottom slats did have some minor separation (only held together with three small nails on each side), but nothing some wood glue couldn't fix. Overall I was pleasantly surprised by the quality.",

The cart looks very cute and is sturdy and stable. Glad we chose this cart!",

It's been outside on our porch for over 6 months (with wind/rain/cold/hot) and it is still in good shape. I would not leave it completely unprotected though as it is not exactly \"treated wood\". Regularly put wood oil on it to keep it in good shape.",

You do need someone to hold the racks in place before you screw them in. Components: Came packed well. The two racks in the bottom were basically strips of wood held together with nails. That is fine bu some of these nails were hammered in poorly and so these strips and loose and pop out easily when you assemble the whole thing. That is my only problem with this. But I guess for the price, its a good deal.",
