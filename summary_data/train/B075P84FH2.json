This makes the unit useless for security. I contacted support frequently and have been referred to Tier 2 support. They have been very responsive but the problem continues.

However, it's now 2019, and we should be getting at least 2 years (and usually more) from a rechargeable battery. Original Review: The Arlo Pro 2 provides marginally better quality over the regular Arlo Pro. While it might meet the technical specifications for 1080p video, it's not in any way the kind of crisp video you might expect from a 1080p Amazon Prime movie. In other words, it's disappointingly blurry. I guess HD video means different things to different people, depending on whether you're buying or selling.",

The batteries drain so fast because of false events makes so inconvenient to a piece of mind. I am always on the latter climbing up and down to remove the charger so it would charge and still sometimes it does sometimes the battery just completely drains where I have to go up there take it down and take the batteries out and start them over. Tired of it!!!!",

The phone app works seamlessly and even allows you to share videos via text and email.

      "text": "Most features won't work without signing up for extra monthly charge service or connected to a POWER cord. Motion detection misses A LOT of motions even at highest sensitivity. Needs constant recharging .. and you must send data to their server . Definitely can't use it as security cameras since most actions are not getting recorded. Even pointing all 3 cameras at one area, they all recorded same 1 or 2 minutes and all missed to record the next few minutes. In short, you will need power cords, need to pay monthly service, need to send data over internet to record and to view, need constant recharging, you will not catch most critical frames.. too many issues.",

      "title": "Great Cameras. Love the Apple Watch Integration UPDATE",
      "text": "I purchase two Arlo Pro 2 cameras to replace two POE cams and love the ease of use plus the Apple Watch integration. I'll get screen shots of motion alerts on my watch. These are very easy to set up and the video quality is very good. 07/16/2020 Update After having these cameras for around 8 months now I've found that it takes them over a minute to connect to see live view. I have two wired and one on battery and gig speed fiber optic internet and wifi coverage is great all around my house. I have one Ring camera still and it connects immediately. Not real happy with these cameras.",
