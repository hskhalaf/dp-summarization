      "text": "AWESOME! One of the best hand tools I've ever had. It arrived just 2 days ago (plus a box of Rapid 5/16\" staples) and I've already installed more than 60 ft of speaker wiring, stapled about 1 per ft to ceiling and baseboard pine molding, and even a few into oak. NOT ONE failed staple! Compared with other staplers: you don't have to push down; just squeeze the trigger; and there's no recoil. I even tested it into the smooth side of Masonite (about the hardest wood product there is), where the staples at least went halfway: most staplers won't even try. You get what you pay for!",

We have a small business and it is surprising how often we need a stapler for hanging up signs and completing various craft projects. The stapler is heavy-duty and feels substantial in the hand. it is easy to load and use, making it the \"go to\" stapler in the shop. I also like that is is much quieter than our Arrow stapler.
