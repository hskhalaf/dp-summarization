The other bands keep the urine away from his skin and/or do not have the same caustic materials in the lining that this one does. Either way, I would never recommend this product to anyone, nor will I buy this brand again.",

The size S are what you need for a dog more than 10 pounds. These work well and are absorbant. There have been no leakage issues. Most of all I appreciate no longer having to clean random pee spots from around the house. These worked well so we ordered a second set of three so there is always a clean one available between laundry days. I recommend having at least six of these doggie pee diapers if you plan on having them on your dog 24/7.",

He goes through 3 a day (I ordered 6), and they have stood up well to daily washing. Since he has a hard time standing or walking even short distances, he is so much less humiliated by not making it outside. As I mentioned, he weighs 80+ pounds, and that's means there's a heavy load of urine in his pants, and there have been absolutely no leaks. One thing I would suggest, is using adult bath wipes, to cleanse your dog's belly between changes. Love this product!!!",

As I go to pull the diaper ends together over my Pom's back, the corner pieces poke his right side (he's facing me) and he lets out a yelp. And runs away! My solution was to sew a doubled-up piece of flannel over the bottom third-ish of that Velcro, to completely cover the pokey Velcro corners. I had 12 diapers. That was a fair bit of work. Unusable over time as those corners got hard and jabby if I hadn't fixed them.",
