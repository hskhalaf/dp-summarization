I don't return very many items, but this is the first time in memory that I was denied a return by Amazon. Again, be very careful buying this software if you intend to import data from another vendor's software.",

I never received a follow-up. After the second tech support failure, I bought TurboTax, re-entered all my tax info, and e-filed immediately. H&R Block is probably still preferable if you're filing by mail given its clarity and lower cost. However, if you're buying the program to e-file, I cannot recommend it.",
