The sofa and love seat we had was real leather and great, but whoever got the loveseat while watching TV could not lay down and be comfortable. We moved those to another room and now, 2 people can be comfortable while watching TV. I would have given this 5 stars, except the bottom fabric is very cheap material, and the back and bottom cushions don\u2019t have velcro and keep sliding forward. Other that that, I am in love with this sofa!!! It\u2019s so comfortable, I\u2019ve fallen asleep on it many times! For the price, what a bargain!",
