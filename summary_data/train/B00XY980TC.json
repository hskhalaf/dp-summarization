Just be careful you don't burn yourself, and it works beautifully. Just thought I'd put it out there if someone was curious. Its very soft and comfortable for a wig, and at such a good price~",

I wouldn't have bought it again if I had known it would be an entirely different wig (The wig came very quickly and in great condition! It is a little shorter than the picture would make you think (that mannequin has a long neck) But the bangs have and extra layer to make them look healthier and not flat, and the wig does well with heat!

It stays on well, but because of the lack of combs, you have to constantly keep adjusting it. My advice if you buy this wig is to have booby pins ready OR fashion combs into this wig yourself. Other than that, great purchase. The hair is soft, it does not tangle (even though there's not much hair to get tangled, i figured i should include that), and it really does look natural. If not for the lack of combs, I'd definitely buy from this company again.",

I did straighten in on low heat and the bangs were super long so I trimmed them. I could have also just done a side sweep with them if I wasn't comfortable trimming, but I have a friend who uses wigs alot and I watched several youtube videos so I gave trimming a shot. But overall I thought this was a good quality wig, didn't get hot when wearing and stayed in place. I used it for St. Patricks day partying.",

Definitely a synthetic wig, but for the price it was perfect for costume use. Only note- it comes with a wig cap which works, but I ended up buying a separate one that worked a lot better (again, I have a ton of hair)",

It's pretty thick as well tho there is a spot on top where the wefts are visible if the hair moves too much so i have to be careful.

Is a Lil shiny, but what synthetic hair isn\u2019t. You can find good,easy, short tips on YouTube to make it Lil less shiny. It curls and crumpled with heat. Make it a little messy to have that natural look. All in all this was a last minute life saver. I\u2019m so happy I got it. Will buy again for sure.",

I straightened some pieces because the hair was all slightly swooped in the same direction. I will update with some pictures once I've modified it a bit more. My goal is to make it as realistic as possible by trimming some of the front to make the bangs fade more naturally into the rest of the hair.",

I was just hoping they wouldn't be so long, since others who reviewed the wig said they didn't have a problem. So I guess depending on your head shape/size and personal preference, you may have to trim them (it's not a big deal, really).
