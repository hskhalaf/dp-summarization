If you intend to cut bread with really tough thick crust, a different model might be better for you.",

The blade felt sharp, but I am looking for sophistication that is sadly not present here. As an aside, I noticed (as others have) that my knife did not have the words Tojiro in English on the blade. Maybe that is a sign of sub par quality? Others have raved about their beautiful knife, so maybe I received a dud?",

In Europe, we had bread slicing machines at the corner grocery and bakery to avoid these problems. I settled on this because it is priced right, looks amazing, and is Japanese. It cuts the bread beautifully, with minimal crumbs. I can get pretty thin, straight slices with ease. I don't know why I didn't buy this earlier as a regular chef's knife is BAD at cutting bread. Make your life easier and buy this knife now.",

But I did immediately cut myself on it while attempting to clean it straight out of the box (and as noted by others, it seems to handle differently than other knives). There was a slight blemish in the blade but at this price I'm not returning it. The stainless steel seems to be somewhat rougher than our other knives so we'll see how it lasts.",

      "text": "Really disappointed by the lack of sharpness. I purchased this as a replacement to my well-loved victorinox, hoping that this knife would demonstrate how dull that knife had become. That's not what happened. I'm sorry I threw out my old knife. I'm unsure if this knife arrived unsharp or became unsharp after only a few days of use, but in any case, a week in, it's dull. If you look at the attached picture, you can see the light refracting off the jagged edge of the blade. Blerg.",
