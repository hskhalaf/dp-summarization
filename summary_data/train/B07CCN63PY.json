He loves showing friends and neighbors his train \"for pooping on the potty\" and carries one just about everywhere he goes. He was fully potty trained within 3 weeks (after about half the box), and was so excited to pick which train design he wanted each time. We started at the beginning of December, and he got the last train at the start of February. Highly recommend if you're looking to try something similar.",

The remainder were duplicates to me, having acquired them in blind bags. For the collector just starting out, its a good way to get a mix quickly. The beach designs are cute, and it was good to see two of the exclusives had different printing on each side, something that has been lacking on recent releases.",

My son loved all the different colors and loved picking which ones he wanted to keep! We also ended up taking these on a 1 night trip as one of his toys to play with in the hotel! They are so tiny which makes them super portable!",
