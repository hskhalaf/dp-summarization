The inside has a waterproof liner, which is great for damp towel/clothes and I imagine will be super easy to clean. I got the navy stripes and I love it! My previous bag had a drawstring at one end and the mat would get stuck and it didn't fit my yoga towel. Now I can put everything in one perfect yoga bag! Check out my pics so you will see that it fits 2 yoga mats, 1 large yoga towel, a water bottle, a block and more. LOVE LOVE LOVE!",

There is enough room for it (big pro mat) and clothes. A block will fit, too, but the bag won't close all the way. It distributes the weight of all the contents very well and is easy to carry with multiple items. For having a giant mat that has never fit in any bag, much less a tote, I am very pleased with this one. And I love the color!",

Problem is this barley fit my lululemon mat length wise near the top of the bag and won't fit laying flat at the bottom.
