This combined with left handed cobalt drill bits did the trick when welding a nut on didn't, drilling out with conventional drills could not get the angle correct without removing engine etc... a nightmare job that this enabled us to complete. I would like a rethink on the trigger design that was easier to modulate and less likely to activate in tight spaces by the tight spaces...not sure how that would be accomplished, so no stars removed.",

Multiple teeth have pretty much crumbled off. The chuck key is only about an inch and a half long and I have never tightened the chuck excessively. I have used ingersol rand air tools for 15 years and always been happy. This is probably counterfeit item which is disappointing as I went out of my way to purchase directly from amazon.",

It is a Jacob's chuck and needs a key to use (again pretty obvious) the fitment of the key to the chuck is kind of leaving more to be desired slips occasionally. Would buy again if it ever breaks but would probably swap chucks. I'm a diesel mechanic for a trash company so I put it through its paces and other than the chuck being a nuisance occasionally I love it",
