Putting it together was pretty easy, it's a two-person job and instructions were easy to follow. Only issue was the width of wine bottle holder. The size holds standard wine bottles, but not a fuller bottle like champagne or bottles from our wine club :( Overall pretty satisfied with purchase.",

Bear in mind that I\u2019m pretty good with my hands, even so this thing was more of a logic puzzle that turned into a piece of furniture once completed. None of the components were labeled, screws were stripped and dowel pins were missing. I was still able to make it work, but it\u2019s not the sturdiest piece of furniture in my house. Still looks cool, but would definitely not recommend and personally will not order something from this seller again.",

The whole time I was assembling it (which took a couple hours) I kept thinking how cheaply made it was.

It cost about $160 so it's probably worth it if you know what you've signed up for.",

However, the assembly instructions are a series of poorly drawn diagrams and its hard to identify similar looking parts. Some of the holes didn't line up properly and the manufacturer forgot to drill a couple of them... some of the mdf panels had to be trimmed to fit.. overall after 2 hours of assembly time it looks good and is a nice sideboard for our dining room...",
