Based on the reviews, I expected an easy to use mashie with delicious output but either my expectations were too high or using it needed some expertise which I lack. The machine is hard to use; it took my some time to make it shave ice. I could not get it to shave fine grained after all, but it was a mixture of shaved and broken peices of ice. Also, I didn\u2019t like the taste of the syrups. So I gave up on it completely after using it a couple of times.",

There's always a small amount of left over ice. Using it one time isnt a problem its when you make a bunch of shaved ice then that little bit of leftover ice adds up to a bunch of unshaven ice...

The Hawaiian Shaved Ice Machine works great - nice powdery ice just like in Haleiwa. It not only cooled me down, but it brought back many good memories.

Crushed ice even from a blender has been too scratchy for him, water hurts, popsicles hurt, etc. He has lived on shaved ice (even without the syrup!) all week long. It works like a charm! Also - I love the fact that you can use regular ice or freeze ice in the little molds they provide. My ice maker broke this week and having those molds on hand saved us until I could get another ice maker.",

I haven\u2019t pushed it to its limit yet, but I made three snow cones within minutes and could have kept going. I did my homework and compared this brand to others and almost all websites/reviews said the \u201cHawaiian Ice\u201d brand was the best. I think it\u2019s a great machine and definitely worth it.",

Super easy to make the ice pucks ahead of time, and keep them in a plastic baggie in the freezer, for an instant treat anytime. We keep the syrups in the fridge, too. The ice comes out fluffy, especially if you leave the pucks out to defrost a little (10 - 15 minutes).",

We have used it almost every night for a good month now. It make fluffy, nice shaved ice. One of the containers of ice makes about three cones. The Hawaiian Shaved Ice Syrup really is superior to other cheaper brands. The machine says it can use regular ice cubes, but I can't imagine that the ice produced would be as fluffy.",
