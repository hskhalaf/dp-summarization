I use 6 at a time while taking 2-3 hour baths and use the remaining tapers for another 3+ hour bath, after which I am left with 3-4 inch stubs to spare for use during power outages. Best of all (at least in my opinion), each candle is NOT individually wrapped in cellophane \u2014 too time-consuming! \u2014 so they are easy to use immediately. The candles arrived well-packaged; not one was broken. Good quality. Great value. Just ordered 3 more boxes. Highly recommend.",

The only downside is that some of the candles in the box arrive broken, but we'll cut those, and use them for shorter candlestick holders on the table.
