If it lasts me 6 months I'd buy it again for $30. I have a hard time finding a good mat that is compact enough not to interfere with my jumping technique yet has enough spring to provide protection from the floor. Yep, sound investment.",

      "text": "Love this mat! I have it under a rowing machine on a ceramic tile floor, and it works great. The rower feels more cushy now than when it was directly on the floor, maybe because it's more secure & doesn't move around at all. Haven't seen any marks on the floor since I started using it, so happy about that, too, as the rower left black marks before. Was worried about the thickness of the mat, as some reviewers described it as thin, but it seems thick enough for my purposes. May not work as well for a heavier piece of equipment, however. Overall very happy w/purchase.",

I pulled it up the other day and kg hardwood eucalyptus floors look perfect. No abrasion or contact points. No sticking or residue.

The mat appears to be well made and sturdy, and the first impression is that it is dense. But the equipment definitely compresses the pad pretty completely. It will help keep sweat off the carpet but will do a less satisfactory job keeping the impressions of the equipment off the floor. As I learned after the fact, \"Heavy Duty P.V. C.\" does not mean \"solid pvc\" which would have been a better choice for me. It could work as a yoga or exercise mat.",

It is a perfect fit with several inches to spare all around the bike, and protects my hardwood floors. It cleans easily and does not slip or slide. There is nothing about this mat that I do not like.",

But if you are planning to do cross training and Cardio then the mat will scrape and leave a lot of small black dots. It wears out fast. The mat also moves if you are doing a lot of cardio and fast movements exercises. I still use it but looking for something more fit for heavy cardio workouts.",
