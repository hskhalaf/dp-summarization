      "text": "Purchased the RFID Money Belt earlier this year for European trip for the summer. My previous trip to Europe resulted in having my iPhone stolen from my back pack. The RFID Money Belt definitely secured my important items this time, including my pass port, cell phone, wallet, & credit cards. It was well hidden on my body from the pick pocket professionals. However after a week of using it, the zipper simply fell off the pouch. I needed to use a pair of scissors to open the pouch to retrieve my item stored within it. Therefore, although it did secure my belongings, I did not think it was going to last only for a one time use.",

But I figured better safe than sorry, especially since I would be using the train system extensively in Italy where pickpockets tend to hang out.

I would definitely recommend this product.",

At first I thought maybe this is due to some kind of RFID material in the lining, but actually the RFID protectors seem to be provided as separate sheathes that need to be slid over cards / passports before you put them in the money belt. I purchased another money belt sold here on Amazon by Raytix and found it to be a superior product with no crunching noise.",

The extra pack of passport and card sleeves for use when you are not wearing the belt is a nice extra. My one criticism is that it takes the minutest, slightest, squeeze of the clasp to unhook the belt. So I am worried about loss of the belt due to this flaw. I might disable this clasp with tape and just step into the belt instead.",

Best thing about this money belt is the soft finish on the adjustable waistband, it's very comfortable on. The mesh lining/slip pocket on the back keeps it from sticking. I'd like to see a small dot of Velcro on the slip pocket to secure the slip pocket. It would be difficult but not impossible for something to fall out. I ended up not using that part.",
