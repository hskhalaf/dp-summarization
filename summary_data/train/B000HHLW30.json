Assembly was fairly quick, but two screw holes on round metal pieces used to support the stand hadn't been drilled. The wood rack is able to support wood if you don't move the rack once filled, as the support legs are flimsy. The price would be fair if it were better made. Photo does show rack leans.

The holes were not drilled accurately enough and I need someone with stronger hands to wiggle the two hoops together so the screw would go through both the hoops all the way. However, once together, it seems to be quite sturdy and I was able to fill it up with wood. Make sure your wood is at least 16\" long though, or it would reach across the hoops on the bottom and will fall through. It was suggested that using a cut piece of thin wood that can be molded to the bottom would solve this problem for wood size.",

Now the log rack is portable and I can roll it into the garage to protect the wood from the rain, or move it closer to the fire pit. Took about 15 minutes and works like a charm.
