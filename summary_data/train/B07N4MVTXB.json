I\u2019ve hung a lot of tvs so don\u2019t count on it coming with your mount. I purchased mine at Home Depot for $4. Picture of actual screw is above. Per my research the actual length is 43MM and Samsung/amazon sells the screw. 45MM works with a space cap if you\u2019re in a bind.",

I couldn't tell a difference between the 70, 80, and 90. I had a Samsung 52\" LED tv before this one. It had a great picture but nothing like this one. Everyone prices this TV at around 2999.00 Costco and Sams advertise this TV with a 5 year manufacturers warranty. I called Samsung and they said this is not true. It has a 1 year manufacturers warranty. Amazon had the best extended warranty I could find. The delivery was trouble free. Very pleased!",

Half of the \"smart\" features simply don't work (ambient mode, syncing with the Smart Things app, screen casting, etc). And overall, the picture quality on my old 40 inch was far better.

      "text": "Amazing TV especially for the price as well. I returned a Vizio 2019 M series as I was not satisfied with the picture quality and this TV was definitely better the difference was night and day and well worth the extra 300 dollars. One downside is no Dolby vision . And from what I read it cannot do 4K at 60 frames per second however I'm not a gamer so this really wasn't an issue if it is for you you might consider the LG series",

It feels more like a $500 tv. The other issue is after you turn off the tv with the remote it will turn itself back on about 70% of the time which shows poor quality control from samsung and is a bit annoying. I got this because I was afraid of burn-in with the oled tvs but Id reconsider after living with this picture quality for several months. The audio is good, the only positive.",

But while watching something it\u2019s annoying because you can see it happening in real time, it is not seamless. The Bixby remote is more annoyance than usefulness.

TV remote leaves more to be desired but i guess i do love how simple and sleek it is. Overall, if they added just a few extra customizable buttons on the remote, it would be a 100% perfect tv. However, it's still pretty close! Worth the buy!",
