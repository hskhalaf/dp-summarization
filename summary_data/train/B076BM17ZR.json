I have it hooked to my HDTV (via HDMI) and my monitor(DVI to HDMI) so I can work on it if I need to and play games with it hooked to my 55 inch tv. Been playing prey, graphics are great on both. I'm also a software developer, this handles Visual Studio development very easily. Strongly recommend!",

After setup, won't let me activate Windows 10 because it says the \"previous version\" wasn't activated either!? So this isn't a clean Win10 install, but an upgrade from Win8? Might be a vendor issue, but this is very much not a plug-and-play machine! Now I have to spend how long to troubleshoot this? The hardware seems to run fine, and it is very quiet. Skyrim on Ultra runs great and looks amazing. Hoping I don't find any other surprises.",
