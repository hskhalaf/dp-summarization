If you're looking for a lot of extra stuff, like heart rate, text messages, and phone calls, then get something more expensive. I figure my phone is expensive enough, and a watch should, before all else, tell time. I've been using this watch for 2.5 years, and other than having to change the band out when it wore down after 1 year of constant use in and out of the pool, I haven't had any issues. I've probably swum about 100 miles with this watch so far.",
