      "title": "This walker does not allow \"sideway\" movement",
      "text": "The walker fits well and the toys are cute, if a bit simplistic. However, the walker's fatal design flaw are its wheels that only go back and forth; they do not spin around their axes. This is a problem when the little \"driver\" wants to go sideways, which happens about half of the time. Logically, I think a walker should allow one to go in every which direction, just like one could go if they were in fact... walking. This lack of maneuvering flexibility caused us to return it.",
