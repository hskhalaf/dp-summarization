      "Cocojojo Argan Oil, also known as Moroccan Argan Nut Oil or Marrakesh Oil, is obtained through the cold-pressing technique which extracts the oil without using heat, which would otherwise denature the nutrients in the oil. It is also unrefined, so it is 100% pure, unprocessed oil. This natural ingredient is great for formulating beauty and cosmetic products, used as a carrier oil for essential oils, massage oils, and moisturizer for skin and hair!",
      "RICH IN NUTRIENTS \u2013 Cold pressed, unrefined argan oil is rich in natural nutrients and antioxidants that helps improve the appearance and health of skin and hair. These nutrients help nourish and restore skin and hair to promote a youthful appearance.",
      "FOR SKIN \u2013 Use Argan oil on your skin to help improve your moisture barrier and nourish your skin with various naturally-occurring vitamins and nutrients. Use the oil after a bath or shower when your skin is still moist (but not dripping with water) to seal in the moisture into your skin. This helps keep your skin hydrated throughout the day! Antioxidants in the oil also promotes a brighter appearance in your skin.",
      "FOR HAIR \u2013 Argan oil for hair is a great way to restore the health of your hair and scalp, as well as the shine. Use argan oil as a hair treatment mask and allow the oil to soak in your hair for about an hour. Wash the oil out with your normal shampoo and conditioner. Alternatively, you can mix a little bit of argan nut oil to your hair conditioner and use that mixture to condition your hair after shampooing. It can help with your scalp conditions and nourish your hair for a vibrant look.",
      "PURE & READY TO USE \u2013 Argan oil is great to use for hair formulations and other beauty products. Our argan oil is 100% pure, and will do great in moisturizers and hair oil treatments. Argan oil is a carrier oil and blends well with other carrier oils and essential oils, making it an easy way to make an all-natural product!"
