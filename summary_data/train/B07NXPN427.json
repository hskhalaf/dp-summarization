Even a bumbler like myself can set it up and take down in a couple of minutes-solo. Light, easy to carry, and unbelivaby cheap. IMHO much nicer looking than all those ubiquitous little square circus tents. ( OK-I'm an Architect=obsessive ). Buy it even if they double the price !",

I\u2019m actually using it at the campground to shelter my smoker from rain. With the smoke out the side. Side curtain can stop smoke from blowing towards you. So it\u2019s use is quite versatile. Fabric is umbrella like material. So tie downs a must. But for the money. It\u2019s a good buy.",

I was also unsuccessful to open it as the designer had intended using the cord. I had to manually spread the canopy arms. The potential is there....",
