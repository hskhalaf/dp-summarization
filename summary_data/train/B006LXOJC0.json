      "text": "Was leary on purchase, dust busters are just not what they used to be, I'm only 33 but the quality used to be way better. My wife and I bought one a few years back and hardly used it. Hard to charge, suction was crap and you had to remove from power to avoid destroying the battery to over charge. This one has brought some faith back! It is a tad loud but this thing is great. Great suction and it just sits in the charger. The filter cover is a bit small so a few clogs happen but overall we are really happy with this. If you don't want to drop hundreds on over priced hand helds, get this",

This thing is my first line of defense against bugs and kitty litter. I would have died by now if it weren't for this handvac. Very easy to empty, no-plug charger is handy. Some people mentioned having problems with it, but I haven't had any in all this time.",

The only drawback is that it doesn't have any useful attachments. The narrow nozzle is all you get. Fine for small solid surfaces but not so great for larger areas or upholstery covered in pet hair.",

      "text": "Horrible Battery We had such high hopes for this product after reading all the reviews. Turns out the \"18 month\" battery life that is advertised is 18 months until you have to replace the actual lithion ion battery. The battery, when fully charged, lasts only about 10 minutes total which makes this horribly useless when it comes to cleaning cars or stairs. It also seems that they expect you leave it on the charger at all times, I didn't want to have to leave this plugged in and out all the time. I was hoping for a unit that I could charge and put away, and then use when required to clean out the car or stairs. No such luck.",

      "text": "Great vacuum, good suction, easy to clean out, seems like the filter will last a good long time. I had a similar Black & Decker model that lasted over eight years, lost it in the divorce. What a loss it was. There is no hanger/charger with this particular model. The charger is a disk that the vacuum sits upright on. Like I\u2019m going to make this vacuum the centerpiece of my dining room table or something....kinda stupid charging system.",
