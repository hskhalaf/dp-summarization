Almost all other squeegees are too small to wipe the doors in 2 passes (they require 3 passes), so with this wide squeegee I am able to wipe door in only 2 overlapping passes. I know; sounds trivial, but I have to shower often and using this wider squeegee is a simple way to make wiping down the shower doors just a little easier. Nice grip on the handle, and the second rubber blade is a nice bonus. Very happy with this product!",

Once wet and scrubbed this squeege makes quick work of the liquid. If you dont prescrub and have a wet enough window you will get streaks. A rag on hand is a must to both wipe the blade and the window edges. The overlapping technique to produce a streak free finish can take some practice but you'll get to look like a ninja while doing it.",

The Unger pole has it\u2019s lock system for this as well as threads that I assume will work with other things like rollers. But at $45 for a 12\u2019 pole I\u2019m not happy. The squeegee is $10, the pole $45, so yeah if you want to spend that much to get the windows clean it\u2019s a great squeegee. I\u2019ll just tape it to my old pole for now",

The Unger is far superior and suctions much better with no streaking. The rubber on the Unger is softer and more pliable, which is why i think it works so well. I have to follow up with a lint-free cloth when I use the smaller (non-Unger) one.",
