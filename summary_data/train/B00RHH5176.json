They are in love with individualizing their own spaces with in the same room. The beds themselves are sturdy, safe, and spacious...their mattresses are overstuffed with a pillow top and they are still well below the safety rail. The only thing they complain of is the thin ladder steps hurting their feet but, they also aren't used to climbing up ladders every day, and just end up putting their feet side-ways/long-ways as they walk up. It's perfectly fine, I would recommend these to anyone.",

It comes with two small tools to use and it's honestly all you need. You only use the small wrench once. Maybe you'll want a bigger version of the tools for more ease but still not necessary. My only advice is to make sure you tighten the screws enough. Don't tighten so tight that it bends the metal in but enough to keep it sturdy. It will not wobble if everything is lined up properly and tightened just right.",

It really is quite painful to climb them. Simple solution was a tube of pipe insulation from the hardware store cut to length for each rung. Would have been nice if that had been provided though.

      "text": "Does take about 4 hours to assemble. One bar was slightly bent . The concept of it is great once put together it is sturdy however it does shake when climbing the ladder and when on the bed . It is higher than expected my son is 10 and about 4'8 an hits his head on ceiling when climbing over the bar to get in bed. The ladder does not come with padding so it does hurt the feet when going up and down. It is a great dpace saver and like i said a great concept but i dont think its worth the money . I feel as if i just spent about 300$ on basically shelves .",

Hoping it was quiet as it is used and I can randomly tighten to ensure it stays together. As it is a lot taller than I expected. Which is fine it allowed for more room where the desk is.

The boxes they came in were pretty heavy.. it took two grown men to hoist them up the stairs. Assembly was pretty intense too.. I\u2019m a shade tree mechanic but it still took a couple hours apiece to put them together. Overall though, they\u2019re very sturdy and my kids love them. They\u2019re very nice beds.",

They literally have to climb up and over the railing, which doesn\u2019t seem very safe.",

So I got what I paid for. I tighten the bolts as much as it would allow and the bed still squeaks every time my son moves on it. It is a very high bed. Make sure it has a room with high ceilings as my son's head touches the ceiling when he sits upon it.",

I would say the only downside would be no entry for the ladder area. You have to climb over the railing because there is no opening to get through and the ladder itself is uncomfortable climbing it. Put some noodles on it for padding and I'm sure it'll be fine. Overall good for the $.",

The holes for the shelves dont line up perfectly when you just set it in. We had to slide them in from the side and then one person pushed the shelf with his thumb while holding the bed frame so that they would line up. Once the screws were in, it fits perfectly. Definitely a 2-man job. Took about 2 hours to assemble but it looks great. Very sturdy and no squeaking for it to be metal which is a plus. Tons of free space on the floor now that the bed goes up.",
