      "text": "I purchased these for a hiking trip through Iceland - was totally impressed Walked through a river to get to a waterfall and was totally dry up to my calves. Wearing these boots you forget that they're boots and they feel more like shoes. I drove a SUV with these on and was able to drive manual very comfortably, forgetting I was wearing boots. As someone who usually hates boots this is perfect. I could imagine that with a large pack that it may not be 100% supportive but I can't say without experience. I can say that I love these boots and they are supremely comfortable and very waterproof.",

They MAY have been waterproof the first month but now just walking through a good stretch of wet grass will get my socks soaked. I have probably put close to 100 hiking miles in these. Other than the water proof issue they are pretty good. I wear a size 12 and they just fit right. I bought these cause they were lightweight and waterproof. Im going to contact Under Armour for a replacement due to them not being waterproof.",
