When I received it and opened it I was disappointed the decal was off center and crooked. I figured this was just a very poor quality control issue so I ordered another one. The 2nd one I received was perfect. I think I would have been more upset if I didn\u2019t have prime with free returns. The tray is great for the price of $16. Anything more and it would be a ripoff.",
