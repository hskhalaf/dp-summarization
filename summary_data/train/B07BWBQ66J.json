      "text": "My husband carries his money and credit cards, etc in his front pants pockets. He has never used his back pockets to hold his money & other valuables. The old tri-fold and bi-fold wallets are too big and bulky to be carried in a front pocket, so for years hubby has used a small cut-out square from a file folder bound by masking tape to hold all his cards. When I saw this I had to buy it for him, and he is delighted with it. The style is very modern, and the materials are sturdy and good-looking. The money clip is an extra feature he loves. I feel more comfortable knowing his \"wallet\" isn't going to disintegrate!",

Overall, it it a pretty good product. It seems to be pretty well constructed, but the space for the ID card also doesn't have a viewing slot. You have to pull the ID card out through a thumb push hole which I have found to be bothersome. I would say this just didn't fit my tastes more than the product was not overall \"good.\"",

Also if your one of those people who like to use a card to scan through places like trains, home, work, ETC, without removing the card and simply touching your wallet to the pad, this will not work because of the thickness regardless of where you place the card on the wallet.

The firm pressure of the clip with your money makes it nearly impossible to put credit cards in without removing money from your clip first. Obviously this not what one wants to do at a cash teller in a line of people. So what I do is place the least used cards in those sleeves. The wallet is firm and appears well made.

It doesn't hold as many cards as old-school wallets (hence the 4-stars vs 5) or have a plastic picture holder, but it does the job well as a slim and simple billfold. The pocket on the exterior provides easy access for a driver's license, which is quite handy in real world usage. Very happy with this purchase.",

I don't know why the design has it more on one side rather than in the middle (where the fold is). I really dont know how to align the currency notes to the clip. Should the notes be in the center of the wallet or folder 1/3rd of the way which makes the currency notes start to fly away",

I told my husband how much it was, and he said he would have thought that it was much more. It is very functional, yet slim. I highly recommend this wallet for anyone.

The card slots should both be opened at the ends of the wallet. The openings in the center are difficult to access. Placing 3-4 slots on one side and the clip on the opposite side would have solved those problems. Lastly, possibly having a snap or two closure on the end to secure any paper stored by some money. I'm currently trying to stretch the pockets some to accommodate more than the six or eight cards. The clip restricts the same side pockets.",
