I welded with it and really put it through its paces today welding over 1/4'' steel with ease. i will say 3/32 rods worked very poorly. I switched to 1/8'' and set it to 65 amp and had no more issues. full penetration with ease. After an hour or so of continuous use the unit was barely warm to the touch. for the price, i doubt you'll find a better portable welder. One happy customer",

I've changed the electrode holder AND the ground clamp and both cables but that didn't help. Now I'm in the market for a new welder and it won't be a cheap Forney again.",
