If you are planning on walking 9 or 18 holes I would suggest getting a two strap clip that you can hook onto the bag to carry easier. But this bag is specifically for carts so I do not complain about it, but just a thought if you happen to walk the course every once in awhile.",

It is also very cosmetically appealing bag as well, so I am very happy with my purchase.",
