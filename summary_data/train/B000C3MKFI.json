I finally got one, though, because the PSP headset can be used on smart phones and the like. These are just as comfortable as I remember. I often forget I am even wearing them. They sound as perfect as anyone could expect, given their price point and size. Too bad Sony does not still make these.",

In any case, it's super fun, and necessary to join clans /cells on such games as Syphon Filter: Dark Mirror, and Socom: Fireteam Bravo. A must have for the infrastructure PSP gamer!",
