Enter this toothbrush, with a nice ergonomic handle and very soothing soft bristles. Aside from the eco-friendliness (they're apparently also compostable), they really do have a nice feeling on my gums. Almost like a massage, without exaggeration. Highly recommended, 10/10, would buy again if the pack ever failed me (it won't).",

The bristles a rigid, and between the shape of the brush and the bristles, I am unable to clean my teeth well. At least when I throw these out, I'll be making less of an economic impact.",

Compared to a jcp brand I bought, I prefer these. To the supplier, please let the manufacturerer know the at least 2 bristles fall out while brushing maybe every few days and it is highly uncomfortable. Overall, I'd still buy these because I've noticed that phone the shedding has stopped.",

Durability is also amazing a box, could easily last you a year.",

The natural bamboo, once wet with saliva, creates friction with lips and mouth causing discomfort. Maybe they could have sealed it somehow. I have rubbed coconut oil on mine, which seemed to help somewhat. Also, the natural bristles, which are designed to be removed before recycling, get caught in my teeth or just fall out while brushing. I think every brushing I've had to spit one out, or tweezer-ed it out of my teeth. At this point, I wonder how many bristles will be left after 3 months. Big design flaw.",

In two weeks, one of the brushes turned black around the bristles. They did this the first time I purchased them, but I figured it was time to change them, even though it was only a month and half. This time, they are turning black quicker. Very disappointed. We use natural toothpaste as well, so I'm confused. Bamboo shouldn't grow mold.",
