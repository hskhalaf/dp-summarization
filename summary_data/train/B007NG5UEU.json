I can't help but determine that these units are poorly made in regards to connectivity.

The monitors with batteries then have to switch with the main monitor to charge when not being used.

It's so low that it's difficult to hear over even minor noise like running water in the sink.

It has good range, adjustable sensitivity, and has been a god send in our sleep quality. While pregnant with our child (our first) we purchased the fancy video monitor that can connect to the net and be viewed on our phones. DO NOT do this if you live in an area without reliable internet over 20mbps. It DOES NOT work even if other tech such as streaming does. After a month of constant fiddling, purchasing wifi extenders, we finally gave up. Stick with tried and true tech. Bonus, it cannot be hacked like some of the newer, internet enabled monitors.",

Plus if our internet or electricity goes out as it sometimes does in south Florida weather, we can still monitor our baby. It can also easily be taken to another location and quickly set up there without complication.",

It is also nice that you can talk through it as well but we haven\u2019t had to use that feature yet. The one thing that I wish was different about it is that the parent parts have rechargeable batteries but the baby part doesn\u2019t. So anywhere you want to place the baby end of the monitor it has to be plugged into the wall. Other than that we have loved using this monitor so far!",

Works just fine. My only complaint is that the rechargeable batteries that came with the receivers were not good to begin with and have already died. I rarely unplugged them to use portably, but if I want to I will have to replace the rechargeable batteries myself. Not a problem, but very disappointing to need to do it so soon. Otherwise I would give these 5 stars.",
