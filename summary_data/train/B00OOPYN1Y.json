This is his favorite part of this toy and stops him from crying and now doesn't work. This is NOT repairable, as there is no way to open the giraffe or replace batteries. Its completely sewn shut. PREVIOUS REVIEW: He's a few months old and he's already working on his motor skills. I put the objects low enough so he can grab them and tug on them. Super easy to put together, took 5 mins. And he gets excited to play with it. Totally recommend this!",

He uses it at least 1 hour every day but sometimes up to 5 hours just depending on his mood. He will baby talk to the animals (in addition to the giraffe we added a monkey and a lion to the gym since it has extra loops). Right now it's definitely one of his favorite toys and its a great price, we we're not going to pay $50-$80 for a toy he'll grow out of in 4 months. This is a great product and a great price.",

Needless to say, he was not interested in this at all!! I thought he would like it what with the bright colors and large cartoon-like characters, but he got bored after just a few minutes and start fussing. I tried multiple times but each time was the same. In comparison, we have a SkipHop activity gym at our house that he can play in for extended periods of time. Disappointing but it may work for someone else!",

It kept his attention for 30 minutes this morning; the circular rattle is his favorite so far. Love that there are different heights to place the toys and they are easily moved from one tie to the next depending on where you want them, i.e. near his face or feet to kick at. I added some other toys we had, and I love that you can switch them out. A big selling point for me was the mirror for tummy time. Lightweight, pattern isn\u2019t overly loud or obnoxious, portable...highly recommended.",

The toy giraffe plays music which was awesome (other than you had to keep pushing its belly to keep the music going.) My daughter played on this activity gym for about 30 minutes. The very next day, the music no longer worked on the giraffe and there is no way to replace the batteries. The only way to replace whatever batteries it takes is to cut the stitching along the neck and sew it back up! Obviously not reasonable. The only reason I\u2019m giving 2 stars is because my daughter still enjoys all the vibrant colors and animals/toys but loses interest quicker without the music.",

I am very happy I purchased this gym over the more decorative wood gyms that would have match our interior design better. Wood gyms wouldn't be nearly as fun or safe for our daughter to move and grow with.",

It's easy to clean -- my son has had multiple blow outs and spits up on the mat and it was an easy clean up. The only reason I'm rating this a 4/5 instead of a 5/5 is because the giraffe piece -- his favorite toy -- broke. The music doesn't work anymore, and I tried looking for a battery outlet, and nothing. The giraffe piece broke only after a month, and it was just hanging there.. :(",
