A concerned family member bought me a pair of these for $150 and they were superior for offsetting pain and soreness. Are they worth $150? Maybe. They do feel better than the others, and I can go further with these 1500 series than my previous New Balance running/walking shoes in the 400 series. I did just fine with several (5) pairs of New Balance 400 series at $59 each in one year (every 2 months wearing out at 5 miles/day walking). These are supposed to last longer, so we'll see. They are immediately more comfortable than the previous models.",

New Balance has a bad habit of discontinuing popular models and replacing them with something different, and in many cases, with poorer design.

In general, it's a longer and narrower shoe. I'll be going to the local New Balance store to find a better replacement than this for the old M1540.",
