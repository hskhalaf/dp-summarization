It's important not to over-wash your beard, but this is made just for your beard. It doesn't over wash it, it leaves it nice and soft and has a mild woody scent to it, not overpowering, just enough to notice on occasion. It's advisable to use this in conjunction with something to moisturize your beard with something like a beard oil or beard conditioner. Washing it will clean not only dirt but remove some of the natural oils in your beard.",

I have now been using this a few weeks, just a little dab is all you need, and my beard feels fresh and looks amazing. It is much softer, and fuller, and smells great. It not just keeps your beard conditioned but the skin underneath.",
