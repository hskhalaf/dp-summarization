After multiple runs, I got the feeling that the difference in taste from a traditional moka pot wasn't going away any time soon (-1 star for you, Delonghi. Plastic bad). SO, I took the top compartment from my stove-top moka pot (Bialetti) and used it instead of the plastic one: works perfectly! NOT that I'm recommending this hack: I can't guarantee your pot won't explode and turn your kitchen into a mini-Chernobyl. It works great for me, though.",

The pinched seal is causing the pot to leak and a loss of pressure when brewing the coffee.

I highly recommend the Alicia model as well...it's compact, light, and the clear top lets you see exactly when your cafecito and such is ready. Enjoy.",

      "text": "I have had my Alicia espresso machine for a year now and love it -its the most efficient, compact machine for making a great brew -and I had gone through quite a few esspresso machines before Alicia. I've never had any trouble with any of the parts on this one and still use the original gasket with no leaks or problems. I started drinking espresso for the low acid process and coffee from Alicia has never let me down. I've even taken this on travel and plan to get a second one for that purpose.",

Found in most Italian kitchens for more than half a century, moka produces an inherently aromatic espresso. It is more intense in flavor, and more pure in coffee taste. That is why generations of Italians have sworn by stovetop moka espresso makers. \n\n In fact, in Italy every family owns at least two mokas. Used on the stovetop, the heat from the burner boils the water and directs it up through the ground coffee and into the receptacle, producing a perfect espresso every time. \n\n Why an Electric Moka Espresso Maker? Although the traditional stovetop moka makes great espresso, people have been searching for a safe, convenient and easy-to-use alternative. The new six-cup machine embodies DeLonghi\u2019s commitment to its Italian heritage and innovative kitchen design. The Electric Moka Espresso Maker is a modern-day, convenience-minded adaptation of a beloved Italian staple. \n\n Electric Moka Espresso Maker Features:\n\n \n\n * 3- to 6-cup espresso capacity \n * Transparent Coffee Container lets you easily monitor the entire brewing process. And the durable container is easy-to-clean. \n * Filter Adapter allows you to choose 3 or 6 cups of espresso, so you can select the amount of espresso to make depending on the number of people you\u2019re serving. \n * Automatic Shut-Off With Keep Warm Function keeps espresso hot for up to 30 minutes. And with automatic safety shut-off, your espresso will never burn or overflow. \n * Two-Level Safety System will automatically shut-off the machine when the unit is finished brewing and when the body is lifted from the base. \n * Cordless Operation with Detachable Base makes serving convenient and simple. You can bring your espresso right to the table. \n * On/Off Switch with Indicator Light Easy-to-use illuminated push-button control lets you know when the unit is in operation. \n * Pressurized Safety Valve ensures safe operation. \n * Aluminum Boiler is made of durable, high-quality aluminum. Count on getting great espresso for years to come. \n\n How to Make the Perfect Italian Espresso in Just a Few Simple Steps: \n\n \n\n 1.  Fill the aluminum boiler with water. \n    \n    \n 2.  Fill the filter with ground coffee.  \n    \n    \n 3.  Attach the transparent coffee container to the base.  \n    \n    \n 4.  Plug in and switch the push button to the ON position. \n\n Technical Specs: \n\n \n\n * Dimension: 5.12 by 8.27 by 10.63 inches \n * Weighs 3 pounds \n * 120 volts \n\n The DeLonghi Devotion to Living Innovation\n\n DeLonghi is committed to creating products that enhance and benefit the lives of our consumers.
