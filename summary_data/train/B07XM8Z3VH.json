I feel like it's supposed to be an easy setup but I've been here hours now. I realize it was only just released so software updates could fix some issues, but it's very annoying that I now basically can't use it despite doing everything right (as far as I can tell). If I was you I'd wait and check the reviews a bit more.",

The sweet spot is so tight that actually getting a clear image in the headset is also practically impossible without constantly fidgeting with it. The worst thing? The sensors don't work properly, even in high light environments it states you need to turn up the lights. Sent back immediately, expecting a full refund. IF Vive had any conscience, they would pull this broken product. Also note i'm writing this in October 2020.",
