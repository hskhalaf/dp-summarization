The handle rotates backwards to open but the construction of the case is so poor that the plastic hinge part pops out each time and needs to be carefully refixed. Destined to be broken on Day 1 by the kids on Christmas day. The handle of the case and of some of the \"instruments\" is glitter covered. The glitter comes off on your hands, the sofa, everything. Not nice for Amazon. More like pirate disney toy.",
