I don't understand why companies do this... fruit is already sweet. :-( Nice idea and good price but for that reason I won't be reordering. I'll find an all natural alternative.",

I like to munch on a handful of this a few hours after dinner if I start getting the munchies. I knocked off two stars because this product has consistently (same variety and size bag) cost $4.98. My most recent purchase was 2 weeks ago (mid-April 2020) and now it is May 1st and it costs $10.60. That's over a 100% increase. I understand we are going thru a pandemic but sellers/companies shouldn't be so greedy and implement such high surge pricing.",

The variety of nuts in bag are a even amount. Only 1 of 6 bags was way to many cranberries & most wasn\u2019t chewable because the skin was dry and not the chewy fruit taste. Also it had 5-6 small walnuts in bag. So that bag for me was disappointing. But other then that I love these & will continue buying these because of the freshness & tasty flavors.",

The mixture is not as good as Trader Joe, Whole Foods or Kirkland, but about half the price for 14 oz (my rough estimate).
