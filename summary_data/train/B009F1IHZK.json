But I realized that I wanted something that was more productive and would run Windows8, but was still easy to take in my purse. I considered Microsoft Surface, Lenovo Yoga and the Asus Taichi, after going to Best Buy and Staples, I chose Asus Taichi because of the reviews and the hands on feel. As soon as you fire this cutie up, you will know that the quality you desire is there. Asus Taichi may be pricey, but the quality is worth it and they even offer a 12 month accidental warranty. Try that one on for size-that is way ahead of the competition.",

(with external speakers, of course) i knocked off 1 star because of their cust svc. also, whatever you do, don't it carry around like a plate full of food -- i.e. closed, horizontal, with your thumb on top and your other four fingers on the bottom -- the exterior (touch) screen will crack. oh, and be sure to buy the taichi suit. looks awesome and keeps the bottom cool.",
