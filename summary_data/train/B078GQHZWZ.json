I was on the fence about the eWater; I'm very glad that i got it, it is a huge improvement over the original. I was worried that the washlet would trigger ewater every time i walked into my small bathroom - It does not. It only triggers if i step directly in front of it. The few times that it does trigger is no big deal; it is very quick and quiet. I am impressed at the improvements made over my earlier model.",
