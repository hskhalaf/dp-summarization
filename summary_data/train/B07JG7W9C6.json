Screen resolution provides really clear text and sharp graphics. Sound, in dolby stereo, is excellent for the size. App loading is really fast and startup speed is excellent with a fast shutdown, even after all my current software has been installed. Thoroughly pleased with this as it now replaces and combines my old Dell laptop and desktop. This is my first Acer and I highly recommend the Nitro 5.",

The bad things are bloatware (which you can and should remove), if you use it for streaming and have a web browser open and play a game, then the RAM will max out, but there is space to put in more RAM. The AMD Radeon settings will break every so often which prevents you from updating your graphics, but you can just re-download it from the AMD website.",

For the money I would recommend getting a different laptop (or at least get some additional cooling fan pads for it) I only use it when I'm away from home. Consider different laptops before buying this one. Apart from stuttering and really high temps when gaming, I did not have any other problems with it.",

However, the CPU can overheat to 80C-100C after 1 hour of gaming. This will degrade (i.e destroy) the CPU over time and also cause laptop performance issues. To remedy this you will need to potentially i) under-volt the CPU ii) open up the laptop and apply new thermal paste to the CPU iii) turn off the CPU turbo boost function If you're unwilling to do any of the above, I don't recommend you buy the laptop unless you plan to use it to fry eggs.",
