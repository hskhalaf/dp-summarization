Though, there is an option of setting it up, lengthwise, on the counter, access to the water reservoir, and controls (other than start/stop) are reduced. I had been looking for something more reasonably priced than the $100+ coffee makers out there, and the reviews on this were good. I am very happy with this coffee maker.",

Finally, for the life of me cannot figure out how to turn off the high-pitched beep the machine makes when brew starts/finishes--our place is small and although not super loud it is enough to wake people up....",
