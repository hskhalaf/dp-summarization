That means when you set something down next to the teapot it will not be unknowingly activated thus melting or burning whatever is next to it. Holds ample amount and the space saving vertical size is also a plus. We have been very happy with this and would buy it again.",

It seems to heat water quite fast, and it meets my needs well, which is to have it with me while camping (where there is an outlet handy). The mouth of the kettle is a bit small, though; so you'll need someone with small hands to clean it if needed.",

Just started to use the kettle about 30 days ago, It has suddenly leaked on the right side plastic panel to the degree that the kettle cannot be used as water is everywhere coming down and out. Do not know what to do, as I bought awhile back but did not start to use until 30 days agi, Very disappointed and feel mislead by New York Times reviewer who said to buy this kettle. RE; ratings. It was easy to use and keep clean etc until it just failed in 3o short days of use.",
