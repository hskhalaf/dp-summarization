If you see white spots on the metal it is the starch from the rice. Oil it before use.",

Nonetheless, the health benefits of using a stainless steel pot (versus using non-stick Teflon pot) makes up for this. As some reviewers said, when cleaning the stainless steel pot for the first few times, there is a sort of greyish residue that comes off when I wiped it with a paper towel. I did some research on this, and it's a thin coating added on during the manufacturing process to give it its shine, and apparently it is harmless? I am not sure about this, however.",
