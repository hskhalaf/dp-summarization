Why is the cover permanently fastened on so it gets in the way when you try to cut? At least they didn't make that flaw impossible to correct: use a small screwdriver or needlenose pliers to get the hinge pin loose and remove it. The cover still snaps on, still pushes cut slices out, but no longer shoves everything else off the counter as you try to maneuver around the fruit you are cutting. Shouldn't have to do that though.",

If you prefer larger apples (like Honeycrisps), sometimes they are too large to fit the slicer. We ended up throwing it out and went back to slicing with a knife - it takes longer (hardly) and it's much easier to clean a knife than this contraption.",

A few apples took a little extra \"umph\" to cut thru, but for the most part, one push and it cut beautifully. Yes, I would recommend it.",

      "title": "The Best Apple Slicer Out There",
      "text": "I'm convinced that this is the best apple slicer in existence. Normally when I'm cutting apples, I'm cutting them for my kids. Those other 8-slice apple slicers make pieces that are just too big. This one creates 16 perfectly-sized slices that are good for little mouths and adults alike. I didn't even realize the gray bottom could be used to push the apple all the way through and make cutting even easier until I had owned it for several months (I thought it was just a guard to protect the blades.) Amazing. I recommend this to any mom who I get into conversations about apples with (which happens more than one might expect!)",

      "text": "I was looking for an apple slicer to slice the apples thinner than my old 8 slice slicer. I bought this and have been very happy. The plastic part that fits on to protect you from the blades doubles as a way to push the core and slices up through. This has taken the work out of making apple pies by slicing the apples thin so they cook quickly. I used to have to slice them by hand even after using my old 8 slice slicer to make them thin enough. I love this and highly recommend it!",

      "text": "This makes my daily apple snack something special. Especially pleased with the 12 slices. My two other ones only make 8 slices. I prefer the slices thinner and almost never use the thicker slicers. The form-fitting bottom provides the finishing touch, to get the blades to slice completely through the apple. It is harder to press 12 blades than 8, but follow the directions and place on a firm tabletop, rather than the countertop. This allows you to get the leverage you need more easily. I also initially press somewhat slowly until the skin of the apple is pierced, then press harder (faster) to make the cut. Then fold the hinged bottom into place and finish.",
