I've also gotten Beams by Honest Kitchen, which I prefer as they offer chewing time (they're much harder and thicker - these are kind of crumbly). I don't know if it's because of using different fish or a different manufacturing process. For a little dog these might be more of a chew and could easily be broken into pieces (they're quite long). Beams have to be cut apart with scissors if you want a smaller piece. Quality is good though and I'd rather give something like this as a quick treat than give her cookies.",

I was surprised at how brittle the cod sticks are, but this makes them very easy to break up into feedable chunks. This is not a chewy treat, and should only be given under supervision given how easy the treats shatter. In terms of the odor, they do smell strongly of fish, but the smell disappears pretty soon after the treat is consumed. My picky eater loves them, so I couldn't be happier.",
