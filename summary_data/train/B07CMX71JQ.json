We checked for leaks and just had to make one minor adjustment . This is not for an unseasoned plumber to install or a do it yourself person. You do need expensive plumbing tools to install which we already had on hand. Would be very easy to install on a new build by a seasoned plumber . It works great and is worth every penny . I love the quality and how it\u2019s flush to the wall. Very easy to use and pretty.",

It doe's spray hard if turned on high, but can be controlled by the lever. Watch the depth for the cover plate need to add 1/2 for cement board then thickness of the tile, that will leave about 2 inch finish plus cover plate. I used to install two controllers one for shower head an one for hand held. Cost difference about $200 saved. This is the best why to go. Bush chrome looks great and works perfectly... will by again.",

The installer blamed a solder joint in the fixture, but not sure if it was the installer's fault or the manufacturer. It was easily repaired. Second, the sprayer is actually turned on and off by a push-button after you open the valve on the wall. This is a little different from typical sprayers and takes a little getting used to. It has a beautiful finish and is solidly made.",

The regular ones out there can be used only during summer time. One thing I would recommend during installation is that make sure you ask the plumber to add two separate valves, one for cold and another one for hot pipe. This way in case if you encounter any leakage later you could simply turn off the line. We also strongly recommend to turn of the sprayer when not in use. The controller at the tip of the hose is not meant to contain the waterline pressure.",
