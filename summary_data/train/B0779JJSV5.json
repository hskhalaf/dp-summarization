After an initial break-in period, I felt that the mattress was a good balance of comfort and firmness. Unfortunately, after sleeping on this mattress for 6 months it no longer offers a good level of support. There is a significant sink along the center of the mattress and there is not enough firmness to get through a night of sleep without significant aches and pains. I am a relatively standard size, 6' and 175lbs and primarily a side-sleeper. Unfortunate that this mattress broke down quickly as the initial comfort was positive.",

So I did want coils rather than a slab of just foam and latex as a top layer for comfort and longevity. Also a low odor and non toxic fire retardant would be preferred as well. This bed hit pretty much all the check boxes. Bed is very comfortable, sleeps cool, good support, good edge support, minimal motion transfer and great price. If it holds up and lasts without sagging then I'll be completely satisfied.",

Considering this purchase was during an Amazon sale, it definitely influenced my purchase. This baby is soft as hell and sleep hasn't felt any better! My old mattress would make my box crack & squeak more than a 80s Horror Movie & this mattress actually prevents it!

I'm not saying it takes pain away, it doesn't, at least not mine, but compared to other beds and mattresses it is very comfortable and I look forward to snuggle up in it. When I bought it, queen size was 250$. Affordable and very comfy!!!! Came rolled up in a box, it was very heavy, took 2 people to push it to my apartment.",
