I was a bit nervous about it being difficult to put together, but it's only a handful of steps that can be done with a screwdriver and hammer in under twenty minutes total for two end tables. Not sure if it's entirely real wood, but it looks nice and the top is lightly textured so it will hide any potential future scratches well (I always seem to damage my end tables with keys and things). We only need two end tables currently, but 10/10 would buy again if that changes.",

I thought the table was pretty stylish and a perfect size so despite the mixed reviews, I decided to purchase it due to the low price point. It arrived quickly (prime shipping) and was packaged well. The pieces were scratched and marked up despite the styrofoam packing. Assembly was easy \u2014 just a Phillips screwdriver needed. If I knew I was going to receive the same (damaged) item again, I wouldn\u2019t purchase. I am not surprised at these blemishes though, because you do tend to get what you pay for. These seem to be hit-or-miss with damage.",

There is an additional lower Shelf for incidentals. It's a great height and a great size. I recommended!

I tried them out just to see but they make the table unsteady, maybe they'd work on carpet? I ended up taking them off and putting felt pads along the bottom of each leg. Sits much better that way.

Its not the most sturdy or durable, but Im putting a lamp on it....not a 60lb child...unlike other reviewers complaining about it breaking because their kid sat on it. Obviously its not going to be the nicest piece of furniture, but for $20: I have nothing to complain about.",
