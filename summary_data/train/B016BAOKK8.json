I've never had an allergic reaction to a detergent before, and it's it's disappointing that the first time I try something specifically designed to be gentle, I end up missing work, unable to sleep, and taking medicine to try and stop my very first severe allergic reaction to anything on this planet.",

Since they were also a brand-name, I decided to buy these. They are...ok. When they dissolve, they are good at cleaning but I've had way too many that do not dissolve and, while they didn't ruin the clothes, they came pretty close. I switched to the liquid version after noticing that these were not dissolving, and so far so good!",
