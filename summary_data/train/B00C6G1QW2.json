The heating element is so weak that we have to set the timer on maximum and then add additional time when the cycle is complete. Clearly not carefree operation. Many types of bread dry out before they brown. Way too much money for an appliance that performs so poorly.",

      "text": "I like this toaster for a few practical reasons, in spite of its apparent impracticality. 1. The automatic toasting ALSO means automatically popping up; I've put thick rolls, bagels, and slices of Italian bread in there, and never had anything stuck! 2. A lot of settings. At first, it seemed too much. Then I found there was really a nice range of toasting compared to the settings on a cheap toaster. 3. The FROZEN setting is pretty intuitive. The drawback: when your toast is ready, it comes up on the motorized cradle. If you don't retrieve it fast enough, like if you're busy cooking, it retracts and toasts it again! If not for this, 5 stars.",

The other complaint, I like my toast dark and if I am toasting a moist whole grain bread, even the darkest setting isn't enough. Otherwise it's great, I especially like the keep warm feature, and the ability to toast 2 different breads at different settings at the same time. Over all a good choice.",
