We put it on REALLY fast so it's a little disheveled here and there, plus our couch was slumping in a few places already, so it doesn't look as nice as in the photo, but that's all on us. We have two cats (golden and silver colored, long haired) and they haven't been scratching at the material (thank goodness because we bought this cover to hide the torn to shreds couch fabric) and their hair blends in pretty well. The hair is very easy to remove, just wipe it off and ball it up with your hands.",
