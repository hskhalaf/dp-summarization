Easy to set up, even with one person, as the poles aren't threaded through the fabric, but use external clips, which is excellent. The double door design is also helpful to allow entry or exit without having to crawl over your tent mates every time you need to go to the bathroom or whatnot. Some other colors would be nice, but it does what it needs to with good material and design.",

There are two doors opposite to each other, and there is a window above each which can be zipped open to get fresh air. Everything fits nicely in the sack that came with it. Some reviewers mentioned that this tent is not for hiking trips, but I think we could bring it with us next time without a problem. Can't wait :)!",

This is my first tent that actually had two doors, and what a relief it is opening them both up in the morning to let a nice breeze through. This can easily fit three fully grown adults along with a few bags. Definitely not a backpackers tent, but perfect for those looking to set up camp close to their cars.",

Instead the clip is the same smaller size as the other ones on the tent. We own other ALPS tents and they have the larger clip to grab two poles at any junctions.

The tent is advertised as a three persons tent, but unless the manufacturer was referring to small childs, the tent barely has room for two persons with minimal equipment. The floor of the tent is so thin that you may want to use a heavy tarp to sit the tent over. Likewise, while streching the tarp, one of the tarp seams ripped apart. It is not a bad tent for a single person or backpacking, but it is one that would not last long due to the below average manufacturing.",
