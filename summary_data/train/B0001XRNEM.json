This one is made with much cheaper material and much lighter than the one I had. A tamper needs to be heavy so that it's own weight can help ease the process of pressing coffee. Also, as seen in the pic, there's a line that pops out, which clearly shows how poor the quality is. I'm truly disappointed.",

      "text": "I bought this tamper to use with my Breville cappuccino machine. The tamper itself works great. It fits perfectly into the slot and evenly packs the espresso. The problem comes in when you put the tamper into the dishwasher. The product information says that this is dishwasher safe, but this could not be father from the truth. The first time mine came out of the dishwasher, it was no longer chrome colored, it was a dirty aluminum looking tamper covered in some black liquid. I am not sure what washed off of the tamper in the dishwasher, but I would not recommend putting this in the dishwasher because it will cause big issues for you.",

I'm deciding to keep it since I intend to keep making cappuccinos at home and I will definitely replace my current machine once it breaks down so this tamper may be useful for my next machine/s. I think it's a pretty good tamper. I like the weight and the feel of it in my hands as well as the flat ends. It's shiny and very simple in design and I don't think it looks cheap.",
