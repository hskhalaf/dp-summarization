      "text": "First let me say I had used my old hammock ten for many years and liked it a lot, but this tent is so much more comfortable. It has a nice stable platform; in that it allows you to lay almost flat. So I have used the tent and loved it. But...I messed up and damaged it. I contacted the seller explaining what I had done wrong with it and the damaged I had caused; so they could let me know how I could get it repaired, they simply sent me a replacement. This is almost too kind as it was my fault and no issue with the tent. So, Kudos to \u201cGetoutland\u201d!",

    "description": "Style:Hammock and Strap BundleLawson Blue Ridge Camping Hammock and Strap Set A unique, hybrid tent-hammock that has been rated #1 on the market by leading publications like Backpacker and Outside. The patented design allows for use suspended, as a hammock, or on the ground, as a tent, greatly increasing camping terrain options that are often limited by the type of shelter you\u2019re using. The spreader bar and arch pole system also keep the bed of the hammock flatter and more taut, eliminating much of the uncomfortable \u201ccocoon\u201d and \u201cbanana\u201d effect created by most hammocks. The Blue Ridge Camping Hammock has attached no-see-um bug netting and a rainfly that attaches directly to the hammock, so no need for additional trees for tying off a tarp or staking. Lightweight, easy to set up and perfect for all types of camping or anyone looking for a comfortable, bug/water proof place to relax or sleep. Specifications: Total Weight: 4. 93 lbs. (including poles, rain fly, straps, and stuff sacks) Interior Length: 90 in. Interior Width: 42 in. Pack Size: 22in x 6 in. Weight Limit: 275 lbs.

Use suspended or on the ground. Patent Pending Buckle System more reliable than traditional \"daisy-chain\" straps\" Easily adjusts using attached high-strength buckles.
