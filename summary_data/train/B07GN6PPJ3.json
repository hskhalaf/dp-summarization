The next morning water was beaded up on the outside of the cover, but the seat and other areas where the cover was in contact were damp, leading me to think the cover was more water repellant than waterproof. Since then I have built a small carport to park the ATV under so I may not get the chance to test it in direct rain any time soon. However, I'm sure it will protect it from snow and dust and anything else that blows in.",
