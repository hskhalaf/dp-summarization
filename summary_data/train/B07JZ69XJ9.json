Will obviously hold moisture when you\u2019re swimming,showering or get your entire hands submerged in water/washing your hands.

This Christmas, I got a new Apple Watch and searched for a protective cover. This is the cover I chose. I am absolutely pleased with the cover. It was easy to install, does not really show and absolutely does not interfere with the functionality of the watch or the rose gold color. If anything, it makes it more reflective. I was so pleased with this product, that I ordered them for my son for his new Apple Watch! Thank you for such a great product!",

Origins review: It gets dingy really quick! Idk why that is but it has this ashy look to it after about a weeks wear. The TPU IS OK. Works decently nothing special. Does not work if you\u2019re a swimmer or sweat a lot. I wash my hands constantly and once a drop of water gets under it, it can\u2019t recognize touch.",

They do seem to scuff easily, but I just look at that as a mark that isn't on my watch! And the scuffs are only visibly when the screen is black. They don't interfere with seeing the face.

However, every single time I wash my hands, a small amount of water will splash on the watch and get trapped under the protector, which makes the touch screen not work and makes the screen difficult to see. In order to clear it you have to remove at least one side of the protector which can only be done by removing one side of the watch band. This makes it unacceptable for me - I can't be taking my watch off, removing the band, and cleaning the protector every time I wash my hands all day long.",

With the line of work I\u2019ve have done, and am doing, my watch seems to be the scape goat of every door frame, cooking utensil, or mail box. This casing protects the sides, and glass from scratches, and dirt. However, the work my husband does, makes him sweat, and his casing gets wet under it, but no fear! We just followed directions and smeared some dawn dish liquid on the inside, which seems to be working thus far. Thanks for providing a great protection for my clumsy self and the watch I wear, and my husbands watch!!!",

Yes, the watch is water proof, but to remove the water, you have to completely disassemble the watch by taking off both bands, then taking off the case, and then wiping out the case and the watch.
