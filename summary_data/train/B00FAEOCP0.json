      "text": "Honestly I don't understand the crazy hype about this mascara. It curls well, sure, but doesn't help with length or volume. It also flakes, and doesn't go on smooth. And don't even think about putting it over a lash primer - it won't coat your lashes at all then. In all, it's probably close to the worst quality mascara I've tried. The one plus I can think of, is that it doesn't smudge. But then again, generally quality mascaras don't anyhow. I hope this helps! Maybe I just got a bad batch?",

Unfortunately I found this mascara clumpy and heavy. I like it when my mascara separates my lashes then makes each individual lash thicker and longer. This did the complete opposite. It made my lashes stick together, look super sparse and clumpy. It also took the curl away from my lashes, because it was so heavy. I really wanted to love it, but I guess I'm with the few it didn't work for. I VERY rarely give one star, but I can't find anything positive to say about this product.",

I take it off when I get in the shower by wetting my lashes. It doesn\u2019t smear away, but rather turns into a soft paste on your lashes that you can easily remove by combing them with your fingers. Doesn\u2019t leave me with raccoon eyes. I\u2019ve worn it to the beach before and it\u2019ll still stay on your lashes when they\u2019re wet, as long as you don\u2019t touch them. Literally amazing. Only \u201ccompliant\u201d is it doesn\u2019t make my lashes as FULL as i\u2019d like. Could use improvement in the brush aspect but I\u2019m still buying it again.",

      "text": "The brush has short bristles, not holding much mascara on it. It applies with thin, barely noticeable layer on on my lashes. Feels like it's a little dried out. Wore it for the day and when I tried to remove it with eye makeup remover it stuck like glue. Felt like trying to remove waterproof mascara with water. Took some effort with baby oil to remove it all and ended up taking some eyelashes in the process :(",

First it doesn't flake off, second it washes off without leaving black smudges under the eyes and the same can be said if you fall asleep with it on. One thing I would prefer is a fatter brush. I like my mascara to go on heavy and thick without clumping and I think if the brush was fat in the middle and came to a point it would provide thicker coverage without clumping. Also I would say that you can't really re-apply so if you want a light look for work and then heavy to go out after it ends up just looking like you glued your lashes together.",

At first I was skeptical to buy sit since I never heard of this brand before and its price is comparable to other more popular ones. I am so glad I bought it based on feedback. I have been using this mascara for over two weeks and it is as good as on the first try. It does what it promises to do: voluminizes my eyelashes beautifully, no crumps, doesn't smear through the day, and even gives some length. I have normal to long eyelashes, but I like them to look full and vibrant and this product does the trick. 100% recommended.",
