In small households with run a large dishwasher with a partial load, or let them sit until the machine is full - not particularly hygienic. With a counter top, one can clear up daily dishes, with only the odd time when a second wash is necessary - as when doing lots of baking, etc. This machine is quiet,several nights I have gotten up to check that I actually turned it on, it was so quiet. B,it, you\u2019ll like it.",

What's the use of having a dishwasher when you have to clean the dishes before you put them in the dishwasher? You might as well as finish cleaning them yourself and not pay money for this!",

The combined time is still less than a standard load. This does have a very high-pitched house when it runs. I don't seem to notice but I have friends ask about when it's in when they're over. I couldn't be happier with this purchase. It's changed my least favorite thing about my home.",

Now I rinse dishes and put them in the dishwasher until it's full then fire it up. It sits where the dish strainer always sat so I really didn't lose any space. The quick connect hose is very convenient. It's been great having this in my home and I would recommend it for couples with one or two children tops.",
