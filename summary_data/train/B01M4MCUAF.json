I\u2019m impressed with the customer service of this company. My concerns were dealt with promptly and I\u2019m excited to see the results from using this Vitamin C serum This is my first foray into Vitamin C serum. I really didn\u2019t know what to expect, though I would have expected a bottle to be completely full. Half of this bottle was bubbles and air.",
