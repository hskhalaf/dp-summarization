It does more than I expected it would, picture quality exceeds my expectations also. I can't stop taking photographs and I need to delete very few of them. Photograph more edit less works for me.",

There is a very wide auto-bracketing range which is useful in difficult light especially if you know how to stitch them together using photoshop or lightroom, a much better solution than built in HDR. Pick a good lens and it will take truly excellent photos the way you want them with very little effort to learn its tricks. Not as many megapixels as some, but again if you know what you are doing you can take multiple 'panoramic' exposures and blend them together with photoshop.",
