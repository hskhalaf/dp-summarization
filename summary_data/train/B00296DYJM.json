      "text": "The first can I used was good and the valve cover turned out looking great. When it came time to use the second can on the intake manifold it was awful, like almost no copper color to it at all, it was almost silver colored. I had to order more to redo the job. Otherwise I'm happy with the paint and looks like it will hold up well.",
