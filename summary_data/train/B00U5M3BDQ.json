      "text": "I hate installing/applying screen protectors. Regardless of how carefully I try to operate, there's inevitably some spec of dust under the protector or a bubble I can't smooth out. But this one was different. Completely. I followed the instructions and used the materials supplied, and I was pleasantly shocked that, when I laid the protector on top of my screen, it basically self-installed. No dust, no bubbles, nothing but a clear, clean screen. So far, I really like it. The screen image is crisp and clear, and it's not prone to getting fingerprints and smudges like the ones I've bought in the past. Would definitely buy this brand again.",

      "text": "I'm going to assume that it's a GOOD thing that my daughters and I used JETech Screen Protector for our iPhones and have had the experience of the screen doing its job--breaking instead of the screen itself. It's my understanding that the protector's tempered glass will sacrifice itself for the sake of the iPhone screen. On at least two occasions an iPhone has fallen onto the pavement and the screen protector is cracked--but the phone is fine! Meanwhile, the JETech Screen Protector doesn't scratch or get as greasy/filmy as others I've used. As long as you take your time while applying the cover (and removing it when necessary), it's easy to apply and remove.",

Great buy and like that it comes with two protectors.",

I was able to attach the screen to my phone extremely easily, with zero bubbles. On top of that, I feel like it's way more clearer than the Zagg Glass protector. It's a little thicker than the Zagg, but nothing horrible. I am very happy I made this purchase instead of another Zagg.",

The cutouts for the camera and home button are accurate for the most part, compared to cheaper screen protectors. Screen feels natural and 3D Touch works perfectly. The only con would be that it does not cover the entire screen of the phone. There is a small portion (maybe 3mm wide) around the screen that is not covered. Overall, good product. Protects your phone like it is supposed to.",

Once it's on, go over it with a microfiber (or similar) to really seal it down. Totally recommend buying this item to protect your iPhone. \u2764\ufe0f",
