My kids love working for rewards, but also lose tickets for specific instances of disrespect, etc. They are learning that some things are just expected or they lose tickets for not doing them. Everything is not a reward, but it's a learning experience. Best system I've found for where we are with our 6 and 8 year old. Customer service is exceptional as well -- visit the website and email your questions. Top notch service.",

Review what chores have been completed throughout the day & what has been earned. Pay them their tickets for that day and together choose new chores for the next day. A common time is in the evening. They will be excited to plan what they will earn next! \n\nTips: \n- Pay for the Work For Tickets chore cards only when the Responsibility chores cards are completed. \n- Offer double payment if they do all their chores without complaint. \n- When your child completes a chore, have them turn it around & place it behind any other cards in that pocket. At a glance you can see if all the child\u2019s chores have been completed. \n\nExample: \n- Parent decides to pay child 1 ticket per completed chore & if all the chores are completed for that day without complaint they agree to double the tickets per chore. \n-Child does all the chores without complaint and earns a total of 8 tickets for that day. \n- For this example the parent is willing to pay .25 per ticket or 15 minutes of screen time. \n- This child decides to use 6 tickets for 1.5 hours of screen time. \n- Each day the child does the same thing. At the end of the week the child earned 56 tickets by doing 28 chores without complaint, enjoyed 10.5 hours of screen time, earned a playdate from the family store for 10 tickets, & pocketed $1.00. \n\nWOW! Twenty-eight more chores in a week! Your child feels great about what they\u2019ve accomplished, is learning new skills, & how to manage time & money!",
