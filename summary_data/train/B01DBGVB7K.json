I was looking for a light weight solution to get me out of my office when I just needed to use the internet, google docs etc. Figured for $200 it would just be a nice little cheap toy. This thing is pretty amazing. Nice keyboard, decent screen, great webcam (to use mostly with Hangouts) good speakers and its really fast. I watched about 4 hours of videos on battery and it only went down to 79% full. Solid unit, very happy with purchase.",

It\u2019s perfectly good for basic function like Google Docs, web browsing etc. I am very disappointed in the quality of the video connection when she uses zoom to log into her live classes. She constantly complained about it freezing and being glitchy on zoom calls with her class. We have other devices on the same Wi-Fi network that are working perfectly. I think it\u2019s due to the low processing speed of this device. I wish I had bought her a faster processing speed basically it was a waste of money for distance-learning.",

Because he had used a Chromebook at school, he jumped right in and was able to use it. I was concerned about the small size because he was used to a large monitor but it has turned out to be perfect for him. He loves the touch pad and the keyboard is fine. Overall, I would recommend this for a elementary age child.",

She throws it in her bacpack (no sleeve or cover) and it seems to take whatever she can guve it. For less than $200, pretty much the perfect computer for her. Connects easily to whatever WiFi is around, works seamlessly with all Google stuff (photos, drive, contacts, etc.)",

Since Chrome is built on top of Linux XFCE, it's actually pretty easy to revert the system to Linux and be able to switch back and forth between Chrome and Linux. I can't use it quite like a desktop and I don't have a cloud-capable printer which sucks, but it's great for on the go. No regrets.",
