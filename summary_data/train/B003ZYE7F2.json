My twins have not used them yet themselves as they are still in the throwing phase but I use the bowls to mix yogurt and the plates to serve their blueberries, etc. I mostly wash them by hand as I use them multiple times per day but I have run them through the dishwasher and they did not appear to gain more wear from it. These were a great deal and should last for quite some time.",

I've cut my daughters meals up on these places using my expensive steak knives and they haven't left any cut marks on the plates. My favorite part is these dishes even though they are plastic they do not get stained by dark or red foods they wash up perfectly. I plan to purchase another set very soon.",

      "text": "This is a great set for a toddler/preschooler. The colors are vibrant and the fishy design is exciting for the kids. The cups are perfect. My only complaint is that the bowls and plates are a little on the small side. So if you're looking for a deeper bowl or \"dinner size\" plate, then you should skip this set. If you're getting it in conjunction with other plates/bowls that are bigger, then this is a perfect addition to that. Also, I love that they can go in the dishwasher & they're BPA free!",
