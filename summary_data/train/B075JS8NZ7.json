The 'large' bezel, ''poor' Android integration and 'limited' functionality of Chrome OS are not issues for me and seem to be have exaggerated by some reviewers.",

The charging LED was not illuminated and the battery icon didn't change. After few trials, I realized the charging cable was broken already. (I used my own type-c cable, then it works.) I checked the dysfunctional cable. It looked different from the type-c cable I already have (for my Pixel phone). A USB type-C supposes to have 24 pins, however the one I get was missing lots of pins (on both sides). It's really difficult to understand how could this happen to a new product. Kind of disappointed.",

When the device would go to sleep it would take multiple attempts to turn it back on. Got to the point I turned off sleep mode, and stopped having the issue. I recently was having trouble with apps crashing, so I figured I would reboot. I turned off the device and now it won't turn back on. Brought the device to a recommended repair place and they say they can't fix it, likely a motherboard issue. Less than 2 years and the device is a brick. Too expensive for that to happen.",
