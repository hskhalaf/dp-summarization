      "text": "Strong, weather resistant, and very long-lasting. I strung 6 strands through the wisteria and roses and clematis and up in the crepe myrtle tree in the back garden for an amazing year-round, magical effect. They transformed the garden in the evenings and I could rarely bring myself to turn them off at night. They were switched off sometimes but they burned almost continuously in the heat and cold and rain - no snow - until they started blinking out after about 18 months. I'm happily replacing every strand plus a few more. The light is slightly golden - not white - and is ideal for subtle twinkles and glow.",
