If I didn't have a case, I wouldn't be at all concerned with the lining potentially scratching. The canvas is a nice quality, and the little case it comes with it awesome. It fit my external hard drive, battery pack, or power adapter perfectly. Love that!",

Inside was soft and the smaller pouch was nice as it unzipped all the way to ends rather than halfway down sides. It had same soft light gray lining. Canvas feels very rough and harsh, imho. Design was a nice dark black/white however, just as pictured.",
