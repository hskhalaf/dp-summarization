If the batter swings under the ball, he/she is not hitting a stiff black tube like the cheaper tees and thus won't knock over the whole tee itself.

It also raises and lowers super easy; my 9 year old can do it no problem. Overall.... really nice.",

    "title": "TANNER TEE the ORIGINAL | Premium Baseball/Softball Batting Tee w/ Tanner Original Base, Patented Hand-rolled FlexTop, and Easy Height Adjustments for Ages 9 & up, Metal/Black, Adjustable Height: 26\" - 43\" (TT001)",
    "description": "The Tanner Tee (Adult/Standard Adjustable 26-43 inch) is our most popular and universal Tanner batting tee, comprised of two parts, an adjustable metal stem and a nine-inch weather resistant base. This is a top seller, backed by quality, unsolicited reviews from Tanner Tee customers. Our tees are used by all levels of professional baseball, top college and high school programs, and thousands of home hitters. \nThe FlexTop ball rest is a tightly wound durable cone and allows your bat to pass through the contact point with the least interference, which means bats are not damaged by rigid tee tops and most importantly feedback off the tee is true. \nThere are similar tees at various price points and features. You can pay less for a plastic version of a Tanner Tee, but remember a metal bat will contact your batting tee with velocity - quality parts and workmanship matters! Our founder Joe Tanner invented the adjustable rolled-rubber batting tee 30 years ago, and we proudly stand behind every Tanner Tee we build. Every tee is built and quality controlled by the same family that's been doing it for 25 years.",
