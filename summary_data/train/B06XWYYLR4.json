I thought I was going the way of Dorothy's house in the Wizard of Oz's house. Not only did the tent perform flawlessly, I stayed 100% dry. The photos were taken up at the Guyot Campsite 11 miles into the Pemigewasset Wilderness in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. As you can see you don't have much extra room for a card table or anything like that. The tent is easy to set up and take down too. The stretch cord in the pools pulls the pieces together in seconds.",
