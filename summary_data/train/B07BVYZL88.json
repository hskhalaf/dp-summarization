The only thing I've ever tried that occasionally comes close to this in terms of whiteness are products from the UK and Korea, which can both be very hard to source out here in the States. If you have chronic red eye, or your eyes easily become red when taking certain medications, these drops definitely deserve a close look.",

I got on Amazon, ordered it, and couldn't open the package fast enough once received. It absolutely works well, fast and for hours. I am really happy with this product!",
