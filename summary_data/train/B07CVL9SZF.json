I can also use the Philips Hue App to control the lights while I am away, much better than having a light come on using a timer. You can also turn the lights on using the button on the switch and also control the dimmer using the switch.",

You need the power button to put it in pairing mode. this is extremely annoying and I'm starting to wish i'd just gotten a different model.",

It was easy to install, and the depth of the switch is the same as our previous switch so it fit into the existing box with no difficulties. Pairing the new switch with the Echo Plus was a snap. My only complaint for which I deducted one star is the location of the ground wire. It is riveted to the mounting flange in such a way that the ground wire partially blocks the mounting screw hole, and the wire holds the bottom of the switch out about 1/32\" from the box so the cover plate doesn't quite sit flush against the wall.",
