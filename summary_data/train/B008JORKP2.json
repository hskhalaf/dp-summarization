I had some ceramic logs that we also put on, as it was mentioned in another review that it gave the flames a more lifelike feel. It put out decent heat, we actually had to turn it down and back away a few times. Was a perfect substitute for camping in an area where campfire and charcoal grills were prohibited due to fire danger. Very happy with the fire pit and would definitely recommend",

Overall it was just what he wanted. We have only had it a short time so I can't speak to durability.",

If you have 2-6 people around it, everyone can stay comfortable and warm if it's cool. Just don't suggest roasting anything over it, as the briquetes you get with them are not easy to clean. It does come with replacements, but just a few and to buy new ones is expensive, so I just say use for a decorative and warm fire.",

We haven't gone through much gas as many have said on other reviews. The size is perfect, there was no odor or smell.

It puts out a good amount of heat and we were quite surprised as we used it for Thanksgiving, and the extended family sat around it on our deck. We have a wood fire pit but this is so much more convenient and easy, not to mention the lack of the smell of smoke in hair and clothes.",

The heat radiates probably only a foot or two away, but with lawn/camp chairs next to it, our feet and bodies were comfortable. I would recommend buying the lid for this, it makes hauling this around and keeping the rocks intact easy and clean. We would purchase this again.",

It is well made and a very good deal. You can buy the same thing from a big box hardware store for about the same price but I prefer Amazon just for the speed it arrived. Easy to set up, and use right out of the box. I see us using this probably on a daily basis and taking it places because it is very portable and light.",

Throws off some heat! Ok, if its 40 degrees out or windy, this won't get it. But if it's a nice fall or spring night and about 55 or more, this will be great to take the chill off. I'm a very picky buyer, and this was very portable, and well constructed. I had no problems setting it up or operating it. No smoke either!!! Highly recommended.",

I can have my sparker going when I turn the gas on and I still get a big poof of flames. Get a long sparker/lighter and stand back. We travel with this so I ordered the metal cover. Also worth every penny. Fits perfectly and acts as a handle to carry it.",

Now no more worries about smoke, flying embers, or the hassle of putting out a real wood wood fire. The main con you don't get the real wood smell. The pros outweigh that one con though. Gas consumption seems very good.",

It gives off a nice flame and we actually roasted hot dogs and s'mores with it. It will warm you up on a cool evening as well. The pit itself is nice looking too. Very pleased with it (and plus...you don't smell like a campfire).",

No chopping and hauling wood required. You can even roast wieners or marshmallows if you want. My sister in law saw it and had me order one for her hubby too!",
