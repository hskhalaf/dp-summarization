Not really for rocking out but a perfect replacement for missing or gigantic PC speakers, comes with 2 patch cords and works with almost any MP3 player, game system etc. Nice case and AAA battery optional operation as well.

Though I will say that the review that describes this as producing sound on par to that of a top-notch portable stereo is a bit overstated. I'd say it's more like decent computer speakers. Then again, I'm kind of a sound snob. I'd have given it 5 stars if the sound could rattle my living room windows. One minor bad point, the cradle didn't fit my PSP Slim God of War Edition. Hardly a deal-breaker though. All in all an excellent product.",

It looks like the PSP and nestles it nicely in between the speakers in a well made stand. It also allows for portable usage through four AAA batteries, not included however. Good buy for those who enjoy UMD viewing either on the go or at home.",
