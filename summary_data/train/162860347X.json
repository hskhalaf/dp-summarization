There is a lot of mis-information and even some potentially dangerous suggestions/information out there related to the ketogenic diet so it's difficult to know where to start and who to trust. This book solves that problem and then some! It's full of practical advice for how to tackle beginning a ketogenic diet and ways to tweak it. It has information on the science in a way that's easy to understand, and it has so many amazing recipes! I got a copy for me and one for my mom - so impressed.",

I'm so excited to cook my way through this cookbook. Also, this cookbook has so many beautiful images (one thing I cannot stand is a cookbook without complementary pictures) so you know exactly what the finish product will look like.

I love that this book begins chock-a-block full of actual information about how Keto works, the process, etc. I also love that there is an explaination of how there is plenty of room to be Keto in different ways, and you don\u2019t necessarily need to count every macro for the rest of your life (a departure from many other books). The ONE drawback is that all the meals are non-dairy, which we are not, but, it shouldn\u2019t be too difficult to find dairy swap-ins and that doesn\u2019t bother me one little bit.",

Anyone who has prior experience cooking real, Whole Foods will be terribly disappointed in the recipe section. She also uses a lot of ingredients that are not readily available in a rural area. I would have given this book 3 stars, but it doesn\u2019t claim to be a cook book, so I think that was unfair",

I have had so much success on the Keto diet, and this book has given me the inspiration to permanently eat Keto. It explains everything. I will be referring to this book forevermore! It is about being healthy, and it truly explains which foods to eat and why. I received the book yesterday, and I am almost done reading it. I simply feel empowered, and it has validated this way of eating for me, and it has given me reminders about why Keto is so good for your body! I highly recommend it!",

I already feel more equipped to make good choices for my health because I'm using my brain when I go to make decisions and not just my emotions and appetite. Diane Sanfilippo rocks!!",
