Living in a hot, humid environment I work up a sweat when I workout outside so I really wanted a detergent that would get the stink out of my gym clothes. After both soaking/washes my gym clothes had a stinky smell to them. On the 3rd wash I did 1 cup vinegar in a hot wash. Next I did 1/2 a cup of baking soda in a hot wash. Smell was gone!!! My gym clothes had no smell at all in them. Save yourself some money and buy a big box of baking soda and a jug of White Vinegar if you want to clean your gym clothes right.",

So far 5 sweaty classes in and my clothes don't stink during or after yoga. WOW!!!!",

Laundry perfumes, sports detergent, Pine cleaner. Nothing worked. Once my freshly laundered exercise clothes became sweaty I could smell the stew. Then I saw a commercial on Facebook for this detergent. I was skeptical but hopeful. Guess what? It worked! After using this detergent I don't smell like beef stew any more.",

My workout clothes used to have that weird odor after 10 minutes of exercising and now they stay fresh. I would recommend soaking all your exercise clothes in the sink for an hour and then put them in the washing machine, when you first order this product and you will immediately notice a difference. Now I add a scoop to every wash. I also wash all my workout clothes and sports bras separately to other clothes and air dry them all as i think the dryer can affect the smell!",

I did it a third time and at this time I was certain that my clothes were clean as the water stayed clean.
