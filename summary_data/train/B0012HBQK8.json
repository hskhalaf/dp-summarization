It is where the sanigloss material meets regular porcelain. It has been there since day one. I thought I could live with it, since the toilet does flush well and is quiet. But now after 16 months, I'm done!!! I have been diligent about keeping these things clean to no avail. Nothing works. I bought three of these nightmare toilets and will now have to replace all of them..",

The tank is much smaller than our old toilets, which would seem to indicate that they use less water per flush too. The toilets are bright white.

My husband installed it and it worked so great that we purchased another one for our 2nd bathroom. It arrived today.... Days earlier than expected!

I never would have thought such a toilet could be had for such a reasonable price. Also, the packaging and delivery was wonderful and the toilet seat is a must!",
