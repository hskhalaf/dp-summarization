So you\u2019ll be stuck with a chain of wipes between you and the warmer, shaking your arm until they separate and then you\u2019ve got wipes scattered around the place and wasted.

The instructions say they recommend Costco wipes because they are cheap and have a continuous feed. We haven\u2019t tried those yet but I know this works well with the Pampers Pure wipes!",

In fact when we change him if and he's calm or not fully awake he doesn't not startle or scream!

      "text": "All in all it did have a positive impact on diaper change time. There are couple of things that you hav to do using it though. Add water to make wipes moist enough. Keep the wipe pile stocked enough, small amount will result in cold wipes, as the warmer doesn't reach lover level of the box. Also, the lid that feeds the dipers- separates them at all time, so I just end up opening the whole thing every single time I need a wipe. Otherwise I am happy with the purchase and I would recommend it to everyone",

There have been a few reviews with temperature control and burnt wipes, but I've not had any issues and I've been using this for 3 months now. The nightlight is pretty useless as it's not very bright if using by itself, but handy to turn on to check how many wipes you have left. The locks on the side that keep the container closed come lose occasionally but you just click them back into place, so it's not really a big deal for me personally.",
