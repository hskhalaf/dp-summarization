I've always wanted to make oyster rockefellars more often but hard to unless I have fresh oysters in shells. Plus they are hard to shuck if you need to feed many people. These were answers to my dilemma! They clean up well and look great! Many people couldn't even tell they weren't real shells. Thank god some asked if they should just throw them away when they got done eating it. Otherwise they would have ended up in my trash!! Expensive but highly recommend.",

These look just like the real thing!!! They work not only will in the oven and under a broiler but, work well on the grill too! I used to have to shuck my own oysters for events like this. Now I can just buy them already shucked and put them into these shells for doing them raw on the half Shell or under the broiler with whatever you might want to top them with!!!

I tosed the empty shells in hot, and slightly-soapy water and they cleaned up beautifully. Great purchase!!",

Cleaning was not as easy as some reviews stated, but they are ceramic and it was expected on my part. How does one get in touch with the seller?
