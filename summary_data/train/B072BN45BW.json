Today I grabbed the handle to slide it forward a little as it was in the way and the handle stiching completely gave way with little to no force. Not impressed and I can't find manufacturer contact info for the warranty. The stiching isn't great on the panels but for my needs I was able to look past that .",

The only thing I don't like about it is the fact that it slides on the hardwood floors. Otherwise it is very good. I think it is a good quality mat because the padding is thick and the covering is also thick. My friends and I have made up 3 different routines together.",

For a mat at this price point don't expect it to be like the high dollar mats at most gyms.

      "text": "My daughter received her tumbling mat today! We\u2019ve only had it for about 3 hours but I couldn\u2019t wait to give you our review! The product was packaged great. My daughter picked the purple mat and it looks exactly like the color online. It\u2019s bright and just a really pretty color in general! She is using this to practice her tumbling, she does competitive cheerleading. She had it outside then brought it inside, we had to wipe it down already it it wiped clean very easily. So far it seems very durable. I know my daughter is extremely satisfied with this purchase, which makes me one satisfied mom for this mat!",

It was shipped with no damages. The box was beat up but luckily the actual mat had no issues. My son loves it when ever he wants to wrestle, jump around or flip he pulls his mat out. I\u2019m so happy we purchased this for him.",

Before we set it up in my daughter's gym I used it for a couple yoga sessions at home and it was perfect. Great size and comfortable to use! I am considering purchasing another one to create a yoga area in the garage for myself! My only complaint was that It took forever to arrive! We purchased it on April 22 and it arrived May 15th!",

It's been a month later and no once has called back. I can understand being closed during the lockdown, but we are past that with many companies open.
