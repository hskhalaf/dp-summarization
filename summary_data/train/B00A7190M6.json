      "text": "I'm a guitar teacher with several students over the years. I always have them buy an inexpensive guitar, those do not come with cases. I ordered this case to see how good it is. It meets all expectations! Great quality gig bag for an acoustic guitar. They have many cases for different needs. I highly recommend this to all my students and anyone that needs a good protective gig bag for their guitar. On a plus side, it comes with picks and a strap also. It's padded and has shoulder straps making it easy for the student to carry! More bang for the buck! You won't be disappointed!",

They also offer a free set of picks and strap, but they are just incidental. This would be the best deal even without the freebees! I probably will never use the strap or any of the picks, I'll just give them away. The best part about it is that it only costs $25! Buy it for God's sake!",

I took my home recording stuff with me on vacation recently and this stowed my MIDI keyboard and audio interface with room to spare. It's a gig bag so I wouldn't risk dropping it or anything, but the rubber fenders on the corners are very reassuring against all the bumps against things that inevitably happen. Can't believe they're making money off of it at this price. If you've got a pointy guitar or bass and can't find or afford a hard case that will fit it, then you need this. It will solve all your problems.",

After a few more lessons , the other zipper completely broke off and the zipper itself broke in half. The zipper on this was just terrible quality and hard to zip.

I needed an odd-sized bag for a smaller acoustic-electric, and this baby did the job. The item also came with a product catalog that had a bunch of burnt-out looking heavy metal endorsees, and this gave me quite a few laughs. Very satisfied with this purchase.",

Had a hard time finding the guitar strap and guitar picks that were supposed to come with the case but I did find them. They looked real new and professional. The guitar picks were a variety of colors but the case was black and the guitar strap was black. I got the guitar case real quick and in good condition. It fit my acoustic Gibson steel string guitar perfectly. I was almost afraid it would not but it did. I put my guitar strap and my guitar picks in the front pocket so I wouldn't lose them and always have them with my guitar.",

I mean, it is not a 500.00 bag, so if it was, it would get a 1 or 2, but it is really nice for price and solid and she keeps her stuffed animal hanging out the back.",

It may have just been a packaging or a shipping mistake but I gave up and will look somewhere else.",

As long as your guitar fits (My guitar is 43\" and fits nicely) and you're not looking for a shell type case, this gig bag is perfect. It's a heavy duty material with heavy duty zippers. Good balance when holding it by either handle and very comfortable when wearing the shoulder straps. It does come with a guitar strap but only 4 picks, not the 12 shown in the picture. But even if it came with nothing, this is still the best $25 you're going to spend. . . I'm very happy with this purchase. And, as usual with Amazon, it arrived almost before I finished ordering.",

Well, I received the product a few days ago and I'm happy to report that product met dimensional and functional expectations. The quality of the materials on this bag is good for the price paid and the functionality is enhanced by its many pockets and straps to carry the bag as a backpack. Cushion is not the very best but appears to be sufficient to protect my instrument on those occasional trips to guitar class. It was great that it arrived with extra picks and a strap. Thank you.",

What it IS is a very well built gig bag with a decent amount of padding and plenty of pockets. The only part that I think could be better would be the backpack straps, they fill a little flimsy. The carry handle is great, though.",
