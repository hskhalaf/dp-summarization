I like it better than the organizers that have a top cover. And the little pouch is great for coins or cash and fits an apple iphone xs max...barely.",

On our first trip, we took our daughter to Disneyland and this came in handy. It held her water, milk, 3 pairs of sunglasses, an external charger for our phones, and snacks. It also held up when we gate-checked the stroller. We were running extremely late and I was too frazzled to remember to put the stroller in the gate-check bag. It was still there on the other end of our flight looking as good as new.",

It probably only has a few more good months before it completely rips apart. The front zipper is a great idea, however if you put more than 3-4 things in it, the weight pulls the zipper apart and its unzipped and fallen onto the floor several times already. I will purchase a similar product by a different company to replace this one. Hopefully it will last longer.",

Kind of a pain either way because the stroller seat is heavy but then taking off the organizer is also a pain because you have to take off the Velcro and then loop it through again when putting it back on",

Slim, lays well, and gives me just enough extra space. I do think this would be perfect if it had a mesh bag that rolls down like others I've seen, and if there was a better place to store your phone. There's no real place for a phone other than throwing it in the main center compartment that doesn't close. I am going to try and add my own little mesh pocket somewhere. They should also add a snap or velcro closure at least for certain compartment.",

The Britax cup holders have a formed shaped, I like that the skip hop cup holders give me more flexibility. The open space between the two cup holders makes for easier access.

Many other organizers have much wider straps which would interfere. The cup holders on either end of the organizer are neoprene but not lined with wire (the middle section is lined) so they can bend inward when the stroller is folded and keep the overall footprint slim unlike organizers that have wire throughout. Ample storage in middle compartment (easily holds sippy cup or wallet or phone) and zippered compartment (also good for smaller phone or keys) just in front is a plus. No complaints whatsoever.",
