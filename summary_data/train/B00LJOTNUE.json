There is only major fault and that is the crazy high resolution of the screen (although the detail is amazing). In most cases it's fine, but I use quite a few programs that do not scale well and the menus and writing can get so tiny as to be very tricky to read. This can be resolved by reducing the resolution however if you are using a program for a while.",
