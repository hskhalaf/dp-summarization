The only drawback is that while wearing the sneaker, I started to feel as if my feet were too flat against the flooring/ground with each step. Then I realized it was because there is almost no arch support in these shoes. I had to go out and buy a pair of arch supports; once they were inserted, I felt the difference immediately. The sneaker just fit better overall and that sense of being \"flatfooted\" was no longer there.",

However...this last pair came with shoelaces that will probably break in another week or so. Quality of the laces that are paired with this high quality sneaker is more than disappointing -- especially since the price keeps going up, albeit expected. History: 1st pair came with a sturdy, grey lace that matched the shoe. Really nice. The 2nd pair came with sturdy, white laces. Not as nice looking but still nice quality laces. This 3rd pair's laces are beyond acceptable for this price point. Yes, I know, just a nit.",
