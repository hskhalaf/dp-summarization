So be careful not to over cook your food! Still working on getting timing right for baked goods, but most turn out pretty good. I have found that baked goods cook more evenly if the size is small, like cupcakes or muffins rather than a whole cake. Love the feature to line up the angle of the sun; and the oven works much better if you actually use that feature. Unlike some other reviews, I've had no problems with quality or ease of use. Would highly recommend.",

Other than aligning the oven with the sun occasionally, this dish required no attention. I even used the oven to cook the pasta in the second of the two pans (they stack) that came with my oven. Here in SoCal there is plenty of sun for cooking. The Sun Oven is easy enough to use, although the leg in the back for tilting the oven toward the sun could have been designed better. I think the benefit I appreciate most is that I am cooking without fossil fuels. The sun's energy is clean and free.",

The only thing about the product and is difficult for us to do is take a picture of a damaged rack for the dehydrating. They will replace it if we send/email a picture free of charge. The only problem is we don't have the technology to do that. Otherwise, I highly recommend this product, because it works as stated and is great. Of course it is peak of the summertime, and we haven't used it in the winters sun, but I am sure it will work just as well.",

The interior of the house stays cooler and the A/C unit doesn't have to work so hard. The new features which include the thermometer, siting capability, cooking racks, and pans are great.

The adjustable leg on the back and the shadow-eyes on the front make it extremely easy to keep this properly oriented. We've only cooked soups and roasts so far, and they were perfect. Although it is sturdily constructed, it is light enough for me (small, middle-aged woman) to carry it out and plop it in the sun and then quick clean up and return when done. Between this and the Solsource parabolic cooker we bought, I'm looking forward to not heating up the kitchen this summer. Plus, I know that we'll be able to cook and purify water in the event of emergencies.",

I use the oven primarily to cook foods that require a lot of boiling, like beans. Dry beans get done within 3-4 hours in the sun oven and that keeps the smells and steam from the beans out of my house. My house stays cool and I don't have to constantly watch for a pot over boiling. The oven beats a slow cooker for this cause the slow cooker puts out a great deal of heat inside a kitchen.

The larger size & all the accessories allow me to cook more at once for my large family without using any electricity, no heating the house in the hot summer, then using even more electricity (A/C) to cool it back down, plus less environmental impact!!!
