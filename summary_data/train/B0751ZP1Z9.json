Meanwhile, I will never buy this particular shoe again. I'm surprised at New Balance to risk their reputation on it. I was deceived by the picture (but then I must not have zoomed-in) and I was not familiar with this construction type. An additional problem, for me, is the \"football-player-type\" cleated soles which, with the thing inner soles, makes walking in this shoe like walking on unfinished concrete in my stockings. The only good feature is that this shoe looks good, to others, from a distance.",
