I use them to get my zero turn in and out of my shed, and since the tires are offset I was looking for something wide enough to fit front and rear tires so I wouldn't have to do precision driving every time so I don't fall off the ramps. They do a perfect job and make getting in and out a breeze. Really light as well and easy to move around without breaking your back. I don't use the straps for my shed, but used them to try getting my mower into a a pickup which worked just fine with this length on a 1500 truck. They are very sturdy with only light flexing.",

From generators wirh their wheels to freezers with a hand truck its been a blessing to have this asset. This tool has been useful for us in moments of disgrace as victims of hurricane Maria moving people, equipment and tools. Moreover, I believe that every truck owner must consider have ramps like those in their vehicles, house or work.",
