And when I actually used this peculator I found it to be of low quality. I've had old peculators in the past (not made in China) and they performed far much better. The \"basket\" and the \"spreader\" units of this peculator are made of cheap material. There's no on-off button. Even when I used coffee ground specifically for peculators, the brewed coffee had many \"coffee chunks\" in the cup. I would not recommend this product.",

I have dealt with it for 6 months and now the coffee is barely hot when it is finished. Since it has been 6 months no one will do anything. Terrible customer service.

After 8 months it started tripping the GFCI outlet. Tried another outlet, same thing. Ran it on a non-GFI outlet and it worked fine. Then I checked the connection \"port\" from plug to pot and found it moist and a little contaminated with what could be coffee stains. I'll update this when I try the next pot of coffee. For the record GFCI ( often called GFI ) outlets trip due to grounding/current leakage problems, not due to too much current load. A complete short and high current load would trip your circuit breaker.",

This one keeps it really hot too. The only issue is sometimes it's hard to gauge whether the stick is actually in the hole in the bottom and it doesn't perk the coffee, only makes hot water! Then you have to start all over again. So make sure the stick is for sure in the hole before putting on the lid and plugging in!",

    "description": "Color:Stainless SteelExperience the taste of bold, flavorful coffee with the Hamilton Beach Stainless Steel 12 Cup Percolator. Before single serve and automatic drip coffee makers, there was the percolator. Remember the perking sounds of freshly brewing coffee? Better yet, how about the bold, hot coffee it produced? Coffee brewed in the Hamilton Beach Stainless Steel 12 Cup Percolator is still just as satisfying but takes a lot less time to brew than the percolators of old. This attractive stainless steel percolator stays hot with a gentle keep warm heater. It also has a detachable cord for tabletop serving, cool touch handle and no drip spout for easy pouring. A ready-to-serve light takes the guesswork out of when it\u2019s done. The light indicates brewing is complete and keep warm mode has started.",
