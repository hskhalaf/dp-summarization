This looks good, nice blue comb and comfy to hold. And that\u2019s only good at it. If you cut 3mm which is shortest, comb touching the clipper face and is all good. Retract the comb away and all good is gone. The material they used for comb is so flexible it gives on gentle touch. What does it mean? On 9 mm setting i was cutting anything between 6-9mm having patchy finish. Unusable bad choice of material, not happy with retractable mechanism either, is not as good as on other brands. Bad bad product",

The connector is unlikely to stay in place if trying to use the clipper in 'corded' manner because it doesn't have a retaining clip.. The cable is 1.1 metre. The photo shows a standard UK shaver plug next the braun adaptor, the adaptor is a loose fit in a uk shaver socket.",

It comes with a European plug, but you can use it in shavers sockets usually fitted in bathrooms. I managed to get a pretty decent hair cut on my own, with fades.
