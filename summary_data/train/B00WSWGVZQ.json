This little microfiber mop does a heck of a job and my floors are streak free! My only complaint is that I wish the handle was longer, fully extended, I still have to bend over a fair bit to use elbow grease on areas that need it.",

      "text": "I was looking for a mop that would eliminate me manually wringing it out and decided to try the O-Cedar. What a lot of reviewers have said is true that the mop tends to be very wet. You gotta really step on the lever a good 4-5 times to get most of the water out of the mop. I also think the actual mop is very tiny and covers a small surface area. My husband isn\u2019t very thrilled about that. Also, make sure you store the mop stick downwards if you\u2019re leaving it outside to dry. Any water collected inside it can be a nightmare to get out.",

Only complaint... wish it had two separate compartments in the bucket... one for dirty water one for clean. For example, where you dry to spin it, should be separate from the clean water!

You have the option to remove the mop head, and wash it separately in the washing machine. I would buy it again. Perhaps their next version actually squeezes the mop.",

However, the cost cutting is apparent with everything being plastic with some parts less robust than others. If you buy it on sale as I did and it doesn't last that long then that's how consumerism works in this country today. One obvious improvement I can see would be to split the main bucket into two so the dirty water from the spin chamber can drain into that. Overall, I'd recommend it on sale price, way better than traditional mops or using disposable products like wet swiffers, etc.",

      "text": "I honestly just wanted a basic mop, and stumbled upon this gem while browsing selections. This thing is amazing! It is really light weight, but feels durable. It is very compact, folds up and extends to a good size. The bucket is durable, light, and ingenious. Whomever designed this mop deserves high praise. I don't think I can ever go to a normal mop and bucket again. I will gladly pay a few extra dollars for such great comfort. Thank you for making such a great product.",
