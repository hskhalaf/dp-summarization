They are soft, not too big, no foul odor, smells like a regular kitty treat-maybe fish flavor? These were recommended by my vet for my aging kitty's arthritis. I think it has helped, she doesn't seem to be limping as much. I did this instead of using harsher treatments. She has been taking them for the past few months now. I will continue to buy this product and highly recommend. Kitty approved!",

    "description": "Size:60-countGlycoFlex 2 Hip and Joint Supplement for Cats represents stage 2 of our comprehensive joint support program designed to meet the needs of cats starting to slow down due to age, weight issues or the onset of joint health issues. Recommended by veterinarians for over 30 years, GlycoFlex 2 for cats includes quality joint support ingredients like glucosamine and MSM as well as our signature ingredient perna canaliculus sourced from the waters of New Zealand. Combined these ingredients lubricate and support joint structure and activity to help keep cats healthy and happy.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nGLYCO-FLEX\u00ae II FELINE \nVetri-Science\u00ae Laboratories\u2019 Glyco-Flex\u00ae II Feline combines the multiple benefits of GlycOmega\u00ae brand Perna and our DMG with glucosamine, methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), and manganese. This comprehensive blend of ingredients helps to optimize support of the structure and function of synovial joints in cats with increased need for joint support. \n\nGlycOmega\u00ae contains all major classes of GAGs that occur in connective tissue (joint cartilage, tendons, ligaments, and synovial fluids) like chondroitin sulfates and hyaluronic acid. \n\nRESEARCH AND UNDERSTANDING:\nOver 17 years, researchers have conducted several studies to determine the abilities of Glyco-Flex\u2019s\u00ae main ingredients and the product as a whole. The GlycOmega\u00ae (Perna used in Glyco-Flex) is exclusive to Vetri-Science.\u00ae\n\nOut of top selling brands, Glyco-Flex\u00ae is the only joint support product line registered with the FDA as an animal health product. The GlycOmega\u00ae Perna whole mussel (used exclusively in Vetri-Science GlycoFlex\u00ae products) is the only New Zealand green lipped mussel clinically researched for its impact on the body\u2019s inflammatory response.\n\nPATENTED N,N-DIMETHYLGLYCINE HCL\nGlyco-Flex\u00ae II Feline features our patented DMG, an adaptogen known for its immune support properties. DMG is naturally occurring in small amounts, and assists in methylation processes within the body. This amino acid derivative supports circulation and oxygen utilization, promoting better nutrient delivery to the joint. Vetri-Science\u00ae Laboratories has obtained four patents on DMG backed by 20 years of research. \n\nImage of a healthy Joint ADDED MSM\nBecause Glyco-Flex\u00ae II Feline is designed to represent serious support; we\u2019ve added MSM to our tablet and chewable formulas. MSM, or Methylsulfonylmethane, is an organic, sulfur-containing compound. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), the fundamental building blocks of joint cartilage, are linked together by disulfide bonds (bonds between two sulfur atoms). Because cartilage is in a sulfur-dependent state of quality, MSM supports joint and connective tissue health. \n\nADDED GLUCOSAMINE\nGlyco-Flex\u00ae II stands out because of added glucosamine. A natural compound found in healthy cartilage, glucosamine sulfate is a constituent of glycosaminoglycans in synovial fluid, meaning it supports joint health through promoting synovial fluid viscosity and strength of the cartilage matrix. \n\nEVEN THE TASTE IS OPTIMAL\nAvailable in both a tablet formula and a chicken liver-flavored bite size chew, Glyco-Flex\u00ae II Feline is known for its high palatability.",
