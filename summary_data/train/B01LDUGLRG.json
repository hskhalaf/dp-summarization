The overall comfort of the shoe is good (large toe box, the heel doesn\u2019t rub) but the shoe has very little padding so I don\u2019t see wearing these for lots of walking. I\u2019m going to add an insert with some arch support and see if that helps. But for fashion and light walking, I highly recommend. Very cute and comfortable.",

They don't look or feel cheap, which I'm always worried about when buying cheap shoes online. They fit exactly as expected and weren't tight in any areas. I wouldn't recommend them for long periods of walking as they don't have a lot of support. But for just hanging out in the summer, they're great.",
