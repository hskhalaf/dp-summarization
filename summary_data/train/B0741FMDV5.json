      "text": "These gloves fit well as described and the finger savers are great to have a protection against injuries. It started out as a great glove for my goalkeeper son, who needed it to used it 3 times a week for games through the season. He loved the grip and and fit of the glove but the glove lasted him less than four weeks even though he used another pair as practice glove. Turns out very costly if one has to buy this every less than a month.",

      "text": "These are my gloves after about 25 games. I probably used them on half turf, half grass. The durability is fantastic, and they're still have tons of grip. I can still palm balls with both hands, and can handle any shot that comes my way. My guess is that the people giving bad reviews don't know how to properly care for gloves and don't realize that they need to be wet when used. If you know what you're doing, these gloves will last quite a while. I will probably buy the new blackout colorway next.",

The strap is really strong, takes some force to open it. The quality is first class, they look nice too. Overall I love the gloves. I feel like they do run a little small - I've been buying size 9 from different manufacturers for a long time and this is the first glove that fits very tight on my hand, so I might consider getting a size 10 next time I buy them.",
