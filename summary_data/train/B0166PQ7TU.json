It looks like the paneling is glued to particle board, which you can see between the cracks of the paneling. The item also had a very strong chemical smell. OJ Commerce was not willing to work with me on returning the table until Amazon got involved. They told me that \"pine\" did not describe the type of wood. They also told me to leave the table outside to deal with the chemical smell. The company was the worst if ever had to deal with.",

The set together looks great...coffee table, round end table, nesting tables and the sofa table. The mix of square and round adds a great dimension and they are very versatile. Very happy with this purchase.",

The top is covered with weird gouges that seem like they might be intentional but are completely unfinished... so they're just like weird white gouges that stand out and make it obvious that it's just particle board underneath. The whole thing feels pretty cheaply made and not sturdy. Definitely not worth the price. Would send it back if it wasn't such a pain to repackage - and the packaging was totally destroyed during shipping. We will live with it for now and hopefully replace it eventually. \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb",

While you can't totally tell unless you look closely, it is pretty cheap quality for what you pay for. If I hadn't waited 10 months to put it together, I totally would have returned it. :(",

Everything is bolted or screwed together and wouldn't be too difficult to \"hack\" if you are handy and wanted to change the color or wood.",
