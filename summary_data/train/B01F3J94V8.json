P.S. buy the Husqvarna hearing protectors too .. it is also very comfortable to 'wear' with the cushy shoulder pads & waist belt .. buy the six pack of Husky oil too at the same time and extend your warranty from 2 to 3 years!",

      "text": "We live on a 1/4 acre surrounded by a forest of pines, oaks and maples in Maine. Additionally, the way the wind blows, our yard grabs the leaves from several other homes. For years, I had been using a high-power, 2-stroke hand held blower for years + a rake and a tarp. Worked fine, but wanted something faster. This 360BT moves a TON of air ... cleaned the entire yard of WET leaves (front and back) in less than an hour, PLUS pushed back (about 5') years of leaf build up that was accumulating around the backyard forest parameter because the previous blower wasn't powerful enough to push the leaves deep into the woods. VERY HAPPY with this purchase.",

My neighbors pay $800+ to have their lawns cleared so I figure I am already way ahead. Took about 15 minutes to set up and get running out of the box. Started on one pull and ran smooth as all heck. One recommendation, make sure to get ear protection! You will not be disappointed with this blower.",

At first it started easily, but after the 3rd time I used it, it wouldn't start unless I sprayed starter fluid into the carburetor. It feels a little heavy at first, but after using it a few times it doesn't seem that bad; the backpack design allows for easy control of the blower. It's worth the $400 because my lawn service wanted to charge me $750 for a fall clean-up and they only come out once, so if more leaves fall it would cost even more. Very glad I purchased this blower.",

I am now able to move the leaves past the clumps of honeysuckle and deep into the wooded area.
