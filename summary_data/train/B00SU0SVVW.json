The wood, skins and hardware appear to be sturdy and of good quality. Fit and finish are better then expected. Very good value for the money. Drums are not my primary instrument, but I know enough about percussion to evaluate these bongos competently. High, low, open and muted tones are clear and distinct. I will be playing for fun at home and with casual drumming circles. I may occasionally use them on my music tracks. These are fine for my intended purposes.",

One of the nuts on the 6\" would loosen, or tighten, even after taking it off the rim and using an adjustable wrench and pliers the nut would not move. I determined that some of the nuts are not threaded properly to the clamps. I see this issue occurring with the 7\" head as well.",

The only insane issue is how the middle part that holds both of the bongos together didn't seem to be glued completely. While it didn't impact the sound, it made the instrument appear bad and this made it kinda weird to hold. Overall, sounds great but seems like the company sends occasionally damaged instruments. I'd be careful but it might be my fault.",
