      "text": "I bought the 2018 QLED in hopes that Samsung had fixed the issues with the 2017 QLED, but unfortunately not. The colors are great but the QLED still does not have camera pan motion right. I don't know how professional reviews of these displays never mention all the artifacts and vertical banding that shows up when the camera moves. For instance on a long pass in football when the camera moves to stay with the ball, vertical ghost lines appear across the screen until the camera is still again. I've adjusted all relevant settings but nothing fixes the issue. If only the KS9000 was still available. Perhaps it's cousin the NU8000 would be a better choice.",

They shipped the tv very fast and also through a special shipping company that was extra careful with it. The tv shipped on its own pallet. Back to the tv. It produces very bright and vivid colors. Also very deep blacks!! Game mode works very well with the Xbox One X/PS4 Pro/Nintendo Switch. Also if you happen to pop in a blu ray or turn on Netflix the tv will turn off game mode. If your a gamer and are afraid of the oled burn in issue I would highly recommend this tv!!",

The audio is fine for what it is; I bought a sound bar and use that instead, but the built-in speakers would be fine for the average consumer.

Maybe there are better displays out there but as far as I'm concerned this one is perfect. Great picture, network connectivity, IOs, design etc. all perfect. One small design issue, once the display is mounted it is very difficult to get to the IOs for any changes. Course you shouldn't need to do this but once unless you're adding a device. Also the remote is anything but intuitive. Once you figure it out its fine. It's unique. Bottom line, Luv it and highly recommend.",

But once the HDR is enabled in the TV Settings, the 4K movies look absolutely amazing!!! I like that this QLED screen does not have burn-in problems. Dark scenes are plenty good enough. There is not one dead or stuck pixel on the whole screen. Setup was easy. Hooks up to your wi-fi. Haven't really used the Apps that come with the TV yet.",
