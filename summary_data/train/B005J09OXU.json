Our biggest lens dragged in and out of a similar but smaller Lowepro Slingshot Edge 250 AW. The camera and attached lens space is larger, allowing easier in/out, and giving me room when I buy the next bigger/longer lens. The laptop pocket makes this wonderful as an airline travel strategy. I can keep my laptop and camera both on me, even if my roll-on gets gate checked. Tripod attach is better than the other two bags I've tried.",

Very uncomfortable to carry as the straps were straining the shoulders even with just one full frame and a couple of medium sized lenses to carry. Even worse and causing more strain if I use a laptop that's just 14\" and less than 3.5 lbs. Silly design to keep the rain cover pouch \"inside\" the backpack. Usually that pouch is underneath the backpack or in a side outer pocket. This basically leaves us with opening the backpack top compartment when it's already raining to pull the cover out and use it.",

There is big compartment at the top, where I'm supposed to throw in everything else, which defies the purpose of organizing stuff in a backpack.

      "text": "The bag is comfortable to wear. The hip and chest straps secure the bag even more, useful when hiking. The bag has a slim form factor but fits a DSLR body with a 70-200mm lens attached and several other lenses and a flash. That's just in the lower padded compartment. The top compartment was perfect to stow my wallet, phone, phone charger, etc. My favorite feature is the side flap that enables you to pull out the camera while the bag is still on your shoulder, without opening the whole bag.",

I would say zippers don\u2019t matter too much, but if your bag doesn\u2019t close because it\u2019s missing a zipper, what do you do?",

      "title": "Great backpack for camera and laptop",
      "text": "Great camera backpack with lots of features and very customizable. It fits my 15\u201d laptop just fine. I wasn\u2019t very happy with how the camera body was loose in the slot provided so I added a small towel to take up the space. You can either carry a tripod or a water bottle, not both and the bottom can help with small accidental water incidents(like setting the backpack down in the ring of water left by a cold drink) but I would use the rain fly in the event of rain. I\u2019m very happy with it overall.",

All the rest of the compatments have a decent amount of room. I've not been out with it yet, so it's untested, but do see that if (that's the word) you register it within 30 days, then you get a 3 year warranty.
