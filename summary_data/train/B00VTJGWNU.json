I just wanted the convenience of screwing in a canister. I connected the stove to a 1 lb canister of Propane and lit both burners. They fired right up! Like other reviews said, there really is no low/simmer stage of the burner. It has only 2 levels, high or very high. But I'm okay with that. This stove is exactly what I was looking for.",
