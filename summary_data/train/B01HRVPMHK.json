It looks great and fits well after adding a link at the local jewelry store. Clasp snaps shut and is very secure.",

I had not even pulled the tags off. It seemed to snap back in, but now I dont trust its reliability. So, at this point Im working the standard Amazon return/exchange policy and hoping the replacement is not broken. Waste of my valuable time, in terms of setting up the return, returning the item (driving to drop off center), and waiting for the new one. But Im proceeding as this is hopefully an anomally.
