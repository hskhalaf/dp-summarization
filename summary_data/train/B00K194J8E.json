Ever since I got a 7.2V drill and a flashlight years ago, something was special with Makita. Maybe it's their color, maybe the long standing fact that their tools are the best. Or it's the feeling I get picking up a Makita tool. So I decided to stick with this platform along with the latest LTX line. Everybody else seems to chase what Makita makes. I know Bosch is good, I just happen to stay with Makita. Just a choice that started out with my first Makita drill and Tourch Light.",
