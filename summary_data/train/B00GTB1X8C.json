The pan is sized to use standard deep 9 in crust recipe and filling, and bakes using the same oven temps and time. I\u2019m looking forward to experimenting with banana breads, etc., with it. Coworkers were taking pictures and asking where I got it, so Amazon may be getting a bunch of orders! Best pan ever!!!! Thank you, Pi People LLC!!!",
