The material is very strong and not flexible which makes pouring the milk into the bottle a little difficult. You just have to pour carefully. The bag did well in the freezer and defrosting.

The plastic is super stuff and the zip lock part is not easy to use at all. Plus I don't believe the bags are recyclable. I've used other brands that can go in your recycling can and I'd prefer those. I can't wait to just finally be done with these already so I can buy a different brand.",

      "text": "These bags have terrible plastic/chemical smell in them and they effect the breastmilk. I have over 100 oz of breastmilk that is going down the drain since my baby actually notice the difference and will not drink it. I even tried to air out the bag before storage, and it does not make a difference. Don't waste your money on these or suffer the same consequence I did! As others noted, this bad is easy to use and the material is durable, but those aspects are useless if the breastmilk is going to spoil inside!",

When I pour in 5 oz, it shows the milk above the 'do not fill' mark... so that's confusing and not fun. Also, these bags are so stiff at the bottom that they do not lay flat in the freezer. The Lansinoh bags (whose volume markings also don't match the measuring cup) lay nice and flat in the freezer & then once frozen, are easy to transfer upright into freezer bags for efficient storing.",

    "description": "Size:100 Count\n\nPumping breastmilk is a vital function for new mothers. Keeping the breastmilk safe and ready to store for future use helps to keep your baby healthy. This is why Medela has created these double-zipper and hygienically sealed breastmilk ready to use storage bags. The Medela Breast Milk Storage Bags have been hygienically pre-sealed with durable material and double-zipper protection to prevent leaking. These bags safely store breastmilk in the freezer, fridge, or when traveling. These ready to use breastmilk storage bags are constructed from a durable, double-layer material with a built-in double zipper seal to keep your breastmilk safely stored in the fridge or freezer.\n\nThe Medela breastmilk storage bags have been designed to be self-standing and come with a large write-on area. This allows you to document the date and other vital information for safer storage and use. Also, the Medela Breast Milk large 6-ounce Storage Bags have been designed to lay flat for space-saving storage. This unique feature allows quick thawing of frozen milk when your baby is hungry. To help you keep these breastmilk storage bags clean and organized, we\u2019ve added a bonus resealable transport pouch that keeps unused bags organized and clean.\n\nMedela offers two types of storage bags to fit your lifestyle. Our new breast milk storage bags are for moms looking for save only bags and who don't need or want to pump directly into the bag, while our Pump & Save bags are designed for moms who want the added convenience of pumping directly into the bag. With either choice, we've got you covered. Medela\u2019s primary focus is on helping moms to successfully breastfeed their babies for as long as they choose. Meeting this goal responsibly is at the heart of everything we do.",
