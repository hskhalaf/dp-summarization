I have two Miniature Dachshunds and according to the directions, I split one chew between the two each morning. They each grab their half chew and swallow it down so fast I have to check to make sure all my fingers are still there! LOL UPDATE: About 1/2 way thru my first bag. The dogs still grab them each morning and swallow them down. They are definitely shedding less. Their skin is nice and soft. I've also noticed less scratching and biting themselves. The price is good and I'll be buying more of these in the future.",

My 6 year old rat terrier mix has been taking these for about two months and she looks great. Her fur is softer and has a more silky feeling. I just adopted a new terrier mix puppy who has a wiry coat with the hair standing up on top of his head and down his back, giving the appearance of a mohawk. He has been taking these for about a week and I will update this review with further details on how it has affected his coat.",

I give them as after-breakfast treats every morning - he loves them just as much as he does his regular doggy treats, so there's no epic battle to get him to take the supplement. As an added bonus, they're grain-free, which is fantastic if your pup has any grain allergies (like mine).",
