What I really liked about this baby shower decoration kit is that it came with everything I needed. The pump, the balloons and the balloon tape. Didn\u2019t have to get helium so that was also nice. At the end I just hung it with tape and it still looked great. Overall I would recommend. Especially for the price.",

It was a bit of a challenge fitting in all the balloons, but it looked pinterest beautiful for our friends baby shower. Make sure to blow less air in certain balloons to customize your garland. Thank you for the set!",

We encountered this about 2 hours before the shower, so that was kind of a bummer. Fortunately \u201cgirl\u201d sort of got the point across.",

Does take a good amount of time to assemble... My girls weren't too happy, but I was happy with the result! Also very heavy to hang, make sure to keep that in mind. Kept falling so we just used a lot of heavy-duty shipping tape.",

They were literally the size of a mini soccer ball and they kept popping when we were blowing them up. Overall I\u2019m so disappointed because I did not have a backup plan so I had to go to dollar tree to buy balloons and a banner. Oh and the leaves do not come with it. Just saying. I wish I could get my money back for this order but I was so disappointed I threw everything away except for the baby balloon.",

I'd recommend assembling on top of a clean surface!",
