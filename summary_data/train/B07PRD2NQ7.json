The Mini-5 is very fast, responsive and the perfect size for how I use an iPad.",

This tablet is super fast and it comes with all the bells and whistles of it being a high end tablet even for a small size, and even though I love my Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 8.0, I needed another small tablet for portability especially because my old tablet no longer has updates. This tablet is light, easy and comfortable to hold and great for productivity and media consumption.",

Video apps like Amazon Prime Video and Disney plus also allow for portrait viewing. Speakers are plenty loud when compared to fire tablets. Overall, a better media consumption device than its competitors. The extra power eats through the battery a bit faster, though. Could use a bit more storage, either built-in and/or expandable.",

And it should be powerful enough to still keep up years from now so you're getting a good investment on the device.",
