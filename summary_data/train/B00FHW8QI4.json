      "text": "The mattress pad works well, after all it is a Sunbeam... I really dislike the control. The knob I find is difficult to grab hold of and difficult to turn, usually requiring both hands, one for the knob and the other hand to support the base. In bed, you cannot see the setting without setting up or rising enough to 'look down'. Sunbeam has, I just discovered, another model with a ComfortTech Controller - Control 'tap' buttons on the top, a display on the side. This model has a preheat button which the one I have is lacking. When I replace the one I have, I will 'upgrade' to the 'better model' and 'friendlier control'.",

I got one of these for us for Christmas. I keep it on the lowest setting all night ! One of the best items I have purchased. Great for my lower back problems. Plus it has an automatic off after 10 hours if I forget to turn it off.",

I turn my side on 4 before going to bed to heat up our memory foam mattress and then turn it off as soon as I get in. Soooooo nice to get into a warm bed.

I've bought more expensive pads; they don't last any longer. This one is fine. Next year, I'll buy another one. If someone made one that would last 5 years, I would pay more for it.",

I made the bed after installing the heated mattress pad by the easy to follow directions and turned the controls on set to the lowest heat. Turned the controls on about 15 minutes before bed time and when I got in and covered up with a light sheet and quilt it was heavenly. My spouse loves it too. Should have bought one years ago.",
