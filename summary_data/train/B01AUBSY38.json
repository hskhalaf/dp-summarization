I was hesitant about this being a 'grey' with the price, but I'm happy to say that it was very well packaged... plus I have run a few tests already and am very pleased with the results! (So it seems all the rave reviews are well founded)",

Super fast camera, excellent viewfinder, top notch picture quality. It has a light body and a nice hand grip. Ps. The tilt touch screen is just great. Well done Nikon. Top marks A++++",
