The better versions of this kind of product include the capacity to fill the bag, then use a fine zipper that compresses the whole bag to a thinner size. This greatly helps packing. If they used strong, but lighter material, it would more than cover the cost of a light zipper to facilitate the compression.",

      "text": "After watching many reviews on packing cubes I bought this set for an Alaskan cruise last year. It was almost always the #1 or #2 ranked for cruisers. I now use them every time I travel anywhere. They keep me organized and all of my clothes clean. I am not someone that unpacks in hotels so having these cubes is crucial to know where every item is. I no longer hunt through the depths of my suitcase trying to find something that shifted during travel. I loved them so much I bought a set for my mom so she could benefit from them too.",

Easy to re-pack when leaving because you simply take it out of the drawer and close it up! I like the fact that it comes with the dirty clothes bag (which I have also used for shoes). Only thing\u2014I wish they were sold in a larger bundle-4 isn\u2019t enough.",

      "text": "I read many different reviews prior to purchase and I'm so glad I went with this brand. They are clean (no weird smells), easy to see inside (but not flimsy) and it's nice that they come with a little laundry bag. They make packing so much easier. It's so great to be able to divide your clothes ahead of time. You don't have to go searching through the whole suitcase when you need something. You can have a cube for underwear, a cube for t-shirts, a cube for dressy clothes, etc... Rather than mess up your carefully packed suitcase - you can just pull out the cube you need.",

The cube slides into my pack saving massive amounts of room, and everything is easy to find during travel and at hotel. Taking out one cube and unzipping is much better than digging through a pack! I will never leave home without these!",

The smallest size i used for a change of clothes for myself and both children including a few diapers in my carry on. Even though I packed them as tight as i could, once zipped it did not feel as though it would burst nor was it bulky. i would definitely recommend these to anyone who likes to have their travel bags organised.",

I'd recommend trying to buy the smaller cubes separately as well, especially if you're a carry-on type of traveler.",
