Convenient to take apart and empty, put back together, remove and clean the filter, recharge. Ease of use is unparalleled due to light weight and rotating head. All my life I have hated vacuuming, and I still don't adore it, but this little cordless machine takes away 88% of the intrinsic aggravation. Does carpet or bare floor depending on adjustment of a step-on button. I have 3 hair-shedding pets and it takes care of everything efficiently. It does not stink while operating, it is not particularly noisy, and it has a friendly vibe.",

No cord means it goes everywhere quickly, lightweight so it\u2019s easy to carry around, super suction power means it gets everything including pet hair, and the washable filter makes it easy to clean out after use.

      "text": "I initially purchased this in December of 2016. Loved it. Lightweight, super easy to use and charge. In 2019 the belt gave out (brush roll would no longer turn). I was surprised to find out that Shark doesn't sell replacement parts for this vacuum! But, I liked it enough that I purchased another on in October 2019. Five months later, despite meticulous upkeep, the brush-roll has stopped spinning again. So frustrating!!!",

There is something in the way that they are wired and when the head pivots that causes the wires to come loose. Shark had better address this problem.

My vacuum of 11 years finally died and I bought this to hold me over until I can afford another Sebo. It's lightweight, cordless, and does the job! We have a cat and a dog and it seems to be collecting everything it's supposed to! The downside is it doesn't have any attachments, but it's still a great little vacuum! It does well on my tile areas as well! My 10 year old son got my \"love of vaccuming\" gene and has used it more than me over the last few days!",
