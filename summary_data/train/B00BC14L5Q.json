      "text": "I read a lot of great reviews with an occasional one that scared me about inconsistent strength. So far I have not ran into the issue of only the first half the gloves being excellent. These are supper strong, using them for engine repair work and they are indestructible. I would agree with others that they are sized small so go up one size from what you would normally get.",
