Im impressed...and yes we are keeping it and ordering another soon for the other bedroom and hall!!!!! GREAT FAN!!!!! Really like the adjustment up and down. lets me put the airflow right where I need it and not everywhere else. PS....it isn't that noisy either. All I hear is the air flowing, not the motor.

The Lasko moves more air, but I like these better because the build quality is better. If the Lasko fan is on an uneven surface the flimsy frame distorts and the rotating cage inside rubs on the frame. These Stanley fans have heavier frames and bodies, so they run well no matter what orientation you put them in. I haven't taken one apart for cleaning yet, but it looks like it will be pretty easy to clean. The output grating is not easily removable, so there is room for improvement, but overall this is a very good fan.",

      "text": "I'm not much for indoor living even in hot SW Florida. Prior, I had a much cheaper pedestal fan and I had to have it blowing right by me on the highest level. This unit blew that one away and on the lowest level. No pun intended. I'll be sitting on the lanai even on the hottest of days. This is definitely a solid purchase for me. It doesn't feel chea.p at all. Very nice and heavy construction. This going to come in handy when I paint the interior of the house",

Tennessee Summers get pretty nasty with the humidity. After reading a couple of reviews, I decided to give this fan a shot. Let me tell you- this thing blew my mind. This fan being a smaller size, actually had a lot of power. This fan is very well designed and has great airflow. An added bonus are the extra outlets on the side. I would buy this fan again.",
