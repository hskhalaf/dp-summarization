It makes one think that perhaps Amazon is just turning those items around and repackaging them. But this one arrived broken and my kid thinks it is a cool toy but as parents we thought something looked wrong - sure enough, and it rattles too as if something in the place that string is supposed to be attached to (inside the main grip area) has broken free. This seems like it is hit or miss with this toy so not sure how the makers of this toy ever got it out past product testing.",
