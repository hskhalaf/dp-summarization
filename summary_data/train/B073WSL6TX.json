      "verdict": "Although a considerable number, the positive feedback that surrounds the Reebok Runner 2.0 MT were mostly about the comfort and fit, and not much was said regarding its performance. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that the criticisms of the shoe were about structure and durability. In summary, the shoe might be a reliable option for light running, but runners should not expect much when it comes to extreme activities.",
      "pros": [
        "Several buyers commented that the Reebok Runner 2.0 MT was a shoe that is worth the price",
        "The cushioning was excellent, especially in the heel area, a couple of wearers stated",
        "Many buyers agreed that it was a comfortable shoe",
        "Every step was refreshing because of the memory foam in the sock liner, a customer said",
        "The shoe provided sufficient heel support, no matter how active the foot was, a reviewer shared"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "One runner felt that the midsole\u2019s shock-absorbing capability was not sufficient",
        "The shoe was too flexible and lacked stability, according to a wearer",
        "A customer said the toe box was short",
        "The shoe showed signs of wear early, mentioned a disappointed user",
