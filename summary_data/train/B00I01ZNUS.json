It cannot reach the level of effects I want. With this pre-amp inserted between my receiver and the Dayton I can boost the power of the signal and set the level of effect where I want. I'm 100% satisfied, this product does exactly what I need. I am running a mono to stereo cable from my sub out to the pre-amp. The rest of the path is a right and left channel that are both the mono sub signal running to the transducers on the right and left side of my chair.",

It is quiet and unassuming. The included adapter takes care of the 12VDC power the pre-amp requires. The pot adjusts the power level coming down the line, and the signal over that distance is strong enough that we still have a little headroom. We can't detect any noise being injected into the line. So, yes, this is a great little box and perfect for our application.",
