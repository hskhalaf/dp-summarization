In August 2018 it stopped working again. After much time with phone support , I could not get it working again. It seems there is a problem with the optical output. New cable didn't work. Analog cable worked somewhat, but I don't have analog inputs on my smart TV. It costs money to have it shipped and repaired which may or may not work. So I'm ditching it. Should have known that a sixty day return policy wouldn't work well. Live and learn!!",

The 6 settings for the Accuvoice, though do help improve the ability to understand dialog when the TV producers seem to need excessive so called background music to go along with the dialog. The ability to change easily from 1 (lowest) through to 6 (highest) to enhance dialog without changing any of the other settings is a real advantage. Will need more experience using it to better evaluate.",
