Don't get me wrong, you can't slack off in the kitchen and expect this to be your safety net. If your nutrition is on point, and you DRINK ENOUGH WATER throughout the day, you will observe optimal results. *NOTE: USELESS if you are doing cardio, OPTIMAL for RESISTANCE TRAINING.",

It\u2019s not a steroid and won\u2019t give you muscles, but if you\u2019re into weight lifting, it will help your muscles squeeze out a couple extra reps at your limits which helps with conditioning.
