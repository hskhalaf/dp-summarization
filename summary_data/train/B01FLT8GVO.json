The only complaint was the sizing chart was hard to figure out what size to order because the measurements did not fit my dog.

After reading many reviews I decided to order both a small and a medium and the small ended up fitting my dog the best. My dog weighs 8 lbs, 15\" chest, 14\"1/2 length and 9\" neck. The shipping was fast and the seller was easy to work with.",

I'll have to remove the label and the thread it's sewn on with. Will purchase again for my other dog, but might wait to see if they do something about the label.",
