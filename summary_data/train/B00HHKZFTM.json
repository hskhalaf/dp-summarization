Also found it very convenient to read my kindle book because of the cylindrical bulge ; which helps to hold the tablet comfortably(opening up the kick-stand adds more convenience :) ). The screen resolution is more than enough for an 8 inch screen and found the videos and pictures to be clear. Will definitely recommend.",
