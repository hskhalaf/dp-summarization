It has TONS of characters that come with it and is packaged nicely if you are giving it as a gift. they also give a website to \"design\" your board before you put it together, quite helpful. So the one star off is for price. I'd probably give back the star if all materials were from the US. I'd pay more to support all local material/manufacturing.",

For the price, I expected this to come ready-to-use. I'm sure she'll love it though, after I do the work.",

      "text": "I want to start by saying that although I have found that letterboards are NOT my thing, this is a great product. This was my first time using letterboards and I tried a few different brands. This is by far the best. You get a lot of letters, numbers and symbols. You also get a cute little bag. The website is extremely helpful and you can even try your design online first to see how it looks. It is easy to use and very good quality. Aside from the fact that I find them to be too much work in general, this is a GREAT product.",

It looks great, and the grey felt board contrasts nicely with the wood frame that helpfully has a wall hanger on the back of it. The letters are easy to separate off of their plastic molds and fit snugly in to the felt board while still being easy to get out. Also, there's a lot of them, making it easy to write longer messages - complete with punctuation and flair. Great purchase.",

Even though this was an easy fix, I emailed the store owner. She was so sweet and personable and immediately sent me a whole new board!
