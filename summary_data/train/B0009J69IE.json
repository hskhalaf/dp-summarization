I thought, hey its on amazon and lets buy the 32oz so i dont run out as quick. As i opened it up excited to take my first dose, I noticed right away that it was no where near the same potency and also noticed it being watered down. Im very disappointed that i spent near $100 dollars only to be let down. Shame on Amazing herbs and Amazon for allowing this scam. I will get my future orders else where.",

I would recommend, however (or in addition), to purchase some glass bottles to transfer the oil in. Why? The oil seeps through the plastic bottle. I can literally wipe clean the bottle, set it on the counter, and the next morning, there is a light film of oil all over the bottle It seeps through the plastic pores. So if you are going to get this bottle, make sure you have several glass jars on hand to transfer the contents. Hope this helps.",
