The only downside is the the trimmer line spool does not always extend out properly, for it gets tangled inside, thus I have to rewind the spool. Other wise, it's a good trimmer with a good long lasting rechargeable battery. :)",

This never happened with my previous ExpandIt model. Ryobi won't stand behind this product. Replaced spool mechanism - string did not come out easily, bump or not. Design sucks. Order a better one from Amazon, throw Ryobi's away. Minus the coupler, unit and battery have held up two seasons of lawn care on my small lawn.",
