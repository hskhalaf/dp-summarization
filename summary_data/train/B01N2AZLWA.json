The cabinet is open enough to allow critters to enter. The undersized grease cup fills with water when it rains and overflows grease to the bottom of the cabinet. I got the Amazon assembly option. The Amazon installer did a nice job.",

Assembly instructions were not well written (very few words) and didn't explain parts not required for natural gas model, but customer service was helpful. Well constructed and nice features.",

Napoleon customer service told me to open the grill lid, which is ridiculous. Another time I spoke with them they said the grill should be between 400-500 with all 4 burners set at low, but my 600 degrees was within an acceptable margin of that range and my grill was not defective. So if I want the cook something lower than 600, I have to turn off half the burners and lose half of my grill area.",

When it was delivered the back panel was dented and the infrared side burner grill was chipped. Napolean did replace the chipped grill. The greatest flaw is that the grill is partially open in the rear and with heavy rains water gets into the grill lower cabinet and fills up the grease tray even when covered. I have complained to Napolean about this and they say it is a common complaint.",

The grill does not distribute the heat well and you will have very distinct hot and cool spots. The infrared side burner is nice and gets very hot for a good sear. I would not buy this grill again when I will have to replace it after only 10 months of use.",
