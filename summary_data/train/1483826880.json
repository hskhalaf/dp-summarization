This book touches on the topics mentioned in the description and more. Very thick book too as you can see in pictures I posted. I chose the updated version yet I can not tell you the difference btwn the old that is selling for a dollar less. This is a winner though\ud83d\ude01.

That being said the workbook is very well set up. It's thorough, easy to read and engaging. My son has no issues completing his work alongside our massive wall map, even asking if he can do a few pages on his own.",
