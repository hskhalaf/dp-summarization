The larger bags seemed to have more of the tougher pieces that my cat cannot chew, and more \"crumbs\" i presume because of shipping. So i am going to keep ordering the smaller bag. When I called to discuss my issues, the marketing person was VERY NICE and explained about some of the meat not having as much fat which causes the tougher pieces. She returned my call very quickly and i continue to be impressed by the qualityof this company!",
