Press the button again and it will remove the cork from the bottle and then continue until the cork comes off of the corkscrew. So much easier than doing it manually. I've used it at parties and the charge will last between 20-30 bottles. It also comes with a charging stand and a cutter for the paper wrapped on the bottle neck.",

      "text": "I ordered this a couple of months ago because the one I had for almost 5 years was giving out. I'd been so happy with my first one! This I've used several times now and only once have I NOT had to dig the cork back out of the opener. Most of the time I have to use force even to get the cork out of the wine bottle. I looked for a way to contact the seller, but I've found none. Hopefully this review will catch someone's attention and they can help me with the situation. So, buyer beware - and use immediately after purchasing because the return window closes a month later.",

Plus, the case is showing some signs of being sticky. Over the years we have given numerous friends the same opener and all sing the praises of this unit. It's easy to get spoiled.",

We've been using it for two months and it is not something that we expect to last for a long time. A great gift for someone that drinks an infrequent bottle of wine. It has a problem when removing the cork as the bottle wants to turn along with the cork so you must grasp the bottle and the Oster at the same time. It also is a little difficult to place back on the charging mechanism. For the price, however, it's more than OK.",

However, the batteries appear to be low quality and don't last long. Buy one if you wish, but be prepared for it to last six months to a year before it simply doesn't have the \"juice\" to pull the cork out of the bottle. I have seen posts that they are not indicated for use with plastic corks, but I haven't found that to be a problem...unless plastic corks somehow wear out the batteries. We're going to try another solution. Otherwise, great product!",

No batteries required!! Also comes with the plastic splitter, great add on. I looked at a lot of others on here and these can be really expensive, this one was the perfect price for me and still great quality.",

My first one last about 2 years - it didn't actually break it just didn't sound healthy anymore. I bought a replacement and have had that one for about 2 years now without any problems.

    "description": "Choose from 3 fashionable colors (each sold separately). OSTER CORDLESS ELECTRIC WINE BOTTLE OPENER\nCELEBRATE THE MOMENT IN SOPHISTICATED STYLE\nThere's just something about opening a bottle of wine. The ceremonial quality of removing the cork truly indicates it's time to unwind. Whether relaxing solo after a long day at the office or hosting an intimate dinner soiree or holiday party, Oster's electric wine bottle opener makes it easy to start the evening off in sophisticated style.\n\nEFFORTLESSLY OPENS A WINE BOTTLE IN SECONDS\nDesigned to fit all traditional wine bottles, the electric wine bottle opener offers the same portable, cordless convenience as other wine bottle openers, but with the added benefit of sleek presentation and fast, effortless performance, opening a bottle in a matter of seconds. Fast, zero-effort cork removal ultimately means more time to spend with guests. Sipping wine, visiting with friends--Oster helps make it happen.\n\nNote: images below are of the Silver model.\n\nOPEN A WINE BOTTLE IN 3 EASY STEPS\nFoil cutter removes wine seal. View larger Wine bottle opener penetrates cork. View larger One simple switch removes cork from bottle. View larger SIMPLE PUSH-BUTTON OPERATION\nBefore removing the cork, any foil seal covering the cork must be removed first. A handy foil cutter comes included making the task quick and easy.\n\nTo use the electric wine bottle opener, place it on top of a wine bottle, making sure it remains in an upright position and not at an angle to the bottle. A single operating switch ensures foolproof operation from here. Simply press the lower part of the switch to start. The unit's corkscrew spiral will turn to enter the cork, then it will gradually remove the cork from the bottle, stopping once the cork has been fully removed from the bottle. Lift the electric wine bottle opener away from the bottle, and remove the cork by pressing the upper part of the switch--the spiral turns in the opposite direction to release the cork. Voila. Let the pouring begin.\n\nOPENS UP TO 30 BOTTLES ON A FULL CHARGE\nMeasuring 2-1/4 inches in diameter by 10-3/4 inches tall, the electric wine bottle opener provides an ergonomically designed, soft-grip handle that fits in the palm of your hand for a firm grip. Other highlights include an LED charging light on the top of the unit and a power indicator light on the base, which offers a small footprint that takes up minimal space on a kitchen counter, bar, table, or buffet. When not in use, return the electric wine bottle opener to its charging base. A full recharge takes about six to eight hours. Fully charged, it can open approximately 30 bottles of wine.\n\nAvailable in a Silver, Merlot or Champagne finish, the electric wine bottle opener makes a great gift idea for that wine lover on your list. \n\nConvenient, cordless design with push-button operation and charging base.
