      "text": "This headphone is a low cost replacement for my more expensive Dragon headphones replacement. The cord that's attached to the Dragon headphone keeps breaking and replacing the headset multiple times was getting expensive so I decided to give these low-cost headphones a chance. Surprisingly they work really well with my Dragon dictation software. The only problem that I have is that the band could be more flexible so that it would sit better on my head. For the price this definitely is an affordable headphone set for simple dictations and yes I'm glad I purchased it.",

The cord is very long, a bit long for PC use (tied mine up for PC use) but is well suited for console play if you have the console a 5-6 feet from your chair. Be wary of having the volume up, as my friends would note on how loud I sound when talking into the Mic. Other headsets I have used did not produce the same volumes this headset did.",

The only improvement I could wish for is a way to detach the microphone part (as I don't need it), but I realize that my needs are outside of its intended usage. I have written to the company to thank it for a great product and to inquire about the availability of a version without the microphone.",

The one negative is a fairly big one, though. The headset presses too tightly into my skull on the opposite side of the earphone. When I need to use this for many hours at a time, that's a very uncomfortable downside. I rate this product 5 stars for how well it works and 2 stars for comfort. Overall, 4 stars.",

They wont slide off when you drop your pen that is for sure. Bendable mike with a really long cord that measures 105 inches, Yea crazy long but great for someone like me who rolls all over the office but is too cheap for a wireless set up.",
