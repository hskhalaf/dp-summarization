I would say it's something that you pour and start melting chocolate while you prepare the sides (while cutting strawberry or banana) or even as you wait for your guests. Does not create hot chocolate but it wasn't cold either. We very much enjoyed using it and I think she will get a good amount of fun out of it as well. Also great for kids to have chocolate dipped marshmallow in!!",

But I added chocolate chips and gave it like 10-15 min and stirred it every few minutes and it melted perfectly. The chocolate never got really hot but I think that\u2019s good, I used it with the whole family including a few kids so it was nice that it wasn\u2019t nearly hot enough to burn them. I will definitely use this many more times. It\u2019ll be great for parties.",

You just have to stir alot as its melting but once its melted you turn down the heat and forget about it. I had bought another one that used an open flame before this and returned it because it was way too high maintenance and burned my chocolate.",

It works great, and I couldn't be happier. Nice and simple to clean, too. This is now our football-watching favorite snack.",
