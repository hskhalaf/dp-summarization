I've been on a hunt for one for my son for sometime now and this one met my expectations, unfortunately I am on the tall side so my baby is pretty tall for his age he's only 7 months but he is 28 ins long and this doesn't go up high enough for him his feet are flat on the ground so sad I have to return, and now I am back on the hunt looking for a walker but just a heads up if your baby is 27 or longer I wouldn't buy it .

I chose the joovy because it grows with your child, has a removeabke tray for feeding/cleaning, lays flat for storage, AND then best part is toys can be changed out unlike so many other activity tables. Another huge bonus for me was the look of the joovy doesn't scream baby. We keep it out in our kitchen and our daughter has been using it since she was 4 months old! Will think about purchasing other Joovy products in the future!",

Its features are great (wide tray with removable top, removable seat in monotone colors, solid construction), but it's not usable if your baby is anywhere near 30 inches tall. Unfortunately this purchase is a complete waste of money for us. The product is most likely suited for babies who are in the 70th or less percentile for height.",

This has a built in tray that pops out and is dishwasher safe, so it doubles as a high chair. It\u2019s portability has made bringing it to family functions very nice! Super sturdy as well! I also have to say that, it\u2019s a bit larger than other walkers I\u2019ve used for my other children, BUTTTTT the tray being as large as it is prevents the baby from being able to grab things she shouldn\u2019t have.\ud83d\ude43",

The seatback is padded and has a wipeable surface, though I don't think it is easy to remove to clean. This piece of baby equipment checked all the boxes for us. I highly recommend it!",

It makes it more difficult for the baby to move since they have to slide the unit along rather than roll. I don't know what the solution is, but they may be better if they had some rubber of something that gives some friction.",

I love that it doesn't have any big bulky toys on top. The walker has a clear, removable tray for easy clean up. I love to put toys on top of tray and he plays with his own favorite toys. It is also height adjustable which is an added plus. Chair cover is also removable and machine washable. Another great feature is that it serves as a high chair. The only con I have is that when you adjust it, it sometimes jams and can be difficult to adjust.",

      "text": "The front wheels turn sideways while going forward. They just drag and scrape across the floor while sideways, instead of rolling. Not sure if this is a defect or not. It does it when we pull it forward without baby in it and also when baby walks forward. So she can\u2019t glide across the floor like she should be able to. Bought this based on the positive reviews and am disappointed, especially considering the price compared to other walkers. Would be a nice walker if it weren\u2019t for the wheels.",
