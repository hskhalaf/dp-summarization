This one seems to be much better at that. Pictures are of the best type. Have not found anything about this camera that I can talk bad about. Price-great. pictures-great. If I had anything bad to say about it, that would have to be the owners manual (users guide). It isn't the best I've used, but I can work around that part of it. Believe me, this Z950 is well worth it's price and will give you all you are asking for.",

It is easy to upload the pictures to my computer using the supplied USB cord. The price was excellent, too for a camera with all those features.",

      "text": "Although I have not yet used many of the camera's features, the one's I have used were relatively easy to learn and they perform well. For some reason, a few of the pictures taken without flash did not automatically focus well. I have to admit that I really miss having an optical viewfinder as the LED viewfinder is sometimes hard to see in the sun and it is difficult to snap rapidly moving objects using the LED viewfinder. The quality of the in-focus pictures is excellent and they can be blown up a great deal without losing resolution. I am a little disappointed in the battery as in that it is quite small and doesn't last long between charges.",

Picture quality is great and the zoom is impressive. Shot my nephew and his friends at from over 100 yards and the picture was so clear there was no problem picking out who was who. At high MP's it does take a second or two to process, but I didn't buy the camera to take modeling pictures. When I finally learn to set the camera for different conditions I'm sure I'll be even happier. And you can't beat $117.",

Some other camera in the same class are geared more for serious photographers, who want something smaller than their SLR. The Kodak is geared toward the novice, who wants better pictures than a mini-camera can provide. The only drawback to this camera is that is is a little slow to turn on and there is a 2+ second pause between pictures. While that is annoying - the picture quality makes up for it.",

A sales agent from Kodak recommended the z950, which is far better than the 981 (while it's much cheaper!!).

This camera is perfect if you just need a camera for those occasions that are on the move, like birthday parties, kid's playing @ the park, or a sports activity. The quality of picture is good, but I'm biased because my other camera is a Sony Alpha, so I have pretty high standards. Perfect to carry around in a purse or diaper bag for those times when you needed the \"in case\" camera. Rechargeable battery is great- saves a bundle on purchasing AA's.",
