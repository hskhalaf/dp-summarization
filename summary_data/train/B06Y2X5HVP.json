I felt like you had to be pretty close to read our legacy barcodes that our wired scanners didn't have issues with. Average 3-4 inches to read. I was still happy with the fact I wasn't tethered to the PC. Restarted the PC one day and the thing would not boot-up until I unplugged the scanner. Tried a different PC, same issue.

Anything can fail with technology so we don't need to knock off any ratings for that. It's a great price for a great product.",

The mat is thick enough to add some good padding, but not so thick that it gets annoying. It has a somewhat strong leather scent out of the package, but fades quickly. The size is good, and fits either my laptop and mouse, or an external keyboard and mouse well, with a bit of room to write on a notepad. The item I received had bent in shipping, but the company was fantastic about working with me to get a replacement that was flat and unblemished. Overall, a great purchase, and exactly what I needed to enhance my desktop.",
