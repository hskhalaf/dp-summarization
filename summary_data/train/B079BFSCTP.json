Easy to use and light weight. I won\u2019t worry about burning my fingers. I own several curling irons, none of them have ever curl my hair as well as this one. After practice, it does a great job. Thumbs up for the free hair clips and dust bag. Definitely recommend.",

I deduct one star because it\u2019s a little tricky to make this work for some of my hair that is shorter (due to the layering) and the beeping sounds are actually pretty annoying but yet useful if that makes sense. Overall it\u2019s a keeper. As for my picture, you can see how the curls look. I set the curler at the highest setting and keep each strand at 4 beeps. No other product used beside the curler.",

If I can't get the hang of using this, I can't give it as a present. Directions were poor.",
