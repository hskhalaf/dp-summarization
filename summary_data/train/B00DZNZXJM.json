I took a few pics - one is the product and box, and the other is my old bottle (purchased from Nordstrom) on the left and this bottle on the right. I would definitely purchase this again because it is a significantly better price than what I've found most of the time. It's great for ppl with oilier skin who want to hydrate without adding a greasy feel. I wear it on my face every night. I have extremely sensitive skin and this doesn't bother me one bit.
