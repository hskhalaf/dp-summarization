Also, I have a stamps.com account and the DYMO stamps that comes with it or even the new roll you buy #30915 will not work with them. I was trying to save myself some money by buying this one.

It remembers the one that you used last time, and you waste labels as you print to the wrong side. Also you must change the type of the label when switching. Smart software would memorize the type of label in each side, and show it as two separate printers. Bottom line it take twice the space on your desk, and you end up using one side only.",
