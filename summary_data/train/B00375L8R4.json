Read that dermatologists highly recommended this and I can see why.",

    "description": "Size:Skin & Lip Protectant PackEight Hour Cream Skin Protectant is the legendary skincare formula created in 1930 by Miss Arden to soothe and protect skin. An instant, overwhelming success, the Eight Hour brand continues its legacy today. Celebrated by makeup artists and beauty influencers around the globe, its wonderful versatility and proven results have elevated it to \u201ccult status\u201d in the beauty industry. The name Eight Hour was coined by a devoted Elizabeth Arden client who used the cream on her child\u2019s grazed knee, and \u201deight hours later,\u201d it was magically better. Eight Ways to Use Eight Hour Apply head-to-toe to seal in moisture and experience hours of hydrated, healthy-looking skin with each use. \u2022 AT FACE VALUE: Simply rub a dime-sized amount in the palms of hands to warm through, then pat onto the face to seal in moisture. \u2022 COMES IN HANDY: Deep condition by working the formula into palms and over the fingers, then wrapping each hand for 10 minutes in a warm towel. \u2022 HEEL-TO-TOE HEALING: Relieve weary feet by mas\u00acsaging the cream generously onto soles, pads and heels, then topping with cotton socks for deeper moisturization to heal dry skin. \u2022 A FLASH OF BRILLIANCE: Create instant radiance wherever skin normally catches the light, including legs, shoulders, collarbone, cheeks and bow of the lips. \u2022 LAVISH THE LIPS: With its effective moisturizing ingredients, this do-it-all wonder perfectly re-hydrates chapped lips. \u2022 THE MANE BENEFITS: In addition to its properties as a \u201cskin savior,\u201d the cream\u2019s petrolatum and natural lanolin help smooth strands and moisturize dry ends. \u2022 FROST SMITTEN: It can be smoothed onto skin as protection from windburn, particularly when adventuring outdoors. \u2022 KEEPING IT HIGH-BROW: Run the tiniest amount through eyebrows to groom hairs, helping neaten and define the arch.\n\nBRAND STORY\nElizabeth Arden Eight Hour has been a legendary moisturizing formula since 1930. Celebrated by makeup artists and beauty enthusiasts for its amazing versatility, Eight Hour remains a cult favorite today.",
