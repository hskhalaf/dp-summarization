Has more Ram and storage than the Stylo 3. Fingerprint sensor works well. Also has a larger screen and greater resolution. The stylus seems to be easier to remove from the bottom of the phone and is a nice feature. Excellent cell phone for a good price.",

I got a silver & blue Anccer case (minimalistic) that complements this purchase to a T! The fingerprint sensor is great and the new biometric facial recognition kicks butt! Feels good in the hand and is very responsive, the external speaker aint the greatest but it is what it is. Overall YES i would recommend this phone, YES it is a \"budget Galaxy Note\" type phone, but \"All of US Stylo Junkies\" are drawn to it like a moth to a flame!",

All to be let down by poor audio, and a pair of cheap cameras. Voices rattle in the earpiece when you turn up the volume. And the speakerphone, yuck. I've had $50 phones with better speakerphone audio. (The microphone is very good though, it sounds clear to the people you are calling.) Rear camera is always focusing, but results always lack detail. Color balance when using the flash isn't good and there are no adjustments in the stock camera that I could find, and I did look. Front camera always blurry.",

      "text": "I actually had to replace my now broken Note 8 with this Stylo 4. It was last minute, and I really needed a new phone. And let me tell you....the battery is much better, it's more lightweight, and the stylus is more smoother on the screen than the Note. And, thanks to Amazon's monthly payments and recent price drop, I've got a phone that is amazing and budget!",

Then once you open a chat to take a pic with flash on using the camera in the chat window it flashes then the screen goes white. On top of that my flashlight JUST stopped working. It comes on for literally a second and comes off sometimes doesn't come on at all. Tried flashlight apps and its the same result. I want my money back!!!!!",

This phone was ordered new because I've had many problems with used. The packaging and ither things were good. No manual. Doon the keyboard did not work. Buttons didn't always react when touched. After that the screen sometimes showed halos and you could see the insides of the screen. Then after about a week it did not connect to wifi even though the setting said excellent signal. Overall a nice looking phone but really bad quality control on everyone's part including the manufacturer. Too bad. Joel Rubin",

Pros: Extremely Smooth and Fast (compared to other mid-range devices) Works With All Major Carriers (including Verizon/sprint/Total Wireless) Great Display USB-C Charging Fast Charging Capability Great Stylus Large Display Average-Good Battery Life 3 GB of RAM (compared to 2 GB with Metro PCS version) Cons: Back is prone to scratching easily No NFC Average Camera. if u are looking for a nice smart phone that doesn't cost a fortune, this is it. this phone has some really cool features.",

I love the battery saver. the split screens, the time out when using an app or playing a game. The only vault I have with it is that it does not have the voice mail icon. You have to use your number to retrieve any messages. You have to check this on regular bases, as there is no notifications for that feature. Besides that issue, I would highly recommend this style of phone. Great phone!!!",

It does hang up a bit where my V30 is silky smooth. I'm assuming that's the lower level processor and ram amounts. It's about on par with my Moto G6 in performance. Not bad at all but a little slow at times. Either way, it works for me and you can't beat the PRICE. Find a GOOD slim case for it. The couple two layers cases I bought for it really bulked it up. Totally ruins the nice feel of the phone.",

It's very thin and doesn't run hot too often. The only letdown is the camera. Both are very grainy if not in the right light. The zoom feature on the back camera makes it look like you're using a flip from 2009. Otherwise I highly reccomend it. Great budget phone",

It's really hard to find a phone at this price point that doesn't require some kind of compromise in one or more of those areas, but this phone does it all plus extra features (like stylus/finger print reader.)",
