Absolutely love them\u2764\u2764\u2764 the lights can stay stuck on one color sometimes, but it's not difficult at all to get them going multi color again. The timer works, I'm ordering more. They bring such a pleasant atmosphere to my livingroom. The only thing that I can complain about is they are not very scented, however that is not why i ordered them, so i am completely satisfied with this purchase, and recommend purchasing them if you are looking to add some color to your space. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",

She immediately took action and had a replacement sent via two day shipping. I couldn't be happier with the service I received and with the candles themselves. They are real wax and look amazing!

I have used mainly inside of candle holders, rather than on pillar holders since they aren't as pretty unlit, but they are versatile and the battery life is not bad. Because the base color is white, the colors are more true than color changing candles that have a particular color as the base, so it is a bit of a trade off. That's why you need to think about where you are going to use these to decide if they're right for you.",

If you are looking for something that even comes close to color variety, forget this product. If you want something that has a couple of good colors, go for it. Also, the auto-off timers do not work.",
