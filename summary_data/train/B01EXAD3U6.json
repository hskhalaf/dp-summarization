They fit on a standard 2\" diameter Olympic bar (see pictures, I'm using the Cap's The Beast). Mine were packaged well, no damage. Yes, they do have a greasy coating -- which is easily wiped off with a rag and some cleaning solution (used Simple Green for this). Yes, they do have a \"petro-chemically\" smell but they're coated in plastic so you should kinda expect it to smell, besides, you're probably not lifting at the perfume counter in Macy's.",
