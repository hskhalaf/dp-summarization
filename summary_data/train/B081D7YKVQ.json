First the pro\u2019s: - Very easy setup with the included screen. - Decent screen quality, Good, not amazing - Can capture a good sized area The Con\u2019s; - The temperature monitor is garbage. Tonight the app on my phone said 71 f, the screen attachment said 75 f. Which is it? - The app is bloated with all the junk Motorola wants to sell you and requires a few steps to get to the camera. - The controls on the screen are clunky and not responsive all the time. - The intercom is painfully slow, making it nearly unusable in that respect. That\u2019s where I\u2019m at with the first",

Also whenever the camera loses connection to the internet it beeps super loud. With no way of disabling it. While we liked that this had wifi capabilities we didn't always need it to be on wifi. Would prefer a camera with a local band to connect to (like normal baby monitors) and then use wifi with the Hubble app when needed. Overall it feels like a camera from 2004. Your money is better spent on another product. Returning ours after a week of frustrations.",

The only con I have found so far is that I cannot get the base station display as loud as I would like. I really wish it would go louder because when the TV is on or people are talking you can barely hear it",

The app connecting to the camera was troublesome from the first and continually required re-pairing. Now it has failed altogether.

I can see my son breathe and that's honestly enough for me to be sold. He room shares with me so it's only used when I stay up after he goes to bed so it's not a huge deal for me, but I feel like it might not wake someone up who is sleep deprived (a parent) or a heavy sleeper in general.",

When I'm in the kitchen cooking or cleaning I love that I can leave my kids in their room and still be able to see and hear everything. The screen goes dark when the sound in the room is pretty steady but then lights up if there's a sudden loud sound so you can see and make sure everything is good without having to touch anything. There's a talk back feature which I love because my kids like to hear me to make sure they're not alone.",

I can also speak through it when I want to interact if I physically can\u2019t. I can also record and save videos when she\u2019s being cute(which is always) and silly. I love how I can control the camera a little bit if I wanted to as well. The camera gives an additional surveillance that my child needs.",
