Stabila has a reputation for quality levels, and I expect these to meet that reputation. I like the cushioned handholds that I would not have gotten with the Stabila beam level; they have an added feature that provides a hooking point. That was the main reason that I didn't return them.",

Stabila guarantees that every one of their levels has been electronically calibrated and inspected and has received a certification of accuracy. The vial system, permanently epoxy-locked in the frame by a patented process, is the clearest and easiest to read of any level we've seen. Everything about these levels is quality, from the removable rubber end caps for flush measuring to the big, comfortable hand holds.
