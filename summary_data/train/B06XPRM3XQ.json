Since using this product for over a month I can safely say that when you apply it every evening you will notice a difference in length and strength! Make sure you take your contact lenses out first if you wear them. Also, try not to open your eyes very much after applying because it will irritate your eyes if it gets in them and make your vision a bit blurry.
