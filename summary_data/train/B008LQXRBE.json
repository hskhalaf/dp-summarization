I love it as a rinsing tool. My son has the tug boat which I've been using, but its spout is narrow. The submarine has a nice wide opening which makes rinsing SO much easier!! I wish I had had this to begin with. So if you're debating between the tug boat and sub, I'd highly recommend the sub. It floats on the water's surface just like the tug boat, plus the top yellow part opens so the kid can put other toys inside if he/she wants.",

I would say the dump truck is the biggest hit (we bring it to the sand box) and this submarine is the second favorite. I like that the plastic is durable and high-quality; we've had to throw out many other bath toys for growing mildew but this one has been fine for 6 months and counting.",

He wouldn't put it down, he was certain it was bath night (it wasn't), and if we'd let him, he would probably have taken it into bed as a stuffie, too. Love that the hatch on top opens and the recycled plastic idea. We have several Green Toys (dump truck, tea sets, dish sets, float plane) and have been so happy with them. They are nearly indestructible (ours have yet to be destroyed) - love no batteries, noises, electronics in toys for kids so they can use their imaginations.",

The water will just sit in it and could mildew if you don't make sure to dump it. It has a pour spout to empty the water out, so its not a huge deal, but would be less hassle if I didn't have to drain them. Still a really nice toy.",

If you are asking why that matters seeing as it's a kids toy, the reason is because this also makes an excellent rinsing tool. Pouring the water out of it's \"mouth\" is the best way to rinse the shampoo off his head that I have found! Would definitely recommend this!",
