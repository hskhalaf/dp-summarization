However, getting a pair that fits well is crucial to enjoying its features. Or else, you may experience a lot of pain and discomfort and later regret buying these basketball sneakers.",

You can find these shoes cheaper on other sites but I decided to pay a little more and buy on here because the amazon exchange policy is A1 no issues tho love the look of the shoes very light weight and worth the buy!",

I wore theses to work I\u2019m a graphic designer and architect and I just walk to and from my office. By the end of the day some of the (scales) side tred on the shoes wore off. Also it\u2019s very strange the insoles have no logo or anything. It\u2019s a very cheaply made shoe it and shows. Looks nice but has no functionality.",
