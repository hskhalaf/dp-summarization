      "text": "I was in the market for a \u201creal\u201d rabbit cage, after a year of having a free-range bunny with a puppy playpen for the occasional \u201ctimeout\u201d. My husband & I were merging homes, and that included 2 large dogs. I needed a place for Bunny to feel safe & secure amidst the chaos. This cage is extremely spacious, for a cage. It was a pain to put together, but well worth the 3 hours of frustration. Bunny loves the little perch, although I did remove the ladder, as it is basically pointless. My Lionhead is about 4-5 lbs, & this cage was perfect for her. Definitely recommend this product.",

Pretty time consuming but not to difficult. My rabbits love it and their is tons of room for them to move around. Great features, the only thing I bought separately was a litter box. :)",

The best part of this is that it has a deep pan that is very easy to clean. The house has a large lid you can lift and clean that pan too, which is the same as the main pan. Plastic, deep and easy to clean. Keeps the garage clean. Make sure you have a tiny Phillips head. The screws are small.",

While it took the better part of the day to assemble (instructions are frustratingly unclear in places), it has been holding up well, and is a good bit larger than what she had. Water bottle works ok, and the size of the base is ideal to use with one of the reusable guinea pig mats which has made cleaning much easier. I'd be a bit worried this is on the small size for some rabbits, but for guinea pigs it's ideal.",

I feel like it should have stated this in the infomarion that the buyer was going to need power tools to put it together.",
