Britzgo simply doesn\u2019t live up to the description. It amplifies sound to a degree in a quiet room to watch TV, but in all other situations, especially talking on the phone trying to use them is an exercise in frustration. Furthermore, the stated battery life is grossly exaggerated. Last, but not least, their appearance couldn\u2019t be more unsightly. I regret that I kept trying to get them to work past the return date, so I\u2019ve just wasted dollars on a truly worthless product.",

Now I can hear the speaker better & also pickup others that participate in the conversations. This device is extremely sensitive to wind or noisy background environment, ie restaurants. Too many conversations & clanging of dishes/utensils, even on lowest setting. Carry it with me at all times & wear when my normal hearing aids do not work well. Reason for not giving 5-star is because this device is very large & bulky compared to my normal hearing aids.",

He sent me back to troubleshoot but there was no luck or signs of life in this. I had discussed him about the item, he used to have them on when he used to go for some gatherings or praying and he loved it. It was quite a nice item though, it just that it didn't last.",
