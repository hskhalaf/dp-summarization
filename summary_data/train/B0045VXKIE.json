This can be very troublesome when I am downloading a file, streaming a video, or playing some online game. I am paying 80 dollars a month instead of a 50 dollar virgin mobile since virgin mobile has the worst customer service, but now I am rather regretting it. This device is what I would call a pure garbage that can't even hold a stable connection. Don't buy this unless you are planning to use it right next to a verizon internet tower.",

Waited ten minutes and re opened vz access manager. Updated something again and it recognized my new acct. Seems pretty quick. Happy it works, but is spendy for the service. Drive arrived in three days of ordering with no instructions, which I really did not need. Looks like you can track usage from the vz manager, which is great. No need for other software or to talk to verizon at all.",
