      "text": "I recently had an accident where I banged one side of my face onto an end table. So half of my face was terribly bruised, but as it faded somewhat I used the makeup to blend in (in fact I used 2 different shades) and people told me that they couldn't even tell. Without my makeup they sure could! The creamy smoothness and the sponge applicator made it so easy to blend and doesn't even look like I have makeup on.",

I have been lucky to have clear skin my whole life, but as I age, my skin tones aren't even. NARS Velvet Matte Foundation Stick is light, easy to apply and evens out my skin tone. It doesn't smear or rub off on clothes and creates a great \"canvas\" to apply the rest of my makeup without looking heavy or cake-y. Thanks!",
