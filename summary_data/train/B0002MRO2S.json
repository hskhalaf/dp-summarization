      "text": "I purchased these some time ago for my parents. They managed to pick up on how to use everything quite quickly, and greatly enjoy the fact that it is wireless. The mouse has a nice heft to it, so that you don't feel like it would break. And with all Logitech products it looks like it's built to last. The only real problem I have with it is the fact that I'm a left handed person and it would be quite difficult to use with a left hand. That and if you install the software bundled (not required for all computers, but some need it) it is quite clunky.",

I'm using the unit to write this review! Thanks! I highly recommend this seller!",

The Mouse, on the other hand, is horrendous. It's big, clumpy, and basically has terrible movement. I ended up getting the MX1000 a few weeks later. Logitech really cut corners with this mouse. Buy the keyboard alone and get a good mouse. Shame on Logitech.",

      "text": "If people would take the \"Tour\" provided in the software, they would find out how to program the Audio Preset buttons. In reality they are Website Presets. Simply go to a website, press and hold one of the Audio Preset buttons, until the Website name flashes on the screen in green. That's it, it's set. My opinion - I don't like the Mouse - I'm using my old MX700 mouse - I love it. The keyboard - Its the best. Period.",

After 4 feet, it's dead-even with almost fully charged batt(half an hour use after overnight charging). My old mouse has 6 feet wire, so What's the point of using wireless? I'd love to give five stars, but not for this one. So if you want to use it within 3 feet, go ahead. But if u need some distance, try something else.",

I told them (via voiceless email) to send it to my in-laws, so of course they sent it to me 1000 miles away. I had to pay out of my pocket to get it to the right spot. Lesson learned-- returns are tough on Amazon.",
