Words of affirmation was difficult for me to fill out so I looked them up online and wrote the ones that spoke to me most. How I want to/should be seeing myself.",

However, in only 3 weeks, the binding suddenly tore away from one side of the journal's sheets. I'm going to find some good glue to bind mine back together, but heads up, [PUBLISHER]: make sure your book bindings use enough glue!

Saturday and Sunday have tiny writing spaces, which I find to be really unhelpful. Plus, I'm starting in January so I prefer a dated book.

I always feel like I\u2019m wasting half of my planner if I get a new one in the middle of the year wonderful planner! The quality is fantastic and I love that it has a elastic pen holder. I also love the fact that you can fill in the dates according to the month that you start. I always feel like I\u2019m wasting half of my planner if I get a new one in the middle of the year. if it had printed dates",

My \"what I could do better\" section is basically \"don't get sick and avoid having to put your best friend cat to sleep\". Prompts for things would be nice. I made a mind map but the vision board is blank. A highs and lows section for each week might be nice. Thinking about the best part of the week and the worst can be helpful.",

I use a RSVP pen and it fits perfectly on the pen holder and I've never been without a pen for the month I've had it so far. Would recommend for students.
