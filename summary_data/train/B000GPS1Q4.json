We now bought the Blanco matching, fitting sink grids. It is an undermount with our granite countertops and is beautiful. Not Cheap, but see before.",

    "description": "Color:Anthracite FinishBoth an expression of your individual style, and a testament to BLANCO's unsurpassed quality and craftsmanship - a variety of shape, sizes and features combine to bring you the DIAMOND collection. Every detail has been considered, from the large bowl capacity to the easy-to-clean, durable SILGRANIT surface. The BLANCO DIAMOND 1-3/4 BOWL offers plenty of room for rinsing, washing, soaking, spraying and straining operations. Made from the rock hard, SILGRANIT patented surface, the DIAMOND kitchen sink features a smooth surface that is resistant to chips, scratches and heats up to 536\u00b0F.

The colorful, non-porous surface also makes the bowl resistant from all stains, household acids and alkali solutions as well as easy-to-clean. For three generations, BLANCO has quietly and passionately elevated the standards for luxury sinks, faucets, and decorative accessories.
