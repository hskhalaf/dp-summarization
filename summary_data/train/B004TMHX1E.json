      "text": "I'm being generous, in that this is really more of a 3.5 star product. The pillow is nice and long and the outside is soft, but the stuffing moves around inside a little too much. I'm 6'4\" and this goes from my chin to my knees, which is perfect. The pillow is very comfortable and is of medium-soft firmness. My daughter can use this almost like a mattress (she's 5) and thinks it's a blast. Bottom Line: A solid product at a solid price.",
