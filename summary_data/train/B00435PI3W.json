      "text": "The unit died almost immediately after setting it up. It worked for about 5 minutes and I really like the interface. I was able to setup the vizio tv, tivo, apple tv, and roku. After a few minutes of flipping channels and trying features it died. I did all the troubleshooting to no avail. Everything was hardwired and router was Apple TC so straight forward setup. I RMA the unit and may try again. Gadgets and technology are very frustrating after you have been using Apple and Linux for so many years which just work. It is worth trying as I may again.",

It also doesn't learn remotes nor help access other content on my DVR. It does do a good job of re-organizing live tv channels into a more interesting and informative manner, but overall this will not replace the need for other remotes in your household, and only serves as an interesting way to see whats on TV right now.",

I didn't even know that I had a Science channel in my direct TV bundle. I use the App every time I watch TV now. It is so much easier to navigate than the menu cable and satellite providers force customers to use. It made me realize how frustrated I am by the 100 channels I don't watch or those that I don't get but am forced to scroll through when using a Cable remote. Peel seems so intuitive.",

Additionally, this unit is a bit tricky to set up, requiring downloading an app, etc. This latter issue is not a deal breaker. On the plus side the interface is nice and the hardware is good.
