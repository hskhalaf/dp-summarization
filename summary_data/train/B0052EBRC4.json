I tried to push the handle back-in a little because I needed the cooler for a camping trip the following day. After my adjustment the handle reinforcement was still exposed about 1/4\". After the first use, the blue plastic reinforcement to secure the handle is now half way ripped. I'll likely only get one more use before the handle breaks for good. The other handle held up, but the quality control to ship a visible defective product is poor. I will go through the return process with Amazon.",

Especially nice for camping whe you need the ice to last a lomg time. Great purchase for us! So happy with these coolers",

Not a big deal, but an inconvenience to now track down replacement hinges. We work hard to catch our fish, clams, crabs and oysters for the winter. Needless to say, it would be very upsetting to arrive home with 75 quarts of defrosted seafood.",

I picked the cooler up and the white handle snapped like it was nothing. Not happy. I know this is a cheaper cooler but that doesn't mean it should break on its first use.",
