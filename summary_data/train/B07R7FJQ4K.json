This is a huge problem for me at least who needs these for that function as much as music. UPDATE: Consistent connectivity issues even with updated firmware. The microphone quality is still terrible.

They assumed everyone that has larger ear canals have big ears and need large wing tips. I needed the large tip for best sound and seal but the wings are so large they are painful. Unfortunately there are no aftermarket options to compensate for this. It's a shame to return these due to the eartips. Sometimes engineers think too much without proper testing. They should have had separate eartip and wing options so you could mix and match for best fit like every other bud manufacturer on the planet.",

I use mine almost everyday and they still perform very well. In case it helps others, after some experimentation I found that the Comply T-600 foam tips fit these well (",

Naturally, I wanted a pair of headphones that sould stay in my ear when I'm sweaty and also sound reasonably good. These stay in your ear, are waterprood, and sound amazing! If you're considering a few different pairs, skip those others. These are the ones you should get!",

Sony WF-1000XM3 were initially a solution but kept falling out of my ears, weren't waterproof, and had the worst microphone for phone calls--captured everything except my voice; nearly impossible to have a conversation except in a quiet room. Finally found these Jaybirds. Still a bit of an issue with the microphone being sensitive to other sounds more than my voice, but other than that, perfect earbuds--amazing sound, comfy fit, discrete look, waterproof, small case, good battery life, and good noise canceling.

The blue tooth disconnects after 30 seconds to a minute then takes several minutes to reconnect. This is very irritating while running, working out etc. Not to mention I paid nearly 160.00 for these ear buds. My cheap Amazon earphones have lasted longer. So frustrated now I cannot get assistance through Jaybird because I did not buy direct from them.",
