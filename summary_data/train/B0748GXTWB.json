In my search for a natural alternative, I was shocked to find that a \"loofah\" is an actual thing that grows, and that loofahs are made from loofahs. And it's better in every way. Bigger, sturdier, firmer, more spongier, coarser.. A lot less scrubbing, a simple pass with this O.G. loofah is all you need. I still have the other two of these, maybe I'll save the seeds from those and try planting a loofah. I still can't believe you can grow these.",

Honestly I think it depends on other people\u2019s tolerance because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that bad. Yes it is rougher than your plastic loofah but if you don\u2019t press too hard while scrubbing it\u2019s not the bad and plus you get used to the feeling, and I feel like it cleans better. It\u2019s also really durable; I\u2019ve been using it for a week now and no signs of falling apart yet, let\u2019s see how long it lasts. I will make sure to update this post.",

Disappointing. ** Original review after first order** Love that they weren't individually wrapped in a ton of plastic and provide a non plastic bag to store the extras in. Love the exfoliation, not too hard, not too soft. Been using it a few weeks now and it's holding up well with no mold or smell. It's been wonderful! I will never go back to plastic puffs.",
