First and foremost, his feet stayed dry. However, after a day of playing in the snow I noticed he had something coming off the sole. It appears the soles tread is made of fabric?!!! They were literally falling apart. I am disappointed and won't recommend this pair of boots to anyone.",

There is fabric separating from the waterproof/rubber bottom, causing a \"fuzzy layer\" to form over the bottom of the boot. Because of this, the boots have no traction and my daugter is slipping all over the place. I tried removing all of the \"fuzz\", but more keeps coming; presumably from inside the boot. These boots will be thrown out and replaced with a different kind. We purchased these because we needed them quickly and they had great ratings, however, they are certainly no good for our snowy Minnesota winters.",

At first I thought my son discovered the next intact Mammuthus primigenius as his footsteps left little black hairy patches on the path we were walking on, but to my disappointment it appears that the soles are disintegrating into a hairy fibrous mess. I'm not sure what material is being used to make the soles of these boots, but apparently they break down under snowy and watery conditions. That's not a good thing...especially for snow boots. To be quite honest I have never seen a snow boot do that before...huge letdown.",

If you\u2019re child\u2019s calves are a little on the thick side you might want to consider a boot with elastic at the top or wider opening than this one.

They are pretty easy to get on and off, although I do have to help him, and they keep his feet dry in the snow. After an hour or so, he does tend to complain that his toes are getting cold, but at this price point, I think these boots are pretty good. If you live in an extremely cold climate, these may not be for you, but for temperatures in the 20s and 30s, these do the trick.",

Great boots for the cold and all the snow we have. Feet stayed warm and dry. The price is good, fit good, feet warm. Best money Nana and Papa spent this year!!",

What we thought were rubber soles are something very flimsy entirely. Now, the snow clings in clumps to the bottom of the boots, making it impossible to walk safely on snow and ice. This is uncomfortable and dangerous. The shoes are now useless, despite being comfortable on the inside. Truly disappointed!!",

      "text": "These boots are dangerous for kids. The snow packs under the tread and creates a dense snowball for your child to walk on. I thought this was a fluke with a heavy snow we had when my daughter was playing outside, but we had a lighter snow of just an inch and the same thing happened. My daughter wore the boots, walked from the car into school with a giant snowball under each foot and fell injuring her face on the floor. Spend up for better boots, little kids need something that functions correctly in snow and shouldn't have to worry about clearing a giant mound of compacted snow from the bottom of their boot.",

I used all purpose natural cleaner to wipe all the dirt off and they cleaned up pretty good considering. I hope they fit a while, i bought them a few sizes to big on purpose to be worn more than one winter. I would highly recommend them and am very satiated with the purchase!",
