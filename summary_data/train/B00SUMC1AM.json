      "text": "We have purchased less expensive deck umbrella for our wrap-around deck. These very inferior products cost about $10 less than this deck umbrella and they were damaged in just a month or two. This 5 Star is of very high quality, is of durable beautiful fabric and does NOT blow down easily. If that is not enough, there are very pretty lights that work reliably and make it fun for late night card games. I bought one for our front deck and 2 days later bought a 2nd for the back deck. They held up all summer to drenching rains, sudden windy conditions and did NOT fade! Excellent product at a great price!",

I have not been able to find an umbrella cover that will fit over the top solar device since it's wider than the tip of the umbrella. Not a huge problem, I just like to cover the umbrella when not in use . The fabric is thinner than I had imagined but definitely gets the job done of providing shade.",

I'll be honest I read reviews about them having this issue and was extra careful, even heard a crack of thunder about 2:30 in the morning and ran down and closed the umbrella in a heavy down pour storm. I was always worried about wind doing this and would close the umbrella if the wind did pick up, welp, no more of that. It's now in a landfill somewhere.",
