I did my research before I purchased this one, plus I got one for my wife who has been using cheap versions that spin. I really notice a big difference in the cleanliness of my face. Now, my pores have been cleaned out and are much smaller. My wife was surprised by how much cleaner her face feels with the Clarisonic Mia Smart Sonic Facial Cleansing Brush. She is very careful with what she puts on her face and how she cleans her face. This is her first Clarisonic device and it gets two thumbs up from her.",

I will enjoy everything else about the system. Love It!",

It\u2019s even helped minimize the big, cystic acne I get on my jawline.
