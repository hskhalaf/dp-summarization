Over the past few months I have had to resort to an older pair of Beats headphones as my Jabra earbuds have not been working correctly. Firstly the charge now only lasts 2 hours maximum. The left earbud is completely useless as it does not connect to the right earbud unless it is directly next to it and therefore playing music with both earbuds in does not work. To begin with they were brilliant headphones but long term clearly not perfect sadly.",
