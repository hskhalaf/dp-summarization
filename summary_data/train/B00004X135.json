For the 4th one (which happened to be mine; adding insult to injury), the shaft just snapped right out of the cheap metal ring that holds it in the egg-shaped head. Plastic shards rained down into my milkshake. Birthday gift broke on its first use. Sad girls. Sad mom. No milkshake for dad. This thing is a cheap piece of crap.",

This is essential, because the recipe calls for flash blending. It\u2019s very easy to use, with two speeds. I gave five stars on durability, but only time will tell how long this will last. But for the price it\u2019s perfect for my needs. It also has a cool retro look. I noticed some other reviews saying that it makes a mess. As long as you don\u2019t overfill the cup, it\u2019ll be fine. I recommend this for people making tiki drinks. This is what was used back in the day before cocktail shakers!",

So far, so good with the new mixer (which the replacement mixer head fits, so we have a spare!). I hope this one lasts another 20 years!",

But its a quick and inexpensive way to make shakes and malts. only cons are: If you set the blend setting to high all the liquid rises and spills all over so you can really use the highest settings. However on low it works good, and mixes the milk and powders really really good. If you want homemade shakes and malts this is a great little gadget.",

The ice cream that is mixed is over mixed into a frothy, airy consistency- nothing like a desirable milkshake consistency. If you try to blend evenly and move the cup down, it sprays and splatters shake around. And finally- the unit looks incredibly cheap up close. It looks like metal in the photo provided- but you can tell that it is plastic instantly in actuality. Will be returning as I only bought this to make milkshakes.. and it makes terrible milkshakes.",

The only reason I bought another one was because the plastic end on the stir stick became so thin over the years that it broke. (I use ice in my mixes) The old unit is still working",

    "title": "Hamilton Beach 730C DrinkMaster Classic Drink Mixer, 28 oz Mixing Cup, Chrome",
    "description": "Recreate the days when thick, milkshakes ruled and the best drinks in town came from a soda fountain. It\u2019s easy with the Hamilton Beach Drink Master Chrome Classic. With two speeds and a tillable mixing head, chocolate malts, vanilla shakes or soda fountain drinks can be enjoyed at home by the whole family. And the best part is everyone can pick their own mix-ins. Start with ice cream and some milk, and then add anything from pineapple and coconut to cookies or pieces of your favorite candy bar. The 28 ounce stainless steel mixing cup gives you plenty of room to create a delicious treat. The two speeds let you blend and mix to create the perfect texture. When finished, the detachable spindle removes easily for cleanup. Make family night a little sweeter with the Hamilton Beach Drink Master Chrome Classic now that\u2019s Good Thinking.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nDrop a dime into the jukebox, press F2 for Fats Domino's \"Blueberry Hill,\" and dreamily drift back to the '50s, when bobbysoxers and guys with ducktails or wearing white bucks (never, ever both) idled away after-school hours at the local drugstore's soda fountain sipping chocolate malts that had been churned to a smooth, frothy consistency by a mixer exactly like this one. Hamilton Beach's drink mixers began appearing at soda fountains in 1911; this 14-1/2-inch-high, 70-watt model, in creamy green, recalls Elvis's first decade. But it's 21st-century, too, blending fruit smoothies and health drinks as well as milk shakes and malted milks. Also use it to mix puddings and beat eggs for omelets. Two speeds offer mixing flexibility, and the tilting head makes it easy to remove the spindle for cleaning. Its professional-style, stainless-steel cup holds 28 ounces and is dishwasher-safe. --Fred Brack",
