Major drawback for me is that later down the line when she needs to actually take all her books to school she may get some difficulty in opening the bag wide as the elastics on the side prevents it from opening up like the jansport.",

I also like the pattern because it's unique and bright. The only thing I don't like about this backpack is that the material along the edges of the straps is a little rough, and always rubs against my clothing.
