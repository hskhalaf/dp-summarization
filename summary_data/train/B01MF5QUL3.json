Very high quality/durable. Such a great idea. Now my wife won't be complaining about sand in her bag at the beach! Just a very convenient product.",

The tubing was a little small but the hook tightened OK. This is a permanent installation so I secured it further with silicon injected around the top & bottom. The only improvement for this application might be a hook optimized for smaller tubing. Let me know if you want a photo.",
