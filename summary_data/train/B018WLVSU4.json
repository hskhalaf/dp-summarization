Its unique blade has serrated edges to slice through smaller roots or saw through larger ones (within reason). It is definitely an advantage over regular shovels when there are root barriers. A great addition to your \"arsenal\"!",

When you start getting into straw size (circumference) and bigger, you need to work a tad harde, but, it's not a big deal. The size and shape of the metal spade lets you dig from a few inches to one foot at a time. The height of the handle is perfect for me (5'10\"), and the spade has a nice foot rest (?) for you to confidently apply pressure with no slippage. The product arrived in a timely and well packaged manner. I have no complaints, and would gladly order from these folks again.",
