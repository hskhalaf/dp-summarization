      "text": "Trying to shoot video on my iPhone is in the past, now I have this new camera. Had it for around 6 weeks and totally LOVE it! I've never had a Canon before, but I'm really impressed. The video function is easy to use, has a flip up screen to check yourself out on, and the still image element has loads of great features to help create the best pic you can. The best thing about it is the crisp high def that you get, and you can even shoot in low light. I bought lights for my studio, but haven't really had to use them yet (and I'm shooting in Jan/Feb). Very chuffed with this, and would highly recommend.",
