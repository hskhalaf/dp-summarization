All I have to say is this is a lifesaver. I have been able to go to work, go to the super market, and get around much easier than crutches. If you like attention, this scooter will definitely turn you into a superstar wherever you go. Everyone wants to ride it. People see your boot and scratch their temples like how is she getting around post surgery so easily. I LOVE IT! Also fits easily in my trunk and I have a Honda Accord Coupe. If you have any leg or foot injury this is a MUST HAVE!",

The scooter performed adequately on indoor smooth surfaces but was not good on the roughened concrete used in many sidewalks. It was totally useless on gravel or brick walkways. If you need to go on a variety of surfaces, find a scooter with larger, wider tires. The scooter was not as stable as other ones I have used but by positioning my weigh towards the back wheels, I avoided problems. The seat where you rest your knee is very comfortable. The design of the knee-rest is the best part of this light-weight scooter.",

NO INSTRUCTIONS - had to google the product and watch a You Tube video to figure out how to put it together. NO INSTRUCTIONS on how to take it apart and I haven't been able to find a You Tube video to give instructions.",
