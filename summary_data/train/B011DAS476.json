I don't own many rings besides my wedding ring. I also own a lot of jewelry, and I was pleasantly surprised with how much this box could hold and organize. The quality looks decent, although I doubt its real leather. The bottom taller drawer is great for big chunky bracelets. The other drawers with dividers are perfect for my many earrings. I liked that this seller shows you the inside of all the drawers, which other jewelry boxes for sale on Amazon did not do.",

All five drawers can pull all the way out so you can easily sort or find things in the back. It seems very sturdy and I think will last me for many, many years.
