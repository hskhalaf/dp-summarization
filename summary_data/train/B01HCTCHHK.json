I also wish they came in other solid colors such as purple, pink, and blue. The lights were easy to put up without any help, just be sure to unwind them as you go and not all at once if possible. I have a lot of solar lights in my yard for my grandchildren and this brand seems to fit in nicely. I will be reordering this product, they've been in my garden for a few weeks now and are working beautifully.",

I used them to light a small outdoor stairwell (5 steps, and I looped over 6 times) but it didn't help much in terms of lighting. Worse, I would set the program to a steady light, which wasn't the first setting but rather a number of clicks through, and then annoyingly, the lights would reset every 4-5 days to the default (flashing) and I would have to re-adjust the program. The nail in the coffin to this brand is that after 3 months, they stopped working altogether. Boo. Not worth your time or money.",

I am in SoCal and the PV was aimed toward the southern skies, directly toward the sun. The second string acted the same, but lasted another month before failing.

It needs to be ON to charge (according to limited instructions), but no light or anything to indicate if the on/off single button is actually on or off. I've resorted to covering the panel to test on and off during the daylight to make sure it's on to charge. Wouldn't buy again. Pros - it's long, and lights are bright (when it works)",

      "text": "These lights were great, and came as advertised. At first I thought they weren't working; user error, the sun has to go down to see if they've charged properly, and they were! They had different speeds, from fast, to slow, to dimming, to staying on constant. I loved them, and even had the panel in a not so sunny part of my yard, but it still charged! Unfortunately my black lab got ahold of the panel when I wasn't paying attention, RIP solar string lights, but I will definitely be purchasing again! They are a great addition to our deck!",

Maybe I could outline some tomato cages! These stay lit all night. The next day's morning sun turns them off. I'm pleased with the warm white color and how long they stay lit.",
