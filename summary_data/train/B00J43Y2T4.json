      "text": "Bought 2 sets for my 10 x 10 canopy (7.5 lb + 7.5 lb on each leg) and the weights kept the canopy firmly on the ground during strong wind gusts at a town expo on main street.Some other people were using gallon jugs full of water or sand, but the jugs had to be tied to the canopy upper support structure which greatly decreased their effectiveness. Many vendors had to physically hold on to their canopy so it would not blow away during the wind gusts. Very pleased with performance and the weights are easily transportable with no leaking of the contents. Highly recommended.",

The first year we had our canopies, I simply staked down the legs and anchor cords that came with the Coleman canopy. Then a 50 mph front moved through and simply picked up the canopy and twisted into knots. After replacing the canopy, I bought 8 of these weights and placed them on the windward sides. The next strong front came through and made the canopy shudder like mad, but the weights prevented the canopy from lifting up and pulling out the stakes. No damage.",
