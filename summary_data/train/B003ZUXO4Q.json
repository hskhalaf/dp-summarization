Make sure to use pot holders though, those handles get mighty hot!",

However, the manufacturer recommends simmering on lowest heat with the lids fully on. The other bother is that washing them requires care not to use abrasive pads other than non scratch, otherwise their surface will be immediately ruined. They can be put in the dishwasher. Quite costly but worth it.",

    "title": "Le Creuset 3-Ply Stainless Steel Saucepan Set - Silver, 5 Pieces",
    "description": "The Le Creuset three ply Stainless Steel range is made using the multi layering technology where stainless steel and aluminium are bonded together to form the special three ply material. A core of aluminium is sandwiched between two layers of premium grade stainless steel cleverly combining the cooking benefits of both materials. The aluminium stretches from base to rim, meaning heat spreads evenly and gently throughout the entire pan - not just the base. Professional style cast handles are attached with stainless steel rivets, secure fixing and the addition of helper handles makes lifting easier. Close fitting lids retain moisture and heat for efficient and nutritious cooking in the casserole, other thoughtful touches include capacity markings and an all round pouring rim. Suitable for use on all hob types including induction, oven and grill safe.",
