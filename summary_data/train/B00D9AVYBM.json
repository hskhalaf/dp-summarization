I was afraid it would be damaged or there would be something wrong with it because of the price and the fact that I ordered it online, but there are absolutely no problems. It was not damaged at all during shipping. I had no trouble activating it and using it. As for the Galaxy SIII in general, I really like it. It is fast, easy to navigate and has a lot of features I enjoy. I am very glad I got this phone!",

Love the phone it was listed as very good shape. I would say it was more like excellent shape had just a couple of tiny scuffs on the plastic cover screen was perfect. Phone has operated like it was new, battery life on this Samsung Galaxy S III is better than the Samsung Galaxy S III I was using even when it was new. Very pleased with the phone they delivered thank you.",

However very disappointed with the battery, it is worse than my 3 years old HTC rhyme, it drains within 5-6 hours from 100% to 0% completely while idle , without making a single phone call, texting or even using data, I am planning to buy a higher strength battery with 7200RPM but I saw reviews that it is bulky and disrupts with IQ signal. Besides I am worried if my cool tardis case cover that i just got for this phone won't fit anymore. With such nice phone they could have provided a better battery. :(",

      "text": "I compared many phones before I made a decision to buy this one. I talked others who had owned this phone. I was nervous to spend so much money on a phone. When it finally arrived, it was really easy to transfer my information from my other phone. The battery lasts much longer than my other phone. I really love how easy it is to use. The screen is much more sensitive to touch and makes texting easier. It has surpassed my expectations. I just love love love this phone!!!",

I have canceled Boost service and selling phone on Craig's list. Buy the Galaxy SIII, just avoid Boost. The GSIII has all the great features you expect from a high end smart phone. I have moved on to the unlocked Nexus 5. Give me poor service and I'll move to different cell provider.",

The button positions are just awful, no thought went into how this phone might be carried or used. Normally I can get a phone case that goes around the buttons so that they are not pressed inside my pocket. This phone has a button on the front below the screen, and the slightest touch turns the phone on for a few seconds. In a pocket this happens so much the phone will get hot like a hand warmer, it's just stupid.",

I'm happy with the product since instead of using an itouch to hear music, a kindle to also hear music and use the web, a small brick phone for texts and calls, the galaxy is the whole package.",
