It fits comfortably in my hand, the length is just right, the jaws are rotatable as needed, and especially, the padded jaws allow me to pick up almost anythng! Definitely worth the money, and something everyone whose mobility is becoming limited and/or who can't reach quite as far as they used to should consider buying.",

These tools keep you or your loved ones needing to bend over and pick things off the floor or try to struggle for things up high, these are high reasons for falls in the home. I recommend buying a bit of sticky velcro to attach to the reacher and walker (if using one) to keep this device always handy. Be safe!",

      "text": "I love this reacher . It can be turned around and angled to reach light boxes or bags. I used it to position and retrieve spices bottles and jello boxes. I used it to get light cans. It is a great light weight reacher for picking up light items. I use it for paper,cards, leaves, light twigs, paper clips, etc. This is great for any light items that are not bulky or go beyond reacher width.This is not meant for heavy items.",
