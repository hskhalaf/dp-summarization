It boasts versatility, accommodating various track and field tournaments. This is owed by the running spike to its top-notch componentry. With the Hyper MD 5, users can expect featherlight support and traction on the tracks.",

        "Several reviewers compliment the lightness of the Hyper MD 5",
        "It has an appropriate amount of cushioning, remarked some athletes",

By the time you buy the spike and tool separate and go to a sporting goods store you might as well buy a shoe a tad bit more expensive that comes with all the spikes and tool. I have since purchased New Balance that are ready for use. I wear New Balance and love them.",
