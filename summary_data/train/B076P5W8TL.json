This vest is great. It\u2019s moldable and came exactly as pictured with two service dog, and two in training patches. Shipping was incredibly fast. My only suggestion would be to add more Velcro. You can only have one patch on each side at a time. Would be nice to have service dog and in training on the same side. Or maybe in training on top or in front. Still recommend.",
