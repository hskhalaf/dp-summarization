Very disappointed with the amount of cheap plastic in the unit and its accessories. Things are going to break. Compact size and less weight are nice but dust bag size is very small which will probably require frequent and costly changes. Compared to my old Kenmore, this Miele model is a big let down. At $200 or so it would be a good buy; at $400 it is way over priced.",

The only downside is that it does not have a hook to secure the stem and suction head against the canister for storage in the upright position; it has one to store it in the horizontal position, which takes more space.
