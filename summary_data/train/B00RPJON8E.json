One would overheat (?) within 20-30 minutes and shut down for a short period. The other did the same, but would not come back on until all heat had dissipated in the case. I still need to send a replacement to Uganda, but will not use this model again. Consider the final destination, as there are places in the US that would match the weather in Uganda. North Pole?

If sound quality is a necessity, attach external speakers. I would definitely buy again.",

We have played DVDs, Blu Ray, and streamed content through this from Planet Earth to sporting events and all of them look fantastic. I would say that I would buy this again, but I don't plan on ever having to do so. Highly recommend this projector!",

The picture is bright and sharp and the colors are true. Despite the company's advertising, the unit's internal speaker is nothing special.

Do note that this projector has a non-standard throw ratio, which makes pictures look smaller than most projectors for the same distance. This was exactly what I wanted so I ended up with a perfectly sized picture in my living room. If the characteristics of this projector fit your room, then it's really a good option. I connect it to my Amazon Fire TV stick and then use the audio output jack to feed a Bluetooth transmitter and then connect my Bose speakers. Really powerful combo! I love it!",

No complaints for either use. I have in the past taken it on business trips and it performed better than expected for that as well. Excel is typically the toughest thing to project and this projector did as well as many other much more expensive units. I will be purchasing a second one of these projectors to use in sports film study groups. On of my best purchases ever!",

      "text": "I have been using this projector for about 2 months now. It took me several months before I finally deciding on this one. I have watched several of my movies in 3D. Everything about this projector is super awesome! The images produced by this projector is fantastic. The problem I'm having right now is that anytime I connect my Comcast cable box directly to the projector to watch a movie, the HDMI connection keeps dropping like every 5 minutes during the entire movie. This is not fun but I hope somebody will tell me why this is happening. I don't have any problem when projector is connected to laptop, 3D Blu-ray player or other media players.",

CONS: Not a lot of specs about what was included with the projector- cords, etc. A hard case for it was available for storage/keeping it clean would be a fantastic investment if available!",
