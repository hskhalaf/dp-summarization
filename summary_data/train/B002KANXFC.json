      "text": "Nikon is a necessity to create NIFTY Photos! My new Coolpix S70 is great and performs flawlessly to my own abilities. My only request would be an instructional video /DVD to achieve all the capabilities included in this tiny package. I initially purchased this camera with thoughts of the S70 allowing my sweetheart, a C6 Quadriplegic to take photos because of the touch screen command interface. Eureka! It works for her. We are both very happy with that capability. Just learning to operate the S70 now, so I will discover more features as I add skills. Great Product. Nikon Glass is the best. The size of camera should lend itself to \"Stealh\" photo opportunities.",

But, most importantly, I'm surprised by the other reviewers who say the photos are great as I think the photo quality is very poor. I've tried various auto options and have tested all the manual settings and cannot get a really good photo. I'm not new to Nikon - I've had other Nikon Coolpix cameras that I loved and I also have the Nikon D300 SLR and have been a Nikon owner for 40 years but this one is the worst...sorry to say!",

The screen brightness is great and the touch is responsive. The internal optical zoom is nice and you don't have lens moving outside of the case. The only downside (minor) is the lens is in the top left corner and at first was easily covered by your finger when you hold the camera. This was easy to see and correct. Quality is great.",

He uses it with ease and has loved being able to take pictures! The touch-screen zoom, flash, review, etc is all extremely accessible. The picture quality is great 90% of the time. You can always default to using the \"button\" on top of the camera to take pictures. The battery life is excellent and really the whole product is a dream come true.",

    "title": "Nikon Coolpix S70 12.1MP Digital Camera with 3.5-inch OLED Touch Screen and 5x Wide Angle Optical Vibration Reduction (VR) Zoom (Black & Black)",
    "description": "Color:Black & BlackFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nFrom the Manufacturer \n\nIn Style with a Cool Touch. The next generation of touch display. \n\nNikon\u2019s sleek, sexy Coolpix S70 combines 12.1 effective megapixels and 5x wide-angle zoom with a beautiful, bright 3.5-inch Clear Color High-Resolution Organic LED touch-panel display that makes taking and sharing pictures easy. The Coolpix S70 combines Nikon\u2019s 5-way Optical VR Image Stabilization system and a touch shutter that gets you sharp pictures throughout the zoom range. The Coolpix S70 features Nikon\u2019s Smart Portrait System that enables you to get great portraits with a touch of the shutter! The Coolpix S70 also features an HD (720p) Movie Mode. Now you can view HD movies on your computer and share them with family and friends! \n\nVibrant Clear Color OLED touch screen operation and advanced functions served up in style with the tactile sophistication of dual texture design \n\n\n\nFeaturing Nikon\u2019s innovative Clear Color OLED display and a highly responsive capacitive touch screen, the Coolpix S70 is the smart and fashionable photographic tool that makes picture-taking a greater joy. \n\nThe Coolpix S70 introduces Nikon\u2019s newly developed 3.5-incg Clear Color OLED Display with refined touch control that offers a new level of intuitive fingertip shooting control and a variety of exciting playback options. \n\nOLED technology delivers the immediately recognizable benefits of vivid color reproduction, sharp contrast, and absence of afterimages. Nikon combines this with our own innovative Clear Color Display technology, making the large 3.5-inch OLED display a real eyeful. In addition highly responsive new capacitive touch screen technology adds the benefit of sure and immediate response at the lightest touch of the display\u2019s surface for a fun and intuitive feel to every camera operation. \n\nAdvanced new shooting features that leverage this quick and easy fingertip control include Touch Shutter, which, at a single touch, releases the shutter after focus and exposure are locked on the subject. In addition, new on-screen sliders provide touch control over brightness (exposure) and Scene Effect Adjustment. \n\nTouch control also makes viewing and retouching images more fun and efficient. The speed and ease of fingertip scrolling through images is matched only by the fun of using a pinching motion with two fingers to zoom in or out on displayed images, switch between thumbnail and full screen views, and so on. \n\nHigh-performance imaging capabilities include 12.1 effective megapixels of sharp resolution matched to the compositional freedom of a precision 5x zoom Nikkor lens that covers focal lengths from 28-140mm (35mm format equivalent). Advanced digital image-processing faithfully reproduces fine details and subtle tones, delivers quick response, and maintains image quality and clarity when taking advantage of extended light sensitivity settings as high as ISO 6400*. \n\nThe Coolpix S70 features a slim body wrapped in a sumptuous dual texture design that pleases the eyes and the hands with its trendsetting good looks. \n*ISO 3200 and 6400 are available only for image sizes of 3M (2048 x 1536) or smaller. \n\nNikon Coolpix S70 Feature Highlights \n\nEXPEED digital imaging technology\nNikon\u2019s smarter approach to digital imaging technology. From image capture to processing, Nikon\u2019s comprehensive EXPEED digital imaging concept encompasses the entire picture-taking operation. EXPEED is much more than a processing engine; it is a revolution in digital photography. \n\nNew 3.5-inch Clear Color OLED Display with touch control \nThe Coolpix S70 introduces a new 3.5-inch, wide-screen OLED Display with approx. 288k-dot resolution. In addition to the immediately recognizable benefits of vivid color reproduction and sharp contrast, OLED technology also improves power efficiency and allows for a thinner camera design. New capacitive touch screen technology ensures sure and immediate response to finger action on the display\u2019s glass surface. Other features include anti-reflection coating and brightness adjustment. \n\nFive advanced image stabilizing features* for sharper results\nVR image stabilization in action Nikon's Hybrid Optical lens shift and Electronic VR image stabilization systems combine to help produce blur-free images. High ISO 6400** capability allows faster shutter speeds when shooting in low light or capturing fast-moving subjects. Motion Detection automatically controls shutter speed and the ISO setting to compensate for subject movement and camera shake. And, Nikon\u2019s original BSS (Best Shot Selector) function automatically shoots a series of sequential frames and saves the one with the sharpest focus. \n* The camera selects and uses only the features required to optimize each image.\n** ISO 3200 and 6400 are available only for image sizes of 3M (2048 x 1536) or smaller. \n\nNikon\u2019s Smart Portrait System with Skin Softening\nFace-priority AF helps produce more satisfying portraits by adjusting focus and exposure for as many as 12 faces in the framed shot. Skin Softening function detects and analyzes a framed subject\u2019s skin, and then adjusts smoothness to produce enhanced results. Smile Timer automatically releases the shutter when the subject smiles, while its Blink Proof function shoots two sequential frames, then saves the one in which the subject\u2019s eyes are widest open. Blink Warning presents an alert when it suspects that someone in the shot has blinked. In-Camera Red-Eye Fix automatically corrects any perceived red-eye effect before saving the image to memory. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntelligent automated shooting modes that promote carefree shooting\nNikon\u2019s Scene Auto Selector makes it faster and easier to capture the moment by eliminating the need to manually select a scene mode to match the intended shot. This intelligent function determines the subject, analyzes the surrounding settings, and then automatically selects the appropriate scene mode for optimal results. Subject Tracking enhances the shooting experience by following the subject\u2019s movement to ensure clear focus and quick response when that special shutter opportunity presents itself. Subject Tracking even functions if the subject moves out of the frame for a second or two. \n\nQuick Retouch\nQuick Retouch automatically adjusts the contrast and saturation of selected photos to create an enhanced copy with the right finishing touch. \n\nNikon Coolpix S70 Other Features\n\n *  D-Lighting in action \n * Selection of three different stylish HOME screen displays \n * Macro shooting from as close as 3 cm (1.2 in.) \n * 16 handy scene modes for optimized shooting in various settings \n * D-Lighting \n * Active Zoom \n * Versatile file sorting functions \n * Four movie modes with sound \n * Time zone function for easy setting of multiple locations \n * Approx. 20 MB of internal memory \n * Hi-Speed USB connectivity with USB charging via Charging AC Adapter EH-68P or PC \n\nWhat\u2019s in the Box  * EN-EL12 Rechargeable Li-ion Battery \n * EH-68P AC Adapter/Charger \n * UC-E6 USB Cable \n * EG-CP14 Audio Video Cable \n * AN-CP19 Strap \n * Coolpix Software Suite CD-ROM",
