I put it in last night and I can't stop touching my hair. There's no frizz even in LA being kind of near the ocean. Not for nothing, but it's made me like my curls even more. Try it.",

On the other hand, I'm not sure if it was this seller or the other few I recently purchased from, but my card and bank account was compromised. Thank goodness for having a good bank, so luckily no money was actually stolen, but just beware.",
