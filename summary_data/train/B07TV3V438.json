I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to do at-home workouts or if you want to gain muscle without using weights. Both the Pilates circle and bands are great quality and you can use them for arm, ab, and leg workouts. I also love how you get the light, medium, heavy, and extra heavy bands with this one product. Super happy that I got these!",

That is not how a pilates ring should be. It should be flexible enough to push in, yet have enough resistance to provide a workout. This does not. It is immovable. Only reason for the one is because the bands have a carry case which is helpful. Though I had to buy another set of bands when the lightest one broke after one rep during daughter\u2019s physical therapy.",
