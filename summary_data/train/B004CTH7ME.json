As soon as I open the package I noticed the messy glue job all over the board. I haven't checked other things but the letters on the tiles were bright and legible. If I can't see the workmanship what's the point of paying extra?",

The game surface under the tile grid is just glued down paper that looked like it would curl up around the edges before long. The letter tiles are not engraved \u2014 just printed onto the wood. The tile bag is too small for adult hands to easily reach into to grab tiles. I expected a premium product for that price and was very disappointed. Returned right away.",

      "text": "This was a Christmas gift from my husband. I started playing scrabble with my father when I was a kid and am now playing with my children. This is a nice board. It stores everything inside and even comes with a score pad. The color of the board is different from my old one, so that was an adjustment. The only draw back is that the letters are printed in gold and the light glares off of them. It makes them a little more difficult to view. However, gold letters are pretty cool.",

There were several vintage ones on e-bay, but Amazon is so much better I just went with it and got a new one. It turned out pretty well. We thought there was a malfunction with the tiles, but it turned out that I had misplayed a letter as a blank on the second play with this board. Can't remember what word I made though.",
