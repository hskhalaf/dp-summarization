So far I've used it for slicing bagels and spreading cream cheese on them (no simple chore for most knives), slicing onions, tomatoes, mushrooms, bell peppers, sausage and pepperoni (sounds like I'm making a pizza...haha). Suffice is to say that this knife is now the crown jewel in my Dalstrong collection.",

Only used since Christmas, as I got it for a gift, but seems to be high quality & durable, with full tang set into nice treated wood handle & a very sharp blade. Came with a sturdy blade cover in very nice cushioned box. If it holds up to regular use well, I\u2019m happy to buy more in a variety of sizes. Wish there was a 5\u201d. Also- got email from company (via Amazon) asking about our satisfaction. Very thoughtful & a rarety these days.",

It is like a serrated cleaver. Speaking of, it is dull, barely sawing through pealed tomatoes. Doubt I'll keep it. Better to spend $44 on a well engineered German knife, than this allegedly \"German steel\" hatchet. The supplied sheath fits very loosely, provides no safety at all. The only good thing, handle looks pretty, at least brand new.",

The knife is hefty and sturdy\u2014and very sharp. It does what it says it will do. It slices bread and sandwiches, English muffins, whatever. It also will slice a tomato or something like that, and it has that nice, rounded tip for spreading condiments. It\u2019s by far my favorite knife right now. I want to get more from this brand, if possible.",

The utility knife he's not sure about, simply because we've never had one before, so he's not quite sure what it's useful for. Don't worry: He'll figure it out. Overall, he loves the knives. I'm pretty sure I couldn't have found anything better at this price level. Thank you for a quality product.",
