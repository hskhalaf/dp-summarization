It does a LOT more than the original remote, which fell out of the recliner the day this one arrived, along with giving me air mouse, volume control, mute, and FULL keypad (no more using the stupid onscreen keyboard for us!) and many more abilities that we are still discovering. Only flaw I found is with Funimation, no button on here will make it click to start, every other channel works like a charm, so it much just be Funimation (luckily I found the other remote, I guess).

Setup was very easy, but I do wish there was an app to program all of the keys on the remote to mimic keyboard buttons. Overall a very cool item and exactly what I was looking for!",

I'm not going to keep it and use it without the cover on it, that is just ridiculous. Sending back this faulty item. Sadly, because all the reviews suggested it was a good choice, and it probably is, unless you have one with this bizarre quirky fault.",

      "text": "First off, let me say that this is one of the best MX3 remotes I have owned. There was only one problem that I've had. Installing the dongle into the side of my Android TV box, it seems that it can only turn off the box. Once the box powers off, you can't turn it back on. I've reached out to Favormates, and it was confirmed that the remote can only turn off the power and not turn on. Seems like something you should mention on the description of the device. Right? Besides that one flaw, it's a good remote over others that I've used.",
