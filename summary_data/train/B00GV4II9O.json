It's no-kidding, light as a feather, and somehow effective for me with nothing but a t-shirt underneath in temperatures down to about 25 degrees. The fit is slim, and would not allow much in terms of layers underneath, so not a true long-duration solution in extreme temps.",

Pilot is very elegant and neutral looking great with many pieces of my wardrobe. Very happy. Money well spent.",

      "text": "For an activity jacket in midrange temperatures, this is a good bet. Keep in mind that the light insulation is strategically placed and the side panels are venting. That is, this is better used for strenuous hiking than sitting in a stadium to watch a late fall football game. The weight is minimal and it compresses for packing. In the right size (one up for me), it clings but doesn't restrict movement. The coverage is good. The materials and workmanship are of good quality. It's a nice athletic jacket but you need to find a discounted price to get the value for your money.",

    "title": "Arc'teryx mens Atom Lt Jacket",
    "description": "The Atom LT Jacket from Arc'teryx functions perfectly as an outer layer when times are cool and dry, but functions just as well as a mid layer in those chilly and wet conditions. This jacket offers Coreloft insulation to keep you super warm, but also offers permeable sides to allow for some airflow if things heat up; aside from that, the Atom LT Jacket will provide you with enough pockets for storing all of the essentials, and then some. Featuring an Arc'teryx logo on the chest and some nice dark colors makes the Atom LT Jacket stylish enough for any occasion. PRODUCT FEATURES: Fit: Trim, hip length Tinthan: 100% nylon Polartec Power Stretch with Hardface Technology: 88% polyester, 12% elastane Coreloft: 60 insulation (60 g/m Light, soft face fabric has DWR finish to repel moisture and good air permeability for active use Low profile, stretch side panels provide trim fit and allow for ventilation Mid height collar is soft next to skin, insulated, and layers easily Two zippered hand pockets, internal zippered chest pockets 14645 , arcteryx Mens Atom LT Jackets , arcteryx atom lt jackets , arcteryx atom jackets , arcteryx mens atom jackets , arcteryx mens atoms , arcteryx mens jackets , arcteryx jackets , arcteryx coats , arcteryx mens coats , arcteryx mens outerwear , arcteryx outerwear , arcteryx mens insulated jackets , arcteryx insulated jackets , arcteryx mens outerlayers , arcteryx outerlayers , arcteryx mens outer layers , arcteryx outer layers , arcteryx mens midlayers , arcteryx midlayers , arcteryx mens mid layers , arcteryx mid layers , arcteryx mens winter jackets , arcteryx winter jackets , arcteryx mens clothing , arcteryx clothing , arcteryx mens apparel , arcteryx apparel , Arc'teryx Mens Atom LT Jackets , Arc'teryx atom lt jackets , Arc'teryx atom jackets , Arc'teryx mens atom jackets , Arc'teryx mens atoms , Arc'teryx atoms , Arc'teryx atom lts , Arc'teryx mens atom lts , atom lt jackets from Arc'teryx , mens atom lt jackets from Arc'teryx , atoms fr",

      "Polartec Power Stretch with Hardface Technology\u201488% polyester, 12% elastane, 230 g/m\u00b2. Coreloft 60 (60 g/m\u00b2) insulation. Tyono 20 denier shell with DWR treatment - 100% nylon.",
      "ESSENTIAL PIECE - Fact: Every person at Head Office owns at least one Atom LT; most of the women have two. The reason: Coreloft insulation inside a light taffeta shell. All the comfort of a sleeping bag, but it feels weightless.",
      "WINDSHELL - The benefit of taffeta fabrics is their light, airy nature with an ability to turn aside wind. The Atom series have a taffeta outer lining that is treated with DWR (durable water resistant) finish to give them a long-lasting ability to shed moisture. In light precipitation, the Atom LT can be worn as an outer layer.",
      "NO SWEAT - Mid layers that can function as outer layers have varied degrees of weather shedding capability; they also have varied degrees of moisture management. In addition to being made of breathable Coreloft insulation, the Atom LT has breathable side panels of Polartec Power Stretch with Hardface technology to help regulate temperature during exertion.",
      "PACK LIGHT - Highly compressible, Atom pieces pack down into a tiny parcel of stored warmth. Store the jacket inside its own pocket, or tuck it into a sleeve or inside the hood if you are not restricted by space. A quick shake restores the original loft, time and again."
