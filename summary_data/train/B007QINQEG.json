It's not like a sleeping bad material, which is a plus in my opinion. It is very soft and cuddly. Easy to roll up. I've washed it 3 times since I've gotten it a week ago and still looks brand new, no color fade. My daughter absolutely loves her nap mat. We purchased the unicorn one. Would definitely reccomend to anyone! There is also a blank pink pocket on front that was perfect to vinyl her name for personalization.",

They are also super easy to wash; the pillow is removeable. We hang dry when we can, but also tumble dry when needed. My 4 year old can roll it up on her own and has been able to for the last year. Our first one lasted just over a year with weekly washings. Other more expensive nap mats we\u2019ve purchased made it far less than a year without falling apart.",

It's also nice that it has an outside pocket to tuck her taggie and bink in so everything is together. She should be able to use this until she is 4 or 5 based on size.

A couple downsides to this is that her toes stick out of the bottom (she's average hight) and it's a bit thin for school floors so I added the basic foam mat underneath for extra comfort.

The only reason I give it 4 stars is because the 2 velcro straps used to close the mat after rolling it are too short for a small child. An adult has the strenght to roll the mat really tide so that the velcro straps close in place. How ever for a small child that has to roll their own mat in preschool its nearly impossible. I had to take the mat to the simstress and extend the straps so my daugther could roll and close the mat on her own.",
