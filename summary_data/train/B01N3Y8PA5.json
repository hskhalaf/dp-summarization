      "text": "These look amazing. Would have been cool if they could have worked in the trademark stripes but they look super clean and stealth without them so. A little worried about stains getting on the fabric part. The woven material is legit. Flexible and breathable but also secure. The material gives the shoe kind of a rough carbon fiber tactical sports car vibe. Pulling the tongue straight is wierd, it\u2019s like a single layer of really flexible woven fabric. They are all day casual comfort approved for me.",

Also they weigh like this:clean>boost>bounce.My location max temperature is 87 F, relatively hot. Two pairs of leather shoes will be a bit stuffy. Bounce is breathable and light compared to them. But the insole will shift. Ortholite insole is really breathable and dry. I hope adidas can be applied to all shoes, after all, the cost is not much.",
