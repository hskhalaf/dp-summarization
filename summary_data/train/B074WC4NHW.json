People laugh when Cozmo recognizes their face and says their name out loud. But then a few minutes later he's tossed back in the corner to chill for a few more months. Bottom line: it's a toy. He's well built with lots of features and games, and for the price, you're really getting a lot of great technology. But he's a toy.",

Overall I would highly recommend this little guy for children. However, they have to be able to read so they can follow the instruction on the phone.

I\u2019m thinking his parents will also enjoy it, Cozmo also has a cam when using the app on your phone or tablet. Not sure of the battery life yet, but he\u2019s only on for less than an hour at most with my nephew. I\u2019d get this robot for my other nieces and nephews if they wanted or Vector.",

Curiously smart and a little mischievous. You see, Cozmo is a real-life robot like you\u2019ve only seen in movies, with a one-of-a-kind personality that evolves the more you hang out. He\u2019ll nudge you to play and keep you constantly surprised. Cozmo\u2019s your accomplice in a crazy amount of fun.\n\nCreative coding.\nCozmo\u2019s big brain and even bigger personality are operated by impressive technology. Besides all the games and smarts he comes with out of the box, you have access to a visual programming language that\u2019s stem-ready for beginners. Program Cozmo to do anything from performing a victory dance, sneezing, or playing hot potato with his Cubes. Simply use the drag and drop coding blocks on the Cozmo app to build a new combination of blocks, and you\u2019ll see Cozmo act out your creation. There are no limits to what you can create. All it takes is imagination.\n\nSome of the games you can play with Cozmo:\n\nQuick tap.\nBoth you and Cozmo need your own Cube to play. When your Cube is flashing, tap it to begin the game. When the colors on both Cubes match, the first player to tap their Cube gets a point. Only tap when colors match. \n\nMemory Match.\nGame time just got another dose of fun. Follow the pattern on Cozmo\u2019s Cubes. Watch the lights, listen to the tones. You and Cozmo take turns remembering and repeating the series as it grows more complex. Sound easy? just wait. Cozmo\u2019s sharper than he looks. \n\nKeepaway.\nYou need 1 Cube to play. Move the Cube close to Cozmo to get him to pounce, but pull it away before he can get a point. Watch out! if you\u2019re too slow, Cozmo will get the point!\n\nCozmo also has accessories. Check out the Cozmo case to bring him anywhere. or get him different colored treads to suit his moods.",
