We do have another that has not broken , so hoping it will not happen again. UPDATE ON 2ND PURCHASE: Sadly, same thing happened, but his time after only 2 months. Will not buy this product again.

Had I been more involved I would have steered her away from this design. This bag has the zipper that allows the bag to lay flat, the premise being that you can unzip open it fully in half and pass TSA screening with the laptop left in the bag. Doesn't work that way anymore. Laptops have to be completely removed. This wastes the entire center of the bag. My other 2 bags are standard and have that extra center compartment. Otherwise a great bag.",

It has everything you need: multiple pockets, good-sized water bottle holders, a padded back zip pocket that holds your laptop and folds flat for travel. It looks well constructed and is just a darned good-looking backpack. HOWEVER - I am 5'3\" -- short but on the wide-shouldered side for a woman. And yet these straps are far too wide for me. They dig into the sides of my armpits in front, such that with a laptop inside, it's painful to reach forward with my arms. Please, Swiss Gear, make some flex-adjustable shoulder straps or differently-shaped straps (see North Face Borealis for an example) that better fit women!",

I ordered this backpack and returned it because it was bigger than I thought it would be and had waaaaaay too many compartments and zippers. In the product photo they have all the zipper pulls laying neatly along the zippers and that camouflages them giving the bag a cleaner look. When I saw the backpack for myself it had zipper pulls jangling all over the place. I could picture myself traveling with it and repeatedly zipping and unzipping all those compartments because I couldn't remember where I put something. Not for me, but a quality product just the same.",

      "text": "I bought this backpack because I previously owned a smaller swissgear that lasted from high school to law school, that is from 2002-2016. I was searching for a backpack that could hold my 15.6 laptop and other stuff like food, purse, clothes, ipad, etc because I travel alot for school and work and always carry a lunchbox because of my special food diet. This backpack can hold alot of things and its great for school, work, travel etc. Its very secure and sturdy, a lot of compartments. Currently it has really done its job with 2 summers in university of california, 1 winter in new york studying for the bar exam, and 2 hurricanes (maria & irma).",

It sounds like a silly thing to complain about but it can be very annoying when say, the backpack is sitting next to you in a car. I would recommend this backpack if you have to wear it on you a lot because it has a lot of padding and it is very comfortable on your back.",

That's fine, though - the Alienware is too heavy to want to carry on my back anyway. This bag might last me 1",
