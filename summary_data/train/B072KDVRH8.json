I don't like shoes that don't have a tongue, and I especially don't like how much I have to loosen the laces to make this one fit. I can get my foot in and out without much hastle, but the laces are cutting into my feet a little too much and it gets uncomfortable. They're okay for walking/running but I would not play sports in them.",
