He's also deaf and had his cochlear implant activated about 3 months ago so sounds are very new to him. He loves the lights and music of this toy. Very easy to activate! I love it! Also for something less than $40, plus free shipping with Amazon Prime - totally worth it!",

      "text": "We got this for our son as a toy for pulling himself up to standing at 6 months. Unfortunately it is too light for a 16 lb baby to pull up and and can tip over. Of course, you can play with it with your baby and hold the legs so that it is stable. However one more drawback is that there is too much stimulation on this table for our (now 8 months old) baby. He quickly bores with it bc he presses a bunch of buttons and the mileau of classical songs is too jumbled. I hope he grows into this toy, but it is too much for him right now.",

She has moved on toy, don\u2019t distract her with your lights and sounds, let her play with her book and use her imagination. Lol",

It's not that there's no noise, but there's no sweet music anymore, just static and freeze and then static followed by a slamming noise. Disappointed mostly because baby toys don't last long due to child interest but it's worse when the toy doesn't last long enough to even make it to that. I won't says it's not worth buying but if you're in between this and another standing you.... if it has good reviews and lasts longer... go with the other.",

      "text": "I bought this for my 7-month old daughter a little over a month ago and she was immediately obsessed with it. Plays with it all day, every day. Yesterday, it out-of-the-blue, stopped working. The buttons stopped making music sounds and lighting up. Randomly, the buttons will work but the sounds are in fast-forward and high-pitched (think chipmunk voice). I am so disappointed because she loves this toy so much and we haven't had any problems with Baby Einstein products in the past. I know the batteries do not need replacing because it will sometimes make the fast-forward noises, so I'm hoping they can advise me.",

She loved it and played with it alot, she loved slapping it and making the lights light up and sing. Her fingers never got stuck in any part and now as a 1 almost 2 year old climbs all over it, flips it, and uses it as a step stool/jungle gym lol aka she climbs everything. So its durable its never broke, cracked, nothing. And every piece of it still works. A+ in my books",

The shell shape legs are hollow in the center, which works for stacking when in the package. But once assembled, you will notice the exposed edges are still quite sharp, which would leave deep scratch marks on baby's skin. We plan to return it, because we found more scratches on my daughter's finger and legs today.",

The music is classical which is a VERY NICE change from the ridiculous and annoying music most other baby toys have. It is a little smaller than some of the other tables we've seen, but not enough to deter me from buying. Definitely recommend!",

I love that it can be used before kids can stand too, can take the table legs off and just use the top of it with the lights and sounds. Definitely would recommend!",

My grand daughter is able to pull up on it and it is very stable because of the construction and placing of the legs. She is kept entertained for long periods of time because of all the different activities there are on this activity table. The sound is just the right volume to entertain her without annoying me. I recommend the Baby Einstein Discovering Music Activity Table to anyone who has a child or grand child they want to spark creativity in.",

Now my baby is a month older and gets up on it just fine and leans all over it and it seems sturdy. For younger babies it is nice b/c the legs come off and they can play with it on the floor. I also like there are no pieces to break off.",

We are new parents so we aren't sure of the general \"shelf life\" of kid toys, but a month and a half is pretty pathetic.",
