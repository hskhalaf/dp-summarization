As of right now it gets 5 stars. I'll update this in 3 months. Update after 90+ days. My review remains the same. Even with tons of apps downloaded, a few personal tweaks, that don't require rooting, this phone is still amazing. Love the dual cameras on the back and the AI cam is more function than gimmick in my opinion.",

Great camera, the AI feature is a little slower than the P20 Pro, but the adjustable filters are pretty neat within each AI shooting mode once it detects a scene. Battery life also seems great so far, very happy with my phone. I wanted something waterproof for vacation, and the Mil Spec durability doesn't hurt either. Included Quad Beats earbuds are pretty decent as well, and Hi-Fi Quad DAC to go wtih it. Looking forward to testing this out further over the next week!",

A downside for smaller hands and being limited to extra slim protective cases. \u2022It's a bottom firing speaker phone. No problem at all for homes with many Bluetooth speakers in different rooms & ppl with wired or quality Bluetooth earbuds on the go. Without these these cons it would be even better than the Galaxy S10 overall. I'm an experienced tech enthusiast & 100% am aware that's how good the phone is.",

If you ever make the move to an LG you will not be disappointed.",
