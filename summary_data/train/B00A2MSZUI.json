I know the D5300 is just about to be released but I don't want the extra features it offers at my level of photography. This camera is very,very good for an amateur photographer it's two steps up from a point and shooter.",

Takes excellent sharply focussed pictures using my 35mm 1.8 DX Nikon lens at present. Flash exposure very good Easily carried camera, long battery life, light weight , bright viewfinder very good clear LCD and just as was to use as my D40 which I am holding onto. Price has also dropped since I git mine by over \u00a36=50 Unusually UK has D5200 before USA !",

I also wanted to purchase the D5200 body only and select a different lens to more suit my general photography using only one lens. I finally settled on the well rated Nikon AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-105mm f/3.5-5.6G ED VR Lens. I rounded off my order with a Hoya 67mm Pro-1 Digital UV Screw in Filter. Amazon supplied my order very promptly and I am delighted with my purchase. This combination gives me a chance to get maximum use of a great lens and versatile body.",
