Overall, the ideal combination of a breathable upper, a responsive midsole, and a durable and tractive outsole was accepted by many.

Despite these issues, others still highly recommend the Reebok Forever Floatride Energy because of its quality and excellent performance.",

My right insole is ridiculously glued together from two pieces, and the glue line is a little bit more stiff than around area, so it will slightly scratch my forefoot. It is hard to notice, but it definitely causes problems after long run. Why? Why do you do this, Reebok? You make great shoes but try to save money on the insoles. That's insane.",

It is feels right in the middle, not to soft not to hard. The shoe is advertised for $100 but feels more like a shoe that costs $150. It\u2019s definitely an underrated shoe for this year. With that said, reading other reviews of this shoe it definitely runs 1/2 size bigger. I normally wear a size 13 but fit comfortably in a size 12.5. I would definitely recommend this shoe for someone that wants a good running shoe but doesn\u2019t want to spend a lot of money.",

Not a long distance runner any more. I run or walk 3-5 miles daily and this shoe has done great over last 30 days. Caught these on sale @ Amazon for $75. Note - color affects price.
