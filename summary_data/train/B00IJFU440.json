The material these are made of is too flimsy to try and force it. The snake just tries to bunch up in a zig zag pattern in the drain.",

Be prepared for a mess as you remove the Gobbler from the drain. If you have a drain cover over the shower it is difficult to insert and remove. Environmentally speaking it is better to use this when compared with a caustic drain cleaner.",

I think because there was so much stuck inside that even this couldn\u2019t reach, and that this ended up pulling out unreachable hair to clog the pipes more. We ended up calling a plumber. :( This is a good tool for maintenance though!",
