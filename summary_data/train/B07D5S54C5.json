The white buttons so far haven't began to show any signs of dirt from fingertips, but the same cannot be said for the wrist-rest! That thing was showing dirt within a week or two and seems pretty miserable to clean and probably not worth the effort. Just something to think about!",

It complements the case quite nicely and gets away from this boring black them most manufacturers seem to go for. To be honest, I haven't actually completed the new build yet as I'm still working on getting the other components but mostly it's modifying the inside and outside of the case.",

Very solid keycaps and base and is easy to take off the keycaps in case of replacement or cleaning. Personally, I really enjoyed the cherry mx speeds. A lot of people have different tastes, but if you\u2019re looking for something that\u2019s linear, clicky but not too clicky, and has a very fast activation, highly recommend Overall, very nice buy.

      "text": "Received the keyboard with great expectations. Set everything up and the damn thing is off balanced or something because it wiggles when the keyboard stands are up or down. Started as a minor inconvenience but the more I use the keyboard the more irritating it becomes. I've tried examining the keyboard to ascertain the cause of the inbalance but can find no obvious signs of why the keyboard does not remain stationary.",

The best solution I found if you went to use Keybinds is to save them on the keyboard its self then exits the software. The software needs to fix the bugs. Otherwise, the hardware is good no problem with it so far.",
