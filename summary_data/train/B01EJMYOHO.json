      "title": "Extremely comfortable - Very bassy",
      "text": "Without a doubt these Meze 99 Neo's are one of the most comfortable pair of headphones that I have ever worn, even more than my ATH-M50x's. I could wear these for an entire day without feeling fatigued or having to take them off for a break - I would have to take my ATH-50x's off after approx. 20 / 30 minutes. Sound quality are on par with the ATH-50x's. The bass is a lot more noticable, but I felt that these were somewhat muffle at first. After getting use to the sound signature, it's barely noticeable now. The Meze 99 Neo's are definitely worth the \u20ac200",

They are delivered in a smart box and the speakers, cables etc are supplied in a well made zipped container. My only complaint, if I am really picky, is that the longer cable could have been a little longer for my use but a extension cable soon fitted the bill. A good deal all round.",

      "text": "Everybody raves about the walnut cups and retro looks but if I'm honest I'm still on the fence with these looks wise. One thing that's beyond question though is how great they sound. I must confess that I'm not much of a HiFi geek. I listen to these with a half decent turntable and amplifier. I chose them because they may not be neutral sounding or accurate but they make the most of every single track I listen to. They are lively and a perfect match for vinyl",

The box etc was unblemished so they were put in like this at the factory, very bad quality control. Wouldn\u2019t expect this from a pair of \u00a330 headphones, let alone \u00a3180 ones",

Sound stage is impressive for a closed back headphone. Will continue to use my Beyerdynamic T51i's for my daily commute, but the Mezes will be used for all other occasions. Great job Meze 5*'s.",

Very unique product, I got this partly to support the work of the design team since I like the way it has been developed.",

The cheap 20 quid Sennheisers I use with my ipod blow them out of the water and my wife's now 20 year old HiFi headphones, which were in much the same cost bracket, are in a completely different league. Sadly the Meze's are just about fit for use with a metal detector. They are useless for listening to music.",
