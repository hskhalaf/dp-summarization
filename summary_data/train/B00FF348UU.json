Seems to be sturdy, but I got this one because it was \"commercial\", but i have no basis to know the difference. Also i got the same brand, sand bag holder, although I filled it with gravel. Overall very happy.",

My 5 foot tall wife was able to to help with set up. I think it would be a challenge for one person but could be done. For tie downs on asphalt use 2 2-1/2 ga water jugs on 2 opposite corners with 2 each, using the supplied take down strips. I love the canopy and am planning in getting the side walls for rainy days.
