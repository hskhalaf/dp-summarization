Also, you might want to use additional screws above what is provided to ensure good solid connections, especially if your bench will be used heavily.

I love how customizable this can be, though the primary thing I cared about was depth and length (2 ft deep, 7 ft long). I'm less thrilled with the shelf links. I think it would be just as easy (maybe easier) to just work with 2X4s rather than bother with the link system. Additionally, I would have liked having about 1.5 more depth...but this system is not customizable in that way.",

I also added a 2x4 to double the width of the front rail as this makes it far easier to secure a bar clamp to hold workpieces. The added surface area will be appreciated.",

Mine is a little off kilt but not really noticeable. I also modified mine with a cut out for my legs when sitting. All in, the project probably cost about $150. Worth it for a super sturdy forever bench.",

I didn\u2019t need 16\u201d deep shelves so we cut the shelf supports in half to make two shallow upper shelves for clay pots and baskets and one lower for plastic nursery pots that aren\u2019t as pretty to look at.
