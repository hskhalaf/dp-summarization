All my services in one place (plus a couple of new ones I'm happy to have discovered), easy to search and it's so dinky - stuck it to the top on my TV and I barely notice it's there. I've had no problems with Internet connectivity, although we do have excellent wireless and very fast speeds so I wouldn't expect any issues. I really like the accompanying iphone app as well. Quite delighted with this little gadget and will be recommending to family and friends.",

You can control it through your mobile phone as well as the very simple to use remote control. It makes navigation and finding programmes so much easier. My only request is for voice activation because I'm sure they would do that really well as well. It beats Xbox and PS4 navigation systems by at least 75% and I will never use anything else to watch or download TV or movies again. Buy it today!",

The app controls the player OK but the sound repeatedly cuts out on headphones. The Roku store has hundreds of apps. Some of the mainstream apps that you might have heard of are good. Sadly many of the apps are frankly dire. I would question how much Roku vet apps before loading them onto their store. SUMMARY: All in all a great media player.

      "text": "Genius product. For years I have been connecting my ipad to the tv via a HDMI cable to watch Amazon Prime, Netflix, Now TV, BBC iplayer, spotify and Les Mills workouts but the wire did not extend far enough so I\u2019d have to get up to change channels or move onto the next episode. The remote control works perfectly however I also like that I can control the TV from an app on my phone which is practically always closer to me. The product is small (which is a good thing) and easy to set up. Would recommend.",

Its a touch longer to set up having to use a browser, I used my phone bit once your account is setup this streaming device is excellent. Massive bonus is you can use the USB port on the TV to power it so less cables. Also it has amazon prime onboard so you can login and watch your amazon shows and the iPlayer appa for BBC, ITV etc make it a complete package. Will purchase another for bedroom",

Roku software is slick, and agnostic, unlike some of the other devices you can buy from Apple / Amazon which limit you to certain providers, more so in future as they start to promote their own streaming services. 1080P is really all you need for travel - very rare to have a 4K TV in a hotel, and wifi speeds often too slow to support anyway.",
