The Adidas Adipower 4orged S marries style and performance, and that can be translated even after a round of golf. Thanks to the technologies used on this trainer, many have found a love affair wearing it. If not for the tongue shape that runs quite long, this low-top shoe is built almost close to perfection.",

Great in the heat. Con: the top of the tongue cut into my ankle or rather irritated it the first time I wore them. Next time, I bent the tongue back to lay against my sock. It worked. Another option is to wear higher cut v low cut ankle socks.",

I loved all my other adidas spiked shoes over the years, but the rounds in this pair are the firsts where my feet didn't hurt after the round. And in dry conditions so far very little slipping and sliding compared to spiked shoes. As other reviewers mentioned, I don't quite understand why the tongue was made to protrude out so much. I took the advice from one of the reviews and just folded it under the lacing and it's a non-issue.",
