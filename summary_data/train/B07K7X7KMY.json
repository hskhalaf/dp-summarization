They are also a bit stronger than leather because of the fibers on the inside of the biothane, if you have a dog that has developed the habit of biting through leather leads in one bite (Yes, a dog can easily do this in one bite)",

If we try to keep most of the length in our hands as we walk (doling out the yardage as necessary), the leash is quite a handful to carry around.
