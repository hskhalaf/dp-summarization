I was not intending on using the photograph functions on this camera but the photo quality & functions way exceeded my expectations. My older regret is not spending a little more to by the larger lens. Very lightweight & portable which compared to my old DSLR. I wish the battery life was better but it\u2019s not a deal breaker. In response to the camera heating up. I\u2019ve only had it feel hot one time during a long video file. It did not shut off. Another recommendation is buying an external microphone.",

First annoying bit: cannot quickly switch from single shot to multiple shot - have to go into menu. Although it may be programmable into one of the free slots on a button - haven't learned that yet! If you're serious, invest in a Zeiss zoom lens for an equivalent amount to camera and you're good to go. (f4 lenses are perfect as the a6300 has a top ISO of 52,000! Shoots with f4 lens in the DARK. I tried it.)",

Not kidding, her select pictures now total more than half a million and she throws away dozens for each select pic. She is in her 70s now and the heavier cameras are a problem after hours of holding it up. The Sony A6300 is light and does everything she wants. It is a challange to set up special modes but there are web sites out there that tell you how to do it with examples. She uses the 55-210mm lens and gets great shots.",

Settled on the mirrorless and decided to go with the crowd on the A6300 along with 35mm lens. So happy I did - I probably got top 8 of 10 of my all time favorite photos and have had it for less than a month. I think that it is the combination of 35MM lens and a6300 that is producing the magic. Suggestion is to skip Kit Lens entirely. Auto mode is producing such good pictures that don't think will even bother to learn about the other options. IMO, all the gushing reviews with hyperboles are correct.",

      "text": "This camera takes great photos and is really compact. Sony has done an amazing job with this, but the biggest downside I've had is with the battery. As a shutterbug when traveling, I like to capture a lot of things, like architecture, people, tourist stuff, and random photographs. an average charge on a battery will last me a few hours, not an entire day, like you'd get with my Canon 7D dSLR that I've been equally active with. Granted they are massively different in size, but I'd hope that Sony would make a longer-lasting battery. I bought 2 additional batteries as \"insurance\" in case I'm out in the field and a battery dies out.",
