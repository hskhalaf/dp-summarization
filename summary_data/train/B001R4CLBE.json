I've always liked their lip balm - it's one of the best I've used and lasts a long, long time - so I was interested in trying other products from Pangea. I only took one star off because it's a pretty small amount for the price. I also like EO body washes, and they come in a more reasonable size.",

If they could do something about the fragrance I would try the brand again, but as of now I will finish the bottle so I feel like I get my money's worth and will not purchase again.",

Overall, I wouldn't recommend this product. I think the product was a complete waste of money and now my hunt continues.",
