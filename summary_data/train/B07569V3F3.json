      "text": "My friend and I were looking for a new tent to take camping at renfest. This tent was perfect. It fits a queen mattress with enough room on the sides for a duffel bag or backpack. The porch is cute feature and we love the convenience of the pop up design. I do recommend setting up and taking the tent down a couple times before heading heading out. It can be a little confusing at first. Overall, looking forward to several fun tent adventures.",

It rained all night on Saturday and we encountered wind as well which was blowing around 30 mph and this tent sustained it, I had no issues at all. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who are a good camping lovers and looking for a proper tent. Also, the tent had a huge amount of room, could easily fit about 4 in it. Definitely recommendable !!",

The locking elements can be hard to close down. Take the time -Work the shutdown Connections a bit by themselves to make things easier to shut back down. I see us using this for many years to come.",

I live in Louisiana where the weather changes every 30 minutes. A freak storm blew through and it just folded like a taco. Ripped along the seam by the door witch I taped but the poles themselves also broke. So it's pretty much junk. It stands crooked and wont become taunt now. And from what I can see there's no manufacturers warranty, just a return date. Purchaser beware.",

One thing I wish it did not have is the breathe mesh all the way around, as I am using this outside in the winter. But, the \"breathe\" mesh is important to those camping in spring or summer. The zippers, fasteners, elastic pulls and all accompaniments are of good quality too. This \"tent\" is so worth it!",

When zipped closed, my tent had a muffin top. There was no room for anything on the floor. See photos for proof. It also comes with cheaply made stakes that bend when put in the ground. I was frustrated with this. Although it pops up nicely, it's a pain in the neck and quite difficult to take down with arthritic hands.",

The net at the top held our large LED light perfectly so we were able to play cards after the sunset with plenty of light. Setting up the tent is pretty basic, just snap together the poles and slip it through the loops. Zippers were ok quality. I don't see them breaking anytime soon.

Also, it has 2 layers and the outer layer can be separated to use alone as a flysheet. Cannot wait to use it on my family's next camping trip. It's also good to bring to the beach as an alternative to bringing a giant umbrella. Highly recommend this tent! Totally love it!",

Cons: in the smaller side, not suitable for taller people, it would fit 2 adults or 2 adults and a smaller child, 3 adults would be a tight fit.

Beside that... super easy to put up and lots of room. Got a queen size air mattress inside right now but plan on upgrading to a king soon. Just wish i had that gear loft mesh.",
