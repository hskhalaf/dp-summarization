Cord is as long as an average wing span of my arms..so not very long but good for table seating. If you have the drill on the lowest setting and apply to much pressure the drill stops, but if you turn it higher it\u2019ll keep spinning. Also the two drill bits highlighted I thought they had more teeth on them but they seem to be smooth like the smaller diamond bit ones. But they still get the job done. DONT be intimidated by it on low, touched my skin multiple times no cuts. To good of a buy saved so much time.",

I never knew it was as bad as it is until I recieved my melodysusie nail drill (bought off amazon too) & it was so quiet & BARELY even vibrates at all! So again, its alright if you dont have 60 bucks for the melody susie (scarlet) nail drill i bought, but if you got the extra money for sure just go with the melodysusie..",

It does get hot on your nail though but I think the more often I use it the easier it will become definitely start at lowest setting and work your way up. I have smaller hands so it's not the easiest for me to hold, still a very good product though.",

I can get into every edge and corner and with the adjustable speed and ability to switch directions, it is one of the best products I\u2019ve had. My only complaint is that they need to include replacement tips for the metal ends, and maybe making the fit between the base and the filing tips tighter. Otherwise, fantastic!",
