That limited use didn't stop these things from quickly loosing the bottom sole. With in 2 months I had quarter dollar sized holes in both heels and balls of feet. The ankle securing system was good however. I really really liked the feel of the booties and appreciated the securing mechanism. I just wish the soles would have held up better.",

They protect my feet against razor clams and other beach detritus that can cut and scrape, they go on and off easily, and the soles are reinforced. However, I got them for open-water swim races, and they really slow me down because they fill with water. If you care about speed, get them undersized so they have to be stretched on like a wetsuit.",

Looking forward to using these in winter on our sculling boats. Durability: we never walked long distances in them, they're not meant for that. But walking across hot sand and rock?

Might order a lighter color for Summer. I'd suggest you NEVER wear them on asphalt, or outside of the sand pit. Unless you'd like them to fall apart faster.",

These fin socks are perfect as beach footies usually worn on rough sand or small rock patches at the beach. My wife and I decided to get these along with new, open back (strapped) fins to replace our full-foot, slip on fins. Theses smart socks are great and wearing them with fins (straps correctly adjusted) we can do beach entries much more easily and the socks do not let the fin slip off. Highly recommend these as a great value and a product that works as advertised. Run TRUE TO SIZE as well.",

They are so good that your feet don't even get wet unless you open up the side of them. It definitely helps with keeping your body warmer with your feet feeling super warm. Will definitely be a loyal customer to these. Very well made and I'm not seeing much wear!",

He said they were comfortable, they stayed on and they held up beautifully to the wear and tear of the 5 games he played. Looked just a good as when they came out of the package.",

    "rating": 4.4,
    "feature_bullets": [
      "Different to other Water Fin Socks - BPS\u2019s \u2018Storm Socks\u2019 are cleverly designed to always feel like they will stay on, and let much less water in around the ankle. A unisex fit with a MORE DURABLE (but still FLEXIBLE) sole helps everyone enjoy their sports like sand volleyball and beach soccer. Please check the size chart to ensure a great fit.",
      "How do they do it? An extra adjustable elastic strap around the ankle ensures an excellent fit and minimises any water getting in; a flexible but tougher than standard sole with a rubber grip pattern handles slippery environments, and a tab at the top rear of the sock makes getting them on and off easier than other socks.",
      "The fully flexible soles provide an amazing \u2018foot feel\u2019 on the beach, surfing or on a SUP. You genuinely forget you are wearing them. But for this to happen the sole is not rigid enough to handle walking on asphalt or concrete for very long; so to keep your socks feeling comfortable, put them on once at the beach or river or boat. Also, you will receive e-guide providing some helpful tips on getting the most out of your Neoprene Fin Socks. Make sure you DON'T OPT-OUT so you won't miss this",
