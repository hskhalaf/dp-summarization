      "text": "I received this waffle maker today and made waffles for supper. Finally I have a wonderful traditional waffle maker! The waffles turned out great, just like the ones I grew up with. My old traditional waffle maker died after about 30 years. I had no idea it would be so hard to find a replacement. I bought the Chef's Choice Waffle Pro based on Cooks Illustrated/America's Test Kitchen review, but they should have said it makes really thin waffles. If you like really, really thin waffles that is the one to buy. If you want traditional waffles, not Belgium buy the Breville. The machine is very well made. I am very happy with my purchase.",

A thinner batter will overflow the sides. To clean, merely pass a wet cloth over the still hot plates and moat. For a golden brown waffle, I turn the dial up. This machine takes roughly a half cup of batter per waffle.",

      "text": "After a few weeks, we are loving our new waffle maker from Breville. It heats up quickly and efficiently; there is no need for any \"spray on\" coating, as the coating Breville has used really works well. It does NOT make thicker, Belgian-style waffles; but it is not supposed so to do. We love making the waffles ahead of time, freezing them and then popping them into the toaster for a quick dinner. Storage is wonderful with the \"lock and stand\" feature. The only draw-back, of course, is that it only makes one four-section waffle at a time; but since there are only two of us, it is not really an issue.",

I did a bunch of research and this one was liked in the comparisons I looked through. Since we have had it, we have found it to work well.

The key idea we have learned for this waffle maker is to make sure the batter is the right consistency - too thick and it's hard to cook all the way through.",

Once you get the temperature dialed in, which really only takes one or two test waffles, you'll never have to check a waffle while it's being made again. It beeps when it's preheated, and again when your waffle is done. Pretty simple. Cleanup is super easy too. The nonstick surface just takes a quick wipe and you're good to put it away. This is my third Breville appliance, and I'll keep buying them. They last several years at least. If you've never worked with their customer service before, it's on point.",

I made the recipe in the instruction manual that came with the machine. The top is darker but has super light spots but the bottom is not cooked enough IMO. I like my waffles on the darker side therefore I set the darkness at 6 which is one up from max. Made probably 8 waffles and they were all the same. Defiantly not as nice or consistent as my old Waring Pro waffle iron I had before this. On the bright side I\u2019ll be eating less carbs.",

The browning setting works very well. The overflow spill area for no mess is just that, no mess at all. This makes an adequately thick waffle, not belgium thick. The unit gets super hot, and therefore the waffle cooks extremely fast, allowing us to make waffles for the whole family very quickly. We decided to spend about $30 more for a Breville, and it definitely worth it",

That's a good thing. You can tell the plates are sturdy and rugged, able to take heat after heat. I'm making everything into waffles now.
