While they did help me lift heavier, I couldn't even wrap my hands around the bar because the grips stick out too far. The hooks were the only thing holding the weight. I ended up finally getting the versapro grips. I recommend those wayyyyy over these. Those allow you to wrap your hands around the bar and continue to strengthen your grip while still lifting much heavier.",

I got these to assistance work with hanging exercises where my grip would give out before I was done with a set. The design of the two hooks make it impossible for me to hold onto the pullup bar in any way that would let me attempt to support myself as much as I could. Waste of money. Sticking with my old pair of fabric straps.",
