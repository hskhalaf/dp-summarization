It did not wash out of my hair at all, once my hair would dry there would be awful greasy waxy build up on my hair. I couldn\u2019t run my fingers through my hair without them needing to be washed after cause they were so oily. My hair wouldn\u2019t even last a day without looking like it needed washed and normally hair lasts about 4 days. If I could return this product and get a refund I would be happy but unfortunately it\u2019s past the window. Save your money, it doesn\u2019t thicken or give volume, just weighs it down with grease.",
