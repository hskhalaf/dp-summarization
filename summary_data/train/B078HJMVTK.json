All of the cords were included as well so I didnt have to order anything else. -Tested the system with the original Jurassic Park movie - simply amazing! -Night mode is great and doesn't wake up my wife or the kids when I am watching TV late. -I can raise or lower the volume by voice. Need to learn more commands. -It is an Amazon Alexa on steroids. -Amazing sound. Awesome value. I will be buying another for my living room.",

Everyday it gets worse. This will be going back soon if this problem continues. They only way to get it to connect is to unplug and then plug back in. That should not be how it works.",

It started updating itself twice while I was in the middle of a show which required quite a long pause before sound was available. It froze twice and had to be unplugged and powered back on. All I wanted was a soundbar, not an interactive app driven device.",

      "text": "Very pleased with the clear sound! Our old LG soundbar was on its last leg and chopping out. We tied this in on a group with a few echos and have music throughout the whole house and patio now. We could instantly tell a difference with smoother vocals, bass and sound effects. Sounds 360! It was easy to setup to control the volume with our own TV remote and also an Apple TV remote. Plus it\u2019s cool I can mute never ending commercials of sporting events without even having the remote nearby. Alexa, mute! Unmute! Highly recommend.",

I cant get ahold of polk support as they are only open 10 to 6 and haven't emailed me back yet... been weeks since I sent email.
