[UPDATE 4/12/19] I notified Jabra about my issue over one month ago, completed their Warranty Information on their web site for incident CS00403762. I have since emailed them twice and no response. My conclusion is that Jabra doesn't give one iota about standing by their product. Vendors like this deserve to go out of business. I will *Never* buy from Jabra again.",

I think they lowered max volume so people wouldn't harm their hearing [like we aren't responsible enough to do that on our own!] This ear piece sits over the ear not in it. As a result I can hear extremely well! Nobody can tell I'm speaking on it in a call. Calls are very clear and I have had no complaints from callers either. Its very classy looking and very light, which I have had to get used to. Hard to remember you have it on! Absolutely LOVE this headset!",

The voice commands won't work, or I can't get it to connect at all. It's way to dangerous to ever try to use it in a car again. I am very disappointed with Jabra, I always heard they were the best.

If you try to pair this device on an iPhone, iOS-7 most-definitely works better than iOS-6, which is notoriously sketchy and received lots of \"thumbs down\" from Bluetooth users!!!)",

The button on the mic arm does take a bit of getting use to, I tend to use the larger side button.

      "text": "Works great but having issues with it turning on and off reliably when it it supposed to. I like the software interface that goes on the phone to control the settings and give status of connection and battery life. It is a little big when folded up. Great price in Amazon, especially with the incentive when applying for an Amazon Visa. Would have really liked to have an extended warranty but did not see one offered.",
