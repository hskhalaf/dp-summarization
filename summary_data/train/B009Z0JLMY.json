If your intent is that of a similar nature you'll want a size or two bigger than your daily wear to fit over a sweatshirt/other clothes. (i.e. I wear mostly large clothes and bought the XL). The buyer beware piece is that the XL pants are HUGE. I would never wear them even though the jacket fits perfectly. If you are large and in charge, and want this suit for your weight loss journey look no further - this sweat suit will do the trick. Good luck and be safe.",

They made it through a full Zumba class at least and brought a lot more sweat.",
