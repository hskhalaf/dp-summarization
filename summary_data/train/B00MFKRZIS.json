It was easy to mount on wall but i recommend using different anchors than what comes with the rack. I used self drilling drywall anchors by snapskru, #6 x 1-1/4 and it was a total breeze with power screw driver. I love the looks of this as convenient towel rack hung on wall just next to shower and appreciate the storage capacity. And placing colorful towels in it adds a pop of happiness to an otherwise small, dark and Windowless bathroom.",

Several of the racks were not even with each other. I had to bend 4 of them to get them to line up correctly. Other than that, highly recommended for the price.",

Edges and finish are smooth (no corners or burrs), and the color is a nice, rich bronze. Mounts easily (4 screws provided). The metal gives slightly; so far this is not a problem (and is, in fact, helpful when hanging larger wraps), though I am somewhat nervous that it could cause damage in the future (broken bracket, damage to finish, etc.); I will amend this review if that happens.",

      "text": "Honestly the photos don't give these towel racks justice - they are well welded, massive enough to take bath sheets in the larger hooks and bath towels in the smaller ones. The mounting hardware is top notch - everything from the anchors to the screws themselves; very, very sturdy, solid gear. Make sure to check your measurements first, it's my only word of caution but it's not enough to drop a star because they are very much worth the money!!",
