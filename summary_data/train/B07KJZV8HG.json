      "text": "$10 for 100 sheets is kind of a lot but the good news is you only need one a day to really be effective. I am oily whether I wear makeup or not and the best thing about these sheets is that the makeup remains mostly undisturbed. I barely lay the sheet on top of my skin and come away with more oil than I think is there. I'd post a pic but I think everyone gets the point of blotting sheets. I subtracted one star because there are similar sheets available for less but I'm a fan of Boscia skin care products so it's an expected cost.",

I used 6 or 7 of them to eliminate oil on every greasy square inch of my face and it worked! Not only did my face look oil-free, it felt oil-free to the touch! So, wow!

These are actual linen, which is so much softer and feels much more like quality. The package is also well made. Nothing feels cheap, the box is sturdy (not thin, cheap paper) and the actual linens are thick, nicely sized, and leave skin oil/shine free without any residue left behind. I highly recommend these!",
