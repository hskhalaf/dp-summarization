Low and behold it really doesn't matter what you choose in the first box because you still need to filter through all the kid, little kid, and then toddler sizes. Honestly it's my fault. I will say though that when I received them and looked in the box they were pretty cute. I obviously sent them back but I'd probably recommend them based on looks alone.",

I think they will hold up well enough with my hard-on-shoes 10 year old son. And they feel pretty grippy which is something I specifucally look for when shoe shopping for my littles! Bonus? My 10 year old thinks the shoes are pretty rad.",
