Also, one side of the zipper pins is plastic while the other side is metal. The plastic pin is bent and breaking, both sides of the zipper pin should have been metal. Luckily I was able to take the remaining slider and make it work. The only reason I did not give this a 1 is that the sleeping bag itself is good, packs well and so far (after 2 uses) lives up to its specs.",

I found my legs sweating at times.Mummy bags are inherently narrow, and this one is no different. As an active sleeper I found it restricting. The trade off is the saved weight, and space it takes up in your pack. I am 5''11'' 190 lbs. I ordered the long because it happened to be the cheapest price out of the three sizes carried by Amazon, and not a third party. I'm glad I did this because I found the overall length just about perfect for me.",

Minor inconveniences. I was comfortable in nighttime temps down to almost freezing (and using a decent full length air mattress), with just underwear on. Would highly recommend.",
