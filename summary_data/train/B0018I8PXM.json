I have a Pure Komachi chef's knife, paring knife and smaller cutting board for when we travel and use rental condos. My wife always has the paring knife with her for prepping the kids lunch when they are out. I like the handle on this Zyliss much better. The Komachi is slippery plastic, while this is more rubbery. I mostly use it to peel and slice fruit for lunch at work, or when I'm out with the kids on the weekend.",

I have a nice Calphalon knife set but the steak knives didn't cut through any of the steaks I got with ease. So I bought a cheap picnic set of paring knives but I didn't like the short handles. So I found this one and unfortunately I only bought one so it gets passed around my family during meals. So I'm in the process of finding more. 1 for each of us. Best paring knife I've ever come across. Thank you!",
