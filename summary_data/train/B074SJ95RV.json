I'm looking for an elegant, stylish bag, and also can fit my laptop. When I saw this, immediately purchase it. I really like the bright color and graceful design. So many compartments for both sides can allow me to carry out not only a lot of accessories and laptop, but also easily grab my pens, key, cosmetics, and recycled bags -- all the pockets I've filled! Also, my laptop also fits and protected. My roommates said I look more professional!",

I have a older laptop which fills the bag to capacity so not ideal for traveling anymore. If you have a slender laptop and do not need to much room this bag is great.",
