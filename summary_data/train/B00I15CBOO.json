The arm rest pads are connected with Velcro rather than buttons (babies r us version). So they are constantly slipping and falling off- very frustraging. Additionally, the ottoman is different. Doesn't have the tilted foot pad as the one at babies RUs, and is also extremely light weight, so if your foot weight is not evenly distributed, it tips over. Also super frustrating and potentially dangerous!",

Whenever i travel anywhere overnight with my daughter, i find myself missing our glider more than words can say. I highly recommend this purchase- I used it almost constantly when i was nursing (with a pillow under my little one), and still use it for naps and bedtime. It is amazingly comfortable (I have fallen asleep here many times), and so easy to rock. Hubby and I are looking forward to moving it to our tv room when the nursery is no longer a \"nursery.\"",
