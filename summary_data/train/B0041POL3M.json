Will be buying directly from the Bare Minerals store this weekend to assure I get a genuine product. Very disappointing to see people being fooled.

This makeup is light, non greasy and can be touched up at the end of the day if I am going out and want a little more coverage. This is definitely going to be a part of my beauty protocol forever.",
