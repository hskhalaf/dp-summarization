Does't come with a cooler so you will need to purchase this separately. Please take a second to hit the helpful button it makes taking the time to write the review worthwhile x.",

I would recommend it - idle temps are 30C and under load it gets to 60C (H100i V2 cooler) Only issue I have noticed is the temperatures tend to fluctuate quite a lot. For example when I am idle I will sometimes see the temp jump to 45-50C for a second then go back down without seeing the CPU usage increase accordingly. I have done some research and apparently it is nothing to worry about - a lot of users are experiencing the same spikes and intel don't deem it as an issue.",

With a careful delivery of this product and a longer return policy this would be a 5 star review. P.s the damage is fron the cpu falling from it's plastic holding.

      "text": "Upgraded from a 3770k, minimal performance increase, runs quite hot (30c idle to 75c full load when watercooled with a H80i @ 4.5GHz). It's a flagship processor but unless you specifically need hyperthreading then don't bother and get an i5 instead. Gamers seem to buy these and I'm not sure why as HT won't improve your fps. I do some video editing, gaming, programming etc so although HT makes a difference, I can't really justify the extra cost.",
