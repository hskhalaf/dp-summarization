This phone has not dropped one call since I activated it. Everytime I DT with someone it works. This phone gets a signal where T-Mobile, Sprint and all others fail. The buttons for texting and replying to emails are easy to handle. If you are looking for a \"phone\" this is the one to get. I would give this 10 starts if it were allowed. Another plus is it handles mp3's & GIF images which I upload from my own PC to the phone.",

It's a phone people, nothing more, nothing less. I use the walkie-talkie regularly, my wife and I text back and forth daily with no missed or missing messages. This phone receives/makes calls and walkie-talkie's where others have failed. If people want games buy a Gameboy, want pictures buy a camera, not real hard to figure out. This little gem was built to be a phone and that's exactly what it is. In short.... See it as it really is, a phone.",

I have only had to phone for two months. Its the worst phone ive owned, do not buy this. The i776 is a good phone,but you have to buy the rugged version.",
