They have staying power. The feel: You're running with unlimited breath and endurance across the prairies of Wyoming when you come across a brown bear with her cubs; you stop to observe the beauty, but your presence isn't appreciated! Suddenly, you're being stormed! What do you do? Naturally you run for the hills knowing that you'll fly like a kite because you made the right shoe decision a few days earlier in Topeka before you left. You smart son of bitch.... Bears are scary, and the Kineta Relay saves lives...",

But these olive/brown canvas ones here are junk. Because I wear about 15 different shoes, I only wore these 15 times max. They now have holes that have simply worn through and lots of stitching coming apart. They technically are still in one piece, but they would be very embarrassing to wear in public. On top of that, the soles are completely worn down (not through) but completely slick making these super dangerous on a wet sidewalk....like on an ice rink. Don't buy,",

I've only had them for a week but the sock fit is perfect (not too tight yet the heel doesn't slip and your foot can still breath). As always with Saucony, they run small so order at least a 1/2 up if you're new to the brand. Also, I wouldn't get these shoes for any kind of distance running and certainly not cross training but perfect for every day, walking, or running shorter distances. Highly recommend!",
