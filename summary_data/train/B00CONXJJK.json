Doors slide from the corners and lock in place with magnets. When you exit shower you can keep doors open for added elbow room in the bathroom. takes a little time to level doors for proper mating and alignment. Glass is good quality. there is some coating on it that I guess is for water spots. I will update any long term issues in the future. Would give 5 stars if the glass was thicker!",

When the doors close, it will either be slightly open at the top seal or at the bottom. I adjusted it so the top is slightly open since no water should get up there and leak out. Other than that, it looks AWESOME in my new bathroom.",

We have a very small master bathroom that was not functional. The previous shower stall was too small and couldn't open all of the way due to the door hitting the toilet. We couldn't add any square footage to the room so we bought these shower doors and installed them over a custom tiled base. These doors have finally allowed our bathroom to be functional. Highly recommend this product in small bathrooms where you don't have room for door swing clearance.",
