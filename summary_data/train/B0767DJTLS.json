I struggled with finding a bag that would be large enough to fit my pump, all of the parts, and what I needed for work but this bag seems to meet the mark. It is very spacious and seems like it will work very well! The insulated pockets are large enough to fit a small cooler and my Spectra pump.",

However, it is very durable, very sleek, and almost no one knows this is a pump supply bag! I\u2019d definitely recommend.",

As other reviewers have stated, this bag is huge! At first I thought it was too big but it is just the right size to store enough parts for three pumping sessions as well as my bottle storage/cooler bag. My spectra pump fits nicely in the outer lower insulated pocket (note one side is larger than the other and fits the pump nicely). The only thing I'm not in love with is the print. Otherwise this is a great bag!",
