It takes a lot of work and babysitting to keep the flame going, and in colder weather I could not get the battery to charge. I had a blazing fire going for over an hour and the meter just stayed where it was -- low to no charge. Then you can get into these weird scenarios in which the flames die down, and you are trying to get it going, but the fan turns off. Just very busy and fickle. I'm going back to the tried and true gas stoves.",

Size is manageable when transporting; weight isn't too bad, especially considering you don't have to lug fuel around everywhere you go. Keep in mind, it is a little top-heavy, so be sure you're on a level surface. Also, don't be in a rush to charge your device as it takes a little while to charge things up.",

      "text": "Fire wasn't even enough to recharge the fan battery, much less charge a light or device. The battery comes with a small charge for you to be able to start a fire immediately, but the battery died about 15 minutes into use. Unfortunately once the battery dies it's impossible to use the stove. Extremely disappointed. Will be returning immediately. I bought this stove for emergency situations and it has clearly failed. Thankfully I was just testing in my backyard and there wasn't any emergency at all.",
