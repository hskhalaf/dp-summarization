The belt is comfy and doesnt bother your lowerback or sides once you load up the extra weight the rope to attach the weights looks like it can hold a couple hundred pounds havent tested that much weight on it yet just a plate. This belt looks like it will last me some time by looking at the quality",

Maybe about 6 inches longer. If you have a 34-36 inch waist, then the length of the strap is fine. But I have a 38-40 inch waist and there was barely enough strap to go through the buckle and get the belt closed properly. Some of us that like to lift do not have a small waist. Beyond that, this is a very nice belt.",

Very comfortable once I was able to get it on (barely) and the way it's constructed keeps the weight from crushing my thighs like my old chain belt did.

The loop belt is very sturdy and stays in place, I really like that they have the middle buckle sliding to allow for easy adjustments when you tug to either loosen or tighten the belt. Stays in place and holds weight without any adjustments needed mid-lift. Really happy with this purchase, this seems like a way more expensive belt than what I paid for it.",

This belt has been in my gym bag while i nursed an injury so ive not used it in a couple months. That said, the belt has never left my bag and through travels, this slide bar, which hugs the waist strap in place just...fell.off? Im not going through earthquakes or hurricanes over here, so how does it fall off?",

There is ample padding that when you tighten down the belt it doesn't slip in the least. They sewed rubber into the straps as well which helps keep the weights from slipping around as you move. The leather is there mainly for comfort, the weight is spread out functionally across nylon webbing, which gives it great strength. A lot of though went into improving the dip belt that resulted in this product. This is top notch!",

I am pretty sure I will reach the limit of what I can handle before the belt does. I only gave 4 stars on sturdiness, because I haven't used or owned the belt very long so I can't judge how long it will last. The construction does look like good quality.",

Due to design of this belt, I don\u2019t foresee that being a problem. The inside is padded which is nice for heavy weights. The belt does hang a little lower than I\u2019d like but I solved that problem by running it back across my waist and attaching both ends to the same ring. That becomes a little inconvenient if you want to take the weight off between sets. All-in-all though, a very nice and comfortable belt even when loaded with a lot of weight.",
