      "text": "This bingo cage is larger than I expected but it seems well constructed... I do believe it will last for years. However the plastic B I N G O board where you place the balls after they are called, is not as durable and will be easily broken. After reading some other reviews that the balls would shoot past the rails, I would like to add that's not been my experience with this cage... the balls stay on the track fine. It is expensive for what it is but it is exactly what I was looking for.",

It is possible to spin and throw a ball out missing the chute but it simply drops down under the cage and you pick it up. Not a lot of things in this world perfect, so we were just fine with it. Maybe happened 1 every 100 balls and probably was the operator spinning to fast or slow.",
