It's very well constructed, seals completely with zero drips while shaking vigorously, and the little spout and the top stays put with a solid seal but is easily opened with one finger when you're ready to pour. Love the measurements along the side too - just makes it all so much easier! Definitely glad we bought this!",

      "text": "We just started using this and will probably by another 2. It has an O-ring to seal the top spout. If using a creamy or a dressing with gritty spices in it, it will stop the O-ring sealing properly. You can press the handle a bite tighter to the opening and wash out the spout or remove the top and rinse it out. We often need to do the same thing to our other salad dressing carafes. The nice thing about these is they don't drip all over the place. I like to drawn my salad. We are looking at other uses. I have added it to my shopping list for later.",

My only quibble, and it is a very minor one, is that some dressing accumulates above the stopper making the shaker requiring clean up to keep the shaker looking good. That said this salad dressing shaker is terrific. We make our own dressings and can keep a batch fresh and tasty over many nights.",

Some salad dressing shakers actually have a top that can be removed, the problem here though is that you wind up with oil somewhere other than your lettuce! This salad shaker prevents that unfortunate scenario and also keeps your thumbs from coming into contact with unnecessary oil. All said, it's a simply designed product and a great tool for anyone who is no longer punishing themselves with store bought salad dressing.",
