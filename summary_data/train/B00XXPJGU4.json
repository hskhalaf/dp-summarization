It took a hammer and drill to finally get it together because I am disabled and no way I could carry this to return it plus I really need it!!! Nothing matches.

The pieces don\u2019t snap together very solidly, so they slide a little and then the slip cover doesn\u2019t attach, it just slips over and zips around it, so it\u2019s loose and not very taunt against the steps.

      "text": "My three Cairn Terrier's are really happy. Very sturdy stairs, and easy to assemble. Perfect height for our new bed as they do not have to jump up any higher than the stairs. No problems with being scared going down the stairs which I thought was going to be an issue/deal breaker. The steps are nice and wide, so they have no trouble. They can now visit with us without me worrying about them hurting themselves jumping off a 30\" high bed. I am extremely happy.",
