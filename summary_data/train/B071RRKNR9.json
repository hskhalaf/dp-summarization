It is surprisingly spacious, I have done several 3 week trips with just this suitcase and a bookbag. It fits perfectly in the overhead compartment, never any trouble from TSA. The charging port on the outside is pretty slick and useful. Overall, this is a great piece of luggage and was a great purchase.",

Also, not sure about the black but the titanium was not that great.",

The other side has a less than elastic strap that won't hold much of anything with any weight in place. Overall it's the best luggage I've had. As for value per dollar it seems about 1/3 more expensive than than it ought to be.",

It may actually qualify as \"oversized.\" But with all that interior volume, you could pack for multiple people and only check the one bag. Rolls very easily too. Also has a TSA approved lock that allows your bag to remain secure and still be inspected, and if you register the combination you can easily recover it. Also, the bag has a bag tracker that allows it to be recovered and returned to you. All these features don't come cheap; the suitcase is $600, but it appears that it will last for a fair amount of time.",

I have had the occasional breakage in the contents of my soft-sided rolling suitcase; it appears that this hard-sided case will provide better protection.",

The handle for transporting this luggage is as smooth as the wheels and the shiny color is impeccable. ***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",

One half of the case is zippered off, handy for keeping dirty clothing or toiletries separate. If you travel frequently, such a versatile, strong suitcase would be worth the money. It's small, and will slip into the overhead with room to spare.",

The charging extension is a nice feature; I have a battery that I can put inside the bag, and so it becomes very convenient to charge your phone off of the jack on the outside of the bag. Without question, the highlight is the double-four wheel system though. It rolls really, really well. Either direction. Long-wise or flat-wise. And straight-up. This is just so helpful when traveling and finding yourself in tight, cramped quarters--which seems to happen all the time.",
