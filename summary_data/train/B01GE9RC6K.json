My iPhone gets the signal from this unit to almost the furthest location away from the unit while I am mowing. The unit sits on a table near a window on the opposite side of the house at the above location. We do have to reboot the unit once in a while. I'm not sure if it is an issue with the unit or the cable company. The internet comes right on after the reboot. This doesn't happen enough to cause any issue.",
