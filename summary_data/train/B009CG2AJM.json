I have not had a pair of Aviators since my late 80's high school days. I was just tired of wearing cheap sunglasses and went back to the classic--except that now there are a lot more choices of lens and frame combinations that actually make Aviators unique AND high quality. They fit like a glove and feel like an old pair of jeans. Perfect. The difference in quality of sight through these as compared to my cheapies is amazing. Purchase from Amazon and you will not be disappointed!",

Oh and the lenses are very scratch resistant. Would I buy them again? Yes! I'm on my second pair. Also I think under $100 for a pair is a great price!",

Side note: I originally got size 55mm & like everyone says they are way to small, so unless you are a kid or have a super small face I would recommend the 58mm in size because they are the perfect fit!!!",
