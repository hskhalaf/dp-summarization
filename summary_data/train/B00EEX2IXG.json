      "text": "We purchased the CS-023 model sink, which is oval-shaped and low profile. The sink has a nice smooth finish and sits well attop a vanity that has a small drain pipe opening through a slab. Standard pop-up type chrome drain works just fine - no leaks. It is odd that other models of this sink appear when clicking the link for a CS-023 sink. This may be a discontinued item. The beauty of this sink is the shallow depth, which allows installation on a \"floating\" or wall-attached cabinet while retaining standard fixture heights. We used wall-mounted fixtures in a small bathroom with good results. If there are issues within the next two years, I'll adjust the review accordingly.",
