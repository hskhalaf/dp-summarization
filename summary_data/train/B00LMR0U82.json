However, the wrist wrap is lacking for me. It does not conform well to my wrist and the plastic piece on the strap tends to hurt the bone on the lateral aspect of my wrist while working out. There is no wrist support as the strap is much too thin. All in all I will keep using these for a while and try to break them in and see if they get any better.",

But for basic weightlifting and pullups, they do seem to help although the finger holes took a while to \"shape\" to my fingers. I don't have large fingers, so that's something to keep in mind. They add a little support in a restrictive-sense to keep the hands somewhat rigid so as not to strain the wrists, which I find helpful. The wrist straps are hard to get right, but if you had a buddy help then that would solve that problem.",

It takes a second to take on and off vs gloves. There was chafing of the leather on my clothes occasionally, I'm expecting that to stop with use, otherwise I'd look for a died darker cooler in the future, since I normally wear dark clothes when working out.",

Only thing that's uncomfortable is the wrist wrap portion of the WODFitters when doing KB cleans and snatches- because the bell rests on the back portion of the forearm and the wrist wrap cuts off a bit of circulation, there's slight discomfort. But when that happens i just unwrap the wrist wrap and just keep the WODFitter on. Would purchase again!",

Best of all they really save your callus area during exercises like toes to bar, pull-ups, kettlebell swings etc. They allow me to do far more reps on these type exercises with far less aggravation (blisters, bleeding, tears) than before. I looked at similar grips that were both more and less money - I'm very happy with my purchase.",
