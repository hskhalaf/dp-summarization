A pea-sized amount, lathered with wet hands, foams up and covers the whole face and neck, and rinses off clean, with no tightness. Doesn't dry me out at all, and it's a perfect follow-up to an oil cleanser. One star removed for a nitpicking reason: there are tiny bits of mica added to make the soap look shiny/sparkly, and not only does it seem totally unnecessary, it sometimes gets stuck to your hands, and I would assume the facial skin. I've noticed no irritation from it, but it is an additive purely for cosmetic reasons.",

There was one major issue for me personally, thus the 4 instead of 5 star rating. I had been trying to place the smell after using is a few days. It dawned on me today that it definitely, and very unfortunately, smells like baby spit up. It isn't a harshly offensive odor, but it makes me pause applying it to my face...",

You also only need to use a small amount for face and neck. I also use their night cream and day cream. My slight wrinkles have disappeared and I am 57.
