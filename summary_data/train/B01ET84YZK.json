When you unroll it to put on bed have another person with you. It immediately fluffs up to the full size very quickly. There is a foam smell that leaves quickly if you ventilate the room. It\u2019s a firm mattress that conforms to your body in just the right spots. When you sit on the side of the bed you don\u2019t slide off, which I\u2019ve read that other mattresses do. So far I\u2019m not disappointed at all. Normally I wake up hurting and I didn\u2019t after one night on this mattress!",
