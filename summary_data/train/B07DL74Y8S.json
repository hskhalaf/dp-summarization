      "text": "This is my very first Alexa-WIFI power adapter. I decided on the 3 port plug and 4 port USB charger so I could set it next to the couch, charge stuff but also turn on/off the light. Setup was very easy... this is not like setting up a Google Chromecast where you have to connect to a separate WIFI network then switch back. You basically hold your phone close to the adapter to set it up. Then, follow the directions to enable Alexa.",
