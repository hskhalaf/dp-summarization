Didn't think I would use the burger makers much because I'm used to just using my hands, but have found the burger molds actually made the process much easier and everything looked way more uniform and professional. Plus, with kids, the molds help them make nice round patties each time. Highly recommend if you grill or make a lot of burgers.",
