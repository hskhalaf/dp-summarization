I have trouble with other sports bras straps digging into my shoulders but with the adjustable straps this doesn't do that. The color is a very deep blue and is slightly darker than the picture shown. The cups are moulded nicely for the breast, however the padded cups can get distorted and need to be flattened out after washes.",

I plan on ordering a few more because I do Yoga several days a week and basically live in these bras because I'm a full time student. I am a 36DD and I buy an Large which stretches perfectly for a cozy fit.",
