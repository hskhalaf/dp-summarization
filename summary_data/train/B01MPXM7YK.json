If you can't tolerate the taste, I would suggest mixing it in a smoothie -or put it in your double shot of whiskey to stop your whining and complaining.",

What was that cloyingly sweet flavor that was hiding the taste of my berries and bananas? After careful inspection, I finally found the culprit. Listed under \"other ingredients\" there are two items that stem from 'organic stevia leaf extract'. I guess because it's not 'artificial' then the company is within their rights to claim it wasn't an 'artificial sweetener'. I still feel like I've been cheated, though.

Plus, I prefer adjusting my sweetness to much less than most people require. Maybe the company could offer a non sweetened one as other brands do. You can\u2019t beat the price, for sure!",

What a rip off. I wouldn't mind posting a picture but that option isn't include on the review.",
