The only thing I have a small complaint about are the edges which are very sharp. Just be careful when handling. Otherwise, perfect little grill! As soon as it arrived, we BBQ'd immediately!",

      "text": "I purchased this in May. We love camping and travel by motorcycle with a small trailer behind us for all our gear. It is a great little grill. Perfect for the two of us. Folds down to a very small size. Easy to clean and uses very little charcoal. We just wish it had one more rack in the bottom to lay the charcoal on. It does need a little more air to circulate underneath the charcoal for quicker lighting. We just use the little Weber \"pills\" to get the charcoal going. Foil lining the bottom of the grill helps greatly with clean up, just be sure not to cover the holes on the sides.",

But be careful, many of the edges are extremely sharp. I used a file to round them off to be safe. I've not used the grill yet but I'm anxious to try it.",

      "text": "This is Exactly what I wanted. Small enough to qualify as being portable and still big enough to cook a Whole 4 pound chicken, Or, a Whole Tri-Tip Roast. And, this is a charcoal grill....\"real BBQ ing\" ! Take the \"base\" and use it for a cover. Make a small \"wind cover\" like the one that is included, and you can completely \"Shut down\" after your food is done. Then, you can most likely \"re-use\" the remaining charcoal brickettes. It took approx. 15 pieces of charcoal to cook a 4 pound chicken, and there's enough remaining to cook 4 burgers or hot dogs. This is a little expensive but still well worth the cost.",

      "text": "I own the tiny Esbit pocket stove and like it for camping and emergency scenarios. This grill is essentially the same concept, but obviously much bigger. I like that concept, but the grill should be made of thicker metal sheets. Yeah, I get that doing so would add to the weight, but at least it won't always feel like it will cut my fingers. Also, be careful when opening/closing the grill. This is probably the most portable grill that I have come across. It won't be my main grill, and I doubt it was designed to be anyone's main grill.",

It's stainless so no corrosion to deal with. Does steaks with aplomb. Chicken thighs and or wings are no sweat. If you can locate this here on Amazon get it . These things come in 2 versions this is the larger of the two and are very hard to find. Buy it if you find it. Can't go wrong you'll enjoy it for years of beachgoing or hiking. or just a easy impromptu grill craving fix.",
