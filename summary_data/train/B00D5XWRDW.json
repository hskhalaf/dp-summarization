I can pick it up like that because I used the special plastic super glue to secure the base on. I would think they would have made it a twist on base or something. Otherwise it looks great and dispenses jelly beans, skittles, and fruit runts just fine.",

I tried another, slightly larger candy in it in place of one of the other ones (I forget what they were), and they tended to bind it up. One of my coworkers, trying to unbind it, turned it sideways and shook it...don't do that. The only real flaw for this is that the lid does not seal off each section, so the candies all got mixed together. Minor flaw. I paid $13 for mine, and especially for that price, this thing is awesome!",
