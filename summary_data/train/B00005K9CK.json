I am extremely acne prone and this product does not irritate my skin.",

It goes on easy and quickly works its way into the skin without the greasy residue. You can apply and go out without the shiny look. It also does not get that sheen on the face when you sweat. The more expensive creams can definitely take a lesson from Neutrogena with this product. It is on my standard list of repurchases from Amazon.",
