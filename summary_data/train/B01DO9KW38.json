It is great for travel and the battery is really good. THAT BEING SAID... I have two of these with blown out drivers that rattle when reproducing bass frequencies at volume above 40-50%. That makes them useless to me now... This is really ridiculous and not B&O quality standards of their premium equipment. I can't tell you not to buy this, the sound is the best in class, but treat it carefully and hope that if it does go bad, that it is within the warranty period. Good luck.",

      "text": "Owned this for just over a year but am just trading in back to Amazon. It is, hands down, the best sounding Bluetooth speaker for its size - each time I use it people are amazed at the quality and the size of it for the sound it produces. Problem is, is you're at 75% or higher volume, it lasts about an hour at most. It's absolutely nowhere near the 24HR promised, I have even tried connecting it to Aux so extend it a bit and it doesn't really help. It also had a habit of overheating and cutting itself down in volume. Such a shame, I will definitely miss the sound quality, but not the battery issues.",

My biggest beef with it is the battery life. Not just that it's short, but that it'll automatically lower the volume drastically when the battery is near dying. Maddening when you are somewhere with background noise, and this basically renders the speaker silent because you can't HEAR it. I'd rather it go 100% full volume until it died.",

I have had at least 3 models of the Bose bluetooth speakers, the Marshall Kilburn bluetooth speaker, and several lower-end brand models. Of all of the speakers I have owned, this one has my favorite sound signature. B&O really does a great job with their sound, and the fact that they have put this much sound into something so small wows everyone that has seen it. Excellent volume for the size, and the quality of the sound is just incredible. Couple the sound with what I think is a very elegant design, and this might be the best bluetooth speaker in this size that has ever been made. Highly recommend!",

I spend a lot of time in hotel rooms and this is perfect for this application. I only gave 4 stars for two reasons... 1) Although stylish, they sacrificed Usability by making the icons so small and difficult to read/detect. I'm over 50 with bi-focals...the icons are a disaster. 2) They should have an app like the UE BT speakers which would allow me to equalize the music.

Very pleasant, accurate, rich sound from such a small footprint. Mostly stream my listening from Spotify and it sounds great. Take it back and forth everyday between my apartment and work. Very, very pleased with purchase!",
