      "text": "Bit expensive, however that's the price of avoiding made in china, and the quality is easily better than most china made goods(take constant supervision by the product contractor to ensure that the chinese are adhering to quality standards and specifications, many companies ignore this, e.g. Vasque apparently). Don't seem to be superwide to me, and previously ASOLO used to run on the narrower side, which is nice as I tend to wear an A or B width dependent upon mfg, etc. Much happier with the quality of these(few days) than a pair of Vasque Breezes (made in china) that I ordered a few years ago, as these don't leak through the sole, and are made to labelled size/width.",

They appear very well made. I am not a boot expert but I suspect these are a bit stiffer to support heavier loads during hiking or rucking. I said somewhat large on the size as they were a little roomier in the width than I expect for a 9 M.",

My previous pair were a light duty trail boot that are just now falling apart - they are 10 years old and have been worn almost constantly. I tried the Vasque St. Elias and the Keen Durand, both 100 cheaper than the Asolo, but the Vasque hobbled me due to a hot spot on the outside right toe, and the Keens were too big in the toe box and heel. Every foot is different, but for me, the Asolo is the boot.",

They kept my feet nice and warm in freezing weather but breath so well I can use them all day at home with weather in the 70's and still be comfortable. Their build quality is top notch. I have put well over 150 miles on them and are holding up great. Considering the terrain lesser boots would be in stitches by now. I did have some initial concerns since the lace buckles I believe are plastic, but my concern seems unfounded as they have held up superbly. Fit seems true, if a little narrow but very comfortable to my feet.",

Unfortunately, the new pair has not lasted very long. The seams started to fall apart very early and the toe guard also started to peel off (same as photos shared by others). I was really surprised and disappointed that they only lasted a couple of months for such an expensive pair of boots. The first pair was so great and durable so not sure what happened (did they start skimping on the manufacturing quality?) to the second pair.",
