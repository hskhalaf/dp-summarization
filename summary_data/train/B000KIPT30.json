This one being $25 made me hesitate about what it was capable of doing... I took the risk and purchased it. This is definitely worth the $25! It did the exact same thing my other $100 did! I saved myself the extra $75 and went ahead and bought a packet of Cable Matters 3.5 mm to 1/4 in adapter (set of 5). It's not the sleekest headamp you can buy but it definitely gets the job done.

It is easily setup utilizing 1/4\" jacks for the headphones (note that you may need an adapter as many headphones are 3.5mm). The volume knobs adjust nicely without producing static as they are adjusted. The only issue I had with this is that one of my 1/4\" adapters was only outputting on one speaker when attached to this amp - the outputs are not completely tight on a 1/4\" plug which allows some wiggle room. However, i would say that overall this headphone amp is a great value and works as advertised.",

When I bought it reviews of this and other Behringer equipment were pretty good, so I thought I would give Behringer another try after having several not so great pieces of equipment from them.

Everyone had a good sound. Just not real loud levels. It was worth the $16 I paid for it but at $25 I would try something else that could handle a heavier load for our needs.",

Different headphones will impact that sensation. 2- The first day, when all four outputs were used there was a low level buzz/hum. The second day when only three outputs were used, there was no noise. I will be investigating that further.",
