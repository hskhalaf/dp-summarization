At least temperature alerts, which is what I got it for, do work. It was also pretty tricky to figure out how to open it up to remove the batteries to get it to reset and go into setup mode. Like all Wink stuff, they don't really believe in instructions.",

It has promise, and the engineers may improve it over time, but if you are expecting to get something that works, you will be sorely disappointed. I am shocked that GE would put its name anywhere near this hockey puck. If you want to tinker, you are probably better off going with TWINE. If you want temperature and humidity sensing, there are a variety of options that will likely work far better. Sure, they may be more costly, but they also will work. If you are still even considering purchasing this device, take a look at the forums on quirky for more stories from other dissatisfied customers [...]",
