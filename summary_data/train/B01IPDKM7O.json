The ring seems to use some type of aluminum alloy now and is not dishwasher safe. HOWEVER I do like the new quality. It\u2019s sturdier, doesn\u2019t bend under pressure and is perfectly round. I\u2019ll be continuing to buy pastry rings from this company in the future. Excellent heavy duty stainless steel pastry rings. Only complaint is that the rings were slightly oblong shaped, which I fixed by pressing on both sides of the ring until it fit one of my circular mixing bowls.",

If you lay it down it still has a slight gap on either side.",
