      "text": "I've only just received these so time will tell on durability and versatility. But the reason I bought them is for cutting remembrance wire (stainless steel, larger Guage, memory wire) and that much they do miraculously well! Ive struggled so much with the remembrance that i finally gave in and bought these at average retail price. They cut through it like it's a twig of asparagus easily with a little snap. I hope these will make my other projects using larger Guage wire significantly easier.",

The wire isn't deformed when its cut, unlike the typical wire cutter which bites it with two straight cutters. This one shears the wire with two hemispherical blades, leaving a round cut. If you need to place the wire into a round connector, this cutter does the trick. I use it on heavy gauge (10 and 12) wire.",

I would recommend this product for cutting, but for getting in super tight for the cleanest possible finish (for restringing per se), I would probably recommend the exceedingly expensive Starrett cutters.
