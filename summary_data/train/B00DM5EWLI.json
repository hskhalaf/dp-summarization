This external hard drive is truly mac/PC compatible and comes with the necessary software and instructions. There is backup software included with this hard drive but I have not tested it out or used it. Transferring items to and from this hard drive is very simple and the transfer rates are very quick. I have had it for 2 years now and have had no issues. I purchased a protective case as soon as purchased the hard drive:. I am still very please with my purchase and would purchase again!",

Plugged it in again recently to see if maybe I was too harsh before, but it was even worse this time. First it wouldn't open in finder, then it froze my finder, then it froze my whole computer. I had to manually shut down my computer (restart from the finder menu didn't even work). Keeping this thing far away from my computer from now on.",

Finding a carrying case was difficult, and I have to pack the case with the cord in such a way that will minimize movement in transit. Otherwise, it would bounce all over the place. All in all, a strong external HDD option.",

Cons: In editing files directly on this drive, it seems to be a fraction slower than another external hard drive I have -- that other one is just 500 GB capacity FAT32 formatted with a tiny 3\" USB 2 cord , while this one is 1TB NTFS formatted with a slightly longer USB cord, so perhaps those factors impact the speed. Still, the difference is so slight it is nearly negligible.",

I have yet to get it to work correctly, and it's extrememly hard to navigate; not user friendly at all. That being said, this unit is very small so it's easily packed for traveling. I simply keep all of my files (I am a photographer) in one folder, and every other day I delete the folder from the external drive and copy and paste the most recent one from my computer. This is a hassle, and defeats the purpose of the software that's included, but it's enough for my needs and the portability and space on the drive is worth the money, IMO.",
