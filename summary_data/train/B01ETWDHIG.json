These Silicone cooking gloves score on all counts. My first test was to fire up my cast iron skillet to see if how it handled extreme heat. No problem ! Next test was dexterity, something which always bothered me with other protectors. Once again, perfect ! And cleaning was as simple as washing one's hands. I am 100% satisfied and highly recommend these gloves.",
