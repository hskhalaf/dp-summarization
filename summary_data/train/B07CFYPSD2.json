      "text": "Great machine - if you're not scammed. I purchased a Surface Pro with the i5 Processor from the seller 'Electronics, Toys, and Games.' It came in a shrink-wrapped box that looked legitimate - the box had a serial number, as well as the model (i5). I happened to be running some diagnostics and noticed the processor is not an i5, but an m3 - almost $300 less in value. I would not have noticed otherwise. Furthermore, the serial number did not match the box - absolutely fraudulent. PLEASE be sure to check your specs and serial number before you do anything, and DO NOT buy from 'Electronic, Toys, and Games'!",

This thing is an absolute pleasure to use, and the fan-less i5 core is speedy and quiet. It charges relatively quickly, but a USB-C connection for faster charges would make it even better.",

This isn't the first problem I've had with a surface pro. I sent 2 back previously for screen problems and being too slow. I'm done with this brand forever. I recommend any other 2 in 1 or else an iPad pro",

No extra software to slow it down, so you get windows at its best. Highly recommend it. Im still an apple user. But credit is given were credit is due.",

      "text": "I purchased this Surface used (i7, 16 GB RAM, 1 TB) and at first, it was hitting some rough patches during set up. A lot of my experiences were easy to look up since others had the same experience: Example - I had to do a soft reset several times before it completed setup. It was having quite a bit of trouble with charging and usage until I updated it fully. Once it was using the latest updates, the Surface started working smoothly and charging properly. It is able to run creative tools well such as Lightroom and works well with Microsoft Suite and Python. I'm hoping this Surface will be a potentially useful traveling computer once we are post-pandemic.",
