We are just using the smaller bottle with size 0 nipple just so she won't develop bottle preference :) For anyone lookong for bottles for their BF babies, these are something to try! PS. We only use the 4oz for feeding as she only takea about 3oz each feed at 13wks. Saving the 9oz bottles for pumping purposes.",

      "text": "This was gifted to me as part of my Baby Registry. It came in on time. I had no problem receiving the bottles. Was very well packaged and secure. It was completed, everything was in there. Nipple comes with a size 2 and pacifiers are from 6-18months old. Perfect if you are breastfeeding so that way nipple still continues to help. So with that being said, only downside is the pacifiers are not meant for newborns and you will need to buy the correct nipple for the bottles. Perfect color as expected as well as the pacifiers. I love it!!!!!",

I do however wish that the 4oz bottles could be sold as a set of just 2. And in color. Makes it so much easier my niece lives with us and has the same brand of bottles I loved that I could order my sons in a different color.",
