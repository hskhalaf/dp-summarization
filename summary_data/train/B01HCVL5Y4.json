      "text": "Very convenient bottle and bowl design for traveling with your smallish dog. Probably not big enough for a large dog, though the 1 liter size would definitely be better. The bottle is a quality product made from BPA free plastic. The lid seals well and I have not had a leaking problem rattling around in my car. The bowl stays clean due to the bowl opening being snug against the bottle. It\u2019s definitely not an air tight seal, but does a good job staying clean except for fine dust. I would definitely buy another one if the need arises, though I think this one will last a very long time. Recommended.",

Much easier to remember things when they're attached so if you know you're going out just fill up the bottle and you're good to go. We have the 600mL version and it's all we need for our puppy but wouldn't have been bad to go with the larger 1L version either as it looks like it's just a bit taller and the 600mL version isn't big at all.",

If they don\u2019t finish what\u2019s in the trough, it\u2019s fairly easy (although sometimes difficult on a bumpy road) to put the water back into the bottle. It\u2019s plastic so it doesn\u2019t really keep the water cool- that would be my only complaint. If they made one in stainless steel I\u2019d be super excited but for now this works well for us.",
