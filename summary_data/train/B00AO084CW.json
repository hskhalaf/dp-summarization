One of the little \"snap\" things went down the tube, and I could not get it.... had to use a bolt instead. When it swings, it is very loud. I am not too impressed for the cost of this swing that was supposed to put any baby to sleep. So far, my little girl does not like it. Hoping she will eventually.... way too hard to disassemble and return. :( The vibration does not work while plugged in... you have to have batteries for that.",

Nice that we have the option of turning the swing in different directions as we like to limit screen time and yet we as adults still want to watch our shows. Nice having the option to remove the seat from the base and carry it from room to room with us if we need to. I have nothing negative to say about this swing!!!",

Furthermore, the mobile does not move. If the sound machine was any good, then the ridiculous amount of space this thing takes up would be worth sacrificing. I have twins so I ordered two, but am returning the one that has not been opened. If you are buying this for the music or sound features, you've been warned.",

We offered to return it and get a new one for them, but they declined as they didn't want to wait and we were able to make it work.

You can BARLEY hear the little lullabys or the \"nature sounds\" it plays even on the highest volume setting. Doubt baby will hardly hear them either.

Had to have my son put it together for me. That said it is very nice now that it is up. Love the fact that you can detach the chair and that the chair can be adjusted to a sit up position as my granddaughter gets older. My daughter ordered a different swing for her home and likes this one so much better. It is sturdy and quiet. Vey happy with this purchase. Would recommend to anyone. Great price as well",

That should solve the problem. Other than the sound, it is still a nice product that comes with many features like nature sounds and white noise. Works on battery and plugin.

Swings strong enough. (Goes to a 6) 2. Swing can face 2 different directions which is great. We make ours face the window which our baby loves. 3. Sound options are white noises or classical music. 4. Aside from swinging, swing has the options to vibrate. Baby can nap, which means so can I. or I can eat in peace. or get some work done. or just recharge my brain!",

I\u2019m giving one star solely on the safety of this issue, since my babies well being is number 1. Before it broke while my baby was in it though, he really enjoyed it. But I can not recommend anything that isn\u2019t safe.",

I love that it can be used as a swing in different directions and can also be used as a rocker. I don't know how long the batteries last since we have it plugged into the wall and don't plan to move the swing.I did put a battery in the rocker part for the vibration if/when we choose to use that.",

The battery compartment for the vibration unit is a bit too big which does not provide a snug fit for the battery, so when I turn it on it is very loud and not soothing at all. To fix this issue, I had to cut pieces of cardboard and placed it on one side of the battery which stops it from moving around so freely. This seems to do the trick, now it is working as intended, but other than that it is a great product and wold definitely recommend to others.",

So, we returned that and went without a swing for a month and a half or so. After a fair amount of research, we ordered this and it is whisper quiet! It makes only the sound you would expect it to - just a normal swinging sound that is not annoying at all. Love that it can swing two ways, has six speeds, music, nature sounds, a vibration option, and two incline settings. Would definitely recommend!",
