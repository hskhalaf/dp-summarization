There was a note inside from the owner of the company guaranteeing satisfaction and I'm very pleased with the lantern. It's heavy and very well constructed, with a decent quality of glass (included). It pairs well with a Luminara Flameless 7\" Candle, though a 9\" candle would work as well. I'm pleased with the purchase and would have no qualms purchasing from H. Potter in the future.",

It was packaged perfectly and I'm amazed that the glass inner piece was completely intact when it arrived as it is a thin and very pretty glass center. My Mom uses it indoors however it could definitely be used outdoors as it would take a hurricane force wind to blow it over. I am extremely pleased with the craftmanship of the lantern and plan to by one for myself. Highly recommend.",

The top and clear glass chimney are removable so that you can use an LED candle.

They can be stacked lightly into the tall chimney to expand the lighted area. I\u2019ll likely get another for my back deck.",

The finish is not very sophisticated or 'old-world authentic' looking, which isn't enough of an issue for me to send back. I'll have my iron-worker re-do the finish for me. In trying to describe the finish..... it's a solid pinkish brown that looks like it's been sponge-dabbed with black. In spite of the finish, It is quite refreshing to see such a well-made product offered - I think H Potter could do better on the paint finish - even if it was just all black.",

The cast iron lid is not attached, but sits on the frame. The glass is slightly bubbled for a quality look. Looks great with 7 and 9-inch candles lit.

They are indeed heavy, as other reviews stated, and will not blow over. The finish is beautiful. I used candles that operate on a remote so I don\u2019t have to handle the tops of the laterns to use them. These laterns are definitely worth the price!",

We live in an area with lots of those, so this helps chase the winter blues away and gives our home a warm, inviting feel. The lantern its self is just beautiful and the quality is top notch. I appreciate the fine craftsmanship and the hand blown glass. I got the small size and it's plenty big for indoors. I plan to use it outdoors this spring & summer and may even add another one or two. It was well packed and arrived in perfect condition including the glass. One of the best purchases I've made!",

I purchased these for my fireplace hearth and am using battery operated candles in them. They are gorgeous. There is more depth and variation to the color than what shows in the photos--I had been concerned that they would blend into the black fireplace surround but they do not. These lanterns were so well packaged that I can't imagine any damage every occurring during shipment! They would not blow over outside either and I like the idea of being able to temporarily use them for an outdoor party this summer.",
