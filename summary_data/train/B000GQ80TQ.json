      "text": "We have two pitbull's 50-60 lbs each one of which loves to chew on everything. Both of them love Dura Chew chew \"bones\" I bought two chicken ones this time instead of different flavors so they stop steeling from each other. They love the chicken over the bacon flavor. I am not a fan of rawhides, animal parts (ears etc.) or things not made in the USA for chew toys so that is why I decided to try Dura Chews. Not good if you have carpet and are worried about it getting stained these do make their gums bleed if they chew like my dogs do. My older dogs teeth look great really helps with keeping them clean.",

I attached a picture of the new toy and the two week old toy to show how durable it has been!",

I bought it after hearing a lot of good comments, so I don't know if it's just me, but I don't like to have my dog's gum bleed for being cut.",
