I don't know what use it is in this bottle - you would end up wasting a bunch I think. It helps keep my scalp healthy and makes my hair softer and smoother.",

It's a non-oil base so doesn't goop your hair up, smells gently pleasant and really feels like it's doing some good. Plus my hair seems thicker in the 3 weeks I've been using it. One minor thing: it would benefit from some kind of dropper to facilitate getting the lotion on to the scalp instead of the hair - I've taken to decanting some into a regular dropper bottle and using that so I can part my hair with the dropper and distribute the lotion more evenly. Other than that, EXCELLENT product.",

However, I think this listing is incorrect as the size on the Hauschka website is 3.40 oz, not 30.4 oz (which would be HUGE!) The website price is $30 plus shipping, or free shipping over $40 per order, so you'd have to consider if this was a good value or not. But the product itself seems excellent, definitely superior to \"competitor\" items such as Aveda.",
