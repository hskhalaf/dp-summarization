Supposedly this is \"E-Element\" which I think is also Hui Jo or something, but the box says \"Super Scholar\". So...take your pick I guess. They keyboard feels good. However, it did have scratches and scuffs on it already, and didn't look new, though it supposedly was. The metal base was scratched, and there were manufacturing scraps in the box (curls of plastic, dust, etc). That was disappointing.",

I reconnect it and it just fails to register. Then if I change USB ports it continues to no register. Considering the cost and how long it lasted it is NOT WORTH THE PURCHASE PRICE.",
