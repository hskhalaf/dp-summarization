The difference between this speaker and Anker is not dramatic, but it is there...this speaker is luxurious.The sound, the feel, the materials. I paid $65 for it and it is absolutely worth double the price of Anker.",

We bought it primarily as a wireless bluetooth speaker phone, and it it works superbly. Crystal clear sound, can be stood upright for one speaker, or lay flat as a true conference phone (four directional microphones). Callers tell us they hear us perfectly. It is professional, gorgeous, and small enough you could carry it anywhere. As others have noted, it doesn't come with a case, and that's unfortunate.",

I'm not convinced the EQ is perfectly flat, it does seem to have some character of its own, but it has a subtlety where I am hearing new details in songs I have known for many years. I have no idea what technically makes it sound so good, but it really does. A really great speaker for the bedside, for listening to music while working or watching videos. Sounds great with everything from Steely Dan and other Jazz to Metal.",

When used as speaker phone, it looks like only half of the speaker is working because of mono sound but still clear with plenty of volume. Bass is not as bad as I was reading in the reviews. You can feel it is still pushing a lot on low frequencies despite thickness. When compared to Bose Revolve+, it has obviously less bass but the stereo sound on the Esquire 2 plays in its favor. I purchased at 160$ but saw other deals later on at 129$ which definitely make it a good deal.",

The buttons aren't that easy to see and press in the car. But having said that, I can voice dial by pressing the pause (phone) button and saying \"OK Google\".

I tried doing this a few times to record meetings for absent staff to listen to later, and the unit shuts itself off after a period of what it sees as \"inactivity\". I checked with support, and there is no way around this behavior. Unfortunate, because it would have made it a much more versatile tool.",
