My male cat, at age 13, has not yet figured out he can squat. So, I put a piece of plastic carpet protector under the litter box to catch periodic drips. Oh, do not fill the bottom pan more than 3-4 inches. You will run into problems.",

I finally figured out that if she aims for either of the two hinges, the urine leaks to the outside. I solved the problem by putting a puppy training pad underneath, but that's why I can't give it a 5-star rating.",

If you're looking for something that makes it harder for cats to spread litter over the sides, you may be better off purchasing a plastic storage container and making your own litter box. That would be the cheaper thing to do. I don't even use the lid on mine, since my large cat still doesn't like to go in with the lid on.",

      "text": "My scaredy cat -- who is an enthusiastic litter box digger -- has steadfastly refused to go into covered litter boxes since she was tiny. Eureka! She loves this one, which is big enough to 1) catch almost all of the litter she energetically tosses around, and 2) overcome her fear of small enclosed spaces. Further, its triangular shape allows it to be tucked into obscure spaces where it is unlikely to be noticed by anyone except you and your cats. Whoever designed this must be a cat person, because I don't think he/she could have come up with a litter box any more feline friendly.",

The size is great because she has plenty of room to do her business and cover it without making a mess outside the box. Like other reviewers have said, don't get this thing if you are trying to save space. It may be made to fit in the corner, but it does not necessarily fit snuggly and it's still rather large. That being said, it is a perfect fit for our available space and I am very happy with my purchase.",
