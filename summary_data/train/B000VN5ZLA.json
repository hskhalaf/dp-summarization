Our vistors are always interested in the concept and enjoy building or watching others construct items from the instructions or from their imaginations. Our 5-year-old grandsaon is particularly good at building with them. He is learning to follow picture instructions and also to make creative objects. So far none of the pieces have broken--although they have been accidentally stepped on occasionally. I am surprised Magformers are not more universally available for sale--but probably the high price discourages people from trying them.",

      "text": "My three year old grandchildren played with Magformers at my girlfriends house when we were over there one day. They were crazy about them so of course I ordered some. I have made a few orders for these Magformers and I plan to order more. They are a a little pricey but if you want to get something all the kids will love this is it. They are worth the money. My grandchildren are a set of busy twins and these keep them occupied for a very long time and they are the first thing they pull out to play with. They love it when the adults get involved because then more impressive things get built.",
