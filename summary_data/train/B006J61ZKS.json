It does the job to find a lot of trash and coins, no gold yet but hopefully soon I will hit the jackpot. This is perfect for beginners who are curious/ interested in metal detecting, it is not expensive and the screen shows how deep the object is, and what it is.",

The std setting is great to learn on for beginners, and one can graduate to the pro setting once one learns the machine. The pro setting gives you more of a range when it comes to depth, you can tell if an object is deep or at the surface. One can easily grow with this machine. Are there better metal detectors out there? Yes. Are there any detectors better for $550? I don't know of any.",

I purchased another one from another retailer. This detector is great! I really enjoy the fact that it is waterproof. The detector is also one of the most accurate for its price range. My only complaint is that the screen does not have a back-light. This is a huge oversight, as I enjoy detecting in the evening after I get home from work (in the dark).",

I am sure as I get more experience hopefully I will be digging less pull tabs.",
