I like this conair better than the instyler. I have a shoulder length bob and the 1.5 inch brush works well to get my hair to stay flipped in even when my hair naturally wants to flip outwards. Also, it makes my color treated hair look shiny and healthy.",

Since using the Hot Spin Brush I not only like this tool more with each use, but I no longer hate styling my hair. The spin is great for avoiding brush stuck in hair syndrome and for styling.

      "text": "This is my second purchase of a Conair hot air spin brush. This last purchase (new model) was a dissapointment, first because it was dificult to change from low, high and cool air, I had to use both hands when with the old model I could control it with just one hand, but what made me discard it was that on the third use, while I was styling my hair I heard a small explosion like sound just next to my ear and a burnt smell. I immediatly stopped using it and went back to my regular hair dryer. This is either a faulty design or factory defect. Will think twice before buying another one from Conair.",
