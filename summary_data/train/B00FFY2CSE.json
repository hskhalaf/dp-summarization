The ties on the sides are also very cheap, slick nylon which makes putting up the net difficult. We had to re-tie many times during the one game we used this, and the eyelet tore on one side after about 20 minutes. Then the other side did the same and just kept tearing more and more until we gave up trying to play. Definitely look elsewhere, and don't be a cheapskate like me, and buy a real net. Luckily they are refunding my purchase.",
