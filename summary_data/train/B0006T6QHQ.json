Everything but the case is pretty decent but the case is really bad. Do not lift it by the handle as the cheap plastic hinges will break. Be aware, this thing weighs ~30lbs. The chips are shrinked wrapped in bundles of ~25. A string in the rolls to help remove the plastic would be a marked improvement. Regardless, this will make family poker night much more enjoyable, replacing counting all those pennies.",

I like the feel and the weight of each chip, i just wish you didnt get so many low denominations which have a tendency to be useless in a bigger poker game. But this did come with plenty of high dollar chips too which somewhat solves this problem. Manufactureres just need to make less$1 and $5 chips and more $25 and $50 since thats where the game ends up rather quickly. The case for these chips is pretty terrible, overall. Its flimsy and the handle feels like it will break off at any moment other that that a great set.",

I could shuffle them straight out of the plastic, and they didnt slip all over like some of the cheaper sets. Poker nut Approved!",

The case was so cheap that when I picked it up by the handle the center of the case flexed outward. The cards and chips (which were still wrapped) didn't even stay in their trays because it flexed so bad.",
