You can still get a good shave if you use almost double the amount of cream (otherwise I would given one star). I recently used an old travel tube and the difference was striking and confirmed all of my suspicions. Sadly, this will be my last jar and I will start looking for something else.",

Also, don't use lots of water while lathering. Use very little water. Gradually add water if necessary. Use a brush and a shaving/lathering bowl. Happy Shaving!",
