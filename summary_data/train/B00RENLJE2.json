Many of the reviewers are reviewing the product right when they get it, which almost defeats the purpose of understanding the true quality of the product. Overall the mat \"works\" and prevents me from slipping in the tub, but having to clean this nasty mold off is not appealing. I recommend shopping around more before buying this mat. Don't just purchase it because it's the #1 best selling bath mat on Amazon. The reviews are meaningless.",

Luckily, I was the one standing on it when that happened. I immediately returned to get another one of these. There is nothing safer out there at any price than this mat. By the way...our shower floor surface is not smooth, and still this mat holds. I am slowly ordering 4 more to keep in reserve.",

I strongly recommend this shower mat, and plan to buy this brand again when needed.",

It's a good size (in my opinion) and feels really nice underfoot, which is usually not the case with most bath mats where all you're feeling are the little suction cups under your feet.",

How would I improve this item? Making it longer to cover the rest of the shower. I guess I can buy two, but it would be better if it was longer. Also if it was bright white like the shower it would work better for me. Great item though!",

The Epica bath mat helps minimize the risk of slips and falls while preventing the growth of bacteria and build-up of soap residues. Heavy duty, latex free rubber .Exceptionally resistant to wear and tear, the Epica bath mat is ideal for heavy use situations such as hospitals, assisted living facilities, gyms and hotels, as well as homes with small children, seniors or anyone who requires the highest standards of safety and quality. It's made of sturdy, injection molded rubber which contains no latex, so it's safe for people with a latex allergy. Excellent grip top and bottom .

These suction cups will work whether or not the floor has a nonslip surface. The upper side of the mat is textured, giving your feet extra traction power Inhibits bacteria and soap deposits . Another advantage of the textured surface is that repels slippery soap residues which could cause your feet to slide out from under you.
