      "text": "Ever since we got our cat from the shelter (as a kitten), he struggled with a respiratory virus, and a sensitive digestive system. Not sure if they are related, but after we got his sneezing under control with supplements, he continued struggling with the tummy issues (lots of throwing up). He went from throwing up once a day (sometimes twice) to once a week within the first week of introducing the Nutro (Salmon flavor) food. Not sure if it's the grain free factor or the fish, but we love it and he loves it even more :)",
