I thought no big deal that's not worth sending it back. I just taped it down. The C.D. player works pretty good. I tried plugging my ipod in and the right speaker was so scratchy that i couldn't listen to it. I tried plugging in a USB flash drive that i downloaded music on, a 2 and a 16gb none of that music worked. I paid allot of money for this thing. Not real happy with it at all!!",

It\u2019s twice a heavy as much larger units so it\u2019s a solidly built unit with enough controls to make your average audiophile happy, and I haven\u2019t even started on EQ settings yet. I\u2019m very excited with my Panasonic RX-D55GC-K and would recommend this highly to anyone except those that feel it\u2019s necessary to spend more than $150 to get quality sounds.",

Unlike some that are light weight and cheaply made (& have buttons that are stiff and hard to push), this one has has more weight to it and seems more solidly built. Operation is pretty straight forward and he loves it.",

I originally gave it a tentative 1 star because I couldn't figure out how (or if it was possible) to change the AM step frequency increment from its current 9Khz to 10Khz as needed here in the US. Fortunately, another poster posted the answer (it *is* possible). Furthermore, I then re-reviewed the documentation, something I'd already done several times without success, and this time saw the instructions on how to do it which I kept missing. I haven't tried its plug-in MP3-player capability but all the other features work fine and it sounds great.",

All buttons are too difficult to read unless one has his eyes close up to the boombox. Do not buy this one, there are other ones out there that really work as advertised! CP",

This is not a big problem for me because we have other clocks. It was a bit of a challenge to program initially.",
