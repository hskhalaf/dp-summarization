The plastic pieces that are connected to the mesh and cammo screens come off easily if you're not careful. as far as being a 3 person blind. Sure, if you're back to back really close or scrawny and short and don't want to be able to move around much at all. There are hundreds of tiny holes in it where everything is sewn together. I WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN This may be a good outdoor play house for kids",
