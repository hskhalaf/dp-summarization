I just turn up the volume on the SoundLink to almost max and then use the volume keys iPod Touch 4g (whether on screen or to the side) ro adjust the volume as my listening taste changes. I guess any fourth gen iPod touch would do the trick. However even in its own the Bose SoundlLink has no equal.",

The only room for improvement is that there is no leds for volume. The cover provides pretty good protection. It does not fit in a briefcase but I travel with it on my carry-on.

The bass didn't crackle even at high volume, nor did it disrupt the clarity of the other elements in the track. With how powerful this is you will never need to blare it on its highest setting. I then played tracks where certain elements are only audible in headphones or with high end audio equipment. I heard all and I was amazed at its clarity. Bravo Bose! Bravo!",

Volume does not get as loud as many other larger speakers, but is still impressive for something this small. Unlike many other Bose models from the past, this model includes buttons with labels. A side by side comparison to the newer model makes it hard to tell the difference unless you listen very carefully with particularly demanding music. Similarly this outperforms the soundlink mini, oftentimes at a similar price. The size difference between the mini and this model is noticable, but slight.",

You can use it for background sound at a party, but it will also pump out some pretty decent volume (and bass - if placed against a wall versus out in the open) - enough for those deck party sing-alongs - and the battery lasts at least 6 hours, even at decent volumes. All in all a pretty amazing feat considering the size. Bluetooth pairing was seamless and easy to setup. Kudos to Bose - I own their 901 Speakers and just LOVE them - glad to see they still make a quality product.",

You can move it from the kitchen, to the yard, to the living room or anywhere you want in the house as it weighs very little. We even contemplated taking it for a week to a vacation home. It's a top notch product and great value compared to other ways of getting superb sounding music anywhere in your house.",

I've invested thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours of research into my home theater sound system so, I consider myself knowledgeable on this topic (but not necessarily an expert). This little speaker sounds amazing... and I'm constantly surprised at the quality of sound it puts out and it's ability to fill the room with sound. The only thing this speaker is missing is a speakerphone so I can accept an incoming call like the jambox has. However, I would recommend this speaker over the jambox... i've heard both and this is far superior.",

      "text": "Last spring I bought a JamBox by Jawbone. I liked it a lot. I liked it so much I bought one for each of my sons, and recommended that everybody should get bluetooth speakers. Then my JamBox died after only a couple months. So, I tried the Bose Soundlink speakers. Night and day as far as sound quality! If you want sound, go for the Bose. If you want cute, JamBox is cute. I'm sold on Bose.",
