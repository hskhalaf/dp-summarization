I am a professional photography and have high-end cameras for paying jobs, but for fun stuff and portability you can't beat this pocket size Sony. I never leave the house without my wallet, cell and Sony camera. The 330 is even slimmer that previous models. I love all the features and I have full control of how to photo is going to come out. The Carl Zeiss lens is a big plus. I highly recommend this camera if you are looking for a point and shoot.",

Unlike the prior model, it offers virtually no user control. Worst of all, there is a considerable delay between pushing the shutter button and the picture being taken, resulting in lots of lost shots. There's apparently no way to adjust for bright backgrounds, so beach and snow shots are not really possible. Pictures come out dark, and due to the delay, often blurred. We bought one for our son and his wife, and the same issues show up in their photos. The display is good though.....",

    "description": "Color:RedThe DSC-W330 captures amazingly detailed images with a Carl Zeiss 26mm equivalent wide angle 4x zoom lens. Taking and reviewing images is made easy with a large 3.0\u201d LCD and advanced features including Easy mode, iAuto and SteadyShot\u2122 make it easy to capture great images in various conditions.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nThe DSC-W330 captures amazingly detailed images with a Carl Zeiss 26mm equivalent wide angle 4x zoom lens. Taking and reviewing images is made easy with a large 3.0-inch LCD and advanced features including Easy mode, iAuto and SteadyShot make it easy to capture great images in various conditions. \n\nSony Cyber-shot DSC-W330 Highlights \n\n14-megapixel Super HAD CCD image sensor\nA powerful 14.1-megapixel, 1/2.3-inch Super HAD CCD image sensor helps you capture gorgeous images with superb contrast and clarity down to the finest detail. With 14.1 megapixels, you can create stunning, photo-quality prints up to A3+ (13x19-inch) size, or crop your images and still come away with high-resolution shots. \n\n\n\nThe DSC-W330's wide-angle lens delivers the big picture Sony lens with 4x optical zoom with 26mm equivalent wide angle\nSony 4x optical zoom lens with 26mm equivalent wide angle brings distant subjects closer for great outdoor, sports, and travel photos. \n\n3.0-inch Clear Photo LCD display (230k pixels)\nGenerous 3.0-inch (230K pixels) Clear Photo LCD display features sharp, natural color that makes it easy to compose shots, read menus, and view photos, even in bright sunlight. \n\nIntelligent Auto (iAuto) mode\nUnlike traditional auto mode, Intelligent Auto (iAuto) mode thinks for you, recognizing scenes, lighting conditions, and faces, and adjusts settings resulting in clearer images, faces with more natural skin tone, and less blur. By incorporating advanced features such as Intelligent Scene Recognition, Face Detection technology, and SteadyShot image stabilization, iAuto mode lets you take advantage of the latest Sony Cyber-shot technology without leaving auto mode. Whether you're shooting landscapes, capturing a beautiful flower, or taking pictures at an in-door birthday party or wedding shower, iAuto mode will optimize your camera's settings to help ensure you come away with a great shot. \n\nIntelligent Scene Recognition (iSCN) Mode\nIntelligent Scene Recognition (iSCN) Mode automatically detects nine different types of scenes and, within just 1/30th of a second, selects the appropriate camera settings: Backlight, Backlight Portrait, Twilight, Twilight Portrait, Portrait, Landscape and Macro . iSCN has two modes: Auto and Advanced. In Auto Mode, the camera takes a single shot using the optimal settings. In Advanced Mode, the camera takes a photo with the optimal settings and, if in difficult lighting (low light or back light) immediately takes a second photo with another optimized setting so you can choose which to keep. \n\nSteady Shot Image Stabilization\nSteadyShot image stabilization compensates for camera shake and helps prevent blur by using higher ISO. \n\nFace Detection technology\nFace Detection technology detects up to eight individual faces and adjusts flash, focus, exposure, and white balance to help deliver crisp, properly lit images of family and friends. \n\nMotion Detection\nMotion Detection, along with Face Motion Detection adjusts ISO sensitivity and increases the shutter speed when movement is detected, reducing blur in moving subjects and faces. \n\nSmile Shutter technology in action Smile Shutter technology\nSmile Shutter technology captures a smile the moment it happens. Simply press the Smile Shutter button and the camera does the rest. You can also select adult and child priority and indicate the degree of Smile Detection Sensitivity. Intelligent Scene Recognition can be used together with Smile Shutter mode. This means that beautiful smiles can be captured with settings optimized for the particular scene, even in difficult conditions such as twilight and backlighting. \n\nScene modes\nThe DSC-W330 features 10 convenient scene modes: High Sensitivity, Twilight, Twilight Portrait, Soft Snap, Landscape, Beach, Snow, Underwater, Gourmet, Pet. \n\nIntelligent AF\nThanks to Intelligent AF technology, capture fleeting moments like a child's adorable expression with the ultra-quick AF which locks focus in as little as 0.3 seconds. \n\nEasy Shooting Mode\nWith Easy Shooting Mode, even beginners can take great photos. In Easy Shooting Mode, easy-to-understand basic instructions are displayed on the LCD screen and the camera switches to all automatic settings, removing several function choices and allowing you to focus on just your subject. Since this mode works together with Intelligent Scene Recognition, the camera selects the optimum setting for each scene. In addition the easy mode simplifies preview mode. \n\nFunction Guide\nThis beginner-friendly optional function helps navigate through the various functions and settings displaying the description of chosen functions or settings on the LCD screen. \n\nIn-Camera Retouching Tools\nRetouch and enhance your photos on the go with in-camera Trimming and Red-Eye Correction. \n\nIn-camera retouching options \nLithium-ion battery\nIncluded lithium-ion battery provides added convenience with longer lasting power than alkaline batteries (capacity of 230 images or 115 minutes of still image with the DSC-W330). \n\nMedia card slot \nFor convenient storage and sharing of your images, the DSC-W330 accepts Memory Stick Duo/Memory Stick PRO Duo/Memory Stick PRO-HG Duo media (sold separately). \n\nSD Card Functionality\nSony SD memory cards are the perfect solution for storing and sharing your digital content such as high-quality photos, videos, music, and more. \n\nIncludes Sony PMB (Picture Motion Browser) Software ver. 5.02\nSony Picture Motion Browser software offers a simple, intuitive way to transfer, sort, and view your video and still images on your compatible PC. In addition, multiple output options let you burn your memories to DVD (sold separately), as well as take advantage of one click upload to a number of popular video and photo sharing sites. \n\nIncludes Sony PMBP (Picture Motion Browser Portable) software\nWith the pre-installed Picture Motion Browser (PMB) Portable software the DSC-W330 makes it easy to pre-select videos and images in the camera and conveniently upload them from the camera to a compatible PC and popular Internet sharing sites without the need for any additional software or install.",
