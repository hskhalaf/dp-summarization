Olympus m5 markii has better controls [WHAT'S TO LIKE] small kit lens is amazing timer is very ez to set up Good Image Stabilization good lens combo, great lens selection it has hot shoe excellent price",

Excellent camera to get into photography with especially considering price. Edit: have had this camera for a while now and still love it. It has video capability but I don't see it as a video camera, definitely not a vloger cam (no mic input jack) but none of that matters for me. I just wanted it to learn photography and it's a whole bunch of fun and that's kinda the point. Also, m43 lenses are cheaper than bigger frame cameras which is a big plus for me ( depending on what lens and blah blah blah)",

The kit lens is gorgeous and the added telephoto lens is a good start for photography. I am most impressed by the in-body stabilization. I have been cursed with shaky hands all my life and this aids GREATLY with my micro jitters. The LCD screen is very receptive to touch. 4K photos look GORGEOUS! I shoot 24 mp otherwise and was still blown away by the quality of the 16 MP. Anyone looking to jump into the mirrorless world or just looking for a starter camera, GET THE GX85! 10/10!",

Would like to batteries to last longer but the stabilization makes up for everything. Shooting with 1.5 Rokinon Cine Lenses plus a generic speedbooster and this camera does better in low light than the GH4. Audio input would be nice but I almost always record externally regardless.

Didn't do much video but just played with it to test. Image stabilization is great and you could get away with a lot with hand held shooting. Great camera for the price and so portable I will even carry it as a second camera when I do use my DSLR. Love it",

      "text": "Came packaged very well and securely. Unfortunately, this camera was just far heavier than I expected; making it impractical for my desire to use for travel. I didn't spend much time with the camera itself before it was returned, but I can say that I was surprised to see additional presets such as a glimmer effect",

I need 2 bodies, so that I can affix 2 prime lenses at different focal lengths each, thus saving me form constant lens changes as I do not like using zoom lenses. The re-seller sends me emails pretending they need to know if I have received the camera, but I think the real reason for their 'concern' is that they want me to post a review, etc.",

But Panasonic has a model called Panasonic DMC-G85 and the other Panasonic DMC-GX85, and both times I received batteries for the the DMC-G85 instead of the DMC-GX85.

    "description": "Style:w/ 12-32mm (Black)For today's interchangeable lens camera enthusiasts \u2014 or anyone looking for a lighter, newer more intelligent alternative to bulky DSLRs \u2014 Panasonic LUMIX Mirrorless Micro Four Thirds system cameras deliver impressive, no-compromise performance. Nearly half the size of most DSLRs, the DMC-GX85 delivers impressive large sensor performance in the most compact camera system ever designed by Panasonic LUMIX. Thanks to the elimination of the low pass filter, its fine detail resolving power is boosted nearly 10% over previous 16-Megapixel sensors. Image stabilization is top of its class with the complementary LUMIX 2-axis lens O.I.S. and a new 5-axis in-body I.S., available in either photo or video recording modes. Camera purists will enjoy the familiar quick-access thumbwheel controls and integrated 2764k-dot eye-level electronic viewfinder, plus a tilting LCD display for greater flexibility in difficult shooting angles. Modern enthusiasts will love the WiFi mobile control and next-generation flexibility that 4K Video, 4K PHOTO and 4K Post Focus modes bring to the creative experience.",
