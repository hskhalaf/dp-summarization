We also modified them by easily snipping off the bottom loops on one. You can buy replacement Edison type lights everywhere now. Nice soft light, but enough light.",

The item is exactly what the picture show me. The length of cord could be adjusted if you want. The cage of light could be relocated. Because the Edison light was not bright enough, I changed the five bulbs. However, it was indicated by the seller. I would be showing it to my friends when they come visit me :)",

If you purchase something that needs installation, make sure you don't get the product too far in advance of the installation!",
