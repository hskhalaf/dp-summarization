I had a D60 then D80 and then D2x and now for a year now, the D2xs. D2x and D2xs are about 90% the same. It is a top of the line camera and also the last of the professional DX cameras (maybe for now). You can not go wrong with this investment. You can get a D3 for 4 or 5k so if you are buy a D2x or D2xs above 3k, you are crazy.",

This is the first audio focus camera that focuses faster than me, its a bit heavy, but I'm a bit older. Couple this camera with a fast lens, (f1.4D, f1.8D, f2.0D, f2.8D), and if the pictures are not good, then its you. With the new Nikon D3 coming out in November 2007, this camera will be available used as well as new, get one you will not be disappointed. :-)",

I will never get rid of my D2x as it is, as I said, a great performer...workhorse build, excellent low iso performance, overall still produces outstanding images. What confuses me though is that Amazon is still selling it new for @$5,800. What's up with that. You can find a pristine copy on ebay for probably under $1,500. That, in my opinion, would be the best bet for anyone interested in this Nikon gem.",
