After using this shampoo and taking Saw Palmetto supplements I saw significant hair growth over the next 3 months. The shampoo makes great suds even though its sulfate free. It has a wonderful light citrus scent that doesn\u2019t linger. The pH is perfect and leaves my hair soft and manageable even without conditioner. I would prefer it even if it didn\u2019t help my hair grow. The only problem is the plastic container is stiff, so it\u2019s a little hard to get the shampoo out.",

For a shampoo of this price and especially one to help grow hair I can't imagine anyone buying it unless they have thick oily hair. If there was ever any regrowth it would probably be because of all the hair that brook off at the roots. of",
