Another brand had different cords and connectors to link them, even allowing them to be flush with each other. That being said, we flush mounted these to the ceiling leaving about an 8\" gap between lights and strapped the extra cord out of the way. Their design made this easy to do. Shop now has plenty of light! Out of the 28 lights, only one was damaged and that being only slightly damaged. Yes we would use these again.",

Both these LEDs and the halogen fixtures are nominal 4800 lumens. These LEDs are much bluer than the halogens (the 5000k bulbs I was looking for) and appear to be throwing far more light, even though the lumen ratings are equal. Disregard the mess on the work bench, and look at the light output. I liked the first one so much, directly after I took the photo, I ordered a second, to replace the left-hand halogen in the photo below.",

Also wish it spread the light out a little more. I'm using this on a pretty low ceiling (only around 8 ft ceiling) and the light is directed more downward. Wouldn't be a problem with a higher ceiling though. I like how the bulbs are secured with a guard around the connections, both For aesthetics and because the lights won't easily fall out if they are bumped. For the price, these work great.",
