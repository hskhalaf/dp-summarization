I have purchased a couple brake components from them so I know they are a reputable company. I can honestly say that they have the same bite as the Brembos. I have not raced with them so I am not sure of the heat fade resistance. I have raced with my old set of Brembos and I wasn't really a fan of how fast they heat faded. After one autocross run they (Brembo) started smoking. These are a great alternative to the OEM pads!",
