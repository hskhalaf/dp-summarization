      "text": "I got this bat for my son to get his tracking of the ball and hand-eye coordination better. I also bought him small wiffle and foam golf balls to really up the challenge. It really improved his tracking of the ball and he has a lot easier time to hit the ball now since the baseball is so much bigger than these balls. Like any bat, the kids get a response on the flight of the ball knowing if they made good contact or not. Highly recommend on this bat for baseball or softball players that want to track the ball better.",

I would add the little foam yellow balls like I did, the 2 wiffle balls are useless. you can actually pitch or soft toss those. well worth the money though. This, plus a dozen of the yellow mini balls is still well under what you pay for a slim bat the big sport stores",

His biggest issue now is laying off pitches, he swings at everything, but thanks to this he hits even the bad pitches.",

The weight is comparable to a regular bat for an 8-10 year old but once you go above 10 it may be too light. Which isn't an issue necessarily as the goal is hand eye coordination BUT think it really fits perfectly for 8-10 year olds.",
