I frequently blow my pics up to 8x10 & they look great. I'm pretty hard to please when it comes to my pics. I've never had any problems with it in my many years of use. My one & only complaint is that you can't zoom in once you've started shooting video, so get in as close as you want before you start filming.",

      "text": "And so my father bought one too. Perfect little pocket camera with a nice zoom. I personally go with a bigger prosumer model (Lumix GF-1), but alternatively this would make a good complement to a DSLR. Battery is on the small side, so if you are going on safari without power for a few days, either buy an extra battery or get a small car charger (Duracell makes a good one in the 100w range for $70) and bring your charger with. Another downside is that it uses Sony 'Memory Stick Duo' media, not SD card, so not compatible with my other cameras/GPS/laptop/UPS adapters. Wife has another Sony, so fine for her I guess.",

Having the ability to take multiple pictures in rapid succession is also a handy feature. The 10x zoom is great. It would be nice if it also came with an \"optional\" small hand strap, in addition to, the larger neck strap that comes included with the camera. The lens cap is not an issue, as the camera displays that you have failed to remove the cap when it is inadvertently left on. Overall, the camera, considering its features and quality of digital photographs, is a good value for the money invested.",

The other issue is that this camera has no provision for a \"remote\" shutter release, neither electronic or mechanical - this is not a problem for most people, but if you think you might ever have a need for that option be aware that this camera will not fit.",

The Zoom button is in such a place that you find yourself zooming when you don't mean to. Your thumb ends up on the zoom if you hold the camera by the \"handle\". Secondly, I just took the camera on vacation and I found that the battery died fairly quickly - much quicker than my last camera. I was charging the camera every evening, but still the charge did not last throughout a whole day. So, I just ordered an extra battery, which was about $30.",
