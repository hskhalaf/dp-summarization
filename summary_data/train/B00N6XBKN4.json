It airs up a single high twin in about 15 seconds and a queen in about 30 seconds, depending on the pressure you want. I didn't feel it was worth a full star penalty, but future designs really need a more secure connection for the adapter. A simple lock notch or male/female dimple would be an improvement over the pinch concept that often comes free inside of transport bag. Would recommend to anyone on the market for an air mattress pump.",

As for myself, the unit I received has held up very nicely in terms of holding a charge... longevity of the charge and overall well-performing unit. I've had it now for over a year and have used it on many camping trips. We use it to inflate and deflate our air mattresses. I'm very happy with the device.",

Can't speak to the durability yet but if it lasts as long as my previous Coleman rechargeable battery powered pump I'll be too old to get up off the air mattress!",

I went camping and the guy with an inverter for the electrical pump had told me I was wasting my money on this. Well when we arrived to the campground his little inverter didnt work and my pump was used to inflate at least 9 airbeds on a single charge. I was the hero of the camping trip thanks to this little baby. Highly recommended.",
