With the detachable hard drive bay area, i was able to mount a cheap ol' rosewill 120mm fan in the level that it was and have perfect air flow. All in all, this case is perfect, unless you have the H110i like me, but the H100i fits perfect, which is taken from the NZXT webpage.",

Registered on the NZXT website and \"opened a ticket\" and have not heard back for a few days. Contacted them again still no answer. The case is nice, the power switch and USB headers work. I unplugged the fans and put them right into the Mobo and they work. The switch on top to controls the fans is just a useless decoration. Not happy with the lack of response from mfg.",

The inside of the case is very spacious and provides ample building space. The hard drive cases provide support for both 3.5\" and 2.5\" drives. However, there is one fatal flaw for this case that involves cable routing. When routing cables through the back of the case behind the motherboard, the dampeners that line the holes VERY easily fall off, which can make for a very frustrating experience.",

(fans won't fit for water cooler inside case with ASUS Z170A). Overall, this is a slick tower case. Ah, one other minor thing, the rubber grommet openings pop out \"easily\" when you push cables thru it. Heck, glue those babies in guys.. I had this happen a few times.. :-)",

Few problems I had with the case: Tool less HDD pins stripped HDD holes and had to hard mount with screws Pre-cable management with multiple fan cables had to be cut and moved to better organize layout once fully put together. Use's extenders for fans which don't fit every MB. Cheap rubber for cable mangement holes that if you are not careful will come off when putting cables through.",

I have to be honest tho, when I say huge fans put out about as much noise as they do air to cool what's inside. The front bay door that covers the optical drives, is sleek looking, but although not difficult to open, is a bit of a pain to both open and close at times. I could see improvements being made in future models, but over all I'm pleased with this one",

The top panel doesn't go back together properly once it's taken off and the door to access the disc drive is terribly designed. You have to press harder than any other case I've ever seen, and it won't lock unless you press in one spot that's no bigger than my finger tip. The plexiglass panel on the side is nice, but both sides are surprisingly hard to line up for some reason. Rather disappointed with this case, likely won't buy another NZXT case for a while",

Expandability and future proof is a huge plus for me. Wire management and layout is perfect, you cannot go wrong with this case! I think that this product is a full tower not a mid-tower as it can house all the gaming needs you could possibly want.",

Only one of the fans is LED lit. I thought from the description that they all were, but it is just the top one. Still looks great.",
