      "text": "We have a 15lb terrier mix who has some health issues with her legs and it was recommended that she avoid stairs. So we purchased this ramp to help her get up and down off the sofa. I thought this ramp would be perfect but it has several flaws. First, the carpet is slippery preventing her from getting traction going up. After she slid back down a few times, she refused to use it. Second, the angle is very steep so she was scared to go down the ramp. I like the design and it was easy to put together. Unfortunately, due to the flaws its just not a functioning ramp for us so we'll continue looking for a replacement.",
