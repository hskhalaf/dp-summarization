I have a three year old and a six year old and in between climbing onto the step stool, trying to reach the knob for the water, using two hands for a standard soap pump...it\u2019s an ordeal. Now they can just wave their little hands under the dispenser and voila! It\u2019s easy to load with batteries, easy to fill up with soap (you\u2019ll need the foam soap specifically, or to dilute regular soap), and easy to use. the only (very) slight downside: it\u2019s quite loud when it dispenses soap. I might just get one for every bathroom in the house.",
