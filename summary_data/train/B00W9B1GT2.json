At times the camera will lose connection & it takes a while to load on your app. You can have it on your computer or ipad & phone. Also the motion detector can be a tough one to mess around with. If you have it too high every little detail will be detected, too low, you won\u2019t get notifications that your kids are moving lol . Other than that, i had it for over a year. I still use it& i like it. I would recommend to anyone who wants something temporary, not permanent",

I have had to reset it atleast 10 times already and it never wirelessly connects so I have to physically plug it into the router to connect and set it up all over again. Don\u2019t waste your time, it\u2019s not worth the hassle. I tried the cheap route and I got what I paid for.",
