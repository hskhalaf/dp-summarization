    "description": "Outdoor Interiors' mission is guided by providing innovative, space-saving designs using beautiful, sustainable hardwoods along with an exciting array of mixed materials. Utilizing high quality hardwoods, our unique styles and durability will make your patio the envy of the neighborhood. Eucalyptus is one of the fastest growing, dense Hardwoods prized for its strength, durability and weathering characteristics in all climates. Eucalyptus is naturally resistant to decay with handsome pinkish-brown tones and a straight, light wood grain similar to Teak. Eucalyptus will weather to a silvery finish over time unless treated 2-3 times a year with outdoor furniture oil. We recommend using a natural Linseed Oil or any Outdoor Hardwood or Teak oil for our Eucalyptus Furniture. The hardwood we use are plantation grown and very dense, with a luxurious straight grain and high oil content, similar to teak. It\u2019s excellent for outdoor furniture because of its strength, rich appearance and durability. We also recommend using furniture covers during the winter months in harsher climate zones. Outdoor Interiors is a FSC Certified manufacturer providing only plantation grown eucalyptus from well managed forests. All hardwood follows the C.O.C. Chain of Custody for managing timber from our forests through production to our factory. This stylish coffee table will find a home instantly on your deck or patio. Beautiful coffee table is made of durable Eucalyptus. Looks and performs like teak. Easily maintained with a once annual oil treatment. Wood is easily maintained with a once annual oil treatment.",
