It uses the tightness of the weave itself to block allergens whereas the LINENSPA uses a plastic \"goretex\" type membrane adhered to the fabric to block allergens.

First is the sound; the cover is quite noisy. Moving around, and getting in and out of bed creates a lot of noise. This is pretty annoying, bordering on intolerable. This is partly exacerbated by the fit of this cover. Our mattress is 13\" thick, and this cover fits loose and sloppy. The last issue is the heat. After we switched to this mattress cover, heat became an issue. It's not very breathable, and we now keep our summer weight comforter on year round. Overall, pretty disappointed with this mattress cover.",

I gave other features an average rating for now since I have no experience with it. I was able to install by myself with little problem and it seems comfortable enough.

I do highly recommend doing your best to make sure you get the air out of the bag before you zip it or you'll be laying on a balloon lol.",
