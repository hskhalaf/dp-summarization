I bought an Intel AC-9560 wireless card (requires CNVi) and it works extremely well in this board. Be aware that older BIOS (0605/0805) will not display any video if trying to boot with a Samsung 970 EVOPlus NVMe SSD. I had to remove it to be able to see BIOS/UEFI on boot. After updating to BIOS 1002 the card was recognized and I had video. Also note that this board only has four (4) SATA III ports. It was all I needed but has caught others by surprise.",

      "text": "This board was used in a build with an i5 9600K and 3000MHz DDR4. The RAM slots are very tight. Only one clip on each memory slot flips out to allow proper seating and removal of RAM. Also, there is no screw to seat into the case offset on the upper corner of the board nearest the RAM slots. This can make inserting RAM difficult as the board will bend and damage if you aren't careful.",

There is only one this that is worry sum and that since this is an atx mother board it only has six instead of the usual 8 screws holes that others come with. Also, it has an rgb strip built into the board that from my knowledge is unprogramable and is set to an orange color, good for an orange build. One last thing is when I was building I had trouble getting the motherboard to fit inside of the NZXT H500i case, I eventually managed to get it in just took a lot of work.",

Returned it then I got the Prime z390-A which worked immediately with my 32 GB of RAM and made it easier to overclock in BIOS with AI OC for only $40 dollars more. If you got this or if you are planning to get this; get the z390-A instead.",
