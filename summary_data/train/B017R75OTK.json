Now you might as well purchase Milk of Magnesia, you\u2019ll get better results. Cannot believe they\u2019re charging the same damn price after they took out Germanium. Extremely INEFFECTIVE product now. I will be a customer again if and when they add Germanium back to the ingredient list. Such a shame, this used to be an incredible product.",

Day one I took 4, day two I took 5, then days 3 and 4 I took 6 each day. 21 capsules total and nothing. Absolutely nothing at all. Not even a gurgle. It may work for you, I, however, am deeply disappointed.",
