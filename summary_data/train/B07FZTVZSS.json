I had trouble releasing the ratchet, but that was my fault because I never use ratchet straps for anything and YouTube was not helpful. The manufacturer responded to an email right away and they were very helpful. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing additional accessories offered by this company. Only issue we had was two kids with varying heights and abilities, you kind of have to chose which kid is going to use it most. Not a problem if you take down regularly, but I left it up for months.",
