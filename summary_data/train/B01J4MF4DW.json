      "text": "These socks are overall great! Got them to use towards the end of my pregnancy when my feet started swelling. One improvement that I think could be made would be to have extra tightening panels around the arch of the foot to help with compression, as right now the bulk of compression comes from the tight panels from above the ankle up to the calf. Maybe for other people that doesn\u2019t matter so much, but I tried another pair of compression socks that actually had that panel and prefer them over these because of that. Good quality sock though, still happy with my purchase and they definitely help!",

It's easy to get them on, a bit more difficult to get off an end of day sweaty foot. But the Stamina holds up nicely, no tearing, no holes, and best of all they're not quitters. The copper toe, sold at Wally World, tear easy, the heel breaks out, they're very difficult to put on and even more difficult to pull off. I'd would recommend not purchasing the copper toe/heel for any reason. That said, I'm very happy with the overall performance of the Stamina product.",

Needless to say, the 9 hour flight, plus all the hiking in the airports left me with some issues. I went back to using the socks when I got home and then ordered another pair right away. They gave me amazing and quick relief for circulation and muscle support until the swelling went down. I regret that I didn't have the foresight to use them ahead of time but at least they have proven their value to help me recover. Buy them! Use them and don't travel without them!",

Compression wise, these are not as strong as other brands I own at the same compression level. They do, however, look like the day I purchased them, whereas the other brands are showing wear, even though they have been worn the same number of times.",

Overall the material was fantastic, elastic, and kept shape after multiple uses. These are great socks for anyone that doesn't want to wear the standard white compression stockings. I would buy these again if they were a bit longer. These socks would become annoying working out or running, because you would have to stop to correct the issue with pulling them back up.",
