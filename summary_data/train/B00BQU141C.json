This most recent one lasted from early 2016 to late 2017 - about a year and a half. The sad part is, when it works, this is a fine little printer. Until the printer jams (usually from trying to print duplex) and removing the jammed page tears the roller. Same thing happened both times. In the attached photos, the top roller should be entirely black, not showing orange udner the torn surface. IF THIS HAPPENS - NEVER REMOVE A JAMMED DUPLEX PRINT BY REMOVING THE TONER AND PULLING IT BACKWARDS - You are much more likely to ruin things this way.",

With all 4 toner colors lying parallel to each other its a little larger than a normal printer but not excessive.

I printed a photograph, but it lacked the vibrance that I expected. I then checked the settings and realized that there are options which might had corrected this issue. So I made the adjustments and then printed more photographs and every one was beyond my expectations. For a small office or home, this is an ideal printer.",

It\u2019s disappointing that the Brother doesn\u2019t stand behind the quality of their product.

The black barely prints any pages before it says the cartridge is empty. Once you replace it, the sensor doesn\u2019t register or something therefore thinks the cartridge is still empty. Finally figured that issue out, but since then it has never printed right. Everything prints is light black ink if at all. This was not a cheap printer and up until now I thought Brother was a good brand-boy was I wrong. Please DO NOT waste your money!!!",

When setting up for wireless, you do have to use the USB cable to connect your printer to your device (a laptop, etc.) but pick setting up wireless as the option. Afterwards you will be set up as wireless and can remove the cable. The cartridges that it comes with don't last long but the replacements do. I have so far printed 500 pages and they look great and print so fast. So much better than my inkjet compared to quality and speed!.

This is a known problem with that model HP printer which is NOT easily resolved by software or firmware, and thus the unit had to returned for a full refund... so, stay away from that printer!
