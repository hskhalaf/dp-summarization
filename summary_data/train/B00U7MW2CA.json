It is quite powerful, but at the same time it's also more complicated to clean than my old cheap mixer, because it has detachable parts. If you only need to mix a pint or so of liquid, then you should settle for a cheap mixer from Sears. If you want to mix big pots of soup every day, then Bamix is probably worth the investment.",

Making smoothies using this together with the Bamix Immersion Blender Beaker is a snap, and so easy to clean up. The one downside I've found is how hard it is to get the blender blades off. I use a thick dishtowel because as hard as one has to pull on those tiny blades, it's a recipe for slicing your finders or hand.",

The G200 has a longer shaft, but the stand was replaced with a wall-mounted holder, so you can't just place the stand on the counter top. The new unit has two speeds, which is better than the old one, but the former on-off rocker switch was replaced with two silicone-covered momentary switches. As a safety feature, you now have to continuously hold down one of the switches during use. This may add safety, but is a royal pain in the finger when you are mixing something for 5 minutes.",

We purchased the blender because we wanted to have the ability to make smoothy drinks, etc. without having to drag out the big machines. For the few things we have done it has worked very well. However, you really do need a tall cup/container because you will have splatter. :)",

    "title": "Bamix Pro-2 G200 Professional Series NSF Rated 200 Watt 2 Speed 3 Blade Immersion Hand Blender with Wall Bracket",
    "description": "This Professional Series Bamix model is handbuilt in Switzerland to last. Each unit is tested many times during production to ensure precise performance. With 2 speeds and 3 stainless steel blades that are easy to change, this hand blender is versatile enough to do countless kitchen tasks. The aerating blade is set at a slight angle for optimum performance to whip or beat liquids, even turning skim milk into a whipped topping. The blending blade mixes, purees and emulsifies thick or creamy mixtures so you can make homemade mayonnaise in seconds. The chopping blade dices raw and cooked fruits and vegetables; makes fruit ice creams, sorbets and smoothies; crushes ice and purees soups and sauces right in the pan on the stove. Optional grinder, powder disk and food processor attachments are available. The precision balanced AC motor reduces vibration to ensure quiet operation and give optimum power at all times. This also makes the 200 watt Bamix extremely energy efficient with unsurpassed power while using less energy. This model is NSF commercial certified. The body housing made of PA6 safety rated nylon is odor resistant, grease repellent and is sealed keeping the motor free from exposure to moisture so the 7.4 inch shaft can be totally immersed even in boiling liquids. The shaft is made of chromated brass which makes it strong, durable and heat resistant. The open mixing head design creates rotating currents to draw food in and down to the blades for more thorough processing. This lets you mix faster and more efficiently. You can use the bamix in pans, pots, high containers, tall glasses and beakers. Easy to clean up by rinsing under running water.",
