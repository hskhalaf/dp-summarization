Even touching an oven rack directly to change heights is not a problem for these gloves. Just be aware these are not intended for prolonged contact although I have been able to easily hold hot pans for over a minute without feeling uncomfortable heat. One more word of caution - these are not intended, and will not protect against wet heat - hot water, oil, or grease. When used as intended these are perfect and very durable. The only downside is that they are difficult to clean if they get dirty with oil or greasy food.",

After the dinner was over, he could handle the sterno containers to extinguish them with ease. We ordered a pair as soon as we got home from the dinner. They are THAT good.",

I would've given them 5 stars if they were bigger-- they're really tight on me, almost too small to fit. They do stretch out a little bit but not nearly enough.

      "text": "Bought these to use loading wood in the fireplace & when cooking with very high heat on my Big Green Egg. Not much more expensive than welding gloves and can be used in the kitchen as well. They are very effective. My charcoal grill can get well over 700 degrees. When it's that hot it's very difficult to flip a steak because you can't get your hands near the fire. These gloves solve the problem very well.",

Lets just say that I ended up with a 2nd degree burn on my left palm. Now since I got these gloves, getting the pan out is very easy and safe. Thanks for a great product.",
