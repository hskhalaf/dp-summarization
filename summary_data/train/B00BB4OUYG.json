      "text": "Over the past 55 years of making Chinese food, I've always owned whatever sort of cleaver I could find on the shelf of a shop in Chinatown. This Shibazizuo knife is in the same class as high-end chef's knives from the best and most expensive European manufacturers. It's wonderfully thin and allows slicing finer than I've ever achieved without using a mandoline. I think I'll take the trouble to learn how to apply the final honing which will preserve its factory edge. One of the best knives I have ever owned, but far from the most expensive.",

Chopping potatos and taro feel as easy as cutting tofu while getting them off the blade is annoying. The vegetables seem like adhesive to the blade like fouling organisms. Even my plastic cutting board is a bit adhesive to the knife that lifting the knife from the board is laboursome. At first I wanted to return it, but I decided to give it a try for it's sharpness. Now I'm pretty used to it. Definitely a nice knife, especially for chopping, dicing, shredding and cutting small bone.",

To me, Chinese chef-knife is easier to use as its larger surface allows you to easily scoop up the chopped food and it's also more \"finger-friendly\" (if you know how to properly hold the food with your other hand). I've been using Chinese chef-knife for more than 12 years and never ever cut myself. Plus it's lighter than it looks like, worth a try!",

Unfortunately when it arrived, it was delivered with lotions and shampoos, and the knive was out of it's own packaging just floating around in the box. And on further inspection, the knife is DENTED at the tip. With that said, basic chopping is fine. Wielding the knife is nice so far, but it's hard to chop anything tip first like a cabbage or lettuce head. I'm bummed with how it came.",
