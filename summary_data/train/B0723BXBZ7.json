We didn't know the blocks come in different sizes. These were very small and difficult for our 2 year old to handle. Luckily we have 5 year old that was more than willing to keep them. What we thought we were getting is called \"PlusPlus Big\". Hopefully this helps someone else from mistakingly ordering the wrong size.",

They look like little puzzle pieces and you can connect them together to make pretty much whatever you can think or dream of. If your child likes to build stuff with LEGO\u2019s, then I think her or she will like to play with these plus plus blocks. These do require good fine motor skills as they are a little smaller like legos. I would say the age range for these would be 5 years old and up. And have a kid with a active imagination that loves to build.",
