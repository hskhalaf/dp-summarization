I received the run around from the seller and manufacturer when I called to ask about their warranty. There is no warranty past 15 days.

I wanted it to match my cupboard wood but it's close enough that it looks nice. The chairs swivel nice and are very comfortable. The only thing I can say negative is that before ordering these you should carefully measure your width space. The seats on these stools are wide. My previous stools were more narrow. They fit ok but a tiny bit tight. Overall, they are gorgeous stools especially for the price! I would order again from this company.",

Someone else mentioned you see the bronze-colored screw heads after assembling them - that's true - again, not a problem for me. Some manufacturers of furniture have little plastic things you can put over the screw heads to hide them. You can see them on the picture if you look closely around the inside of the foot rest.",

The hardest part was screwing in the swivel part to the legs, because the hex-key provided was waaaay too big to use to fit in there. Unless you want to do a million quarter screws to get it in there, look for a smaller hex-key. Tip: Don't tighten the bottom legs until you finish attaching the swivel to the legs, otherwise it's a tight fit sliding it in. Despite my one complaint, the chairs look and feel great, don't wobble and the swivel action is smooth, so five stars it keeps!",

These are good quality, real-ish wood (MDF), fake leather, made in China stools. Easy to assemble in about 15-20 minutes each; follow the directions (tighten stuff in the right order). If they wobble, switch 2 adjacent legs and that should fix the issue. I really like the look of these stools, stain quality is good. All bolts lined up flawlessly (over 150 bolts in 6 chairs). They are very comfortable and the perfect bar height. I recommend this product.",

      "text": "Love these counter Stools. They are actually made in Vietnam! Go figure. They are well made, very sturdy, easy to assemble, heavy construction, beautiful color and comfortable. I bought them for a kitchen renovation that will begin in a month. I already put the 4 stools together and they are really NICE! I went for the padded back and seat for a level of comfort. The color of both cushion and wood is what I wanted. The swivel mechanism is well made and strong as well. The swivel is smooth as ice and sturdy. No wobble at all. This review is written at the very beginning of using the stools.",

Some boxes did not come wit instructions so watch video in the listing. However realized instruction book has better instructions. The chairs had an odor coming out of the box so recommend wiping them down prior to use and perhaps letting them air out in the garage prior to putting them in your home. Eventually the smell resolved. Similar chairs at Costco we\u2019re about 2.5 times more! So great price for bonded leather chairs. Will see how long they will last.",

It only took about an hour to do all three. Once you have them together they look way more expensive than they are. They are very sturdy and feel as if they should last quite a while.
