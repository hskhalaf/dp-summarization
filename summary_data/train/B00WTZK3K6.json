The Keds fit is fine (I usually take an 8 1/2 C or 9 B shoe depending on the fit), and the interior is cushioned. The shoes look like they belong in a ballpark with their bright white leather and red thread baseball stitching. They even smell like a leather baseball! Thanks, Keds, for designing a fun accessory and brightening a rather bleak baseball season with the hope of wearing these shoes to a 2020 game.",

The brown leather base patches on the heel and tongue are cute. Love that the shoes come with a second pair of laces in soft cloth (not leather or rawhide) \u201cbaseball glove\u201d brown.
