      "text": "We've been using this laptop for about a month now and overall are pretty pleased. It is very lightweight, portable, and fast; everything a college student needs. However for the last two weeks, 2-3 times a day the screen fills with lines and is unreadable. It usually clears up after a few seconds, but it is very annoying. I'm worried about a potential hardware issue that will keep getting worse. Is anyone else having this issue?",

(Extensive software updates upon receiving it and Microsoft updates regularly). We've owned the computer just over a month. We will see how it survives college.

You have to hit the keys very hard and directly in the middle. I have developed tingling and pain in my wrists and hands after over 2 weeks of trying to type this way and caved and ordered an external keyboard to plug in - making a lightweight laptop pointless. So unhappy and regretting this purchase. Hoping I can send this in to Acer to be fixed once I return to the US.",

It wasn't cracked or scratched, but simply didn't turn on. It eventually blinked a few disconnected pixels here and there, but that was all. I turned it off and started the return process to Amazon immediately. What I was really frustrated with was that the laptop didn't come in its original package and was shipped from \"Woot Returns\". Moreover, UPS' package had signs of relabeling so I suspect I got a refurbished item, despite nowhere in the description it says it's a refurbished/returned product.",
