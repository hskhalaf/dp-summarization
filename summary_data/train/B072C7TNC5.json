Only thing I would like to improve would be the vertical size, to get it up to 1280 pixels vertically. Awesome beast! Some older games don't support it full screen, but that's to be expected.",

After you troubleshoot it and it does work, it really is an amazing experience. Tip for frozen screen (works 50% of the time without unplugging): click the power button once, click down, and click the power button once more. Even if you can\u2019t see it the menu is still there and you can shut it off and on. Again, only works sometimes. Other times even the menu is defective.",

At first the resolution bugged me a bit but you get used to it and you start to look passed that and really enjoy the monitor. I use it for gaming in it is absolutely worth it! Some games I have to run at a 21:9 ratio (regular ultrawide) like PUBG or AC: Black Flag but it's still a great monitor to have. Hardly any screen tearing and HDR is amazing. Running on an i3-8350k/GTX1080 combo. Most games run over 100fps for me.",

Well, of course it is a 1080 display so to be expected, but not one person in the many that have come to see this thing has ever complained that the icons are pixelated.. Have used for about a month now and still in awe of the overall scope of this monitor. Highly recommend for anyone looking for more monitor real estate, gaming, etc.",

I don't really do any gaming, but I love the extended desktop area for multiple open windows without having to deal with a multi-monitor setup any more. I'd rate the monitor quality 5/5. The image quality is very good, and the smooth appearance of the back are great for setups where the back of the monitor will be seen. I only dinged it a star for the monitor stand, which isn't really able to adjust as high as I would like. I can fix this with an aftermarket stand of course, but I wouldn't have needed to if it were just taller. Overall I would buy it again.",

There was constant screen tearing, to the point you could only browse the web and not play anything cpu or gpu intensive. Even with the freesync on and other settings changed to fix the screen tear, nothing really worked, vsync neither. This monitor is good if you have a 1080ti+ if u want to game with, because anything below it will lag alot and screen tear with high gpu usage because of the sheer size of the monitor.",
