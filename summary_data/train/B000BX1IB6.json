I know Fiskars as a quality brand, so I read many reviews before choosing this model 9146 and I am thrilled with my choice. Many models apparently have a wide handle spread; this model is absolutely perfect. A lightweight unit with perfect handle spread so I can get underneath those pesky box elder growths with ease. These don't have the fancing gearing, but they don't need it. For anyone wanting a lightweight power cutter, this is the one!",

I was worried this lopper would not be powerful enough to cut them, but it was more than adequate. It took me just a few seconds to quickly cut through the overgrowing bamboo. The length of the handles is great for providing strong leverage. I really didn't have to apply that much force. Overall, am happy with this purchase and quality of product.",

I am a tight wad for sure, however we are hard on our gardening tools (We have 16 30x60 gardens) and are always willing to spend that little extra on any Fiskars brand as they truly are worth the extra cash every time. These loppers work fantastic, not necessarily used in the garden but we use them quite often with 45acres of trees and trails threw out. I would suggest these to anyone looking for a quality set of loppers.",
