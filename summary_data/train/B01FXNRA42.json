      "text": "Great little tent for changing clothes, showering or using as a privy tent with a camping toilet. BUT . . . The instruction pamphlet clearly states that there is a hole in the mesh roof for a shower hose to feed through. Mine has no hole. Not a huge deal, but I didn't expect to have to cut my own hole and superglue mesh threads to keep it from unraveling. Another thing that I've come to expect over the years - the so called \"stakes\" are a joke. 6\" long heavy wire coat hanger better describes them. Invest in some real stakes so you don't have to chase the tent across the campgrounds as everyone laughs at you.",

The tent survived really intense wind, but we did have to take it down eventually when the storm wasn't letting up. It definitely exceeded my expectations though. The top part of the tent got torn in all the hubbub of dealing with the storm. It was not at all an issue with the product, just an accident. I emailed WolfWise to ask if I could purchase a new top, and they sent me a replacement, no questions asked. What a wonderful company! I am so pleased--and would recommend to anyone.",

Now as for the zippers, they are definitely not the most durable, so you'll need to be mindful when opening and closing the tent to avoid pulling them off. One other oddity was that the zippers on the windows are only able to be open from the interior. Overall, this product met my needs as an addition to my camping supplies.",

Reality is the seam that holds the cloth to the tent was held by a single set of stitches, so when it became windy they loosened immediately. They need to improve the stitching on the tent to withhold some level of windy. I don't expect high gusts, but minor wind should be tolerated and multiple stitching across the seams would have done the trick. Otherwise it is a great tent, easy to fold, easy to set up, easy to use - too bad the little details were not taken into consideration.",

It pops up in seconds, and folding it becomes so simple once you get the steps on the image. One of my favorite items for my car.",

Lets just say it was a humbling experience.",

With this privacy tent you can use the restroom anywhere. We tied it down near Yellowstone when winds were high and it stood firm without moving. It has proper ventilation and no smell. I have also used this tent as a sun shelter from the heat when watching my boyfriend go fishing. Just roll up the front entrance and put a chair inside and you are protected from the sun. I would absolutely recommend Wofwise pop up tent.",
