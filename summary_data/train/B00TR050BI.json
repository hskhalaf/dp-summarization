The external construction is rock solid, I highly doubt they would break if you dropped one. Unless OCZ screws up, I will continue to buy these.

There are some changes with my lap top since having this hard drive installed such as it is no longer touch screen and tends to be a little slower. I am not sure if it is just the settings on the computer that have been changed or the hard drive that changed it. I know that sounds silly but the computer at least works now and doesn't crash constantly! So I am happy",

I actually had initiated a return process after 3 weeks of my PC trying to repair the SSD every other time I would boot up. After checking the drive for failures and errors, it appeared the drive was it good working order. Hmmmm, now what Batman? Turns out that my mbr was corrupt. So after I fixed the mbr from the command line, no more problems with the OCZ 180 SSD after 4 months of!",
