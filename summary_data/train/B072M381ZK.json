My son had a cheaper guard from Revgear and he can barely move his lips with those and there's barely any forming around the teeth with his.

The inner lining is easily bitten through and snaps and grinds off so be careful not to inhale it and choke. I recommend spending a bit more and getting the Venum predator instead if you want a longer lasting product, but if you only need a few uses this should be good.",

I work in Medicine and now that this is a much easier and cheaper solution then going to the dentist and having one made for a lot more $$$$.",
