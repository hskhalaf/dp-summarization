Given she already has a pair of Tiempo Legend V in a smaller size, they fit as expected. She likes the softness of the kangaroo leather versus synthetic or calf-leather shoes, as it gives more stretch. EDIT: She likes these shoes so much, I bought another pair a full-size up so she can grow into those, too.",

I'll need a few days to break them in, so I suggest practicing in them before a real game or use thicker socks/moleskin for the first couple times. Check out the other reviews on Amazon for this cleat, they were helpful to me. Repeat, COMFORTABLE :) Satisfied customer :) Thanks!",
