I have used this to get me through much of last year. I used the individual packs for use during a marathon at about mile 17. It really helped me get through the full 26.2 - 2nd in my class. Way better than dropping out because of pain! The only draw back is if it gets from your hands to your face and mouth, it tastes really really bad for a long time.",
