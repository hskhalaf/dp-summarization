Our dogs love the secure feeling of their open door bed-crate for a nap, while being able to roam in a larger area for eating and using pee pee pads when we are gone for short periods of time. I say \"crate\" and they happily jump right in for nap-time. If you have to leave your dog for work, it is a much better set up than putting them in just the small crate-carrier-cage situation without food water or a way to go potty.",
