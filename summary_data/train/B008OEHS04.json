The waviness of the keyboard (there's probably a more technical word, but oh well) is not as extreme as some others I've seen, such as Logitech. I didn't need a keyboard that looked like a tumor was growing in it, so thankfully this Sculpt Comfort has a curvature to it without going overboard. The keys have a soft click to them and the keystrokes are very even as opposed to the down-or-up chiclet keyboards on laptops and most cheap keyboards. I'm happy with this unit and hopefully it'll last me many years",

When all of the keys started sticking, I looked for a replacement. One professional review about this Microsoft Sculpt keyboard said it negatively was the La-Z-Boy of keyboards... too mushy, etc. However, I've owned a La-Z-Boy at home for over 30 years and I love it :) So after a few months now with this Microsoft keyboard, I can highly recommend it. Indeed there is limited key travel, but very comfortable. The extra-soft palm rest is especially nice, compared to others. So go to a computer/office supply store and try this one out before buying another.",

THIS IS GOOD. Having legs in the back tilts the keyboard up in the back, so you must bend your wrists. Tilting the keyboard in the front allows typing with straight wrists. First keyboard I've seen this way. I tried it both ways, legs out, and legs in. Legs out seemed to be a bit wierd at first. However, after switching back and forth during the first day, legs out won hands down. Much more comfortable way for me to type",

This keyboard is a smaller and has an improved space bar. But the palm rest is quite in adequate in size, keys are not quite responsive and the biggest downside is the function keys are smaller and harder to press and have a manual toggle switch between function keys and special functions. If Microsoft can make the palm rest a bit larger, add some more travel to the keys, make it a bit more responsive/clicky, improve the function keys and restore the back height adjustment, it will be great.",
