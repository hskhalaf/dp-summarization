It's a memory hog - every photo shot is very large, making it hard and clunky to work with on regular computers and amateur softwares - the auto focus is not nearly as fast either... Only moderately user friendly. I'll be looking for something else before long sorry to say.",

It did recognize the second one and takes great pictures.",

My favorite features are the automatic micro-focus and the anti-shake features which are great for shooting small earrings. Together they pick up all the details and I don't need a tripod. I also like the white balance feature because it allows me to take photos indoors without worrying about the \"orange glow\" that's so prominent under incandescent lighting. I really don't have any complaints so far. Surprisingly, I'm pretty thrilled!",

    "description": "Color:Blue| Style:Body OnlyPowerShot ELPH 115 IS is equipped with a powerful 8x Optical Zoom with 28mm Wide-Angle lens and the 16.0 Megapixel sensor with DIGIC 4 Image Processor deliver sharp resolution and beautifully accurate color. Smart AUTO makes high quality easy in any situation by choosing optimal camera settings perfect for 32 recognized scenes.

Focal Length: 5 - 40 mm.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\nCAPTURE MOMENTS WITH SOPHISTICATION\nThis is an ELPH you'll want in your pocket every day: easy to use and sleekly stylish, the PowerShot ELPH 115 IS is equipped to turn any moment into a high-quality image. The bright, powerful 8x Optical Zoom with 28mm Wide-Angle lens takes you up close for detail and out wide for group shots, while the 16.0 Megapixel sensor and DIGIC 4 Image Processor deliver sharp resolution and beautifully accurate color. And now you'll shoot longer thanks to the new ECO Mode, which reduces power consumption. Smart AUTO makes high quality easy in any situation by choosing optimal camera settings perfect for 32 recognized scenes. Your memories live on in sharp, true-to-life 720p HD video, and recording starts with a simple push of a button. Intelligent IS eliminates blur by automatically choosing image stabilization that's right for the shooting situation.\n\nGIVE IMAGES A WHOLE NEW PERSPECTIVE\n8X OPTICAL ZOOM WITH 28MM WIDE-ANGLE LENS\nThe PowerShot ELPH 115 IS features a powerful Genuine Canon 8x Zoom Lens that delivers outstanding optical performance and versatility. Fitting a high-performance lens with such wide zoom range into a camera so thin would normally be considered an impossible feat but Canon's expert optical engineering met the challenge, developing a lens that achieves outstanding compactness with high zoom power and superb performance. The zoom starts at 28mm wide-angle and extends to 224mm telephoto (35mm equivalent), covering an exceptionally wide range. The telephoto reach gives you the freedom to capture subjects from a considerable distance, while the 28mm wide-angle makes it easy to shoot sweeping landscapes, large groups of people and tall buildings.\n\nHIGH RESOLUTION, HIGHLY ADVANCED PERFORMANCE\n16.0 MEGAPIXEL SENSOR\nWith the camera's 16.0 Megapixels of resolution, your images are rich and clear, with textures and tiny details faithfully reproduced even at the long end of the big 8x Optical Zoom. This high level of resolution is ideal for creating the largest prints, and allows you the flexibility to blow up and crop any section of an image to express your creativity. The DIGIC 4 Image Processor powers the camera's advanced systems and features, ensuring fast, reliable performance with low battery consumption.\n\nDIGIC 4 IMAGE PROCESSOR\nCanon DIGIC Image Processors have set the standard for functionality and performance since their groundbreaking introduction in 1999. With each successive generation, DIGIC processors have brought elevated performance and powerful new features to PowerShot digital cameras. The DIGIC 4 Image Processor has ushered in a new level of picture quality and accelerated processing, making possible features such as high-speed continuous shooting, HD video and Face Detection Self-timer.\n\nA SMARTER CAMERA MEANS BETTER PHOTOS\nSMART AUTO\nPhotographers of all levels appreciate a camera \u2013 especially a go-anywhere compact digital \u2013 that takes the hassle out of capturing beautiful images. The PowerShot ELPH 115 IS digital camera gives you Smart AUTO \u2013 sophisticated Canon technology that makes getting that great shot as simple as pressing the shutter button. Smart AUTO automatically detects scenes by assessing various factors in both the background and the subject. Detected scenes are analyzed using 32 predefined shooting situations. The camera then makes optimal settings to ensure the best possible image capture when shooting still images. Smart AUTO also includes Advanced Subject Detection, which allows the camera to detect and track non-human moving subjects like animals and vehicles. With Smart AUTO, all you have to do is frame your shot and capture away.\n\nSHOOTING MODES/SPECIAL SCENE MODES\nSmart AUTO The camera automatically selects the best shooting settings for optimal quality based on subjects and environmental factors to provide point-and-shoot simplicity. Program The camera automatically and intelligently selects the aperture/shutter speed combination based on the shooting conditions. Portrait Brings the subject into focus while beautifully blurring the background. Smart Shutter The camera automatically takes the photo when people smile, wink, or get into frame. Low Light For high quality image capture in an amazing range of dimly lit situations. Fisheye Effect Now you can get the fisheye effect \u2013 a classic photographic distortion \u2013 without a fisheye lens. Miniature Effect Give images a miniature look with an effect that emphasizes perspective by blurring the top and bottom of the image. Toy Camera Effect Simulates photos taken with \"toy\" or pinhole cameras, darkening the image at the edges to create a vignette effect. Monochrome Choose from three single-tone effects: Black-and-White, Sepia, or Blue. Super Vivid Super Vivid intensifies existing hues, saturating the scene with bright colors. Poster Effect Poster Effect combines several similar shades into one color, turning subtle gradations into eye-catching, scene-popping contrasts. Color Accent Choose to retain a single color in your image while other colors turn monochrome. Color Swap Select a color and replace it with a color you specify for special effects. Snow Shoot clear snow scenes without darkened subjects or an unnatural bluish tint. Fireworks Create brilliant images of skyrocketing fireworks. Long Shutter Use to blur moving subjects for artistic effect, ideal for urban night photography. Stitch Assist Easy-to-use guidelines simplify the shooting of aligned multiple frames that can later be combined (using bundled software) to create panoramic photos. Movie Record video; unwanted scenes can be deleted in playback mode. GORGEOUS HD VIDEO FROM YOUR STILL CAMERA\nSHOOT BRILLIANT 720P HD VIDEO\nYou can shoot high definition video anytime, anywhere, with the pocket-sized PowerShot ELPH 115 IS. With a simple push of the dedicated movie button, you'll be able to instantly record every moment in motion. 720p HD video is smooth, vivid, and beautifully lifelike, making it an ideal way to capture special memories. In addition to being able to shoot 720p HD video at 25 frames per second, the PowerShot ELPH 115 IS can also shoot 640 x 480 VGA video at 30* frames per second.\n\n*Actual frame rate is 29.97 fps.\n\nDEDICATED MOVIE BUTTON FOR EASY VIDEO CAPTURE\nIt's never been easier to shoot videos with a PowerShot digital camera. To make shooting video as natural as snapping pictures, the PowerShot ELPH 115 IS has a dedicated movie button. No need to plan ahead, no need to search through menus on the LCD screen; when you feel a moment would be best captured in 720p HD, simply press the button and recording begins. The camera is always ready to shoot stills or video whenever you want.\n\nA STEADY IMAGE IS A BEAUTIFUL IMAGE\nINTELLIGENT IS AUTOMATICALLY CHOOSES FROM SIX DIFFERENT MODES TO OPTIMIZE IMAGE STABILIZATION FOR THE SHOOTING CONDITION\nIt's easy to capture clear, steady images with the PowerShot ELPH 115 IS, even in low light without using a tripod. That's because the camera is equipped with Canon's innovative Intelligent IS. The system analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation \u2013 allowing you to focus on framing and capturing your shot. For stills, the system automatically selects among Normal, Panning, Macro (Hybrid) and Tripod IS modes. When shooting video, the system automatically selects among Dynamic, Powered, Macro and Tripod IS modes.\n\nNormal Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills. Panning Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement. Macro (Hybrid) Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting. Dynamic Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking. Powered Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified. Tripod When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed. A CHARGE THAT LASTS AS LONG AS A MEMORY\nNEW ECO MODE HELPS REDUCE POWER CONSUMPTION FOR LONGER BATTERY LIFE\nThe PowerShot ELPH 115 IS takes energy conservation to the next level with ECO Mode, which provides more shots per single charge through LCD monitor and camera power management. ECO Mode can be activated for easy power preservation when an outlet is unavailable or the moment is too exciting to put the camera down. ECO Mode quickly wakes the camera from sleep when a button is pressed so you won't miss the moment. When the fun with family and friends runs late into the evening, ECO Mode on the PowerShot ELPH 115 IS makes sure your camera keeps up.",
