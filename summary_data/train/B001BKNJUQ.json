Every penny spent is worth it. The scent is pleasant and not overpowering and you smell good for 24hrs. Highly highly recommend.",

It is a liquid so obviously it takes a bit to dry but other than that I love it. (I did also detox my armpits by using the Aztec Clay mask and a little ACV before I started using this and it definitely made a difference.)",
