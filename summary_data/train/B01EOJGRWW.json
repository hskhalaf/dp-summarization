Can also easily slide my ipad into one of the outside pockets for easy transport. The backpack feature makes it easy to haul it around once I arrive at the site. Have not yet packed it into my suitcase for any of my travels, but it seems as if it will fit into a large suitcase..........but certainly not in my carry on luggage : )",

One it arrived very quickly I put my drone remote and batteries as well as some tools and other accessories all comfortably in this case. Plenty of room and very secure. Great product for the price.

Mine fits the drone (props off), 8 props, a charger, two batteries (three if you set one under the drone), controller (plus range extender), a small box for memory cars and readers, and the prop protectors in the outside zipper pocket. Like I said, great for typical drone stuff. Once you add a bigger range extending antenna, iPad holder, more batteries, sun shade, laptop.... you'll need another bag. I have an phantom 3 standard. This product is great.",

It holds my Phantom 3 Standard and all accessories snugly; there is room for my drone, spare props, controller, battery charger, two batteries, a folding landing pad, and all the appropriate FAA paperwork. This is a must-have because you NEED something to secure this drone when you are moving it around, and I would highly recommend not using the box it came in, unless you'd like your drone to be stolen!",
