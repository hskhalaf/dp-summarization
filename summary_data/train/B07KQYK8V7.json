Is stapler checked off all those boxes and it works very good. I haven't tried to staple say like 10 pages together. But it is done a great job and seamlessly stapled two and three pages together. It comes with a few Staples but my wife had to go to the store and buy more. Very easy to load new Staples in it with a simple push of a button. I'm really glad that I found this stapler on Amazon and gave it a shot. If you're reading my review, I definitely recommend this stapler.",

This unit should be used for light duty work. I staple documents all day long, some of which can be very thick. I couldn't even get some of the papers in the slot. I finally gave it to someone in an office across the hall who's job doesn't require the stapling needs I have. Then I went online and bought a much more heavy duty unit that could handle the needs of my office.",

My complaints... (1) The shavings collection cup does not disconnect from the device so you have to bring trash can over to the sharpener and dump the whole think by tipping it over into the trash can or unplug and carry it over to the trash can; and (2) The power cord is very short , not reaching floor plug from table top or barely reaching wall plug and that's if it is placed directly near outlet, thus limiting options of where to place the sharpener.",

When it runs out, it runs out while the pages are held in place by the staple. It won't let go of my paper until I put in new batteries. If I'm out of batteries, I have to go buy them or order then and wait for them to be delivered to get my paper back!! Old review: I'd prefer that the staple were placed closer to the edges of the page, but it won't spit out a staple until the paper is pushed in all the way.",
