I was looking for a thicker option for a barbell pad as most of the ones I have encountered tend to allow the bar to dig into my neck area when loaded with heavier weights. This is a great way to prevent that from happening and I couldn't be happier with the purchase. The material quality is fantastic and I would imagine that it won't wear for quite some time. It holds snug to the bar and the stitching on the velcro has held well up so far.",

I haven't done more than about 250 on the squats but it was still comfortable at that weight. However, glute thrusts start to get painful at only 200 pounds or so, and very painful around 300. The pain is enough to ruin the set. Many women lift more than 200 pounds and men more than 400. The Glute Guy recommends these pads for Glute Thusts, in his \"Protecting Your Hips\": Airex Pad -- our gym uses this for the Nautilus Glute Drive Squat Sponge Hampton Thick Bar Pad I don't recommend this Dark Iron pad.",

I bought this with limited expectations as it was the cheapest one I could find, and I couldn\u2019t be more impressed! It is very high quality, fits a 2\u201d bar perfectly, and completely changed my squat game! It gives me so much support, which allows me to perfect my form, and allows for a deeper, more effective squat. The customer service from this company is phenomenal, and I will go to them for any items I may need in the future. I can\u2019t say enough good things about this product!",
