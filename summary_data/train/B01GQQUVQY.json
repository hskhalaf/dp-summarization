It is very light weight yet sturdy and comfortable to carry. Plenty of storage compartments for accessories, I carry my drone (with GoPro), controller, two batteries, charger, FPV monitor, props, some spares and tools. The only thing I couldn't fit was the sunshade for my FPV monitor (only because it is non-foldable and really bulky) for the shade I just added a small clip and attach it to the outside of the bag.",
