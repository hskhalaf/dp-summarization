Players can move as fast as they want without worrying about slipping because of the grippy outsole. The combination of these components delivers a reliable and comfortable athletic trainer.",

        "Almost all of the volleyball players have stated that wearing the Adidas CrazyFlight X 2.0 for long periods of practice or game did not hurt their feet",
        "The outsole is very grippy and prevented a majority of reviewers from slipping on polished floors",
        "Droves of athletes have claimed that this model allowed them to jump higher and each step felt more energized",
        "The ankle and heel support this pair of volleyball shoes provide impressed many users",
        "Several wearers commend the lightweight feel of the footgear because they seem to move faster"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "The durability of the footwear has dismayed a few individuals because the upper developed holes, the cushioning gave out, and the outsole lost traction after a few months of use",
        "This Adidas volleyball trainer offers no heel lockdown even when the laces are tied very tight, as mentioned by a couple of people"
