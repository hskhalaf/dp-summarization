However, I did get lucky with these headphones! They were at my price point and had good reviews from CNET. My only complaint is about the size of the buds themselves. The set comes with small, medium and large, and I chose the size that I use for other headphones, but they don't always stay in my ears properly. It's not a major problem as I only use them when sitting at my desk, but I wouldn't use these for walking or running if I were you.",

Noise canceling is excellent but the earbuds are bit uncomfortable to achieve such a tight seal. Giving this 4 stars instead of 3 because the attached mic is surprisingly good... better than the mic on my USB Logitech gaming headset. The button is pretty handy as well. 1 click to pause/play. 2 clicks to go to the next song. 3 clicks to go to the previous song. The build quality seems very solid but only time will tell. Overall a good pair of earbuds for working out. I just personally prefer Audio Technica earbuds.",

The Panasonic's are better value at everyday pricing, but these definitely sound better if you are listening to music and want broader tonal range.",

I constantly use them on travel and they're so much more compact than bringing the larger, over-the-ear headphones. Sound is very good to me (I'm not an audiophile, but they do have some rich bass in my opinion). Work very well on the plane to block out the noise. Nice that they come with different size ear-buds - the medium fit me just fine. Can also use them with your phone, as they have the microphone as well. Only drawback is that they don't have a volume control on them - but that's a minor quibble.",
