I did not like the hassle of figuring out which apps I could safely delete. This version has double the ROM and much more available space, a sharper stylus tip for greater precision, and introduces fingerprint unlocking.",

Trying to get help was fruitless. Almost changed carriers and had to buy another phone. Finally took a frieds advice and used a downloadable app to circumvent the problem. I was and still am greatly upset woth there lack of troubleshooting ability and concern. Supervisors did not return calls as promised. Been with Virgin mobile over 5 years and this shoddy customer dis- service will cause me to seek a better more responsive carrier once this phone needs replacing.",
