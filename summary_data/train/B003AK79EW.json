A little pricey but works awesome to keep all those embers from flying around. and having the ability to lift up half at a time to roast marshmallows or add logs was awesome. super easy to put together. I would say well worth the price.. Only one downside it rusts.. I would suggest getting some rustoleum high heat spray as the coating that comes on it if rained on will rust. But painting is no big deal. we will paint it before we use it again this summer",

However, the screen has warped in the ensuing heat, so not the appeasing curved dome. Looks like it\u2019s dented, but it\u2019s from the heat. Probably needed a thicker gage for screen material.

I have used the screen now for 12 months and as I suspected, the screen mesh is falling apart. It is definitely a light duty screen.

I highly suggest storing the unit in the garage, etc., when not in use. Note of Truth: I hate leaving reviews for everything I buy via Amazon.com. After constantly popping up on my app dozens of times, I reluctantly yielded and posted this review.",
