Although the shoe\u2019s weight and breathability is something that needs to be improved according to some testers, it does not diminish the fact that the Asics Gel Quantum Infinity is a shoe that needs to be added in a neutral runner\u2019s shoe arsenal.",
      "pros": [
        "The Gel Quantum Infinity is the first shoe from Asics to feature a visible full-length Gel technology midsole from heel to toe giving the shoe incredible comfort and flexibility",

        "Some runners applauded the fact the shoe is very lightweight",
        "Also liked by a few users is that the shoe fits snugly with an ample room in the toe-box",
        "It had been mentioned in some reviews that the shoe fits well even on users with wide feet"

      "cons": [
        "One of the testers said that his feet felt a little warm towards the end of the run",
        "A few reviews said that the shoe does not provide a substantial amount of energy return, especially when compared to running shoes like the Adidas Ultra Boost",
        "Also noted by a user is that the Gel Quantum Infinity is quite heavier than many running shoes of a similar type"

      "title": "Squeaky and uncomfortable tongue",
      "text": "Overall the shoe is comfortable and fits well, but it has two major flaws that caused me to send it back. The type of rubber used on the sole is super squeaky when walking on certain types of floors like hardwood. Also, the tongue is a strangely shaped piece of leather with no cushion which digs into your leg while you're walking. Not sure who thought that was a good design, but they must not have tested it out on enough people I couldn't walk more than a few paces without it feeling uncomfortable, not sure how anyone could stand to run long distances in these things. Back they go.",

Lastly the range of materials makes the shoe hard to clean and protect from dirt and debris.",
