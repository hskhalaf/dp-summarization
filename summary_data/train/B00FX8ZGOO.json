A month later one of the three remotes will no longer communicate at all (though it shows temps; new batteries in all did not help). Even from the beginning the communication was very spotty, a location that worked perfectly for days would just stop. I could deal with that, but now 2 of 4 devices failing is just ridiculous. It's a shame as it is a nice setup and design.",

Also, unlike some other models, batteries from all units do not have to be removed and replaced if the signal is lost from one of the transmitters. This replaced a 15-year-old weather station that finally failed; it was superior in one regard, which is that the display was easier to read from almost any angle.",

The colder it gets the more they are off. I tested these using highly accurate medical laboratory thermometers. I switched them around, changed batteries, etc, and the same result. I would not buy any Ambient weather instrument, based on the performance of this one.",

Both the console and remote sensors calibrated well out of the box against a test hygrometer. Despite several obstructions in the crawlspace (i.e. flexible ducts, PVC piping, etc,), the sensors work great and no transmission interference to the console has occurred. I am very pleased with the product to this point (about two weeks in use) and would highly recommend it to others.",
