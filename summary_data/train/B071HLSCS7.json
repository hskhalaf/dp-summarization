When I tried them on, I thought I may have ordered the wrong size by mistake. They actually felt like they were two sizes too small. I'll order them again in a larger size soon and hopefully be able to review them then. Because you have to provide a star rating, I'll just go with 3 for now as they were constructed well, looked really nice, were very light, and we're very price friendly. Looking forward to trying them out.",
