Both sets are starting to fail. I'll be pushing/holding the key, and it will just randomly stop reading the pressure/push. Great fun when you're dodging that lethal body shot,... and now you're dead. For a gaming PC, I'd expect a longer key push life than under a year. In fact, I'd expect it to be 3+ years. Of course, it waited for the warranty to expire before starting to fail. That's quite a bit of money to have to buy/use a secondary keyboard.",
