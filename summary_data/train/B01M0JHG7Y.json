Cyalume, as you may or may not know, is who provides chem lights for the military, so I bought some of theirs but saw a lot of very good reviews for this brand as well, so I thought I'd give them a shot! I tested them right along side of the Cyalumes, and they were every bit as good. I was amazed at how long they lasted--mine were still putting off a bit of light at the 24 hour mark! Great product and reasonably priced.",
