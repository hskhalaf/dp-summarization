I buy two of these cameras for work every 1-2 years I sent this in for service 3 weeks ago and Panasonic was going to call me back and never did, also they had no idea when I would get it or the status of the unit. The image quality is ok, slow at time to capture the image, poor low light capability. I was going to purchase a Panasonic mirrorless unit, but after this I think I'll look at another manufacturer. I have purchased 6 of these for my business and this was the last one.",

Then configure which services you want to send your photos. Then configure the camera to connect to the Lumixclub. The camera takes amazing photos. It has limited manual features which could be helpful. A really neat feature is the time lapse capabilities. I was able to do a really neat time-lapse of the clouds over Ko O'lina",

The photos (in all types of light) tend to be very blotchy and grainy when zoomed up. I like big prints so this just won't cut it. The focus on this camera is also finicky. If you're taking quick pictures you must slow down and ensure that focus has locked or you'll end up with a fuzzy photo. If you only view digital pics or prints smaller than 5x7, this camera will likely suit you well. If you like to go big and take action shots, look elsewhere.",

Pros: * great screen * great picture quality * very rugged The cons: * slow software. cycling through pictures or zooming in on them can take a long time (multiple seconds between button pushes and screen updates). this wasn't an issue on my DMC-TS4 (it's predecessor) * the wifi link software is lame... like most software hardware manufacturers write (with the exception of Apple).",

You can connect each of the two (camera and tablet or computer) to the internet and the issue goes away, but in that case there may be a data charge. Not good. Otherwise a nice camera.",
