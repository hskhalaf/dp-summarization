The lighting in the surrounding area (indoors and outdoors) influence how much green you see. It is very dark, but that also makes it very cool looking. My wife loves it. Super high quality band and brand. Hard to find a great looking green watch.......this is it.",

If you buy it from Watchsavings, it does NOT come with the manufacturer's warranty. If there is a problem, guess what? You have to send it to Brooklyn. Well I live on the West Coast so that isn't very practical. Want to send it back to them within 30 days? No problem! You pay the shipping cost back to them AND they take off an unknown amount for their shipping cost to you. Not such a great deal after all! :(",
