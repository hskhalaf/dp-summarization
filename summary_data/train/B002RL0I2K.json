Many admired the shoe for being lightweight and having a spacious interior, especially around the toe box.However, many users were dissatisfied with the quality and durability of the materials. The interior and exterior construction are incomparable to the quality Keen was known for. Disgruntled consumers were not happy with the price they have spent on the shoe. In conclusion, users are adviced to weigh the advantages and disadvantages.",

I've been hiking three times over mixed terrain and so far they've been very comfortable. They fit well in the heel with plenty of room in the toe box. goiong on steep up an down hills haven't produced any discomfort from toe jams or heel slippage. I also got them soaked from a stream crossing, and the Keens dried quickly and did not change the fit (some boots I've owned changed shape and fit after getting wet). So far after 20ish miles over challenging terrain, I've been very impressed.",

The material does break down after heavy use, but for the price you pay for these shoes, they are well worth it. I have owned 5 pairs in the last 6 years, so I hope that Keen will keep this design going. These are the most comfortable, rugged and nicest looking hiking shoes I've ever owned.",

Before I purchased them I tried on two very similar competing brands and I could instantly tell the Keens were more comfortable. After a full day of walking my feet were sore. I think they are a great shoe, just needed a half size larger.",

These are definitely IT - I wore them during an extended drive (total of ten hrs. over two days) and they were perfect - comfortable, and absolutely breathable. One of the worst problems to have when driving long distances is having your foot overheat, causing discomfort that can distract from driving. These Keens were perfect - oh, and by the way, they were quite comfortable on short (2-3 mile) hikes in the Smokies! Highly recommended. Sizing was spot-on, as well.",
