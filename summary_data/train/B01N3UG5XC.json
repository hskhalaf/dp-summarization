      "text": "Made a great ornament. Nice that you can re-roll if the handprint got messed up. One warning about the glaze though- if you glaze both sides the last side you glazed will drip to the other side and cause permanent damage because you can't rip off the excess piece of dried glaze without making a hole and damaging the clay. So my advice would be to glaze the front and leave the back unglazed or to glaze the back very very carefully ensuring none drips to the front.",

See photo for the dry clay on the counter compared to the moldable clay in my hand. I was able to use the other packet, so I guess this has a ratio of 1:4 are duds. I tried to add water but there was no saving that clay. The odd thing about was it was in a sealed package so maybe I just got an old one? Also, the tiny plastic letters are awful and not user friendly. Anyway, I would not recommend or purchase this kit.",

    "title": "Proud Baby Deluxe Clay Hand Print & Footprint Keepsake Kit - Glaze Finish - Letter Stamps - 4 Ribbons - 2 EASELS - Dries Stone Hard - No Bake - Air Drying (Makes 2 Plaques)",
    "description": "Size:Deluxe Kit - SingleDeluxe Clay Hanging Keepsake Kit - Makes 2 Keepsakes This kit includes 2 packages of soft, pliable air-drying clay. The non-toxic clay is safe and easy to use to capture those precious little hands, feet or paws. After you make the impressions, the clay dries into a hard and durable stone-like material in 3-5 days. The keepsake can be displayed as a holiday ornament on a tree, as a wall hanging, or displayed on a table-top easel. Recommended ages: About 0-2 years (if using the 4\" rings). Also use for pets. Kit Includes: Two bags of air-drying clay (makes 2 keepsakes of 4\" diameter, or 1 larger keepsake), 2 plastic cutting rings of 4\" diameter, letter stamps, glaze finish and brush, 2 black plastic easels, wooden rolling pin, plastic straw hole punch, four pieces of satin ribbon in pink, blue, red and green and Easy-to-follow instructions. [How to best dry the clay: It is rare, but the clay can crack if dried too quickly (most likely) and/or unevenly. When the clay cracks while drying, the surface and/or edges have dried much more quickly than the center. To prevent cracking, be sure the clay is rolled out evenly (not thinner on the edges, etc) and is as smooth on the surface as possible before making the print. Keep the clay covered with plastic or a damp cloth while waiting to make the print and for about the first 24 hours of drying, or until the clay surface becomes leathery hard. After that time periods is over, be sure uncover the clay so that it can continue to dry. Never allow the clay to dry in or near a direct heat source such as a heat vent or in direct sunlight. Overall, allow to dry in the coolest area of the home when possible.]",
