After a bunch of research and investigating features, I ended up trying it out to see if maybe it was improved or I would get a good apple from the bunch. I received it new in package as described, camera and monitor power on and charge and the sync was pretty easy. The camera seemed to sync automatically to the monitor and the Hubble app wasn't difficult [I did not do any of the updates]. So far so good, but I will keep using it and update if things go downhill in a couple of weeks/months.",

I would recommend you go with something more traditional. I have used this for one night and one day. Have had to pair the Device 4 times. I am purchasing something else.",

Couldn't hold a charge, wouldn't charge, would stop charging in the middle of the night & start beeping, waking up the whole house. Eventually the charging cord had to be in the perfect spot to even get a charge at all. We were literally building things to hold the charging cord so it would work.

The only time it actually worked is when it took us about 2 hours to figure out how to use the wi-fi on it in a hotel. I would not recommend this monitor system. I wish we had spent a little more money and got the one our friends have that actually works.",

The app that can be watched away from home is what sold me mostly and now I wish I had gone with just a basic monitor with excellent reviews. Also, the unit itself is too heavy to use one of those mounts that hang from the wall. I attempted and the camera itself fell twice. Hope this helps someone.",

The replacement process is slow and not at all customer friendly - and as we cannot hear our kids from their rooms without a monitor has left us having to change sleeping situations for weeks at a time ole we wait weeks for each replacement unit to arrive. Once this is out of warrranty we are done with Motorola.",

The bonus is that it's Wi-Fi so my husband can participate in bed time when he's out of town. We've had some problems lately with there being a poor connection on my cell phone and constant searching for signal. I'm hoping that a software update will help that because before this week - it's been great. The nigh vision is actually pretty good with decent detail. I mean - it's not military grade - but do you need that to sky on your baby?",
