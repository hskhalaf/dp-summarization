Very sturdy-much more than I thought it would be. It is exactly as measured, and the design is lovely-looks nice, not cheap. It is brassier than bronze- I\u2019ve attached a pic to show. I like it regardless. Fits reds, whites, and even champagne bottles we have (RSVP from TJs and a German variety), which no one mentioned but am happy to report (and use!). Very pleased with the purchase. What an attractive way to store wine.",
