I love the wheels on these suitcases - they roll very smoothly and can go over bumps in the road and sidewalks without getting stuck.

Some scratches on the exterior, which was to be expected. But zippers all held up and work great. They roll very easy, and the locks work great. For the price, I couldn\u2019t be happier.

As a testament, we needed to fly to the West Coast of the US from the East Coast; board the cruise ship; debark for another week's shore stay; AND THEN, fly home. During those 3+ weeks, this luggage survived 5 airline connections, the ship's embarkation and debarkation processes, and a significant drag from the spot the cruise line left us to a place where we could pick up our rental car. I believe this would equal about three normal trips, so I am confident in saying that this luggage is tough, well-constructed, and impossibly light. Thanks for a superior product.",

I was disappointed by the failure, but I am VERY pleased with their efforts to resolve the situation. This certainly makes me much more willing to support this company. The luggage itself is quite sturdy, and protected our belongs well. We've used cloth suitcases before, and this was our first hard-shell set. We're quite pleased overall.",

BUT,,,,, they are a pain to use. one side zips up and if you open it wrong side up,,, all the cloths come out. if it is heavy on one side when you close it, it gets a little off center and is a pain to zip up. I suppose if it is just to transport the cloths to a dresser it is ok. but if you are on a trip that you are living out of the suitcase,, do not buy them.",
