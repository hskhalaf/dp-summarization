They light the whole yard no problem. Nice wide beam with the floods and great distance with the spots, I did wire them together so the flood and spots are on together. They appear to be well constructed and look like they should be able to take the abuse. The only issue I had was the machining and fit of the supplied bracket and mounting block very tight fit and hard to get the bolts started, but that is all. We'll worth the $$$$.",

      "text": "The lights are bright and do their job, but the mounts could use a little tweaking. The block that you mount to the light is attached with an allen screw. If you tighten it down all the way it prevents complete rotation of the half moon swivel that rotates the light up and down. I ordered two of the 4\" work lights and two of the 6\" headlights. The 4\" were not as bad as the 6\" to get right. I wound up using a washer as a spacer between the block and the light so that I could get it tight. Very little instructions were included. As with most things, more money spent gets more quality control.",

It took some time to custom mount the thing but the performance is quite unreal. I took it out at night and it lit up my entire block. Needless to say...it's probably not street legal but this turns the night into day. It comes only with the light so you will have to buy a switch and relay. I've seen many other lights bars with less performance and for more money. The quality seems rugged and should hold up to the elements. I'm happy with this purchase.",

The light it's self is not all that big but holy cow it throws out some light.. I installed mine on a dirt bike last week and I could not be happier way way better then a trailtech or a factory style headlight. No switch included but there is enough wire to splice in, also the blue wire and red wire control the 2 halfs of the light , so I have high and low on a switch... great lil light will be buying more!!",

The only reason that i am giving a three star rating is the hot wire for my set of lights was the blue wire and not the red like anyone in there right mind would think it was.
