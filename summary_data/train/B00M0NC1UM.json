      "text": "Great little plant, but the green vines that protrude from the base are pretty stiff and can scratch the scales of your betta. My betta loves to chill on the leaves, or under them, by the base, and he sometimes gets scratches on his scales from swimming against them. The leaves are soft and look nice, but unfortunately, the green vines just don\u2019t do it for my betta. I tried cutting the vines, but the severed ends are also pretty scratchy, so I removed the decoration all together. Disappointed that I couldn\u2019t keep it in my tank.",

Upped it one star as soon as my betta stopped staring at it as if it was a foreign invader. He seems happy as a clam so far.",

I was also satisfied with the size, it may not be very tall but it is wide and has 12 very soft good sized leaves. Overall with some cutting it looks good.",
