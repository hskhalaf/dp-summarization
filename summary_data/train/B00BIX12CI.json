I purchased the 13 amp unit and also a 100 ft 12/3 20 amp cord for about $60 more bucks. Used it for about 1 hour right out of the box and flawlessly trimmed up my lawn. Very quiet & well balanced. The trim height adjustment is fantastic as well. It's super light and very agile around flower beds and trees. I'm happy i won't have to store gas anymore or pray that it starts. The proper power cord is essential.",

Improvements needed : 1) Inventory of what is supposed to be in the carton 2) Update the fig 1 illustration to match the Handle Bolts,now with saddles. 3) Instruct user to place the cord clips (one does show in the fig2 drawing 4) tell us what to do with the small bone shaped plastic part (some sort of latch?) 5) remind us to hook the edges of the catcher BAG over the wire bail",

I used an extension cord with a different amp number and it overheated and destroyed the motor. The company was very kind and sent me a free replacement in less than a week. Probably you should order the extension cord that Sun Jo sells with the machine. Don't make the mistake of buying the cheapest extension cord at Walmart, as I did.",

Used him approximately less than 10 times before the motor burned out (that was our best guess, judging by the smoke and smell). Really enjoyed him while he worked.

Only complaints are that the front lifts up when the bag gets half way full so I have to hold it down, also the blade got jammed in a really thick patch of long grass but I cleared the jam with ease. I got mine marked as \"used\" on Amazon for $86 but it was new with a damaged box. Totally worth it!",

It is light enough that she has no trouble moving it around or mowing the steep side of the raised driveway (six-ish feet high), and it does a bang-up job on the lawn. The mulch feature only works when the grass just needs an inch or two off the top. When we first moved in the grass was about four inches higher than it should be, and while the mower had no trouble cutting it, the mulching feature just didn't work.
