So glad I splurged and got him this one instead of one of the half price plastic ones. This is an exact replica of a real shopping cart. Perfect for his in house grocery store stand or for loading up in the car and taking to the grocery store with you. Will bring fun for years to come.",

The only thing that I would have liked, would be if they could have put silicone or foam bumpers on the bottom metal parts. I've read other comments that walls get banged up. I tried putting some foam protectors on myself, but my daughter ripped them all off like a game. It looks so cute with her play kitchen and she loves to play with it every day.",

With that said, there is nothing cuter than a toddler pushing his Elmo in a shopping cart and playing with his pretend grocery items. The Melissa and Doug brand is one you can trust for fun, rigorous, educational play. I spent a little more cash and am very proud of this excellent purchase!",
