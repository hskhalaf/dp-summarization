These KONY socks are the perfect mix of stretchiness and support that stay in place all day, regardless of how much walking you do. The dark navy blue color does not fade, and the fabric is smooth and comfortable, it doesn't \"pill\" in the wash. I'd buy these again (and probably will).",

Thank you Kony for making an excellent product!",
