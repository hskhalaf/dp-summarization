This case took only an hour or two to transfer everything except my cd/DVD drive into and had such nice airflow that the my rig is virtually silent 24/7 (even before updating my fan profiles on the required software.) Its so quiet that I've found myself checking the fans through the tempered glass window to make sure they're still spinning. Good case, lots of options for easy cable management too.",

Arrives well-packed with plenty of foam/plastic on glass to ensure a perfect appearance. Build went extremely smoothly, following the included step-by-step instructions. Plenty of cable management space, even for the final 2 SSDs and 3 hard drives (hey if you got'em layin around, use 'em!). LEDs from existing graphics card and case back-lighting is enough for me. Exceptional cooling airflows, even in the cabinet. (The GPU is the only real space heater.) Very pleased with purchase.",

I've been doing tons of research for my build and I can say that this case is BY FAR, the best case you can get for the value. The tool-free screws to remove the glass pane or the back-panel is a fantastic idea, just don't overtighten. I hear many complaints about the lack of CD/DVD drive bays, but let's be real... It's 2019. Discs are quickly becoming obsolete. You won't need one. Love that it comes with two fans already installed. Overall, not a single complaint.

There are 2 light strips pre installed and they look great. glass looks nice. everything about this case is super solid.",

That being said, I will definitely be getting this same case for when I build my dads PC.",

I have had no issues with the products I have installed and I have been running it for almost a year. The drivers are easy to install and it shows you all of your running stats on the NZXT app that pops up on my screen every time I turn on my PC. Fun and easy to edit LED lighting inside if you want it(includes every shade of color, basically), or simply turn off LED lighting. Needless to say, I highly recommend.",

First off, it has glass on the outside allowing you to see the led strips, fan lights, and any other rgb parts you have in your PC. Both the glass panel and other panel are easy to remove allowing you to clean it with ease. The case has plenty of room allowing you to install your computer parts without worry of messing the parts up. If I had to choose a pc case again, I would choose this one any day of the week.",

When my chair hits the case it leaves a sign that is hard to take off and I fell like the material of the outer case should be better.BUT this case is awesome in the cable management wise and I would recommend it or the newer case (h510) that should be releasing at the same price (it's sold at 69$)",
