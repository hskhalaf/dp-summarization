The wheels don't stick, the pedals are awkward, especially with the extenders. I wind up having to hunch down or use my foot to push my daughter around on the sidewalk. If she goes down a little slope, the thing immediately starts wobbling and looks like it's going to topple over. Terrible, terrible waste of money. I even put rubberized tape on the wheels and it still sucks. Save your hard earned money and buy a better trike!!",

All I do is hose it off and towel it down. I've not needed to tighten any screws or maintenance at all. It took my husband about 45 minutes to assemble it but that isn't because it's too terribly difficult to understand the directions. It's just that there are several steps and he's a perfectionist.",

Both my 2 and 4 year old were spinning their wheels on more than one occasion. We just ended up going to our local big box store and buying a Radio Flyer with rubber tires and a more appropriate sized frame for my daughter.

The seat adjustment and pedal extenders are a nice feature to get more use out of this trike. Our two year old couldn't reach the pedals when he first got the trike, but now at 2.5 he can pedal with the extensions on. He is content to vroom it around with just his feet though. He rarely catches his heels on the back tires.",

      "text": "got this for my 2yr old's birthday. He can't reach the peddles. but he can run it like the Flintstones though! My 4yr old likes to ride it and it fits her quite well. My son rides it to the park and back (1/3 mile) with no problem. It's also very sturdy but light weight (some times he gets grandma to carry it back from the park while he walks and she has no problem.)",
