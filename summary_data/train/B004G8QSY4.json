Has 2 different modes for instruments and songs, and a volume control. Helps to keep baby entertained while you need to do other things. I used to give it to them for playtime in their crib or play yard. Songs are not unpleasant to listen to, unlike some other baby toys. Recommended.",

      "text": "My son loves this toy. We probably got a good 8+ months of use out of it. We bought it when he was around 4 months old and he loved it well past a year. Also probably the most tolerable noise-making toy we have. Update: got the turtle out of storage a couple months ago ahead of baby #2\u2019s arrival. Our now 3 year old is again obsessed with the turtle and has been playing with it for months. He now understands the different features and isolates the different instruments. We have definitely gotten mileage from this cute little fella.",

      "text": "My son has loved this toy since he was about 4 months-old. Each of the buttons are large, brightly colored, light up, and, most importantly, are easy to press. Since my son doesn't have to apply much force to activate the music, he enjoys it much more than the similar. Personally, I think the music sounds a bit better (less tinny) on the Mozart Magic Cube, but the fact that he can more easily play with this one, and that it's lighter (he can actually pick the turtle up), means I'd recommend this one more for a younger baby.",

I like that there are two settings--one that just plays the songs when the buttons are pushed, and one that allows the kid to add/subtract instruments, like the harp or drums, depending on which buttons are pushed. I think that will help prevent her from getting bored with this toy as she gets older.",

All other buttons light up and say the color/instrument except the purple one, it does nothing. It is super cute and I believe my son would love it but I\u2019ll be returning.",

Whether it was chewing on the turtle's feet at 3 months, randomly whacking the poor turtle at four months, or pressing and playing with particular favorite buttons these days, he has always loved this toy and lights up when he sees it. Plus, I gotta be real - I enjoy this thing too! It's really cute to be able to add and remove instruments from the composition of famous works - as a music nerd, I find it really entertaining to play with this with my kid.",
