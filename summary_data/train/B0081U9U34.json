For me, this is a case where more for the money isn't worth it. I'd rather have the bright ones.

[The container comes with plastic connectors allowing you to chain as many of the flexible glow sticks as you want.] The discussion over the light stick bracelets was entertaining and when they get the glow sticks, the kids faces literally light up. \u263a We also like to ask the kids to tell us a joke for the reward of an extra glow stick.

      "title": "Combine to Make Necklaces - Cheaper than Oriental Trading!",
      "text": "I purchased the 300 pack of glow bracelets for our high school group to use as a fundraiser (selling at football games). It came out to about .06 cents per piece. What several of the kids were then doing was combining 3 of them to make a glow necklace (there are little clear plastic connectors that come with them so you can do that). The combined price of .18 cents far beats the price you get glow necklaces for at Oriental Trading ($1.00 each). And you can't really tell the difference between using 3 glow bracelets and 1 necklace. Would recommend these for kids birthday parties, fundraiser, church parties, etc.",

We are just a family, but we go through a lot of \"glow parties\" - throwing them around the yard at night, hanging big loops of them in trees, making creepy things, etc. They tend to break pretty easy, so try to keep them in the container or you'll find you've lost some of them to time, or you'll get glowing goo everywhere. (Okay, well, painting with goo and making your arms glow is sorta fun, but probably not the best idea.)",

I did have one glow stick burst from bending it too far, but overall I was impressed with the length and strength of the glows.",

We ran out about 2/3 the way through the evening. Next year I will buy more than 300. They are thin and not quite long enough to slip over the hands of some teenagers, so you have to actually assemble the bracelets on the wrist.
