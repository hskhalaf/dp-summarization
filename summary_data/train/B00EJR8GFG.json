I went don't a steep icy black diamond and dragged my hand for a second and the thumb and palm are now frayed. They look like they were dragged behind a car. The material that the palm is made out of is cheap and plastic like. If you want these for sports I'd think twice. I had a NorthFace Montana mittens that lasted 3 years through worse conditions. They are warm if you're just using them to keep your hands warm and not for actual snowboarding.",

All of the mechanics make sure the glove is on as tight as possible with straps on hand and wrist after on. The mechanics are amazing and make it very easy to tighten and loosen while wearing gloves too. Plus the pocket to be able to put hand warmers in is a huge plus. As well as the inner glove has sticky lining which I love so it sticks in the mitten for better control plus for your touch screen phone. Would highly highly recommend these gloves to anybody!",

They flip inside out easily so I was able to enjoy dry hand protection for our week in the snow. The wrist straps are also really nice.

Next version should have a couple fingertips on the gloves that work with touchscreens and this would be a 5 Star.

The one big difference, which for me was really disappointing was that there's only 1 leash. For anyone who's dropped a glove you know how important it is to have leashes. Here they decided to remove the leash leaving you only the button clasp to keep your second mitten from dropping 30' below. Otherwise they're the comfortable, heavy duty riding mitts I always loved.",

      "text": "Good quality gloves with all the great features I've grown to love from Burton. I usually wear regular gloves and thought I'd try mitts as I'm starting to have trouble keeping my hands warm. Really I didn't notice a difference so I'll probably go back to gloves when I wear these out, which should be several years from now.",

When you're on the mountain for 8+ hrs, most gear gets snow, slowly freezes, and then your hands are wet and cold, but not with these!",

      "text": "Love these mittens. Went to keystone rode hard for 2 days it was pretty warm I did not get to test the inside gloves for warmth bur the outer mitten is rock solid. Even when I got snow in them from wiping out or just from sweating in them they dried out with the top vent open going down the hill. I highly recommend this product. I never measured my hand but I wear a large to extra large and regular work gloves and the large fit just right.",
