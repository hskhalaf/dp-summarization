So much for standing by your product... This obviously makes me think that the product is very unsafe. At best, by purchasing this product you may be risking your money. At worst ... your life.",

Not complicated - after learning once it's a done deal. Easy, lightweight and sturdy. Don't worry about going wood with the rings - it is finely sanded and not rough on the hands. Would recommend to anyone who is looking to build their own home gym.",

The biggest difference between Rogue and Titan is the straps - and more specifically the metal spring clamp. Rogue's spring clamp is much easier to adjust than Titan's. However, a new set of Rogue straps is $25. The Titan rings are $35 plus Rogue's straps (35 + 25) = $55. Rogue rings cost over $70. It is more cost effective to buy Titan rings and Rogue straps than it is to buy a single set of Rogue rings - plus you'll have an extra set of straps..",

The wood of the rings themselves is great quality, as are the nylon straps. So far the texture of the wood has been fine for me, but it could be easily smoothed or textured with fine or coarse sand paper. I haven't had these long enough to tell how the wood will respond to sweat, but I anticipate that they will wear well. Really looking forward to putting in some hours on these great rings. Great value.",

While they aren't perfect, the rings have a few little chips in them but it isn't an issue, I can certainly deal with some minor flaws in order to save some money.",

I haven't used them a ton yet, but they've been great. There is a reasonably strong glue smell which leads to some concern about longevity, but we will see.",

The rings feel really good and are of high quality. Only minor complaint is there are maybe two or three spots on the rings that I can feel need a very light sanding. Nothing major though. For the price, I would definitely buy again over the more pricey wood rings.",
