This LED lamp can be toggled between natural and white light colors as well as a mixture of both along with the ability to raise and lower the light output itself. The magnifying Glass is both the perfect size and amount of magnification in my opinion. Works Great, although i have only been using it for around one week at the time of this review, will update if there are issues.",

Had to put it back together, to even set it up on my workstation, to only see it just hang there. So follow up, Amazon returned my money, after receiving the product. Few days later, I received new shipment of this product in great working order. My wife put it together and I was back to designing and using it as normally. I've enjoyed this product since then.",

Also, the magnifying glass is great for getting close up on things you can't see normally. Very clear glass. All the buttons are touch sensitive and respond well. Not the best I've seen but for the price,\u200b it is well worth it.",

The light also stays put where I place it and does not bounce up like another lamp I had. The only slight issue I had with the lamp was that the light would be visible from the side, but that was easily fixed with a strip of black electrical tape to block it on the side facing me, so the light would only direct downward.",

Range of motion is more than adequate, and I have not found any position I cannot get it to for my needs. Brightness is sufficient, adjustable and you can change color temperatures. I took off one star because of the electronic switches and their placement. The switches are way too sensitive for my liking. I always seem to inadvertently make changes to the light when I want to change its position. This con is minor, and it just makes me more aware of where I need to grab it, but I do believe mechanical switches would be better.",

Also, the lamp is made of quality parts all the way around - definitely has a more sturdy feel. A+++ !",
