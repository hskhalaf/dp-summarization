Perfect, vibrant colors, 3D capability, amazing short throw specs. Best purchase of my life. I use it on daily basis for many hours, sometimes as just a background of a wall sized projection of a picturesque video. Top quality piece of equipment. I have an enormous 140 inch screen in my living room which still amazes me and anyone who witnesses it. They still don't make tvs of this size and I see no reason to replace it.",

This projector gets left on all day and night and is used for TV, DVD, XBOX, blu ray, 3d movies etc, etc and every thing comes through crystal clear. The short throw lens is worth every extra penny, I have 125\" at just 8 feet distance from the screen.",

Once you have this, it's hard to go back to smaller tv's. Remote control works great, backlit. Has automatic cooldown when shutting down to protect bulb. Very well thought out. Even has freeze frame. Only 2 HDMI ports, so I'm buying a multiplier. I love putting my laptop picture on the big screen. With Carl's cloth for my screen I have a wonderful very large picture for a great price.",

Mine is mounted 4\" from my 9' ceiling, approximately 9 feet away from an electric Elite screen and cast a 150\" brilliant picture. In the middle of the day, curtains open, you can still enjoy it. You could enjoy it standing 4' away, without your silhouette being part of the image (mounted on a 9' ceiling that is). Oh...and no lag time!",

I had to adjust mine 3 times before it was right. This was a replacement for an epson that quit working properly right after the 2 year warranty was up. Hope this one last longer. I've got my eye on JVC 4k projector now when the prices drop under 4k. I'm no professional when it comes to picking apart the picture on these so I'll leave those comments to the pros. Haven't used the 3D function yet either so not comment on that.",

I get hot spots, it's hard to describe. The color doesn't fade correctly.",

The menu is easy as set up is a breeze. After reading some reviews i was nervous about the sound; however, it is very quite and doesn't deter from the enjoyment it brings.

I wish I had not made this purchase...",

I've owned the infocus 4805, samsung sp710, and the panasonic ae900. I also currently have the panasonic ae2000, ae4000, and ax200 projectors and the optoma gt700. The 1080st beats them all except for the ae2000 and ae4000 which have better black levels. Highly recommended!!",
