Unlike the ps3, the ps4 controllers batteries last considerably less.There aren't any led light on the unit, that isn't a must-have for me because the DS4 blink when they are charging ,and stop when fully charged(just like when being charged from the console.). You can charge two controllers simultaneously(or just one ).They come with an AC adapter , so you can charge them pretty much away from the PS4. Once you press the DS4 down on the base, it locks down.To release, you do the same thing.Any questions, don't hesitate to ask.",

Another issue is the slightest breeze can cause it to stop charging. Overall it does charge but is more difficult than it needs to be. Not worth the purchase.",

      "text": "Awesome product. I bought this after two Nyco charging stations failed after only a week of use. This one is PS certified and works exactly as advertised. I don't have to worry about using removable contact clips that fail or have to line up exactly to charge like the Nyco charger. The controllers fit very snugly into the station after being pressed into the charging position. It actually charges two completely drained controllers faster than the previous ones I purchased. I am extremely satisfied with this and hope it will last for a long time because I am an avid gamer",

      "text": "The best controller charger stand I have ever owned. Owning every console under the sun I have had many sub-par to good chargers for my \"rechargeable\" controllers. This particular one though I have to say is really perfection. The ease of use for this is amazing. No fiddling around trying to get \"just the right angle\" to get the controller on the cradle-just set it in and \"click\". It works perfect-EVERY SINGLE TIME! Why can't all chargers be this simple and easy to use for other consoles? It will be your favorite too. I have other brands for this console and you had to fuss and waste time getting it just right. Not with this, it's perfect.",

Once your controller is fully charge it automatically stops charging. So you can just leave your controller plugged into this device without the worry of ruining the life of your internal rechargeable battery.",

The only thing I don't care for is the way they are sat down into the dock. It doesn't always feel intuitive and you may have to engage it again to activate the charging. That being said, it definitely fulfills my need for a standalone charger and would still recommend it.",

They also know when to stop charging, so your controllers are safe from exploding and your batteries will last longer. Also, do not be fooled by the packaging it comes in. I thought it was some cheap rip-off until I actually used the product. This product is much better than any other brand. You can trust me, I've done my share of researching.",
