Ok so I have hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) and I tend to sweat a ton mostly on my head, like my forehead, scalp etc. and having protective styles in + sweat is not a good mix. I\u2019ve tried so many other \u201cbraid sprays\u201d and they don\u2019t do anything except wet my hair. this stuff smells so damn good and it completely gets rid of ANY odor no matter how strong. it makes my hair super soft. I bought this expecting it to be like all the other sprays but I was wrong so I highly reccomend.",

It also it a bit sticky (the mist leaves residue on my counter top) but I think it helps keep my braids neat and doesn't let it frizz easily. I need another bottle.",

This spray is liquid magic, not only does it relieve your scalp from the itching and make your braids shine, it truly moisturizes your hair in the braids. One of the other benefits is how well it conditions your hair while in the protective style. I saturated my braids with this spray when I removed my braids as well and it kept my hair tangle free and easy to separate from the braids. Most people complain how synthetic hair drys your hair out, if you use this then there's no need to worry about this issue. I highly recommend this product!",

Just be careful because if you accidentally get the spray on to the braids and not the scalp they tend to soften and loosen the braids (happened to me because it smelled great and I got soray-happy lol ) was not a big issue as I just re-did a few anyway to freshen them up..highly recommend though .",
