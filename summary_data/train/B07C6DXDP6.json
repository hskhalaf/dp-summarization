Nice nylon bag and fits in a pack or bag (compresses very small). Sometimes you don't need high gaiters (when I wear shorts) and these fit the bill.",

They fit great! I did not get to try out the waterproofing sadly so i can not speak on account of that. But i would definitly buy another pair when these wear out and definitly be getting my girlfriend a pair as well",
