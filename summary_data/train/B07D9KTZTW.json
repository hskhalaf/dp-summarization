Plus, it arrived very quickly after ordering.",

Internal lining zipper splits and has no head to rezip. :/ easy to pull suitcase around on multi directional wheels. Grey is attractive. External pocket on carry-on is basically useless except for paperwork. A little tricky to get suitcases nested for storing. Definitely not top quality travel gear, but lasted for our trip across the country. I was worried about zippers. The zipper teeth on the corner of the carry on got misaligned so only one zipper pull can be used and the other is stuck (can\u2019t open zipper beyond the teeth problem).",

Other 2 suitcase handles worked fine. So disappointed. We are leaving day after tomorrow, so there is no time to do something else. Not happy.",
