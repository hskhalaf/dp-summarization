      "text": "Great for the price, arrived on time, relatively easy to put together. I say relatively because, while I was putting in the screws in the corners that keep the top and bottom together, one of the holes was too small to put the bolt through correctly. I had to manually widen it a hair to make it fit. Once put together though, it fit my adult cat fine and was plenty sturdy enough to transport her to the vet with. Not sure I'd recommend it for longer trips though.",

Our 8 pound kitty enjoyed it, she's been laying inside it without the door closed. A great purchase for the money! (The one pictured isn't the smallest kennel)",

My dog got out the first few times and it's always hard for someone new (my roommate, the dog walker, etc) to figure it out without being there to explain it.",
