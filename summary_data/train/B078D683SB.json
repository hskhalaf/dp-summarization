The shoes are slip-ons and built along the same lines as the original Moc although tweaks were made to make them easily adapt to work environments.The sneakers provide a firm grip on wet surfaces, and the arch support is excellent. However, the soles don\u2019t seem to last long and lose their treads quickly.",

These shoes are comfortable, they fit great, and they feel great for any active person in the food industry. They look nice too which is always a bonus. The problem is the tread began separating from the shoe just after the first two months. Which is pathetic in terms of quality and build. I've tried glueing them several times and nothing has worked more than a few days so far. You can see in the photos where it's loose and parts have fallen off and it's been glued back. I'm extremely disappointed.",

These shoes are slip resident and the most comfortable you can buy. I have worn Sketchers, NewBalance, and any shoe you can think of that makes slip resident. Merrell makes the most comfortable. I am so glad they decided to started making these again!!! They are not cheap but if you need dry feet that don't slip and comfortable shoes. Spend the money. Also I usually wear 11 but buy 10.5",

I like these shoes, except the top of the shoe, ankle area is very snug and a little higher on my foot than I prefer, there is toe room, though. My heels bother me a lot and these do help that problem. So overall I would buy them again, however I don't understand the price being so much higher for the pro tread compared to the regular tread, they're pretty much double the price.",

The only thing I\u2019ve found is that for slip-on shoes, the inside heel/spine lining never holds up. It tears up and erodes from the abrasion of slipping in and out of the shoe, combined with I guess whatever little heel friction happens when you walk. Still, they\u2019re way too comfortable not to recommend.",
