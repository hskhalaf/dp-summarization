      "text": "The best gun handle for light gun games. Plus it comes with a wand (3rd party wiimote). Gun connects to wand digitally and gun trigger acts as if the b button was pushed. (not mechanism that pushes the b button on wiimote). Cons are that kids will brake the gun handle and nyko wand dpad has always been strange. Functional but strange. Best uses: House of the dead 2 &3 returns House of the dead overkill Resident evil umbrella chronicles I would say dead space extraction but that is still better on ps3 with the sharpshooter.",

I love them, they were cheaper then the Nintendo brand, and they just feel better in my hand. The rubber grip, the buttons, the weight, it all just feels better then the Nintendo brand. Plus, the ones I got, came in a kit which had the gun accessory and protection guard. All this and it still was much cheaper then the Nintendo brand controller by itself. These are a GREAT. 5 stars from me!!!",
