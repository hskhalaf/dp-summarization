      "text": "I like this little 10 foot pole saw. It doesn't have the power of a conventional combustion saw but it gets the job done. And it is much lighter than a conventional chainsaw. It is much quieter and not as stinky as regular chainsaws are. All in all a great little tool to do light pruning in my fruit trees and other tall trees. I like Greenworks and the two products of their's that I own. Also nice that I can interchange the batteries from the different equipment. And maybe I'm not polluting as much either.",
