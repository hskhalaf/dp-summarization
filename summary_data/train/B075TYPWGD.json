The vibrating head is strong enough to assist in cleaning plaque from tooth surfaces yet, gentle enough to prevent gum abrasion. The replaceable head lasts more than two months with soft non-abrasive bristles that do not easily fray. The rechargeable hand grip keeps a strong charge for days. I was skeptical initially but, I am now favorably impressed. I have been a dentist in general practice for more than thirty years and will recommend this product to my patients.",

Great design, the charging base doesn\u2019t take up much space and I love that the brush buzzes every 30 seconds to help my kids learn to spend more time on each of the four sections: top front, top back, bottom front, bottom back.",
