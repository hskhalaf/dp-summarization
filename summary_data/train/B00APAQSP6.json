Today, all of a sudden, controls grew the mind of their own.

The base is heavy enough that it does not tip over despite having a long arm at the top. Cons: My only criticism is that I do wish that it got a tad brighter. If brightness is really important to you, I'd suggest looking at the higher end models. But overall it does the job for me. Bonus: It's sleek and attractive, unlike the majority of desk lamps!",

I only wish that you could customize the light's colors yourself. It's current settings are kinda like stark white, less white, white with a hint of gold, and then super gold. I'd like to be able to make my own balance of the colors. Like have two more sets of up and down arrows for \"amount of white\" and \"amount of gold\". That would be perfect.",

That's not the light's fault, it's a great piece.",
