I had a scheduled Saturday 6-9am delivery and actual was about 7:30am. I was able to assemble most of the basketball system by myself. I needed my wife to help me position the backboard while I bolted it to the arms. My son and I were shooting hoops by 11am. I've received many complements from my neighbors on the sturdiness and construction. The hybrid sand/water feature is great! I've learned that lowering the backboard to the lowest height will make it \"smaller\" so it's easier to move around and to stand up.",

The packaging is woefully inadequate considering the value of what\u2019s inside. Seems like someone has proposed a cost saving that is costing the manufacturer lots of money and reputation. A thin layer of corrugated cardboard is not enough to protect a flimsy piece of plastic with heavy tubular steel packed inside! Due to the long delivery and collection time we decided to replace it locally with an alternative manufacturer which was cheaper, better quality and most of all, not damaged inside the packaging.",

Delivery was a breeze \u2014 we did use amazon for the setup with expert assembly (we got it for $27 somehow) and I\u2019m glad we did! It took the guy about 3 1/2 hours to set up. We bought four 50lbs sand bags but only three bags could fit so we just threw it on top \u2014 I\u2019m sure loose sand would fit all 200lbs but we wanted to keep the sand bagged for easy portability! The ball return on this thing is great! If you are a decent shot the ball will roll or bounce right back to you! The entire unit is stable and the height adjustment is effortless.",

Right from the moment it was put up, you can see a noticeable tilt for the backboard to the right side (while facing it) I've tried taking it on and off and adjusting as best as I can but it's there regardless every time. Other than that, it's a solid sturdy hoop. I have it in my backyard and the backboard is awesome also. It's between a 3 and 3.5/5 for me. Overall I would recommend it but hopefully you'll have better luck with the backboard tilt than I did",

    "description": "The home court is where legends begin. The Spalding Ultimate Hybrid Portable Basketball Hoop gives you the convenience of a portable system while delivering the high rebound found on the professional court. It has a tempered glass or acrylic backboard equipped with arena-style padding and a heavy-duty breakaway rim built for vicious dunks. The Screw Jack lift system is simple enough for even the youngest players to use, and the Ultimate Hybrid base takes less time to assemble than a traditional base. It calls for a mix of water and sand, which you can load in with no tilting required. A cover on top keeps the ballast out of sight for a clean look.",
