Maybe you can use a large air pump to shorten the inflation time. We brought it to the lawn of the park and started our game. During the play, we encountered some branches, stones, etc., without scratching. It can be seen that the wall is thick and strong. We are very happy, we often take it to the park to play. We all love it.",

Had to buy a quality pump from the nearby sporting goods store b/c I didn't realize it didn't come with a pump. Apparently I didn't read the details. So that was the only downfall when we received them.",

Our older son also used these for a bachelor party, and again, they were a hit!",
