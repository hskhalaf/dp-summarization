      "text": "So, I spent likely 800 hours researching cameras before making this purchase. I looked into everything from point and shoot, to DSLRs to camcorders. At the end of the day, I realized I'm not the type of person who will sit and attempt to frame a perfect image with a still camera. I enjoy taking family videos and documenting our travels and so image stabilization has always been very important. This camera blew my expectations out of the water. Image quality at the stabilization was perfect for me. The main con is the battery, however a $20 purchase of extra batteries can resolve that. Phenominal camera. Highly recommended.",

Absolutely false. I have the standard battery with 4K settings at 100 frame rate and it lasts well over four hours. Don\u2019t buy the extra oversized battery it defeats the use of the eye piece. Just buy the one and half inch thick battery. I have owned this for over a year and have no complaints. I shoot great basketball videos and low light dance of my kids. A must buy!",

And it's difficult to find manual settings, which can sometimes be set to manual and you don't even realize it until after messing up your shots. Basically, you need to spend some time setting up the camera before each recording, and train yourself to become an expert with it before anything critical comes along.",

You can keep it plugged in and shoot a video at the same time so no end to battery life - or conversely, the battery lasts about 3 hours. The lens cover automatically opens and closes as you open/close the side viewer. If it times out and turns off, there's an on/off button to turn it on without having to close the viewfinder screen. I use this mostly for still shots vs. action like sports. It's light weight and so intuitively easy to use. I highly recommend.",
