Worth the money to say the least, plus they last a long time, especially the salmon. I have both the salmon and chicken in bowls next to their regular food for them to snack on whenever they get the urge. A bowl of the salmon will last almost a month, chicken goes a little more quickly. Two or three bowls per small bag.",

He'll eat it right out of the bag but seems to enjoy it even more when I add a few crumbled chunks to his canned formula of Wysong's Epigen Duck. He has had no tummy upsets and/or loose stools and is doing very well on this combination. Should you decide to try the Archetype formula, just make sure you introduce it slowly and in small amounts. By using this as an occasional treat or added in small amounts to your preferred canned cat food, you'll be introducing a safer raw alternative your kitty's diet.",

I find that even the canned foods they don't like as much (rabbit, beef) get eaten when this is mixed in. I find that it also helps to add some water to the food for improved consistency. The plastic bucket container is a great improvement over the Archetype bags of quail and rabbit, too, since this reseals much more effectively. Highly recommended.",
