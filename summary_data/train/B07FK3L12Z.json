I believed before that elderberry would help with immune boosting but until I actually saw and felt the results myself, I did not put as much faith in it as I should. Also, the taste is so good! My kids think they're just getting gummy candy. We will definitely keep this company in mind for future purchases.",

They gobble these right up, without even reminding them to take them. Great product! Flavor is raspberry but a slightly tart raspberry, not overly sweet, if that helps anyone. My daughter forgot to take them for about a week and caught a cold. We started taking the vitamins again and not only did the rest of us stay healthy and avoid catching her cold but her cold symptoms were mild and short-lived.",
