Noise wise it\u2019s probably as loud as a normal fan so if you can sleep through that you can sleep through this. Looks pretty smart and is easy enough to move around. Don\u2019t buy as an alternative to an AC unit as it will not cool a room.",

It's a good fan, don't get me wrong, lots of settings and having an ice pack may make a SLIGHT difference compared to normal fans, but any talk of 'air conditioning' or similar is simply not true unfortunately. If you want a fan get this, but anything more cooling you may need to shell out a bit more money elsewhere.",

As people have pointed out it\u2019s not an aircon unit so it won\u2019t cool a whole room, but it makes a huge difference in the heat. Even on the lowest setting it really cools you off. I use it with the humidifier on and no ice packs and it\u2019s great.",

You need to use it with a lot of ice packs surrounded by water (because physics). Then sit in a nice cool air stream.",
