Been functionally using them for a few months now with no issues. However, they did whistle. After some trial and error found that there is one particular screw hole that was making the noise on the front. The back mount was not whistleing because the aero bars caused the mount's screw hole to not be parallel with the ground. A little electrical tape over the hole(pictured) was all the was needed to silence it!",

Unfortunately, one of the pieces developed a crack on the base of the loading skid from front to back, rendering it unsafe to use. This was after after a combined (approximately) 40 hours at highway speeds (around a dozen trips, in less than a year). We are currently trying to return the broken piece and will use a replacement, although we will also keep an eye on wear and tear. We really don't want to have any incident with boat(s) on top at higher speeds!",

The clamps on these go around the bar where the Thule ones didn't and could be twisted and removed easily even when locked. Yakima definitely does great with these.

A few days later I had a brand new Yakima rack. Unbelievable. Customer service was beyond what I would have ever expected. Very fast and simple process. In a world where customer service continues to decline, Yakama and John (phone representative) did an exceptional job. I will always use Yakima products based on my experience.",

In general I'd recommend this. Seems a nice design and works.",
