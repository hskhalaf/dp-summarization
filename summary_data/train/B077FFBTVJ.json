The only con for me is that if you are someone who constantly detach the joy-cons to play, you will need to take the cover off. For someone like me who leave them attached and use pro controller, there's no problem at all. It protects it very well. Note that you'll need the extender cable for the stand because it won't fit in it either unless you take of the cover. The extender cable is a must even if you do not buy a cover because there have been reports of scratches on the screen while docking and un-docking the switch.",

The tight fit is nice though and feels very sturdy with no loose points and the case is very minimal without adding too much extra size to the switch. The case however does not increase much for grip, so if you've got medium/large hands then this likely won't be very comfortable to hold for extended periods of time. This case also will not fit into the Switch dock, so you'll have to attach/remove it every time.",

There is no \"cutout\" for the kickstand, so no freestanding system. The other issue is that it is too big to place the Switch in its dock. This is a given though. I can't fault Mumba for this. Adding ANY extra bulk would prevent the Switch fitting in the dock. Overall though I like it, I like that it adds a little bulk for easier holding.

It fits very tight to the switch so getting it off is a pain, but as long as your not one wanting to constantly take off the joy cons the case is great ! Regardless even if you do take them off the case is worth the hassle of taking it off to simply protect the system ! The packaging was messed up when I recieved it as they sent it in a thin package yet still the case was in great condition!",

I don't recommend it. I'm actually worried it's causing more stress and harm to my switch than it is protecting it. The problem could be solved by making the top part of the case removable, or by having it hinge. Having to bend the rigid plastic material is not smart design.",

Was not as bulky as it looks, feels great, has grip to it, and doesn't look half bad. The only con that I can think of, is that it doesn't fit in the dock (obviously).

Holding it without the case and then with the case on is a HUGE difference.
