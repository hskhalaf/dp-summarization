The hose had changed from day-glow green, to a muddy, black-spotted, moldy mess that rubs off on your hands. I initially missed the critical reviews that provided pictures and accurate descriptions of what I would have experienced in a few months. Additionally, I understand that the warranty for the hose will not be honored by the manufacturer if a claim is made because of the mold. Amazon needs to assess it's customers' experience with this product and the manufacturer's total lack of transparency about the mold issue.",

      "text": "Very nice hose overall. Incredibly flexible, but the lack of structure means it is really easy to kink. The long green plastic handle/sheath on both ends means it protrudes 5-6\" from where it connects to the hose reel cart. I had to carefully cut that plastic piece off because it kinked and left a weird spot that would not allow it to roll up nicely on the reel. I left it on the other side because I do like that it rotates nicely when you need to hook things up to the hose. All in all, with that modification, I still enjoy the hose. I just wish they'd only put the handle on one side.",

Another advantage of this \"SwivelGrip\" is that the hose rarely kinks. It is a sturdy hose, and I can see that it will last a long time. Disadvantages: Not a lightweight hose! My fault, I got the 5/8 inch diameter one instead of the 1/2 inch one. It's heavier than I expected when filled with water.",
