As an Apple user I have had no problems getting the color balance correct between the printer my G4 desktop and the 3 powerbooks we have in our family. The printer is attached to an Airport Express base station so everyone has access to it. The quality is amazing, the supplies reasonably priced, and installation is a snap. I downloaded the latest Mac drivers from Olympus's site and it worked immediately after plugging it in. My advice? BUY IT!",

      "text": "I am happy with the quality of the pictures, but found that the cost of the Print Packs are high. Compared to Epson and Canon photo printers, the Olympus print packs cost a lot more. I would characterize the quality of the prints as being very good, but not quite photo lab quality. Althought the printer is small, I wouldn't say that it is conveniently portable. It only runs on AC (cannot run on batteries). Cannot read memory cards, except from a camera (through PictBridge) Overall, I like the printer, but wish that Olympus could keep the price of the consumables down.",

Prices for the 40 print pack: $17.00 at J and R to as much as $25.00 at Compusa Midtown. Amazon sells the 100 print pack are $30.00 (through Adorama). Print cartridge is easy to change (takes seconds). Highly recommended.",
