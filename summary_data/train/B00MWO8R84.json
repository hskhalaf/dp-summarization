Once I figured out what all the little straps we're for it was a breeze. Good quality material, softer than I expected and looks really good with the color options available. Definitely upgraded the interior over the cloth seats. High recommend! Also after a week or so of use the seat covers have better formed over the seat making the look even better. 100% satisfied!",

I could have made it work but they would have covered the seat adjusters. They do show that you can cut the fabric for these obstacles. They are BIG so if you have little seats in a very small car these will be swimming all over the place.",

The covers do balloon out a bit at the meeting of the backrest and the seat cushion, but that's mainly because I have such deep bucket seats and these don't have ties that maneuver through that crevice. Far from a deal breaker for me and it does not detract from the look.",
