This makes a very low sound while in use, and honestly, I don't even realize it's operating, as the sound is pleasant (not loud at all). The price is right at under $200, and replacement filters and so are very inexpensive.",

We didn't even use it consistently and we cleaned before starting it to avoid anything big messing it up. It just stopped and started beeping. We have cleaned it , emptied the tray, even took the tools off that come with it. I'm hurt! I dont think I have ever written a bad review like this. Unfortunately we threw the box away on day 1.",

It does get stuck once a week and you just reset it on the floor and push the button to restart it. I recommend it for those who want a cheap priced robot for pet hair.",

Downside is there are always tuffs of fur left beside the edge of a rug, doesn\u2019t seem to have enough suction to be able to go on the rug without leaving dirt behind. If you\u2019re looking for something to help make the floors look nice so you don\u2019t have to spend every day vacuuming this is a great option. If you\u2019re looking for something so you don\u2019t have to vacuum but once every few months...this isn\u2019t it.",

We have a large dog that sheds like crazy and I have gone from having to sweep twice a day to once every few days.

      "text": "So far the Eufy is pretty cool! It\u2019s easy to use, mostly. I\u2019ve had to clean it out twice since we got it yesterday. I think that\u2019s more about it\u2019s willingness to go under a couch unlike everyone else in my house. So far, I\u2019m happy! Update: I\u2019m still happy, but the other reviewers are right. It really isn\u2019t good on short pile carpet. Luckily most of my house is wood, but if your house is short pile carpet you might want to reconsider.",
