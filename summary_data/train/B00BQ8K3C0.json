Well, essential oils are working for me and my family and I researched every diffuser I could find on the Internet. I chose this one because it had a much larger capacity than most and not bad ratings. It was super easy to set up and use and the color changing is a bonus feature of a night light that my son loves. It makes no noise. One fill-up lasts 3 nights for us. I want to get another, so don't raise the price!",

We have used this the past week and can't even begin to rave enough on how much we sleep better and feel more relaxed.

We turned to the internet and tried all the various cleaning methods but in the end nothing worked. I am extremely disappointed in the product.",

We used it for approximately 2 months and have since relocated . When we set it up in our new location, the diffusion feature no longer works. So now we just have a very expensive LED lamp. AVOID purchasing this. Any recommendations for reliable cold air diffusers are most welcome.",

The light is very pretty for creating a mood. However, even on a high mist mode, the effect is underwhelming. I used it to diffuse at night. Then flicked it off, woke up 6 hours later and turned it back on (a common practice in my home) and it smelled of mildew. I attempted to clean it, but it still smells that way. I'm wondering if this is true for all cold diffusers.",
