If I had to nitpick, I'd say the band is too rigid (out of the box anyway). The box it came in had a soft fabric outer-layer and the pillow the watch is wrapped around inside the box shows off the timepiece perfectly if given as a gift.",

Reasonably good time piece accuracy. Been looking for 2 years for just this item. Actually surprised to find it. Much lighter and stress oriented than my Omega Speedmaster chronograph (stress $100 vs $5,000 timepiece). The Omega is a great SHTF item, but the Seiko precisely fit the purpose (timing CDL pre-trips). Glad I bought it. Very nice styling. Clean lines. So light I forget I am wearing it. Recommended.",

There is so much I like about the watch: the brown colored face, the chronograph where the second hand usually is gives it a classic stopwatch feel. I've tried NATO bands and a stainless steel link band. The brown face of the watch makes it a little hard to match with NATO bands, but the SS band looks great (although large at 22mm). The original leather band is a little creaky but looks great. I hope that the watch holds up well because it is a really nice timepiece.",

Amazon has sent a replacement; it has reset the second hand a couple of times, but I'm not sure if I'd accidentally bumped that button, so it's on my nightstand for observation. I have 2 other Seiko watches, & they are both excellent watches, keeping good time & looking good on my wrist, but if the sweep second hand goes to 12 o'clock by itself while I'm not wearing it, it's going back.",
