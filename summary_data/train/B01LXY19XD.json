I tried to run water through it a few times but nothing worked. Update - after reading many reviews I think the unit was filled with MOLD! I cannot believe they sold me a unit like this. It obviously was not new. Disgusting and dangerous",

Unfortunately, the motor on this one stopped working a few weeks ago for some reason and I was very reluctant/hesitant to bother with a warranty claim, as it always seems like a hassle. So I started shopping other brands. I also decided to take a chance and reach out to Waterpik to see what their warranty experience was like. To my pleasant surprise, Waterpik was gracious, and after answering a few simple questions, they agreed to send a replacement unit! Nice!! Made my day!! Thank you, Waterpik!!",

The water reservoir is also way too small, (needs 3 refills during a session) and has a useless lid that is completely in the way and makes the use annoying. This is near \"what were they thinking?\" territory. Bottom line, the classic WP 60/65 / 72 are by far the better designs. I returned this and got the WP72, same as the 60/65, incl. the same, higher pressure. Only difference is the clear reservoir, which looks even better.",

So now what I do is empty the water tank after EVERY use to make sure there isn't a puddle of water all over the sink counter. The leaking problem is apparently pandemic to this product, but it get's hard-to-reach teeth, so I am stuck with using it.",

This was a HUGE improvement for two reasons: QUIET. It is noticeably more quiet than the WP-900 while this has a low humming sound, the other sounded like a motor. Second reason: SIZE. Almost half the size of the WP-900, it is small and compact yet just as powerful as the WP-900. Very happy with my purchase and would recommend this to anyone.",
