      "text": "This is a very nice little console, but you will want to modify it's software. Out-of-the-box it requires a proprietary Sony memory card to store downloaded games, but these memory cards are expensive. A software mod allows you to get around that by using regular USB drives instead. As of Jan 2018, all versions of this console are able to be modified. Issues: - Expensive proprietary memory cards - It automatically turns on as soon as it's plugged in. It doesn't wait for you to press the power button - Game library is limited compared to a Playstation 3 or PS4 (but there are some gems) These issues are minor, and there are ways to get around them.",

That means if you want to play a game that is purchased from the Playstation store you have to buy Playstation's special memory card. The memory cards are not cheap.

It was easy to set up and get a controller working. Biggest drawback is the interface. It is the hand held Vita's interface and it does not make a seamless transition from Vita to controller. Other than that, the system works exactly like I hoped it would.",

I've since researched this lag issue and found on forums the same problem has been happening since 2014...3 years and they haven't fixed this problem. Shake my head Sony, shake my head. I'll be returning this tomorrow.",

Simply connect the USB to your PS4 controller, turn the PSTV on, wait until the PSTV screen is fully on and gives you that \"Press PS Button.\" Press the PS4 controller's PS button and there you go. You'll have to do the same thing if you decide to reconnect it back to your PS4.",
