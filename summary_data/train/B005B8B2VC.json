Also, as many stated, the shoe laces are way to short to even tie. My regular shoe size is 7B and these were 7.5C-D. Have to send them back; my first Amazon return after hundreds of items. Very disappointed; I love the way they look.",

I know Timberland makes sturdy, quality boots BUT the material is stiff/hard and my ankles were SO SORE after each time (even with the \"leather padding trim\"), particularly from the tongues stabbing the front of my ankles.

I've had other timberland hiking boots before and hoped that this would be the solution as many dress boits are way too narrow. I even ordered them in wide only to find they are still too narrow! This has nothing to do with length, even wearing thin socks the wide boot fits like a normal width boot. It's sad because they do look really good, like you could wear them on the trail or to the office. Will be returning.",

I mean the droplet you see there is from me washing my hands at work and a drop getting on the suede. I just can't believe these $95 shoes didn't even last a month!",

I figured that since they're a winter boot for me, I'd wear them with fuzzy or thick socks to add some extra comfort...so it worked out in the end. :)",

I strongly recommend going for half a size higher instead of the actual size... if you're an 8 then go for 8.5 (if available).",
