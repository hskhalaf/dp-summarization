The real problem is battery life. It burns up alkaline batteries with about 15 scans. Rechargeables last about 20 scans. However, you cannot recharge batteries within the scanner as you can with the Anywhere scanner - pity. On the road you would need to carry a plentiful supply of batteries or a rapid charger for AAA batteries. Tony",
