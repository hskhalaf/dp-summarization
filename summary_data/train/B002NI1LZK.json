      "text": "I'm really confused by the few negative reviews on this screwdriver. I own the Snap-On extended length ratcheting screwdriver and when I compared this one to the Snap-On the mechanism seems to be identical. Specifically: - Both turn smoothly with a very pleasing feel - Both have 26 ratchet steps per revolution - Both have 2 pawls (that I could feel) - Both have similar deflection when loaded off-axis It is true that the shaft of the Williams driver is not knurled, but that seems a minor benefit for about twice the cost. In sum, this is a great alternative to the Snap-on if you are not interested in paying simply for the name.",

Included bits are excellent (though lack a square one). However, the ratchet does slip occasionally and the torque ratings are not published - something I find unacceptable in a $40 driver. The handle, while fairly ergonomic, lacks proper grip. The bit-holding magnet is not particularly strong.",

Compared to other brands like the Bahco ratcheting driver (which I also bought and soon returned) it has a much smoother and in my opinion better ratcheting feel... even though the Bahco has a higher tooth count. The small gap between the shaft and handle doesn't bother me. Only thing I'd suggest would be to put some skateboard tape or the like on the shaft to be able to use with your off hand (see pic). Little expensive, but it's made in the USA and it's a quality product!",

The last one I bought online could only hold the bit to the screwdriver, but wouldn't actually hold the screw itself. What good is that? I thought the point was that you won't drop screws. Anyway, this one works, really well. Strong magnetic force holds the screw to the bit, not just the bit to the screwdriver. Feels exactly like my old Snap-on that finally broke after 40 years. I guess you'll all have to wait 40 years to see if this one lasts as long as that one, but so far it feels the same.",

The snapon version is only black if you get the long shank. Red and orange are the current offerings. SSDMRT4 is $63 off the truck. The brownells rebrand is $35 ( pn WRST4 ), not surprisingly this williams has the exact same part number for almost the same price. So if you want a cheaper snapon ratcheting driver and like blue - get the brownells, if like me you like everything black hard handle, get the williams.",

The 5 interchangeable bits are actually Snap-on branded with correct part numbers, so they can be replaced by your dealer when they wear out. The phillips tips are the better ACR tips that have ridges to keep them from slipping when you apply torque. This is a very good deal on a high-quality screwdriver.",

This has all you need for household use in a self-contained product. The fact that all metal parts of this tool are magnetized is an additional bonus. Glad I did the research and chose this one.
