Secondly and more importantly to me, these were terribly uncomfortable. I have a larger than average size head but I\u2019ve never had this sort of discomfort with any other headphones or headset I\u2019ve ever used. I guess I\u2019ll have to keep looking to find a good headset, it\u2019s unfortunate I have to spend $8 to send this torture device back.",

I ended up getting a pair of the Sennheiser HD 300 studio monitor headphones, and they are exactly what I was looking for.

Unless you're an audiophile, I recommend the Core series. For team FPS games, the mic picks up keystrokes and annoys the teammates, so the mic is not directional.

This is the only set that I've ever worn and then forgotten that I was wearing them. I have probably used them more than the average user, but the ear pads are finally, after a year and a half of near daily use at work and home, starting to give out. I highly recommend these headphones and will be picking up an extra set of the ear pads to continue using these headphones as long as possible.",

They're comfortable for all-day wear and sound better than any of the other gaming brands I've tried (and I've tried quite a few). What makes them even better is the detachable audio cable. So when you try to move too far away from your desk with these still on your head, you won't yank your head, your cable, or anything else in the way. The cable will simply pull out of the headphones. :P",

They fill up surface areas so it's hard to grab it without accidentally turning volume up or down. Still, cost vs sound warrants a 4 star rating from me.",

      "text": "So far, the best gaming headset I've owned. I had Turtle Beach head sets before and the plastic all crumbled on their own. This one has an amazing build, and a quality feel to the materials used. Sits comfortably on the head, without gaining stress/discomfort with long periods of use. The removable wire and mic is great which means replaceable if accidentally broken. The wire itself is sturdy wrapped in black nylon. The removable mic means you can use it as headphones outside of gaming. The sounds are amazing, and noise cancelling is scary good as I couldn't hear anything outside of the game/movie (get ready to be screamed at by your loved ones for not hearing them). Love it!!!",

The headset has no surround sound but it still carries great audio. I'm able to hear and pinpoint footsteps and movement. Voice audio sounds great. Mic is clear with no distortion. Detachable mic and cord, nice little carry case. All in all I'm happy with my purchase and would highly recommend for anyone looking for a headset under $100 that has great audio/mic, is comfortable as hell, and is of great build quality.",

This was annoying because you practically have to eat the attached microphone for anyone to be able to hear you. Second, I switched from turtle beach, which allows you to hear yourself through your headset, the HyperX Cloud Alpha does not have this feature, however, if you keep your old turtle beach amp, you can maintain this feature by running the headset through the amp. The build quality overall is great with the aluminum frame.",

The worst thing was you have to be at full blast mic settings in discord and friends have to turn me up on their end just to get to a somewhat acceptable level of sounds so they can hear me.
