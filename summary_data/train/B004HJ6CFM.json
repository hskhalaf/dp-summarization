Since it is a Boar's hair brush, the bristles are plenty stiff enough to walk thru the hardest soaps, yet lather well on the face with no harshness. I own several primo badger hair brushes, a few synthetics, and one boar's hair brush I purchased years and years ago at a drug store. All in all, I'm now thinking that this $11 brush will be my new favorite. I'll be on the lookout for more Omega's, I'm sure. Good stuff.",

The more you use the brush the softer it gets, and after about 5 uses where most of the bristle have split ends, its as soft as badger brush.

Don't get taken by the false advertising. Only deal with reputable shaving supply houses, and make sure you are getting exactly what you order at a fair price. Buyer beware!",

That being said, there is a significant difference between this boar brush and my badger brushes. The badger brushes absorb significantly more water thereby generating a richer lather. As you might imagine, this brush is significantly stiffer than a badger brush. I'll keep it and use it, but I won't buy another boar brush.",

I had used two badger brushes before and found them lacking (not stiff enough for a shave soap and they weren't attached to the handle very well). This brush will start out with a bit of a boar smell but that does not last more than a month. The bristles start a bit stiff but split and soften up in about the same amount of time. I loose a single bristle every few shaves but the whole assembly is very good and is holding up well. Cannot recommend enough.",
