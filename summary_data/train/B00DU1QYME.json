The only thing that gives it away are the unfinished button holes and the shams...You can tell by the stiching on the shams, that they're not top quality. That being said, however, they are only 29.99...So, you do get what you pay for. But, if you don't feel like spending a fortune on a duvet, love the look and feel of ALL cotton, then this is a pretty good deal. Of course, I haven't washed them yet, since I just received them, but all in all, they're not bad...at all",
