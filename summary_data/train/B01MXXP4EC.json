      "text": "I wanted an inexpensive camera to videotape snorkeling in Maui. This came with a waterproof housing that worked REALLY great. It had lots of other attachments, but I ended up putting the camera on a small hand-grip monopod that would float if I let go. The camera is small, so it's hard to hold steady, but the 60fps ended up smoothing it out. I thought it worked great! Excellent product for the $$. There are some technical problems bringing it into Final Cut Pro, but there is an easy work around. Just right-click the file and chose the \"encode selected video file.\" I tried to get a good upload that reflected the camera's quality. It really is quite impressive.",

For the price, I think this camera is perfect for someone looking to do time lapse or use it on occasion. The images are good, but the good photos require a good amount of light to be sharp. The darker the subject, the more grainey the photo is. I still give it 5 stars based on the fact its a 50.00 camera, and the the camera performs like a 100.00 one. If you want to record life-long memories you can watch 10 yrs from now, get a Go-Pro..",

Your audio is going to sound like you're listening through earplugs. If you don't plan on recording audio with your camera, this won't be a problem. 2. The camera only records decent video in the most ideal lighting settings, and is noticeably sharper quality on 720p than 1080p or 4K.",

      "text": "OK, I waited months to write this, I don't do reviews just to get a gift. That said, after using this on several 60' scuba dives, it really does the trick. I'm not shooting professional video, so I want the cheapest camera that does a good job. Campark provides this and more. Their box is jam-packed with accessories that make this the only purchase you need. Why pay more for something that does the job just fine? At this price, I could buy 4 of them for one of the \"name brands\", so even if it goes out on me I would just buy another. Good video quality, even when diving off 20' cliffs into water.

      "text": "I could not use camera because I could never get it out of its protective case to charge it. The instruction booklet it came with had no helpful information and the grammar was terrible. Furthermore, the camera comes with at least 10 different parts and given that the instruction booklet was worthless, I do not think I could have put it together even if I could have gotten it out of its case. I checked for online support but there was none. I watched a video on YouTube as well but nothing helped.",

      "text": "I just got my camera today. The picture is crystal clear and very easy to record. I haven't taken it in the water yet, but the underwater case it was shipped in looks up to the task of keeping it dry. It has a good battery life and it's convenient to be able to charge it in the camera. ( Though I would have liked to have had the dual battery charger included ). So far this camera seems to be a bargain at this price. I'm looking forward to using it quite a bit.",
