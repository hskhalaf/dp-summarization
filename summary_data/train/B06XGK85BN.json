Finally I came across these and i too the chance. Really thinking i was going to be disappointed.. I took the advice of the other reviewers and got half a size smaller with Wide fit, and they not only look amazing high end but are super comfy. They do fit snug, so i am not sure wearing with socks will fly. Although, after some wear, they will loosen up a bit. I do plan on wearing these with stockings.",

      "text": "Shoes fit like a 10. Toes are not so pointy as to compress a bunion or aggravate Morton's neuromas. The heels do slip a little when flexing the foot. I am not bothered by this, but I can see how a skinnier heel would have a problem. My only qualm is that the L shoe's vamp is ever-so-slightly a darker/more orangey color than the R shoe's vamp. I didn't notice this until I was seated in a bright room - so it's not that noticeable. Be that as it may, I am surprised that quality control didn't notice the discrepancy. The memory foam soles make my feet sweaty. They're comfortable, but hot.",

I'm glad I gave them a chance and they will sail me through some upcoming job interviews.",
