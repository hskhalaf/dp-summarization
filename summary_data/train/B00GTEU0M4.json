The bolt head shot backwards and blade wobbled around as I disengaged the trigger. I was extremely luck not to injured in any capacity. I was fooled by the hype of the commercial and the rugged sounding narrator as the actor cut pieces of 2x4's. Don't buy this product as it clearly has some manufacturer safety issues. Sure I may have gotten the 1 out of 30 that's defective, but it is not good odds when your safety is in jeopardy.",

The Hyper Tough is rated 5.8 amps but seems to be twice as strong as this one. I am very disappointed in this saw, what a let down. The picture shows what I am talking about. The edge guide never left the edge of the plywood. Decide for yourself but I'd move on.",

The positive aspect I was looking forward to is the blade mounted on the left side of the motor / drive. This should allow for a more precision cut when you can see your line the whole time. Unfortunately, the negative thing I noted is that with mine at least, when you attempt to drive the blade down the line, it seems to bind a little. I suspect the blade and the guide notch aren't precisely aligned, but I can't determine if or how it can be adjusted. Overall, for a light, quick saw to lop stuff off with, it Rocks!",

      "text": "I'm a woman with an average size hand and because of the positioning of the safety start button it's extremely difficult to start the saw. I can barely reach both the safety button and the start switch. Every start is difficult, which means I'm not starting off smoothly for cutting. I've also had a problem with the blade not turning and I'm not sure if this is because I'm not strong enough to tighten it really hard or if it's a flaw with this tool. In any event, I had such high hopes that I had found a saw that would be easy for me to use, but I've been really disappointed in the product.",

Because it is easier to handle than my skill saw, my cuts are much more precise.",

The downside is that it has a dual trigger system that is nearly impossible to actuate one handed and extremely awkward to actuate with two hands. Either way the initial start-up is quite dangerous. If using just one hand, one has to compromise a sturdy, safe grip to reach both triggers. Using two hands offers a whole other challenge since two hands on the handle means there is nothing holding the work piece stable at the beginning of the cut. Clamps or a clamping system are a must to maintain safety.",
