The Xbox controller itself will have bluetooth and so does windows ten. So the stick is totally unnecessary. Just go ahead and buy or use an existing xbox one controller, and connect it with your computer using bluetooth. The only time I think this would be useful is when your computer is outdated and has no bluetooth. However it seems irrelevant as if you buy this your obviously using it for gaming and any computer capable of gaming should have bluetooth.",

It comes with a usb cord to plug in if you're out. Easy to set up, works with every game I've tried to play using it, and was actually cheaper than 'mega gamer controllers' I was looking at. If you're looking to upgrade or your previous controller died and you just need one, this is the one you want. It's simply the best I've ever used.",

The controller looks really nice and has a nice weight and fits good in my large hands. Set up was a no brainer, basically plug and play. My only ding is that it dosen't come standard with a rechargeable battery pack, which I had to buy separately as I didn't want to be feeding it handfuls of AA alkaline batteries at $10 a pack! For that I subtract one star as Sony's PS 4 Controllers come with a rechargeable battery pack included. But overall, I'm very satisfied with this Controller.",

This works great too when I want to use my HDMI cord to link in my tv screen so I won't have to strain my eyes to see the gaming screen. So happy to purchase both of these items together.",

This should have been plug and play, but it could not find the drivers automatically. The controller works fine, but this initial experience has caused me to lower the overall review score.",

Its actually better than Sony's version of this because if you want a PS4 controller with Wireless Receiver, then its about $120 last time i checked.

(last time i checked) With this you can use any Xbox controller that you could possibly buy so you can go buy one from Microsoft's own customization thing and it will work with this.",
