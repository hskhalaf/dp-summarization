Mine came with two lenses in the original box with all the goodies. I've since bought another Pentax but this one is my main camera.",

Even the lens is great - especially for being a \"kit\" lens. The color (I have the white one) is great - very different and makes it look smaller and less scary than regular DSLR. It is light, small, fits well in hand, controls are at the right positions, it has live view and sensor image stabilization that works well. A great, great camera - especially for people new to DSLR.",

Pros: I love the small size you can even use it with one hand only, the appearance is very cool, remarkable low-light performance, the price was very reasonable, a lot of nice features. Cons: I found the auto-focus function very slow with the live view mode on. The HD video is noisy in low-light situations. But over all I love this camera and I recommend it as a first dslr camera.",

This camera has seen a lot of mileage and went through several hundred rolls of film over the years. The new Pentax K-x is the rebirth of the old trusty camera. I got the \"Star Wars\" edition which carries attention wherever I go. I am very pleased with this entry-level camera body, even after owning it for several years and comparing it to my more advanced Canon cameras. The built-in stabilization is a great asset when using some of my old Pentax lenses and the performance with my new Tamron lenses is excellent.",

I haven't even gotten around to ordering the rechargeable batteries yet b/c the first set just died after something like 1200 pictures. This camera has not disappointed. I am already aware of the weakness of the kit lense, but that will be the next thing I decide to spoil myself with. Any recommendations for a macro/portrait kind of shooter?",
