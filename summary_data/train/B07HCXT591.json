The reason that I see is that does not vibrate loose during use and short out the board or some other component. Also, check to see if the screwdriver is correct for the screw that you are trying to loosen, or tighten. Asus makes outstanding boards. I have used them for more than a decade. Don't try to overclock right off of the bat, let the thermal paste burn in and get your software set up FIRST!. Alway's ask someone for help if you don't know. Double check your build BEFORE YOU START!",

I was able to remove 1 set but was unlucky on the other. Will most likely RMA this because I can't install my other m.2 SAMSUNG 970 evo on it.

Outside of that it's great with some really nifty bios features including an AI overclock. the 4 phase VRM is even more puzzling when considering the rest of the board is really a dream for overclocking.",

Got the 9900k overclocked to 5.1 ghz, and it's been stable ever since. A lot of people complain about being able to get the heatsync off cause the screws are too tight. I had no problem at all getting both off. Yes, there was a little blue lock tight on them both, but it really was no problem. Didn't slip with the screw driver even slightly. So far, this mobo is exactly what I needed, and has performed perfectly.",
