It is essentially a one gallon plastic orange juice container topped by a hard to screw on, hard to insert coins, inaccurate counter for the price of $21.99. While advertised as being for \"ages 3 and up\", any prolonged (more than five minutes) insertion of coins is actually PAINFUL for an adult. Oh, yes, did I mention that unless you insert the coins with the repetitive dexterity of a trained surgeon, the counter will make an error of between .01 and $1.00. That's probably what the manufacturer should be charging for this product.",
