      "text": "Bought as a birthday present for a 9 year old boy. Arrived intact, and damage-free. Went together flawlessly, but required adjustment of the derailleur cable (after normal break-in / cable stretch). Also, the disc brake pads / calipers required adjustment, so good thing I worked in a bike shop for 5 years. For the average Dad, this might prove to be frustrating. A local bike shop could adjust everything for you for a fee, but might cost a bit because you didn't but it from them. The bike is heavy, but it rolls over everything. it's a beast! Very well-constructed, and very sturdy. Should last for years to come with shelter and proper maintenance.",

In putting it together, my husband aside that the derailleur gauged into the tire and he had to bend it out some. We will likely return it. My son is so upset!",
