I have probably Thrown this boomerang about 400-500 times, and it has not broke. The painting design on the wood looks great, but it does get scratched up fairly easily around the ends of the boomerang. Definitly a great boomerang for me, although very frustrating. Only reason it is 4 star is because the wood gets alittle chipped in some so, along with the paint job. I still do recommend this product",

Bending it is what allows it to have a higher or lower flight, but you're pretty much stuck with how it is. Overall, it's fun to throw, but you'll need some practice.",
