Those sellers customize the base model with add ons and label it with their own name. This one has a good air flow (purported to be 900 cubic feet/minute) but very poor lighting. There are two lighting units - each a single \"bulb\" containing multiple LEDs. In the unit I have the lights are like Marty Feldman eyes, going off to the side but not illuminating the cooking surface. Not only that but they are not bright. That has been a great disappointment.",

Just one thing to keep in mind, this is not a hard wire, it's plug in. So if you purchase be sure you already have an outlet, or be prepared to have one installed.",

After installing rhis though didnt realize the hole of the exhaust was 8in diameter so i had to cut the bottom of my cabinet a little larger. Now to its performance on the highest vent setting you can cook bacon in the house and you would git very minimal bacon smell escape. I mean like your whole house wont smeel like bacon forever. I love this hood vent glad I pulled a Tim Allen and thought bigger is better because man 900cfm is amazing.",

Luckily it's a standard GU10 fixture so I can replace it with a warmer bulb. And 2) who needs another digital clock on a kitchen appliance? Yet another clock to change in March and November. But overall I am too, too pleased with this hood!",
