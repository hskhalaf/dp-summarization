      "text": "The product arrived exactly as the photos depict. The construction of the pots and tray are of very high quality. The pots have weep holes in the bottom and I was concerned if I used the pots as small planters the bottom might leak so I filled the tray with water and placed it on a paper towel on the counter and left it overnight. I checked the tray in the morning and there were no leaks! The galvanized steel should last a very, very long time and the spangle pattern is quite attractive. This product adds a very nice accent in my kitchen. I am 100% satisfied with this product and would purchase again.",
