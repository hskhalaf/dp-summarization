      "text": "I've owned three cheaper (non-Paragon) cotton candy machines before purchasing this Paragon. My old ones either arrived broken or broke within a month. I finally decided to invest in the Paragon, and more than a year later, I must say I have no regrets. It never broke down, and I've gotten OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SUPPORT from the first time of use to purchasing new parts. It's a solid commercial cotton candy machine that can take large crowds. My only complaint is that sometimes it would smoke due to burned sugar. The solution: Let it run until the sugar comes out and forms cotton candy. This cleans it. Did you find my review helpful?",

In addition the side travel knobs on my machine, cant speak for everyone but there was a defect. This made the side knobs tighten up the motor head causing it 2 stop. Which I had to play builder Bob to fix by placing a piece of cloth to keep it staple.",
