I am happy with the quality. I opted for a larger set they could grow into. A few of the pictures show product being used by a 4 year old. The 4 year old is having fun with it as well. Tunnel is way to small as mentioned in a previous review! Pictures show product size compared to 1 year old and 4 year old.",
