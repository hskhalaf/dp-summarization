By boiling water on propane stove first before putting in bottom tray, then heating food before putting in top tray, this did a good job of keeping the meats hot using Sternos. After getting it set up, just before serving we removed the sterno cans and the water pan kept the food hot til it was all gone. After the food tray was emptied, people put a couple one-use aluminum trays in the upper pan with smaller amounts of other food and it warmed those in about 5 minutes, too.",

This chafing dish box was damaged in shipping, taped up and then sold to me as used. It is lightweight metal so the pans and the stand were bent. I was able to straighten them out, but it wobbles a little. Still it was worth the discounted price $10 less. Buying a quality chafing dish was not possible at ten times the cost. And, this one worked great!",

They were served at a baby shower, and stayed nice and hot for 2 hours.

We're first time parents and first time homeowners so it made sense to invest in our own rather than rent or borrow.
