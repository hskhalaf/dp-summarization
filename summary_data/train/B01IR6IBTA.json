I would imagine that a dedicated thief could bust it open with the right tools, but that's true for any lock. I really like the mounting clip. I was able to find a convenient spot on both our bikes to mount them. However, on my bike I did need to replace the screws with longer ones to be able to make it fit. If your bike has really thick bars it might be a bit less convenient, but you'll most likely be able to make it work. For the price, I am exceptionally happy.",
