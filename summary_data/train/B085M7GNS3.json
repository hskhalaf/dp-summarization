The bottom is a heavy textured plastic which keeps my pup from putting holes in it. I purchased the largest pool because Carrie likes to roll over and get herself completely wet. It is a little expensive but you get what you pay for snd so far this is a great buy. It is super easy to fill up and just as easy to empty. I haven\u2019t had the chance to fold it to put it away because we use it several times a week.",

We thought the seal was bad on the valve so we tried some silicone, to no avail I tried to fill it up again after a week of letting it dry and it LEAKED AGAIN! This time I could see water pooling on the ground. It was leaking from multiple spots on the corner of the bottom and wall. We don't even use it for our dog it was for our kids to play in. They are very sad their pool does not work and so am I. I really thought this was gonna be the pool that made multiple seasons. Very disappointed!",

Let my dog out and he love it, went in the house for about 15 minutes and when I came back out, he had the side chewed up. As in the actual material of the pool. The pvc material was fine. So I had to empty what was left of the water and throw it out. I am very disappointed.",
