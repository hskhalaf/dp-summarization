It fits nicely under the seat and allows for easy times through TSA. When used as a backpack, this item really manages the weight nicely, I love the padded straps and the additional supports through the rear of the item. It has more than adequate storage and helps me stay or organized though the day. Great product, great price.",

My last backpack was the Amazon Basics Laptop Backpack and it seemed so heavy for the amount of things I carried but when I switched to this one, what a significant difference! The backpack is lightweight on my shoulders which is probably due to the molded shoulder pads. The flexvent back panel is much more comforting on your back/spine than a traditional flat back support as well. Lastly, the side mesh pockets for water bottles can actually fit a 32 oz container!",

I love all the pockets in front to keep my stuff organized, since I carry this instead of a purse. I do wish the big pocket had more width so I could fit my lunch in there better. All in all a great bag, and very comfortable.",

I have back issues and it hurts me to carry a normal back pack so I bought a roll around backpack and got tired of picking it up and down and loading it into my car, so I bought this hoping for the best. Long story short this backpack is a do it all! It has thick padding on the back as well as shoulder straps that are padded carrying alot of weight off my back. Theres also padded inside pockets for your computer! It has chest straps also making it feel like you're almost carrying nothing. Would recommend!",

The bag has a stiff backing and angle so that the bag must fall forward and not backwards to protect a laptop however this feature is also a negative for me since the bag is constantly face done picking up surface dirt and grime. The stiff backing and high quality construction are a pro and con as well considering it became heavy to carry causing back discomfort. The shoulder straps were comfortable and made with women in mind. Love the bag but not my go to bag to carry due to these reasons.",
