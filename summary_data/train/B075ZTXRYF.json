I had a cat that was in a double cone due to licking and scratching, She could get under the cone and still scratch. These did help. My cat has been through a lot and usually is easy to work with. Unfortunately she freaked out when I tried messing with her back claws. I got a huge scratch which left a bruise. Next time I will put lavender oil on the pads of her paws first to calm her down.",

In a world of very limited options to preserve your stuff in your house and your cats claws at the same time, these are pretty good. Just a few small complaints: glue bottle is difficult to use after multiple uses. Easy to clog the funnel the glue takes. Sometimes the caps last well over a month, and sometimes a week if you\u2019re lucky. It\u2019s the nature of the beast. We just check weekly and it\u2019s never been a huge problem. It all averages out to not be that bad to deal with.",

The only thing was during application, it was difficult to tell how much glue you are putting in. I wasn't able to tell if any got in at times. But the caps are staying on, so I must have put just enough in.",

    "description": "Style:1 Pack| Size:Small| Color:Hot Purple & Hot PinkKeep your furniture protected from cat claws with these colorful cat nail covers. Kitty Caps for Cats provide a safe and humane alternative to surgical declawing and help prevent damage to furniture caused by your pet's natural desire to scratch. Kitty Caps are made from a safe and nontoxic natural vinyl resin. They're safe, easy to apply, and stop all snags and scratches. After application, your pet's claws can extend and retract without any disturbance. Kitty Caps will fall off as your cats nails grow and shed, generally 4-8 weeks after application. Package Contents: Each pack includes 40 Kitty Caps, 2 Adhesive Tubes, and 2 Application Tips. Sizing Guide: X-Small (XS): Cats under 5 lbs. Small (S): Cats 6-8 lbs. Medium (M): Cats 9-13 lbs. Large (L): Cats over 13 lbs. Application Instructions: STEP 1: Trim the tip of your cat's nails. Trim just enough to allow the nail cap to fit all the way to the base of the nail. STEP 2: Fill nail caps 1/3 full with adhesive. Gently squeeze the nail cap to evenly distribute the glue and release any air bubbles. If the glue oozes out of the nail cap, you have inserted too much adhesive. Remove some of the glue by squeezing it onto a paper towel. STEP 3: Extend nails by gently pressing thumb on top with index finger on bottom of paw -- slide nail caps onto nail. STEP 4: Observe cat for five minutes before release. You can play with your cat or feed some of kitty's favorite food to distract for a few minutes.
