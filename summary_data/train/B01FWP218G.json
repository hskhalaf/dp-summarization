The actual mirror looks really nice and came well packaged and in good shape. We were excited to put it up but now that we are using this new bathroom, we noticed that the glass quality is poor and our reflections are distorted in some parts of the mirror. if you are really close to the mirror its fine, but as soon as you move back a bit, the image is weird and distorted. For the price, I would have hoped they would use good quality mirror glass to make the product.",

The picture frame hooks it came with would do, but we did a better mounting with screws into wood. Pretty easy to hang, considering they are heavy. I'd make sure at least one side goes into wood and get a good drywall anchor for the other side. We actually removed drywall and did a strip of 1/2\" plywood behind it to make sure it was really solid. Then we just tiled over all but where we hooked the mirror.",
