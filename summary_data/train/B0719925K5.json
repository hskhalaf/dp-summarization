It took about a minute and a half to refill my tire, which has a slow-leak, back up to 35 PSI. The machine is also very loud, but that can be expected from any air compressor. Functionally and aesthetically, it works great. I have had a lot of slow leaks over the years and have had to spend money on compressed air at gas stations to refill my tires. Now I can stay at home and refill them for free at my leisure. It's small enough to keep in the corner of my trunk behind my roadside emergency kit.",

It is incredibly quick, taking just seconds to top off your tire pressure. I replaced a broken 120V compressor with the AUDEW model and the AUDEW is much faster, and much less noisy. Well worth the very modest price. I highly recommend the AUDEW Portable Air Compressor Pump.",

So now, I fill one do something else, fill the second, do something else. Check for temperature before I do the 3rd and 4th. I love the fact that it shuts off at the desired pressure.
