The hinge at the top holding the door has broken. So open it door falls off. Then the thing making it almost worthless the cost of briquettes keep going up no local stores carry them. Only outdoor centers such as Cabellas. You can deal with propping the door open and rigging the hinge. When using it is to expensive and a hassle i say go with a pellet smoker.",

Do not leave it unattended. I had a few flare ups in the past but basically the drip channels are not 100% efficient and any flame can cause the grease to ignite. Once ignited, it is hard to put out. It served me well for two years and probably 30 uses, but I'd probably look for something more durable.",

Also, unless buying them online, they are hard to come by as only a few places sells them. The 20 min burn time for each 'puck' is pretty accurate.
