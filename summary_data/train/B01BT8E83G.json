I needed a reasonable priced and easy to use trap to catch the cats to have them spayed/neutered and returned home. This was easy to put together following the diagrams and instructions. I love that it collapses so it doesn't take much room to store. It is well built and strong enough to last for years!",

She is very small and the trip plates on the other traps were not sensitive enough, but this trap has a very sensitive trigger and we caught her within 30 minutes of putting the trap out. The trap is fairly spacious, as far as traps go, and seems to be made of very sturdy metal. Also, the trap came with several pages of information from Ranger Dave's (the manufacturer) that detailed how to trap and release various kinds of wildlife, which would be very helpful if you were using the trap for a raccoon, opossum, etc.",

Releasing the animals was also easy, they were both happy to escape! Both animals had scraped up their noses and mouths some trying to get out but still seemed okay. Trap was completely fine, no bending evident. Hated having to spend so much to get critters out of garden, but it works!",
