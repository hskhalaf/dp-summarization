      "text": "I have multiple pairs of ECCO golf shoes; these appear to run slightly shorter than the others I have - a bit disappointing. Fits otherwise like a sneaker, very soft and comfy, little to no break-in time, I'm guessing. I like the \"rhinestone\" detail - wondering how they will hold up with use, but looks nice. Innersoles have a kind of weird-looking black stained pink (unless I got a pair that somebody already sweated in?!?). A quality, soft leather golf shoe, pricey as they are!",

It's slightly large but better than 39. So why did I return them?...this pair caused my ankles/feet to roll outward. I tried adjusting insert, but no difference. For this price, I expect just right!",

The 37's fit in length, but were not wide enough. The 38's were a bit longer with all the room I needed in the foot bed in the width. It turns out that I like more length in a golf shoe so I kept the 38's. . I wore them for the first time all day and complimented them all day to everyone :) I will definitely order another pair in a different color to have choices.",
