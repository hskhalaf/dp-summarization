Great for sweaty areas - arm pits, chest area, etc. -- it's a god-send! So, it's one of those: I completely recommend without hesitation!",

I tossed out the remaining 2 unopened containers and the partially used 3rd one - could not get beyond the smell. I have returned to using Johnson + Johnson cornstarch powder.",

It does not work as well as the old school talcum powder you can still get from Johnson and Johnson. Unfortunately, the JJ brand has been linked to cancer.
