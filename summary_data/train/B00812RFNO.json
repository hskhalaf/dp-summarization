BTW, at the bottom of my stand, I went with the Bora Portamate PM-1100 wheel kit, very nice!",

Only problem was that some hardware did not match descriptions in the manual. Drawback- no fence. Bought the kreg fence which fit perfectly. The cost of the saw, plus the fence is equivalent to other 14\" saws of the same quality.",

Went togethor well EXCEPT they only tapped 4 of the 5 required table mounts. Of course it was metric (M8 1.25) which I didn't have. Beyond that, the instructions take very careful reading for the adjustments. Plumbing up the table was a little difficult because the tilt mount is off center. Blade was installed but the bearings were not preset. I think it was well worth the money , especially for a table manufactured today.",
