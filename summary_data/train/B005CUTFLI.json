It wasn't like I submerged this thing, either. Disappointing that a kitchen product would react this poorly to a little countertop water.",

Perfect size, shape and texture to be ground by a professional waiter or a clumsy husband. Highly recommended.",

      "text": "I've bought several pepper mills through out the years and none of them compare to the quality of the Cole and Mason Pepper mill. The grinding mechanism turns smoothly and with minimal effort. The ground pepper is consistent in size, no big chunks nor clumps of pepper stuck to mill's mechanism. Mill is easy to open for filling. I would definitely repurchase and can recommend this mill with confidence.",
