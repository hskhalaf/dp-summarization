I put two scoops into a small bowl/ramekin and then mixed in the suggested amount of water. I put it on top of English Muffins, saltine crackers, and more! Very easy way to get the extra protein needed with out the fat. Highly recommend. Pros: Flavor Easy to make Cons: Consistency. If your a texture person this might not be for you.",
