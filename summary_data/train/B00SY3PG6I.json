This is going to make whatever room you spray stink for a little while after you spray a bit (maybe an hour?). Reminded me of paint fumes. I think it helped flush out a small roach a couple of minutes or even hours after I sprayed. And it made some areas rather unpleasant for the larger roaches. I don't know if it killed any roaches outright though as the crevice areas that I sprayed are very difficult to see or reach into.",

Hopefully we won\u2019t have to verify that claim. Like many sprays, this comes with a straw that allows you to direct the spray. The odor isn\u2019t offensive, though you won\u2019t be wanting to use this for your aromatherapy. In all, this seems to work well. Jerry",
