It took me a minute to decide how to best configure it for optimum comfort, but I'm thrilled with this pillow!",

Good for breastfeeding assistance and for having her propped up for story time. Not to firm and not too soft. Just right for us. Slightly smaller than a Boppy though. Cover is easy to clean and manage with baby messes. Already washed this twice, and it still stays super soft and fresh after hang drying.",
