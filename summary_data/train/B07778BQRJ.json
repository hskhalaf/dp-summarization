      "text": "I've been wanting to get into a more calisthenic oriented workout and with a bad wrist and elbow issues, it's difficult for me to build the necessary muscle base in order to get things going. The Ab strap has solved this for me as it allows me to rest on my upper arm/pit area releasing my wrist and elbow of the pressure. Not to mention hanging leg raises are so much better on my back than normal crunches on the floor. As you can see from my picture, I put them on the pullup bar I have and they fit perfectly.

My one complaint is that adjusting the strap length (if you have shorter arms like I do and would rather hold the bar than the straps) is accomplished by just wrapping the strap around the bars a couple times. This is fine I guess, except a carabiner will sometimes shift in place while I'm doing leg raises, causing a brief instability on one side. It's not a huge deal, I just wish there were a more sophisticated and stable method of adjusting the straps (the product description specifically mentions adjustability as a feature) other than just wrapping the straps around the bar. Not ideal.",
