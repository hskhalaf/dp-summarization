I repurchased through another seller as well as directly from manufacturer... same issues. They did admit they had changed their formulation. I find that this happens often. A good product comes out, and then once the manufacturer has established credibility, they change it to a lesser quality, knowing that people will keep buying unwittingly because of placebo effect. Doesn't work with me, though.",

What I have noticed is that my large pores look much smaller! Even my 15 year old daughter noticed. It's not advertised for that, but it is the only thing I changed in my skin care regime so it has to be responsible. I also had a friend comment that my skin was looking good although she did not give any specifics. I have oily skin and it not cause any breakouts or additional oiliness.",
