I copied the numbers off of the belt and bought two new ones, but the sander is designed in such a way that there is no tentioner tha you can get to. You CANNOT replace the belts simply. So, I forced them on and they both failed rather quickly. It has been sitting on a shelf for over 2 years now, collecting dust. I loved it at first, but now I hate it.",

I can buy a dust bag and the heat isn't a deal-breaker for me. As far as value goes, this is a great buy.",

      "text": "I loved the sander, but it quit after my first time of using it. It was exactly rigorous use. I sanded down uneven patches on a table top I built. Got pretty hot...not so hot it couldn't be held, but the heat was definitely noticeable to the hand. I let it cool, packed it away. The next weekend, retrieved it for another job, and it would not turn on. Don't know why, and at a week old, I wasn't going to waste the time to find out.",
