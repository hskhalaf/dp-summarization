There was one wrong piece in the box, but the company was very easy to work with and sent me a replacement. After that, assembly was not at all difficult (one adult, occasional \"help\" from 5yo). The instructions are not super descriptive, but combined with the pictures it's fine. We like that it's a little different from many sets, with the ladder instead of slide, and bar instead of another swing. Kiddo is thrilled that I can put a board across two ladder steps to make her a \"table.\"",
