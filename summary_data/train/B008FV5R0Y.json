The snow Joe does in fact reduce/ eliminate scratch marks, in that sense this product is great. However their are issues which need to be addressed in order to make this a great overall product. The Snow Joe is screwed on to the telescoping handle, if pressure is applied downward when removing snow it becomes loosened. Having to do the multiple times in the freezing cold is really annoying and a waste of time. I recommend that the snow Joe and telescoping handle be permanently attached with a tilt mechanism added for easier storage.",

Although the design is nice, they need to improve on the quality to ensure the original design is carried out.

      "text": "Just had a snow storm here in Seattle last week. Whipped this thing out the box and put together in less than a Minute. Very large soft cushioned squeegee end and great for clearing snow off your car quickly with few strokes. Will need to use your wipers for the last little bit remaining but this is a good product. Didn\u2019t have very much ice to scrape but I\u2019m sure it would\u2019ve been a quick scrap with this item.",

I can't say if it would work with icy snow, but it sure made this morning easier.",

I used to work at an automobile dealership and we would use these all the time to clean the snow off of all the new cars as well as preowned vehicles. Now that I got a bigger SUV this will come in very handy especially with Northeast weather in the winter. Bought this is in 2017 and still have it in 2020",

I encourage everyone to invest in one of these so you can reach the snow on the roof of your cars (and you can clean the rest of your car off with ease). It's dangerous to leave a mound of snow on your car roof while you're driving around town or on highways. Maybe it's not dangerous for you, but it's certainly dangerous to the ppl driving behind you.
