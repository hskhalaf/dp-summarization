      "text": "When I first bought this sweater shaver, I immediately had doubts about it. It was underpowered and died randomly while defuzzing. I thought maybe it was batteries so I kept switching out batteries and every few minutes it kept dying. It never even really shaved well, and I should\u2019ve listened to my instincts and returned it. Now we are two weeks past the return window and it has died completely. It won\u2019t turn on even with new batteries and like I said, never really worked like I expected to begin with. Definitely not what I expecting and a waste of money. Super disappointed.",

After using my Handheld vac I realized just emptying the fuzz collector was not enough. The unit still had fuzz in it and when this was extracted, some by hand, the unit finished the task and was still on the same batteries.. Just have to not overuse it and empty often.",
