It loosened up some pretty hard surface soil enough to give the grass seed a chance to take root. All and all, I am very pleased with my purchase and look forward to tackling other jobs with it.",

I have had a Troy-Bilt gasoline powered rototiller for about 12 years and it's great but I have downsized my garden area and I believe this new tiller will be better suited for my current needs.",

The second one worked until the warranty expired (used it about 6 times) and then stopped working. Called every Troy-Bilt service center within 40 miles of my house. They all say they will not repair an electric tiller because they are basically unrepairable. The tiller worked great while it lasted, but I wouldn't waste your money on this product. Seems very unreliable.",

When the weather cleared a few weeks later I took it out to start using it and it would not start. Never even got the chance to get it dirty. Contacted the 888 number for somewhere to get it repaired and was given 4 companies. Two said it would be 4-6 weeks before they could look at it, the third said they don't bother with electric equipment and the fourth said f- you and hung up. So needless to say I am VERY unhappy that my $200 dollars was wasted on this product.",
