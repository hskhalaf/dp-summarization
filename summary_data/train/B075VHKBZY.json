This has a huge amount of surface space, and has plenty of clearance under it to fit my laptop on a docking station. Sliding keyboard tray is deep enough to fit my keyboard and gel wrist pad, and wide enough for a mouse and gel pad next to it. Overall this desk converter has saved my working life and made me a happier employee!",

It's spacious enough for me to put a 34\" wide LG monitor + a Mac Mini and some other gear on the desk. the beauty of it is that as it goes up and down, it's sturdy enough that virtually nothing loose ( like a pencil holder) shakes or falls over. It is quite large so you will need a desk that is bigger than 36x24 to support this riser. It's also fairly heavy so make sure your desk can handle the weight of this riser + the monitor/computer you put on top of it. I didn't give it 5 stars because virtually nothing is perfect but this desk is pretty close.",

Like the idea that one can infinitely vary the height, and, when we want to sit, lower it pretty close to about six inches from our desk top and raise my seat height.",

It has sufficient space for two good-size (24\" I think) monitors on the top, and a full size keyboard on the tray, although with the keyboard there, the space for the mouse is a bit cramped. It was extremely easy to put together, as there were only two foot pads to attach via some screws. Lifting the riser does take just a bit of effort. For me it is not hard (6\" tall male), but I suspect for someone who is smaller and perhaps not as strong it would require a bit of effort. Slightly more powerful hydraulics would probably solve this problem. Overall, I am quite pleased with this desk riser.",
