Heading to the Apple Store for advice on what to do. UPDATE: Apple ran a diagnostics and found the battery was 'consumed'. Cost me \u00a380 for a replacement, absolutely appalling that the vendor does not check a simple thing like battery condition before selling on their phones to consumers as so called refurbished, I urge everyone to avoid them.",

I have now had it for almost a year, so it's not under warranty and I've already paid for previous repairs.

The battery has never charged more than 50% and once it gets to 11% it dies instantly. I\u2019ve contacted the company and am awaiting a reply. I want a refund. I shall return and update my review.",
