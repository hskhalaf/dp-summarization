I use it to extend a Hawking 54g wireless router to cover 2 floors, with WG602 in repeater mode. The antenna give better signal than a 7db one I was using. If it were not for the lame documentation, I'd give it 5 stars.",

The box that the AP came in shows a typical network setup utilizing a wgr 614 wireless firewall router and the wg 602. Why would netgear clearly show this compatibility when its not the case? Support on this issue was a joke.",

    "title": "NETGEAR WG602 54 Mbps 802.11g Wireless Access Point",
    "description": "AMAZON.COM\nAmazon.com Product Description The NETGEAR WG602 54 Mbps 802.11g Wireless Access Point lets you easily set up a wireless network in your home so you can share a single internet connection with everyone in your household at speeds up to 54 Mbps. Note that to share an internet connection you will need a router into which you can plug the WG602 access point. If you do not have a router, consider NETGEAR\u2019s Wireless-G Router WGR614.\" \n\n \n\nEasy Setup\nThe WG602 makes it easy for even a novice to set up a wireless network: just plug the included Ethernet cable from your LAN into the device and insert the included CD into any computer on the network, which will provide step-by-step instructions. The WG602 offers a myriad of placement options by including a stand for vertical placement and slots on the bottom for mounting on a wall or ceiling. The default 2 dBi omnidirectional antenna can be removed and you can install an external antenna most suited for your needs onto the standard SMA connector.  The WG602 employs a web-based interface for configuration, allowing you to adjust settings such as the beacon interval, RTS threshold, and DTIM interval. The firmware is also upgradeable via the web interface so you can be sure your access point will always be up-to-date. \n\n Fast and Secure\nSupporting the 802.11g standard, the NETGEAR WG602 offers data speeds of up to 54 Mbps, making it possible to share a broadband internet connection, stream music without hiccups, watch videos with less load time, and videoconference without problems. Downloading files is up to five times faster than it was with 802.11b. If you still have computers that use 802.11b, don't fret as the access point is backwards compatible with the older wireless standard and can be set so all your computers can connect to the network and the WG602 will automatically figure out the connection type and work accordingly. \n\n The WG602 offers many security options to ensure your data is private. Both 40/64-bit and 128-bit WEP encryption is available, as well as Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA2-PSK). You can also use MAC address authentication to allow only authorized users onto the network. \n\n Bridge and Repeater Mode\nIn addition to functioning as an access point, the WG602 can also be used as a bridge and as a repeater. Used as a bridge, the device allows you to connect two LANS wirelessly; as a repeater, your wireless signal's range is extended so even the remote corners of your home or office can be covered. \n\n The NETGEAR WG602 54 Mbps Wireless Access Point is backed by a 1-year warranty. \n\n What's in the Box\nWG602 54 Mbps Wireless Access Point, vertical stand, power adapter, Ethernet cable, resource CD, user's guide, warranty/support information card. \n\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nUp to 5x Faster and Backward Compatible with 802.11b Wireless Networks\nNETGEAR's future-ready WG602 Wireless Access Point connects to all IEEE 802.11b wireless networks. And it lets you add new clients based on the forthcoming, screaming-fast IEEE 802.11g* standard at 54 Mbps, while it maintains support for your existing 802.11b network\u2013taking care of today's needs as well as tomorrow's. With its high-speed data transmissions of up to 54 Mbps, you accomplish a lot of work in a short amount of time. Network users can share a broadband Internet connection, access e-mail, download large files, videoconference, and distribute and play digital images, videos, and MP3 files. Easy to set up and use, NETGEAR's intuitive Install Assistant makes driver installation a cinch. And with up to 128-bit WEP encryption, you can rest assured that your wireless network communications are private.\n\n High-Speed\nSimultaneously supports both IEEE 802.11b and 802.11g standard devices and networks. This dual mode capability protects your 802.11b wireless investment and, at the same time, has you ready for the up to five times faster 802.11g. Provides connectivity to a wired or wireless network for expanded bandwidth. Higher speeds expedite large file downloads and facilitate videoconferencing and the distribution and playing of high-quality multimedia content.\n\n Secure\nProvides the highest available level of industry-standard WEP encryption: 128-bit for both 802.11b and 802.11g devices. MAC address authentication offers enhanced security by ensuring only authorized users can access the network. Will support 802.1x and WPA with a future firmware upgrade.\n\n Dependable\nDynamic rate shifting according to environmental conditions achieves the fastest possible connections. Thorough testing ensures quality and reliable operation, which NETGEAR backs up with a solid 3-year warranty.",
