Filled pot about 2/3 full and served about 12 people with a bit left over. The fondue pot was a huge hit, easy to use and easy to clean up. Very satisfied with it.",

So far it works great for a cheese and then a chocolate fondue. Want to try oil and broth next. So easy to use. No fires lit like my other copper one using sterno. This is safer. Much More convenient to use and good price and fast shipping too! Great addition to use for any dinner party making it fun! Kids love it. Don\u2019t have to polish anything either.",

The heating element provides a consistent temperature, So easy to cook right from the pan and so fondue stays warm, the right consistency and does not burn easily! Cleanup is a breeze with the non stick coating. Finally, the cord is a good size. ( some of the others have really short cords) Very happy with this purchase!",
