Also this is less than half of the weight of my other aluminum ladder. That one folds and had more versatility but is a killer on the back to lift and move. This ladder is so light in comparison. Still 25 lbs or so, but it can easily be carried in one hand and will fit in any vehicle, and takes up no storage space.",

Clearly, they have redesigned the ladder and it is now a bit beefier (I'd guess it weighs about 6 pounds more that the original one) and seems to have better quality plastic catches and a better strap assembly than the first. It worked fine for me today, and I hope it continues to do so.",

It is compact and easy to store. Making this 12 foot is a breeze, takes no time at all, smooth and secure. Absolutely love this. Easy to put away as well. Now, I can view my neighbors second story window perfectly.",

She now I am stuck with a ladder that is useless to me as I have no where to store it in my 5th wheel for travel.",

The aluminum is so light I can pick it up no issues. I struggle to move other ladders. It takes up a lot less space and I can even take it with me in my sedan.",

Sturdy enough for me to use when I'm at my winter weight. and it doesn't take up much room to store. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it needs one improvement. I would assume that if they can create a telescoping ladder like this, they could design it so that you could raise one leg at a time so that it could be used in a stairwell. Other than that it's great. Sure beats trying to move around a huge extension ladder. I would recommend this ladder.",
