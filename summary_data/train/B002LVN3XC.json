The original was solid, thick to the point of being stiff, and when used properly would cover, and stay on the whole day. This product does not come close to performing like the old did. Even with the powder, it fades away in an hour or so. You can get that type of coverage at the supermarket.",

The one important thing about this product is determining the right color that matches your skin color. I have had no problem with allergic reactions to Dermablend. I use a moisturizer first and it makes the applications smoother. I will continue to use these products. This product is affordable and effective and I highly recommend it.",

It worked ok, but didn't cover any better than the BB cream I was using before this arrived. I guess I was expecting more for the high price. It's creamy, but went on clunky and thick. It did not give me the full-coverage natural look that the other reviewers and product claimed.",
