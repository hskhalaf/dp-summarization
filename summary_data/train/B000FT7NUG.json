The crib that I received was missing the \"rock stop\", which is sort of a kick stand that keeps the crib from leaning to one side when you aren't actively rocking it. I went through the trouble of notifying the company that my brand new product was missing parts, and they just sent me a bill, requiring that I pay both for the part and for shipping! I will be returning the crib, as I have no interest in doing business with a company that would treat a customer in this way.",

It fit through doorways which full size cribs don\u2019t. I would sometimes wheel the crib into my family room and it would double as a small playpen as my little one grew.

I will be purchasing a second one for my 6 week old son. I have a small home, which I share with my mother, 3 children, four dogs, and 2 cats, and every bit of extra space counts. I just wish I could find the proper sized bedding for it that doesn't cost a fortune. In the meantime, I just use standard crib sized sheets, and pin them underneath.",

      "text": "We bought this crib for our daughter because we were living in a one bedroom apartment and wanted a real crib. Though we cleared a section of our bedroom for the \"nursery,\" we kept wheeling the crib everywhere in the apartment. It is sturdy enough to handle all that motion, and easy enough to adjust as necessary. Our daughter is 9 months old and in the 75th percentile for height, and she still fits great.",

This is a well built, sturdy little crib which can easily be wheeled from room to room as needed. Since there are 4 levels Grandma doesn't have to strain to bend in two to place a sleeping baby down but it will,in months ahead, adjust for the the height of a toddler. (Why I didn't buy pack&plays). The suggested upgrade in mattress is a definite necessity and I would have been disappointed in the crib if not purchased.",

I like how the wood is real wood, the baby enjoys rolling around while still enjoying easy access to mommy. Our son is 7 mo (adjusted age as he was a preemie) and still has plenty of room to grow in this crib. When we move this away from our bed and put the side on, it's going to make a nice mini crib. I love how it has a small footprint. I can still easily get out of bed in the morning. Highly recommend!",
