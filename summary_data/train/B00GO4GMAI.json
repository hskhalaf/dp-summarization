Too good... In fact, he now can't hear a thing from us even when the headphones are half volume. I tried it out and it's amazing to hear music with almost no external noise. Also, the bass is nice for someone'd like more bass in his/her music. I like a little more bass when watching movies on the phone... Also with the metal band, it seems that the headphones can withstand whatever teenager boys throwing at them. I consider getting myself a pair now after listing to his.",

      "text": "These on-ear headphones are surprisingly compact while being very sturdy and feel well made. They are much lower profile and sleek looking than other headphones and offer nearly the same sound quality as over-ear headphones without looking silly. The case they come in is quite small and they fit in perfectly and it feels like it will be protected very well since these would be very easy to transport and travel with even stuffed into bags without fear of damaging. Sound quality is superb and beats out more expensive headphones I've had before. Causes very mild ear discomfort after wearing all day.. but any headphone would do that. Highly recommend.",

I've owned the V-MODA M80 for many years, and I absolutely love them; I still love them. However, it's undeniable that music coming through the XS headphones is more crisp, balanced and airy/very environmental, whereas the M80 is thicker with bass and low-mids. I feel that the M80 conveys the punch of a song, whereas the XS conveys the nuances. And if you want to crank up the bass, the XS delivers, without any mudiness",

The audio quality is great for the price (ie. it's pretty low, but better than any other cans in this price range). The cable they come with is fantastic. Rarely have I seen headphones with such solid, stylish construction come with cables of equal quality. The case they come with is also fantastic (and it looks cool!). You should order from V-MODA directly instead of from Amazon, because they'll let you customize more of the headphones.",

I was coming from some over the ears and thought I wanted on-ears, but I just couldn't make the change. The noise isolation wasn't enough for me. They are very good for short periods at a desk or in a quiet room, but that's not how I was trying to use them. I wound up with the M100s instead and never looked back.",

I go on walks a couple of times a day and the Bose earbuds were not giving me the full sound of the music and vocals. These V-MODA are very well made and designed. Love them!",

      "text": "I compared these to Sony MDR-10RBT and B&W P3 and these were the winner. Great sound. Good build quality. Comfortable. I would definitely recommend aside from a few small things... The case is ugly. It looks like something from Aliens or a sci-fi movie. Yes - it is durable, but just ugly. One more slight annoyance is the orange cord, and how the small cords stick out at the ear level, but I can get over this easily knowing the cables are of good quality. But - these things are OK and I will get used to them. I'm just overall happy with these.",

      "text": "The audio quality is definitely much better than most headphones I have ever used. The construction of these headphones seems to be of high quality, and the materials used make it very durable. However it fits rather tight and presses down on my ears too much. This makes wearing them for extended periods a bit painful. Also the whole ad campaign about mind the gap seems flawed, as I still see a lot of space between the headphone bands and my head. More than I see with some other headphones I have. If they could work on the comfort level so it doesn't squeeze down on my ears so much they might have a winner.",

The bad: the sub-bass is barely there, practically nonexistent. The highs are have no sibilance, but are subdued and shrouded. These are definitely not audiophile headphones, more for trendy yuppies and teens who want to show off a fashion statement.",

The \"six star service\" asked my to cut the cord and take a picture of it, for them to send me a new one. What are they thinking? It's a puny cable :/ 2. The headphones are virtually impossible to hang on the back of the neck. It's too tight on the neck. That's a dealbreaker for me. Too bad I got it as a present and can't return it.",
