It was more comfortable than any air mattress I have ever slept on! Not noisy at all and surprisingly comfortable...and the height was perfect too!

We recommend not putting the mattress under the cover it comes with and instead using your own cover for it so it won't make that noise. The nightstand type attachments with cup holders were great! we loved them because we could put our drink and keys, phones on there.

Another bonus is that, since the mattress is separate from the frame until you zip it in, if later on the air mattress develops a leak, it looks like we could easily replace that part.

It sets up relatively easy, isn't horribly heavy (not light though), and had the right price tag. That said, the pump that comes with it is completely useless. The thing will be as sturdy as a wet rag if you use it since you can't get enough air pressure with it to really fill the mattress up tight. We ended up using a corded pump from a previous air mattress. Pair a supplemental pump with this purchase.",

We only had two options - both children slept on one cot (which worked) or one child slept in their sleeping bag on the ground without the cot (which negated the whole idea of buying two cots!). Good product but check your measurements first before buying.",

Tables hid in a seperate small bag inside the big bag so I didnt find it until after the fact but thats ok at least they were there. And the mattress comes with it which I noticed not a lot of people asked about so I was worried it wasnt included. But it came with everything you need! Thank you for the awesome product and the minimal shipping time!",

This works well in a large tent or as a portable bed for company at home. We use it for our grandchildren also when they visit. I am not compensated in any way for my reviews.",

I would recommend buying a new air mattress and using the old one for a pool floaty. After one night of hearing that nails on a chaulkboard popping sound of the mattress everytime you would move. I took the cot apart and wrapped bars in mole skin(bandage wrap) and didnt help. So i went to Target and bought a felt top Coleman air mattress for 29.99 (Queen) and that took care of the sound. Now its perfect no more popping sounds.",

If you just blow up the bed and sleep on it the rubber sounds is pretty loud but that\u2019s expected when camping I suppose. Get a topper or follow some of the instructions from other reviewers for fixes. After mom left I was easily able to fold the bed and stand back up into its case.

If the mattress or pump ever fails we can replace them but continue to use the frame. It's heavy, be warned, and awkward to set up, although certainly doable for one person. Also there is a bar which runs down the middle so no one's doing any comfortable cuddling on this thing. But it's there for sleeping and people sleep comfy on it.",
