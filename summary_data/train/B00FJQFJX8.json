Darkness, soft material, and the surprise- you can open your eyes without seeing any light. The way that it is shaped, the mask fits snugly around the outside of your eyes but is lifted in the middle, so you don\u2019t feel any pressure on your eyelids. If you are someone that needs to sleep in darkness, like myself, this is the best purchase you will make. I plan to gift this to my favorite \u201cdark sleepers\u201d this year.",

How ever the forming has created a rim around the mask that is not comfortable.

I resolved that by us trapping it as tightly as possible but occasionally I wake and it's gone. Another issue I have is the qaulity of this mask. It's alrdy peeling at the seems after only a few months use. I ordered another mask after this one from a competitor we'll see how that fairs",

There is a little light that does come through at the base of the nose, but come on...I'm grasping at straws here to even find a negative.",

At night, when the lights are turned off and I all I have to contend with are the city street lamps, the mask works great. During the day these are only effective when I have pulled heavy light-blocking curtains over all the windows.",

I've not used ear plugs before either so I don't know if it's realistic to expect to hear no sounds. These also fell out during the night, but again that was fine for my needs. I'd like to try different ear plugs to see if there are better ones. The mask seems to meet my needs.",
