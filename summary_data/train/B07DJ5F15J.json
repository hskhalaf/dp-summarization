I gave one to my husband who is disabled and sitting at a computer desk is difficult. He can use this on his lap for his laptop orepair tablet. The legs are a little stiff to pull down and put back, but even with a disability my husband can do it. They both like the ability to adjust the angle of the desk. Haven't used it that way yet, but should work well for serving meals in bed. Both family members really like it. If fact my daughter bought one for her daughter!",

I use it while on my recliner sofa, on the floor, and even add it to my dining table or desk to make a quick standing desk. I love how I can shorten one leg when sitting in an awkward position on the couch, the grippy keeps my laptop from sliding and there is plenty of room for my mouse pad. Also you can make the desk flat or slant it, it is awesome!!",

I would definitely recommend this one. Easy to raise and tilt. I did put a small mousepad on there with a wrist pad to complete the desk. Easy to use right out of the box and so far it has been great for use with their laptops.",

It is very wide (like 21\") which is good for us \"larger guys\" who don't like to feel cramped by one of these portable desk devices. I like that it opens easily, folds away for storage quickly, has adjustable sturdy locking positions, can tilt and lock those positions too and is a large surface. The large surface makes it have enough room for a 15\" Macbook Pro (seen in images) and still have plenty of room to add a mouse or trackpad. Great device, very happy with the purchase and the price was very reasonable.",

It folds up really small, would be easy to transport, and has a lot of flexibility height-wise. Plus my pretty large laptop fits on it nicely. I like that it tilts so the desk surface doesn't have to be completely flat. If you want to try standing a little more, or just want the flexibility to work from wherever I'd recommend this.",

I have even used it for eating a meal or two, and reading paperback books. I like that it can be tilted and still keep your laptop in place.",

I have it at an angle, which is good for typing on the device. it's natural for me to rest my hands on the tray and that overcomes the bit of instability because of the chair that I am using. It's very easy to just pick the whole thing up with my laptop on it and either set it on my foot stool or on the floor if I need to get up. I'm very happy with it. and it seems to be quite durable and well-made for what it is.",

The height adjustment etc is very easy, requires no effort. Also, you don\u2019t need to build it yourself, it comes all ready. Truly recommending it, worth the price completely.
