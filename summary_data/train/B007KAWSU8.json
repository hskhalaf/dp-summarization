I purchased several sizes and find the medium/large one fits the best on both, although it is a little tight on my slightly larger cat of about 18-20 lbs. I tried the XL holster on him which is more comfortable, but when he freaks out he can get himself out of it, only because it is slightly too big for him. I still use it. Velcro strong but my cats really don 't pull or do too much when they go outside. They mostly squat and look around.",

We can get the XL harness on the cat without too much trouble and it seems to be comfortable for the cat but he resists being led around. Even when we cinch it up he manages to get out of it as soon as we turn him loose. I think if you have a cat that is less independent or that was harnessed when it was young this might work quite well.",

Previously, 20 minutes into a car ride in a carrier she would have an accident, but with the harness on we made a 3 hour road trip without any accidents or crying!! AMAZING",

I solved the problem by folding the velcroed portions of the neck pieces in half and then twisting one side before closing it so that it couldn't ride back up to the full width again. I will end up sewing the neck portions into that position permanently. Otherwise, a good item for the price and I will buy from this company again when the need arises.",

I think this cat harness is the best one ever i bought as it can be permeable to air and cool with long time wearing. I recommend this one so much!",
