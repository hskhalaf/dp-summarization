The only downside is that the rigidity of the cups in the table makes it hard to make it in the cups - the balls bounce out a lot. Still, when you\u2019re renting or don\u2019t have a space where it\u2019s safe to make a mess and/or can\u2019t play outside, the sunken cups are worth the extra long pong games. We had lots of fun drawing all over the white board. I would buy this again!",

Out of the box and set up as fast as possible, the drawings went on first, then they played for about an hour. All participants declared the table a success! Creativity does not disappear after childhood. It remains, and this is a way for people to express themselves, wipe it clean, and start over again. This is more than a party pong table.",

Also, wish they had an extra cup hole for a water cup. Other than that, it makes a great addition to any party or event!",

One part that they could improve is to have the four sections lock so when you are setting it upright from unfolding the don't flop around.",

It's actually much nicer than what is pictured. They also have 3 modes that can be set differently on each side- solid, slow flash, fast flash. 4 AA batteries are required for use.",

I really like the lights and the ability to change its glow color and mode! I also like how it packaged with markers and balls! Only thing I would wish dif about it is the height (would be nice to have the option of taller) and also it\u2019s stability which also plays into height tho but it\u2019s a little shakey at times but other than that it\u2019s really cool and I would def suggest one of these to my friends or anyone!!

We purchased the table with the LED lights, there is 3 different settings (solid lights, slow flashing, & fast flashing). It is the perfect way to entertain easily!",

Requires 4 AA batteries for the lights (not included) if you purchased that particular feature. I stand at 6'3\" and the table is at waste height. In the picture provided I used standard red Solo cups to give an idea of how high the cups sit. The cup wells are deep enough to keep the cups supported, and prevent any spillage from the cups tipping over. Make sure to heed the warnings provided in the instructions as this table was not built to support body weight. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a quality beer pong table.",

Cups fit nicely into the slots so they don't fall over during the game. The table has two battery packs that are located on the bottom of the table for the lights along the boarder of it. You just have to add 4 AA batteries (2 per pack). All in all its a good table!",
