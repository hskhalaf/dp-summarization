The setup was easy, and the quality of the pictures is great (much better than the photo printer at my local pharmacy store or Wal Mart). And then you get all the extra features (photo editing, touch screen etc.). There are plenty of hook ups for all flash card formats and flash drives. The only complaint I have : There was no USB cable included. If you are planning to use this printer with your computer, don't forget to order the USB2 cable as well !",
