One of my kitties isn't as fond of the bone broth as the other two, but she's a picky eater. I also feed their regular dehydrated food as well. And my picky eater is the first in line to get her meals. I highly recommend this food to everyone!",

One word of caution for you: if your dog has a sensitive stomach and MAY throw up... Turmeric stains are permanent on carpets... just warning you. Well worth the added benefits of the broth, and the dogs eat it up. You can make enough for two servings, just pop the remainder in the fridge until the next feeding. Easy to make, and your dogs will lick their bowls.",

I sprinkle just a little on top since it\u2019s meant to be diluted and then mix it in well. I can\u2019t say if it\u2019s making her better but it fasnt affected her digestive system and I have been seeing improvement in her hot spots. To me, it was worth the try and so far I\u2019m not displeased.",

    "description": "ABOUT BEEF BONE BROTH: Our tasty instant Bone Broth can be mixed with warm water to make a nourishing, and irresistibly mouthwatering drink, that\u2019s got a few health-promoting properties, too. We call it a treat with benefits. \n\nGreat for both dogs and cats, it can be served as a satisfying drink between meals, poured on kibble for a little extra moisture or used to hydrate an Honest Kitchen meal, our bone broth is incredibly versatile. You might find it tempts a picky pet, or perks up one who\u2019s been a bit down in the appetite department, too.\n\nABOUT THE HONEST KITCHEN: The Honest Kitchen started in Lucy Postin\u2019s kitchen in 2002 when she started making her dog\u2019s meals from scratch to help combat his ear infections. The physical difference from his new diet was spectacular but her kitchen was a mess.\n\nLucy then realized that dehydrating whole foods made mealtimes much simpler while maintaining the natural health benefits of the ingredients. From there, The Honest Kitchen was born - and her kitchen stayed much cleaner!\n\nToday, The Honest Kitchen is on a mission to revolutionize the pet food industry through their obsession with product integrity and commitment to help as many pets as possible get on the road to good health through natural, wholesome proper food.",
