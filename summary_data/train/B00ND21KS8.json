      "text": "This backpack if one of the better bags I have tried for my gear. I mainly purchased for use while shooting a wedding. I previously had a rolling bag, but was always worried about someone taking my stuff. It has enough space to hold 2 cameras, lenses, and accessories for when I'm either geared for photography or cinematography. It also has good cushioning for distributing weight. The only downside are the external clips it comes with for accessories that you can attach (like a tripod or a gimbal). For some reason, they easily unbuckle when bumped and I don't have enough confidence in them to use them. This makes all the potentially great exterior attachment points useless.",

During two of those flights, the over head compartments were completely full. I didn't have a choice but to check this along with normal luggage. I was not amused and feared the worse. This backpack is so well made, it survived the baggage handlers and conveyors. All my camera and laptop gear didn't have any problems, nothing broken. I will warn you, this is NOT a small back back, but you can carry everything you'd need in one indescribable backpack. I use this on plane trips and camping.",

The construction is very solid and like the MOLLE on the outside for attaching extra pouches. The tripod holder works really well. The water bottle holder that comes with it, isn't great, but with the MOLLE being a standard attachment system it was easy to find a better one to attach to the pack. I run a outdoor YouTube channel and I am constantly carrying camera gear into the back country this pack so far has met my needs perfectly.",

It does accommodate a good amount of gear and is solid enough to handle the load without deforming or falling apart. It was able to hold 25 lbs/11kg with ease, its just a matter if your back can take the load. I plan on updating this periodically with airlines/planes this has been taken on and how it fit. Airlines used: Japan Airlines (JAL) | Economy | Boeing 777-300er: Would not fit under the seat, stuck out a fair bit. Would need to put in overhead bin.",

I went with a similar designed Sony Backpack, and the straps are padded, reinforced, I could walk for miles comfortably.",

The 350 AW straps seem to be made with the weight limits that this bag can carry. The 450 AW has the same straps as the 350 AW but the 450 AW bag can carry a lot more and this results in the straps not being as comfortable. I believe Lowepro should have made the 450 AW straps thicker or wider in proportion to the weight and size that this bag is capable of.",

The area under where you gear sits rounded and filled with seams. As a result nothing sits flat.

Really pushing the \"Modular\" part of this backpack as I tear out the walls and stick a couple of them together to create a layer of protection between all the gear. I also purchased rolls of velcro to secure everything inside during travel. This is my go to when flying with this much gear. The straps dig in to my shoulders pretty hard with this much stuff in it but definitely worth it.",

      "text": "Good quality bag and nice looking too but regarding functionality: because that curves in the both sides of the bag you can not place your dslr correctly and firmly in the bag near the eather sides and when you load it with a laptop or a tablet the back of the bag becomes hard and uncomfortable(that's why 3 stars). Other than that this bag would be close to perfect (But Its Not) for any activity other than 2 or more days hiking. You can find better bags within this price range.",

Great design, cool accessory holders that come for free, great confort.....its simply one heck of a cool back all around. I've been a ThnkTank guy for a while (own 5 of their bags) but Lowepro won me over with this bag",
