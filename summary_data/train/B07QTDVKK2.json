Our kiddo is 6 and loved the idea of building the set, but needed a good amount of grown-up help -- which I don't fault lego for, since the box labels it 8+! I'd guess even some 8-9 year olds might need help finishing this one since there are a ton of tiny pieces. But the set itself is great. Loved all the figurines, our two kids usually fight over those when it only comes with one or two. Lots of interactive features with the cave, bat tank, and clay face. Not just for hardcore Batman fans, but those who are fans will get some extra love out of this!",

When first looking at the instructions it can be a tad bit scary. Just follow the steps in order and before you know it ( OK a couple of hours maybe ) you have it built. Lego keeps turning out cool sets. I got my first set over 40 years ago and still enjoy them. The grandkids and even their mom enjoy building new sets. This set did not disappoint. I think the Batman or Lego fan in your family will like it too.",

There are so many ways to play with this set and it is a great way to get kids off from screen time and using their imaginations to be heroes that save the day. At the time of this review, the retail price was just under $100 which is reasonable for the quality and the size of this set which includes over 1k pieces.",
