The scrolling feature without the physical ring is new -- it takes a short time to get used to, and works fine. Update 4/21/2020: Earlier I complained that the software had problems, that the Slow Pointer and Single Axis Movement feature didn't work. KensingtonWorks software update to version 2.1.16 fixed those. It all works now. Excellent trackball -- the best! By the way, I;m using it on the latest Mac OS Catalina (10.15.4) and the latest KensingtonWorks (2.1.16).",

The problem is that the large left and right click buttons take up almost 50% of the surface area and are way too easy to click. Need more resistance on the buttons or reduced button size. I found that while scrolling around directories in windows explorer an accidental left click would cause a folder or file to be dragged and dropped into another folder. Frustrating. It took me about 15 minutes of use before I had to return this item.",

This causes the current slide to change versus just moving the mouse left or right. It should be an option in the software to disable it. The software allows for profiles by applications, but you can only lower the scrolling effect versus having it disabled.",

Once you get used to the process it's not so bad, but it is just one more thing to remember. Do anything out of sequence and the Mac won't recognize the trackball. Just a little tedious.....",

Rotating the ball for scrolling seems odd at first, but is surprisingly intuitive and easy to do. Unfortunately, I would not have expected there to be this many quality issues. The first unit had buttons that would get stuck occasionally. The second unit I have been using now is making squeaky noises when rolling the ball. The noises can be mitigated by carefully cleaning the contact points, but usually re-appear after less than an hour.",

      "text": "I have really mixed feelings about this trackball. I loved my time with it, and it is easily my favorite trackball, but a blown capacitor ended up ending our relationship prematurely. I might have replaced it with another of the same, but Amazon was sold out. And, more importantly, I was starting to have arm pain from using the scrolling feature. Twisting the ball to scroll is a really clever idea, and it's very satisfying to do, but it is hard on your wrist. You have to make an unnatural twisting motion with the wrist while your fingers are pointing downward and gripping the ball. If, like me, you got a trackball for the ergonomics, this may be a deal-breaker.",

No new driver, works as a 2 button/scroller trackball now. Looks like an engineer had a great design, then marketing cut cost until they ended up with a cheap enough production.",

Scrolling wants to make the pointer shoot off in random directions and jump and jiggle around and is generally no match for the scroll ring on their cheaper Kensington Orbit it replaced, though. Still if you want a trackball this one or the Kensington Expert are about as good as it gets anymore.",
