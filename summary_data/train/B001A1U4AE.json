      "title": "Not a \"waterproof webcam\"",
      "text": "I used this to stream the outdoor weather from my cabin. It was pretty inexpensive, claimed to be waterproof, and was Prime- so my shipping was fast and free. Turns out, it wasn't a \"waterproof webcam\" it is a \"waterproof camera\" with \"webcam capabilities\". In other words, you have to take off the cap that makes it water proof to use it as a webcam. It was pretty tricky wording that kind of reminded me of \"bait and switch\". I gave it 3 stars because I'm sure it works fine, but was frustrating to be deceived.",

I tried it again for kicks and giggles after these years to sees if it wold be fun to mess around with for a while. It wasn\u2019t. Just a poorly executed camera. At least it was cheap and it would be hard to find one now to disappoint you!",

The only drawbacks were that buttons were difficult to depress. I often had to remove my gloves just to start filming & stop filming and even then it was difficult. Also, the sound quality was lacking. It picked up mostly ambient sound but not my voice. However, I am still learning how to use it. Overall, the video quality is good. Many people liked the video quality once I put on the PC.",

The web cam function is great, just wish it could record at the same time.",

He used it in an hour and a half race and was pretty happy with the quality of the video, although he had to duct take it on to his helmet. The straps that come with it wouldn't keep it steady enough. He turned it on for a second race and it stopped after just a few minutes. We think the batteries wore out but we haven't verified that yet. So it might take a lot of juice.",
