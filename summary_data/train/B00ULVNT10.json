I love all the options of \"chores\" it comes with. My daughter is 2 1/2 and there are ones as she grows up that we can change out to. Plus when we get towards the end of the week she can see the areas she needs to \"work on\" and it helps her going forward!!",

Our child loves the pictures of the specific tasks and that one can receive stars towards are a reward that you can write on the whiteboard. Also, all the stars and pictures are attached by velcro, which is helpful. I definitely recommend this product to all parents that have young kids. It makes routines fun, clear, and rewarding. Great Product!",
