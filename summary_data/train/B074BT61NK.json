Also the app needs a kill switch that you can activate remotely.",

I do see some reviewers want a device that would turn the stove off but they were too complicated for my mom to reset. This wonderful gadget let's me know if the stove has been on longer than usual and I can call and tell her to check.",

She likes to cook, but we were uncomfortable with her cooking alone - and SHE was uncomfortable cooking alone. Wallflower allows her independence in meal prep and has made her more confident. The app alert system works well for her because she is never without her iPhone. LOL Other products specifically designed for stoves cost upwards of 400-500. This was exactly what we were looking for.",
