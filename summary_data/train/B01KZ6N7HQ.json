The inside is decadently soft, the outside feels like soft, high quality leather. Still can't believe I got them for such a great price. I don't wear them constantly, so my usage might not subject them to normal wear and tear; with that caveat I must say they are holding up great. I feel like I won them, as some prize in a contest, because they were so amazingly inexpensive. Very happy with my purchase.",

The tear was about 1.5 inches in length. The tear occurred when I was grabbing a bag from a vehicle. I would have given them one star but they were actually warm and comfortable.

Second, the lining smelled moldy. This alone would make them unacceptable, but even without the smell, the failure of the insulation/warmth is a deal breaker.",
