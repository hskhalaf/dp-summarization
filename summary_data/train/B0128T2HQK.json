The \"rear\" cleaning option if far too powerful even on the lowest setting, so it's basically useless to us now. The nozzle does not move very far forward, making the user engage in some strange posturing in order to get clean on either function. Basically, we purchased a very expensive heated seat.",

The TOTO is more refined in design and operation. The TOTO does a satisfactory job but water pressure is lacking which can be an inconvenience. The TOTO features that SmartBidet doesn't offer, is the bowl pre-mist and the room deodorizer which are real positives but SmartBidet is close to 1/2 the price, has more comfortable seat and offers better water pressure.",
