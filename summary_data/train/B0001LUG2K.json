Maybe for occasionally home playing then paint rubs off its ok IG. I would invest in a better chipset like Las Vegas or Da Vinci or Monte Carlo sets. There ok ..it works but not weighed to my liking in Chips! Their thin and feels like a hard plastic maybe..I can't tell. But I am use to playing with higher quality chips. Big ups for being in tin container and a place to store them if u want.",

Maybe not professional quality (how would I know), but they feel good and seem well made. Only time will tell how they hold up.
