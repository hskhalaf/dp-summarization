She was overjoyed with each figure, and I'm pleased with the quality of them - they don't appear easy to break or damage, so it's great for some non-screen time, while still letting her keep her Minecraft theme going. They are pretty cute too.The paint jobs are good, the different sizes are great and on par with the expected sizes, and each has a little bit of movement to it. She loves each one. The price is right, as all 6 cost about the same as 1-2 animal figures that we usually get her. Great toys for the Minecraft generation :)",

They are decent sized, compared to little Steve characters. The different animals look exactly like on the show. My son is loving playing with them alongside his Steve character building little Minecraft villages in real life rather than just digital. Super cute little toys! My son was very happy with them. These make a great gift for the little Minecraft lover in your life.",

It came out when being played with, but it was attached to a small round ball and could easily be put back in, so don't worry about that! I do have a few suggestions though, because for 20$, it should come with more. I think it should come with 2 wheat, 1 seed, 1 pork chop, 1 carrot, and 1 fish for the animals. I wouldn't mind paying 5$ extra for the set if it came with these.",
