Also, the watch did not come with any extra links. More importantly, it does not say Michael Kors on the back of the face of the watch. After doing some research, these are things that should have been included with an authentic Michael Kors Lexington watch.",

Some people complaining that there's no MK logo on the bottom of the watch, on the silver surface. But the one in the store didn't have it either. They are an exact match. The silver is very bright and flashy. A solid look for any guy or girl.",
