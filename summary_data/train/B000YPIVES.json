      "text": "We use for several baseball fields. Did have an issue with one wheel falling up to had to buy a small cotter pin to replace the cap that fell off. That's the only cap that fell off out of the two markers we got, but it still seems like they're not quite sturdy enough. That said, it's still a good price and the marker works great. Haven't had any problem with leaking. Assembly took maybe 20 minutes, was pretty simple. The lever that changes the chalk line size on one didn't quite want to stay in place so it just had to be bent in slightly, no big deal at all.",
