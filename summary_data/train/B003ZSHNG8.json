It has a great zoom and if your hands don't shake you can take some pretty impressive pictures at concerts. It does not work as well for action shots but again, if you are patient and take a lot of shots you get some great action shots too. I've also got great shots from the car just driving down the road and snapping as someone is driving. And of course it is perfect for still shots of people or things. For the price it is an excellent camera.",

I've taken it to the Grand Canyon, to the Philippines, and numerous other places. It's rugged, it works extremely well for photos and movies. I've captured so many memories with this excellent camera. I'm completely satisfied with my purchase, and after over 5 years, it still works like new.

I can put the camera in auto mode and shoot just about any pictures from scenic to action pictures of my daughter playing softball. The only complaint I have is that it just eats batteries. But then it is a common issue with point and shoot cameras. Stay with the higher end batteries, they may cost more but they'll at least last longer than the cheaper ones.",

    "title": "Canon PowerShot SX130IS 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 12x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom with 3.0-Inch LCD (OLD MODEL)",
    "description": "Canon's 4345B001 PowerShot SX130 IS 12.1 MP Compact Digital Camera is the perfect companion to all your good times. Now you can capture every detail of special moments in crisp, stunning 720p HD even while using the high-powered 12x wide-angle optical zoom. You'll record in stereo sound, then play back your videos instantly on you computer. The SX130 IS all about creativity, with fun new scene modes like Miniature Effect for Movies, and Fisheye Effect for artistically distorted stills. While you're having fun creating, the camera's Smart Flash Exposure and advanced Smart AUTO systems are ensuring that every image is the best it can be. Add the DIGIC 4 Image Processor, 12.1 megapixels and Optical Image Stabilizer, and you've got the ideal camera for making the good times last.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n Smart, sleek and creative, the PowerShot SX130 IS is the perfect companion to all your good times. Now you can capture every detail of special moments in crisp, stunning 720p HD--even while using the high-powered 12x wide-angle optical zoom. You'll record in stereo sound, then play back your videos instantly on you computer. The SX130 IS is all about creativity, with fun new scene modes like Miniature Effect for Movies, and Fisheye Effect for artistically distorted stills. \n\n\n\nWhile you're having fun creating, the camera's Smart Flash Exposure and advanced Smart AUTO systems are ensuring that every image is the best it can be. Add the DIGIC 4 Image Processor, 12.1 megapixels and Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer, and you've got the ideal camera for making the good times last. \n\nCanon PowerShot SX130IS Highlights \n\nShoot 720p HD video with stereo sound while using the optical zoom\nThe PowerShot SX130 IS is the perfect combination of still camera and extraordinary video maker. Videos are recorded in spectacularly detailed 720p HD with clear stereo sound. Better yet, you can now zoom in and out as your creativity demands, without losing a bit of the 720p HD resolution. Given the SX130 IS's powerful 12x wide-angle optical zoom, this capability is especially meaningful. \n\n12x wide-angle optical zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer\nWith precision engineering and decades of leadership in optics technology, Canon has created a bright, wide-angle lens that magnifies to an astonishing 12x. Moreover, it's sized to fit the SX130 IS's compact profile, performs at high speed, and keeps power consumption low. \n\n\nWhether you're at a sporting event, school play, or just out and about shooting, you'll love how the SX130's powerful wide-angle 12x optical zoom gets you up close fast and puts more image into every frame. And Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer controls camera shake to ensure that throughout the zoom range, your images are steady and crystal clear. \n\nScene modes like Miniature Effect for Movie and Fisheye Effect offers creative options for videos and images\nExplore your creativity! The PowerShot SX130 IS gives you fun, easy ways to play with perspective in your still images and videos, too. \n\nMiniature Effect for Movies (also available for still images) enhances perspective to give whatever you're shooting the fascinating look of a scene shot with miniature models. At the same time, selective frames are removed to enhance the effect when you play the scene back at 30 fps. \n\n\"Fisheye\" lenses are favorites of professional photographers: their quirky, convex perspective gives a fun creative punch to shots of kids, pets and more. The SX130 IS creates a Fisheye Effect without the need to attach a special lens--simply activate the mode, choose from three levels (low, medium and high) and shoot! \n\n\nSmart Flash Exposure determines the correct flash based on the shooting situation\nSmart Flash Exposure is a technology that uses the proper flash by analyzing a wide range of lighting conditions, and helps ensure against over or underexposed images. The detail and color of your photo remain intact and truer to life even in challenging lighting. \n\nAdvanced Smart AUTO selects from 28 predefined shooting situations\nJust set the Canon PowerShot SX130 IS to Smart AUTO and you're ready for maximum enjoyment from your picture taking every time. It's a relaxing and satisfying way to shoot because you can completely concentrate on your subject, knowing that the camera has the technical details covered. Advanced Canon technology intelligently analyzes your situation and shooting conditions. Then it automatically selects an appropriate setting from 28 specially defined settings. So whether you're photographing flowers, a captivating sunset, or your friends at the park, you can be confident that you're getting dramatic, memorable images. \n\nWith 22 Shooting Modes including 12 Special Scene Modes, you're ready for whatever shot comes your way. \n\nCapture amazing detail with 12.1-megapixel resolution Powerful DIGIC 4 Image Processor with 12.1 megapixels\nThe PowerShot SX130 IS is equipped with many of the same features as a higher-end camera: an ultra-powerful zoom, eye-popping resolution and advanced picture-improving technology. 12.1 Megapixels of resolution gives your photography incomparable depth and ensures that any section of any shot can be enlarged and cropped with no loss in quality when you edit the image even if you choose to print the image. It can create crisp, clear 13 x 19-inch posters. \n\nCanon's proprietary DIGIC Image Processors have long set its cameras apart from the competition, and the new DIGIC 4 sets the bar even higher. Faster, more accurate noise reduction delivers better image quality, even at high ISO speeds. \n\nLarge 3.0-inch LCD with wide viewing angle\nThe camera's high resolution (230,000 dots) 3.0-inch LCD gives you the big picture, whether you're shooting, reviewing or showing off your images. This high-resolution screen offers a crisp, clear picture to make shooting, playback and using the camera's menu functions especially convenient. Clear and bright, it also features Night Display for easy viewing in low light. \n\nAA battery power enables you to easily power up\nConveniently, you don't need to worry about running out of batteries or having to recharge them. Since AA-size batteries can be purchased at any store, simply get new ones locally--wherever you go, no special power adapters or chargers are needed. \n\nWhat's in the Box  * PowerShot SX130 IS Camera body \n * AA-size Alkaline Battery (x2) \n * Wrist Strap WS-800 \n * AV Cable AVC-DC400ST \n * USB Interface Cable IFC-400PCU \n * Digital Camera Solution CD-ROM",
