      "text": "What's not to love? The fact that 1 in 3 pages results in the paper getting scrunched up (see video) due to the fact you cannot align the paper at exactly 90 degrees to teh scanner, the resulting dark grey image of a white sheet of paper (see image) or the hopeless software which doesn't allow you to combine multiple pages. The only saving grace is that if you open powerpoint then scan, the image goes straight into powerpoint. No mention of this in the user guide. Avoid this product at all costs and either go for a flat bed scanner, or one with a proper document feeder.",

However, the wifi is not great, the wifi software is awkward. Because of the wifi hassle, we just use this scanner with the USB lead plugged into the computer. I would say if you really need wireless, get this one - but if you don't mind plugging it into your computer with the USB lead, you may as well save yourself money and get the no-wifi version, the DS-620.",

I've been using it for digitising old photos and office paperwork for decluttering. It's fast and is whizzing through piles of paper. Highly recommended compared to more expensive products.",
