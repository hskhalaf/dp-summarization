I did really like the front screen, it made taking group shots easier, but other than that I wasn't too impressed with this camera.",

      "text": "Although this is supposed to be an older model. This camera is fantastic! It has a front and rear screen that shows REALLY clear pictures. It is a replacement for a WiFi digital camera that stopped working recently but had only a rear screen. With this one the person having their picture taken and the picture-taker BOTH see what will be snapped. Its good so that if the person who is getting their picture taken doesn't like the pose, they can change up. Awesome camera! She started taking pictures RIGHT AWAY and sending them online! Nice deal...it was supposed to be a Christmas present but she looked so lost without her camera...oh well! Nice price, fast delivery, and secure packaging.",

My poor mother never had charged batteries (it took AA) and when she pressed the shutter, it would take several seconds to click, if it did at all. Flash? Who knows. Needless to say, with 4 young and fast grandchildren, she needs a better camera. I got this for them, because my dad likes to be a techie guy. This is the most techie camera I've seen- loading pics to facebook straight from the camera, and I didn't even have to teach them how to use it. Samsung is just that good. Very happy with the purchase!",

Its surprisingly durable, being used by mostly drunk college students it has been dropped, sat on, spilled on and is still working like the day we got it. Battery life is pretty much on par with other digital cameras despite the second screen.",

The wifi connection wasn't as user friendly as I hoped, the quality of photos was below average. A few things I did like was the front facing LCD. Overall, maybe I got a lemon. Still, I think the camera is okay. I'd suggest spending a few more dollars and getting something more durable and better quality.",

The front view screen is also great for taking pics of my nieces and nephews since it can play a cartoon to get there attention. A great price for a cool camera.

    "description": "Color:WhiteThe Samsung DV150F Smart Camera Dual View gives you two LCD screens, one in front and one in back, so you can easily capture perfect self-portraits and group shots. The stylish, compact camera features a high-resolution 16.2-megapixel CCD sensor and a fast 5x zoom lens, so you can get close to the action with amazing detail and clarity. Built-in Wi-Fi means you can share everything quickly and easily.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nThe Samsung DV150F Smart Camera Dual View gives you two LCD screens, one in front and one in back, so you can easily capture perfect self-portraits and group shots. The stylish, compact camera features a high-resolution 16.2-megapixel CCD sensor and a fast 5x zoom lens, so you can get close to the action with amazing detail and clarity. Built-in Wi-Fi means you can share everything quickly and easily.\n\nA 16.2-megapixel sensor provides crisp, high-resolution images. View larger.\n\nThe 2.7-inch LCD screen makes it easy to shoot and review your photos. View larger.\n\n16.2-MEGAPIXEL SENSOR FOR CRISP, DETAILED PHOTOS\nAn advanced 16.2-megapixel CCD sensor allows the DV150F to capture incredible pictures with lifelike colors, great clarity, and crisp detail.\n\nFAST 25MM WIDE-ANGLE LENS WITH 5X ZOOM\nThe built-in lens has a 5x zoom range so you can easily frame the shot you want and get in close to the action when necessary. The lens starts at a wide 35mm-equivalent focal length of 25mm, so you can fit in all the action when you're shooting, and zooms to 125mm for close-ups. And with a maximum F2.5 aperture, you can freeze fast action and take sharp shots even in dim light.\n\nDUAL LCDS FOR PERFECT SELF-PORTRAITS\nThe DV150F has two LCDs, a 2.7-inch screen in the back and a 1.5-inch screen on the front. The front screen makes it easy to frame self-portraits--no more guessing and hoping you took a good shot.\n\nWI-FI CONNECTIVITY FOR EASY SHARING AND FACEBOOK UPLOAD\nThanks to built-in Wi-Fi, transferring your images and sharing them no longer requires memory cards or cables. You won't have to worry about running out of space, either.\n\nWith the dedicated Direct Link hot key, you can connect to Wi-Fi networks. Once connected, you can save photos and videos directly to a computer or cloud service as you shoot. Print photos wirelessly or share them with your friends instantly by uploading them straight to Facebook or YouTube. With dual band Wi-Fi support, you'll have faster and more stable connections to the wireless networks around you.\n\nCONNECT TO YOUR SMARTPHONE FOR MORE FEATURES\nThe DV150F works with Samsung's Smart Camera App (for iPhone and Android), which lets you instantly pair your camera with your smartphone and gives you features such as AutoShare and Remote ViewFinder.\n\nWhen AutoShare is activated, all the pictures you take on your camera are automatically sent to your smartphone. Remote ViewFinder turns your phone into a viewfinder and lets you preview images, adjust camera settings, frame the scene, and tag the shot location from up to 30 feet away. When you need to take a group shot with yourself in it, Remote ViewFinder makes it easy.\n\nCLOUD SERVICE BACKUP WITH MICROSOFT SKYDRIVE\nNever worry about losing your photos, even if your camera is lost or stolen. If your camera is connected to Wi-Fi, the DV150F will automatically copy the images you take to a Microsoft SkyDrive account. This feature not only automatically backs up all your photos, but also lets you easily make more room on your memory card by deleting shots without fear you'll lose them.\n\nSMART AUTO 2.0 FOR SHARP SHOTS EVERY TIME\nThe Smart Auto 2.0 feature automatically analyzes the current shooting environment and chooses the right mode to give you the best possible picture.\n\nSHOOT HD-QUALITY MOVIES\nWhether you're at the concert hall or a birthday party, grab the DV150F to take 720p HD-quality MPEG video at 30 frames per second.\n\nCOMPACT DESIGN FITS IN YOUR POCKET\nThe compact design of the DV150F makes it easy for you to slip it into your pocket and take it with you wherever you go. The DV150F measures 2.17 by 3.76 by 0.72 inches (H x W x D), and weighs 0.25 pounds.\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\nDV150F Smart Camera Dual View, Li-Ion Battery (BP70A), power plug, USB charging cable, wrist strap, startup guide, and warranty card.\n\nDV150F SMART CAMERA DUAL VIEW\nWHITE\nAT A GLANCE:\n * Compact camera with front and rear LCDs\n * 16.2-megapixel sensor for crisp, high-resolution images\n * Fast, wide-angle lens with 5x zoom\n * Built-in Wi-Fi for easy sharing and data transfers\n * Captures HD-quality MPEG movies\n\nCompact, slim design.
