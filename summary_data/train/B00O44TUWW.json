It really helps with hunger pains and controls my appetite.",

I have been taking probiotics on and off since my mid-twenties to help aid with digestion and, of course, the added benefit to my immune system. I have tried different brands, from the high-end prices to the more basic cheaper brands with fewer strains. I am very pleased with the results of this probiotic! It has the recommended 40 billion CFUs, contains acidophilus (La-14) which is great for lactose intolerance and is very affordable for a probiotic with multiple strains. Highly recommend!!",

I found this product through recommendations of friends and I honestly cannot be happier with the results I got from this. I've lost 14 pounds in two months and that is so amazing.
