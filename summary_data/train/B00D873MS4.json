My suggestion is that if you are going to use it as a running shoe, give yourself an extra 1/2 size compared to other Asics shoes. To those that prefer a light weight shoe and do need the extra cushion, as do I, this shoe may work very well",

      "text": "Nice shoes, good price, but these are the smallest sized shoes I have ever bought (I am 55, have bought many). I normally wear a 9.5 or 10. I ordered these at 10 1/2 because of other reviews. I had to exchange those for size 11. They fit good. I have never bought a size 11 in any other shoe. However, return transaction was as easy as possible. Submitted for return online, printed a sheet to put in the box, UPS picked up the shoes the next day, and Amazon delivered (via UPS) the replacement shoes on the 2nd day. So overall I am very satisfied and the shoes wear good.",

As with the comments stating they run a bit small I ordered these in a half size bigger, glad I did, although the toe box seems to be a bit tight initially. I am hopeful that the toe box stretches because the rest of the shoe fits great. I'll update comments as time and a few runs are in.",
