The axle on mine is 14mm and the mount bracket provided was 12mm so i had to hog the hole out a little.

      "text": "I love to ride my bike daily, so why not save on short trips in my car by simply riding my bike with this cool light weight trailer to go fetch groceries and other \u2018bits and bobs\u2019 around town. The coolest part about this trailer is it folds up and I put it on the bottom rack of a shopping cart when I\u2019m grocery shopping; I do so, for security, while my bike is outside locked up with a U-lock. I\u2019ve had this well-made bike trailer for six months, it looks like it\u2019s brand-new and I\u2019ve got it hooked on my bike nearly everyday \u2018out and about\u2019 on my errand runs.",

I noticed some of the reviews complained a little on storage so with it I bought an Iris weather tight 62 liter storage box.... it fits perfectly into the trailer and adds about 6 inches of height to fit even more into the trailer.... I recommend not riding at high speeds with box in trailer unless it has a decent amount of weight or is tied down.",
