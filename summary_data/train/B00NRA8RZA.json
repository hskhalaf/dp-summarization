The picture shows putting the elastic strap around a headrest, but I put it around my neck and it worked well to keep the pillow in place behind/beside my head. I also used it for back support sometimes. It self-inflates to a point, but if you want more firmness you can blow into it to fill it more. To pack it away, I just opened the air thing and rolled it up to push the air out and it fit in the bag rolled up. The cover is really soft and I like that it's removable so I could wash it when I got home.",

Since it is inflatable, you can adjust the support level. I have taken it on over 10 flights and would never travel again without it. I have back issues and flying has been almost unbearable before I found this back support. I would highly recommend this back support for anyone who needs back support. I like it so much I am going to get one for the car also!",

It's much easier to carry than those bulky U-shaped travel pillows, and can be used in different positions. The strap that allows it to slip over the back of your seat is very helpful for securing it at neck-height. It inflates easily and also is easy to compress to return to its carrying sack. I'm only giving it four stars because I wish it were just slightly larger. As a neck pillow it's fine, but if you want to lean against the window to sleep, it's a bit small.

Although it is larger in the bag than the most travel pillows filled with air, it is still light-weighted and the comfort beats the larger size.I have got questions from other travelers and a flight attendant because it looks very comfortable. So glad I found this pillow.",

      "text": "A friend with lower back issues similar to mine loaned me hers for an international flight, and I found helpful for my lower back as well as a pillow for my neck and head. Now I have my own AC travel pillow which travels with me in my car or is on my computer desk chair. The adjustable strap helps keep it in place when I sit in a chair. It is easy to inflate or deflate for different uses and is compact for packing when fully deflated.",

I would not recommend this product and I have been trying it multiple times over multiple trips.",
