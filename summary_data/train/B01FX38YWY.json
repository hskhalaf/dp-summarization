The bottom teeth are flossable and even pull out (attached by elastic) so you can show what a tooth looks like below the gum line. Great teaching tool. I recommend this item.",

After many, many years it began to look very worn and eventually started to crack and break apart. So I was forced to buy another large model. This product is so poorly made that the teeth don't even come close to occluding together. Cheap material. Flimsy. The toothbrush is probably worth the same amount as the typhodont.",
