I am giving this 2 stars, however, because I have to return due to 2 units having holes on the bottom of the item that lead to water leaking. If yours leaks, check the bottom and look in the red grooves for cracks or holes. Also the drainage function leaves a lot of water left in the unit that you still have to dump it, could have just used a hose drain like some others. May reorder when more in stock, but hate having to play lottery game.",

The only reason I didn't give the elusive 5th star, was because the bumpy rollers in the bottom, that rotate, kind of hurt the feet. I found that I wasn't able to keep both feet inside at the same time, because I had to hold one foot slightly up, off the rollers while it was in operation. You're unable to do this when both feet are in the tub. Because you'd be lifting one and applying more downward pressure to the other. All in all, a pretty good item.",

The spout would initially shoot out some water, a couple of ounces at most, and then it would stop and I would hear the motor continuing to run but without pumping out the water.

For $229 this should work flawlessly for many years and come with a warranty for at least two or three years. It is as heavy as the other reviews stated, so difficult to carry and drain by hand. Returning it for a replacement, but if it fails again, will return for refund.",

When I set it up and turned it on the display immediately indicated that the drain valve was open even though it was closed. I opened and closed it several times hoping there was a stuck switch. But no luck. It drained fine when I hit the drain button, but it refused to operate as a foot bath. I was hoping I had done something stupid, but I can't see what it could be. So back it goes.",
