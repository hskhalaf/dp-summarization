Cushions are firm but 'bouncy' and comfortable enough for extra seating when I'm entertaining. Would definitely recommend as they offer an upscale look at a reasonable price point!",

I contacted support (they were friendly) and they sent me another leg which also did not match the other leg and also did not level the chair. They included with the replacement leg a thicker spacer that resolved the wobble issue.",

      "text": "We were hesitant about buying furniture online, but after spending time researching our options, and thinking of having to wait several weeks for delivery, we decided to take a chance and purchase these chairs for our living room. It took only 2 days from ordering them to having them delivered and assembled. Putting them together is not difficult, just make sure to line the back and the seat correctly and follow the simple directions. The fabric is linen. The chairs are really nice. Not the most comfortable chairs I've ever sat in, but we are pleased that we purchased them. very good looking. We are glad we bought them.",
