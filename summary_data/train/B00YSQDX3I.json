      "text": "The Def Tech Symphony 1 is a great pair of noise cancelling headphones, though not the best I tried, these are, by far, the best I've owned. They are pretty well balanced, all the way from the rich accurate bass to the controlled highs. When ANC is on, it lowers the clarity of music by a little bit, barely noticeable, but as far as sound dampening (passively and actively) these headphones do a very good job. These headphones will transport you from a loud environment to a concert hall.",

You are in the middle of the music and you can clearly hear the highs and lows as the artists intended. The music is almost as good as hearing it live. The noise reduction is every bit as good as the Bose. I wear these while in small turboprop planes. I can barely hear the plane. The prop noise and wind noise is gone. They are worth every penny.",

I like that you can use a USB cable to both charge and carry the digital audio signal from a PC at the same time, which should give better audio fidelity than Bluetooth. Sound quality is disappointing if you're expecting enhanced bass and highs that are typical of Bose and Beats headphones. Had I been able to audition these before purchasing, I would not have bought them. If you want accurate sound, these are a good choice. Also, the ANC works well in my office environment.

It really blocks all that noise and the music sounds very good. With the anc I don't have to crank the volume pass 30% and still get a very detail sound from low to high notes. The noise cancellation works perfectly for me. I tried the qc35 and qc30 as well and the noise cancellation gave me a little headache with the excessive high pitch. The symphony balance that out by not completely blocking all the noise. The sound stage is perfect.",

The Symphony 1 have a nice bass and the sound is crisp and clear. I've got the best of both worlds.

Chet said its usually rare but if frequent resets are required to call back for further troubleshooting. Working now, so unless anything changes I do recommend these headphones due to the super quality sound output.",

      "text": "These are going back. Bluetooth cut out about every minute on an iPhone 7 Plus. They were fully charged, and we tried them with two different phones, same result. They are comfortable, but a bit bulky and heavy. Even if Bluetooth was rock solid, I think we'd return them due to the weight.",

      "text": "Strait out of the box: Very loud hissing sound in the left speaker when ANC is on. The hissing noise also interferes with the sound quality, on some podcasts it sounds like the left speaker blew with ANC on. Touching the left speaker also creates a hissing squeaking noise. I think these are defective.",

Heres a better solution buy pair or Sony MDR1A and an elecom bluetooth amp and you will have better sound and be wireless... Thats what I did.. U wont have noise cancellation but honestly you wont need it... The NC on these headphones did very little.. Honestly dont waste your money.",
