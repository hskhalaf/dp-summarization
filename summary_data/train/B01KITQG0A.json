I put it in unflavored almond/cashew milk and add a tablespoon of natural peanut butter. It's only whey concentrate, no isolate, and the only thing that I don't like about it, is the label doesn't list the BCAA's amounts. Other than that, it is a descent whey protein concentrate powder. The ONLY ingredient is whey protein concentrate (which I like), no added ANYTHING. Note to Nutricost: You need to list the BCAA's amount on the label. We LIKE that.",

Other protein powders I've used in the past, that had many more carbs, would have large clumps of powder. This is the easiest I've had a protein powder mix in.

Secondly, it tastes a whole lot better! I make chocolate milk for my parents and add a big scoop of whey protein. With the Jarrow, I could always taste a kind of sour milk taste. With this brand, I do not taste that at all. If anything, it makes a glass of chocolate milk taste almost like a milkshake. A tip -- if you are making chocolate milk, mix the dry whey powder with Nestles Quik powder before adding the milk. It makes the whole thing easier to mix!",

I find adding about 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda to the milk (before adding the protein powder) really helps dissolve the powder using a spoon to stir the mix. I often add a teaspoon or two of PB Fit brand peanut butter powder to boost the protein content even further. This is now my go-to protein powder and will definitely purchase again.",
