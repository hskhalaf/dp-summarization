      "text": "I love this camera. It's my first DSLR (DSLT). I have been mostly using it for video. It takes great 1080p AVCHD video as well as any professional camcorder. I'm impressed with the built in stereo mic, but equally impressed with the stereo microphone input jack that allows me to connect a shotgun mic. It's small, lite and easy to handle. Even with a 200mm lense, a dual mount bracket, (shotgun mic.), light, and lens hood; it's still light enough to mount on a decent consumer tripod.",

      "text": "I'm really enjoying this camera. I upgraded from Nikon D40 which I had for over 5 years, so the differences are obvious. Only thing that is a bit different and harder to get used to is the fact that through the eye hole you actually see a video and not a mirror image like I'm used to - BUT the benefit of that is that Sony lets you play with the different parameters (shutter speed, etc.) and actually shows you if you got it right before you snap a photo. That's nice because previously I've had to take a few shots before being sure I got the shutter speed or aperture right. Overall, I love it!",

    "description": "Style:With 18-55mm lensExclusive Translucent Mirror Technology DSLR with 18-55mm kit lens provides superb still and video capture performance.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\nSONY ALPHA SLT-A37 16.1 MP EXMOR APS HD CMOS SENSOR DSLR WITH TRANSLUCENT MIRROR TECHNOLOGY\n\n * Translucent Mirror Technology accelerates AF performance\n * 16.1 MP Exmor APS HD CMOS sensor\n * Superb in low light: ISO 16000 sensitivity \n * SteadyShot INSIDE image stabilization built into body\n   \n * Tele-zoom High Speed shooting at up to 7 fps with continuous AF\n   \n * Fast, accurate Phase Detection AF in all modes\n * Tilt and swivel 230K 2.7-inch LCD screen\n   \n * \n * 1080/60i/24p Full AVCHD or 1080/30p MP4 movies1\n * Clear Image Zoom extends the reach of any lens\n   \n * Accurate 15-point Auto Focus system; 3 cross sensors\n   \n * BIONZ image processor for high speed, low noise\n * HDMI output with BRAVIA Sync compatibility4\n   \n * Dynamic Range Optimizer (DRO) elicits shadow detail\n   \n * Stamina battery power for up to 500 shots5\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperience the Alpha SLT-A37, Sony's newest addition to their Alpha DSLR series. As the successor to the SLT-A35, the new SLT-A37 includes advanced features such as translucent mirror technology, a 16.1 MP resolution and BIONZ processor. Capture your moments precisely with Tele-zoom High Speed Shooting at up to 7 frames per second, complete with continuous auto focus. \n\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\nTRANSLUCENT MIRROR TECHNOLOGY\n\nWhile conventional DSLRs can only shoot or focus with the speed and precision of Phase Detection AF separately, the SLT\u2010A37 utilizes Translucent Mirror Technology that directs light to both the image sensor and the Phase Detection AF sensor simultaneously.\n\n\n\n16.1 MP RESOLUTION\n\n\nEnjoy incredible detail and gorgeous enlargements with the SLT-A37. Featuring APS\u2010C sensor size and Sony Exmor APS HD CMOS technology, the camera achieves high resolution with no penalty in low\u2010light sensitivity or sensor noise.\n\n\nSONY EXMOR TECHNOLOGY\nConventional image sensors use only a handful of analog-to-digital (A/D) converters, which can slow you down. The Exmor sensor provides more than 4,000 column-parallel A/D converters. This helps enable continuous shooting at up to 7 frames per second.\n\nISO 16000 SENSITIVITY\n\nWith the SLT-A37, you can enjoy incredibly clear low\u2010light pictures without sacrificing detail, made possible by the low\u2010noise Exmor APS HD CMOS image sensor and refined BIONZ image processor.\n\n\n\nSTEADYSHOT INSIDE\n\nImage stabilization reduces blur by compensating for camera shake. With SteadyShot INSIDE, image stabilization is built into the camera body itself. You'll reduce blur with every a\u2010mount lens, including macro and wideaperture standard zoom lenses. Typical DSLR systems build image stabilization into selected lenses only. \n\n\n\n\nTELE ZOOM HIGH SPEED 7 FPS SHOOTING\n\n\nThe Translucent Mirror makes it easier to capture those precise moments, while the Tele Zoom High Speed shooting mode shoots up to 7 fps at 8.4 MP and maintains continuous auto focus and auto exposure.\n\nHIGH SPEED AF FOR FULL HD MOVIE CAPTURE1\n\nWhen most DSLRs shoot video, their Contrast AF is slow and visibly \u201chunts\u201d for focus. The High Speed AF Full HD Movie retains the same fast, precise Phase Detection you enjoy for still images.1 It\u2019s a decisive advantage for tracking fast-moving subjects and a major benefit of Translucent Mirror Technology. \n\nBIONZ IMAGE PROCESSOR\nWith a BIONZ image processor, the chroma noise reduction delivers high-resolution, low-noise photos even at ISO 12800 sensitivity. Also enables up to 5.5 fps continuous shooting at full resolution, Sweep Panorama mode and more. \n\nAUTO PORTRAIT FRAMING\n\nSimply photograph a person and Auto Portrait Framing will save an additional, optimally framed image in portrait or landscape orientation. Combining Face Detection and By Pixel Super Resolution technologies with rule of thirds, Auto Portrait Framing provides beautifully composed and balanced full resolution portraits. \nCLEAR IMAGE ZOOM\n\nUtilizing Sony\u2019s exclusive By Pixel Super Resolution Technology, Clear Image Zoom increases the effective focal length of your lens up to 2x by digitally magnifying the center of your image with nearly imperceptible degradation. It virtually doubles the effective focal length of whatever lens you\u2019re using providing greater shooting flexibility. \n\nAUTO+ (ADVANCED AUTO) MODE\n\nGet cleaner, more dynamic pictures and fewer missed shots. Unifies and simplifies Sony intelligent technologies, the SLT-A37 automatically recognizes the correct scene mode, then quickly shoots and combines up to six shots to produce images with greater clarity, optimum dynamic range using Auto HDR technology and lower image noise using 6 shots layering technology.\n\nEYE\u2010LEVEL ELECTRONIC VIEWFINDER\nThe viewfinder displays your scene with clarity so you can fine\u2010tune every aspect of your image with confidence and achieve desired results. Its high\u2010end specifications include a notably wide 36.2 degree viewing angle and sharp 1440kdot resolution and provides 100% frame coverage. Exposure preview and informative overlays make operation easy.\nFULL HD 1080/60I/24P MOVIES1\n\nExperience super smooth 1080/60i/24p Full HD recording capability. Records in your choice of 1080/60i or 24p AVCHD format or in PC-friendly 1080/30p MP4 format.1\n\nSIX CREATIVE STYLE SETTINGS\n\nControl how the camera processes your images with six finishing styles: Standard, Vivid, B&W, Sunset, Portrait and Landscape. You can even fine-tune contrast, saturation, and sharpness to your personal taste. \n\nMULTI-FRAME NR\nExperience incredible low-light shooting without a flash. The camera captures six images in a fraction of a second. Combining the data from all six, it creates a single image with a reduction in noise equivalent to two additional steps of ISO sensitivity. Sensitivity selectable up to ISO 25600. (Recommended for still subjects.) \nHAND-HELD TWILIGHT\n\nGet cleaner and sharper nighttime pictures\u2014beyond the capability of traditional cameras\u2014without using flash or a tripod. The camera captures six images in a fraction of a second. Combining the data with separate algorithms for still and moving parts of the picture reduces blur, minimizes noise and enables extraordinary detail.\n3D SWEEP PANORAMA MODE3\n\nCapture vast scenic vistas and 16:9 shots in spectacular 3D. As you sweep across the panorama, the camera records separate right-eye and left-eye images that make landscapes come alive on your 3D television3. Records both JPEG and MPO file formats. \n\nTILT/SWIVEL 2.7-INCH 230K LCD DOT SCREEN\n\nTilt it up or down to frame high- and low-angle shots that would otherwise be hit-or-miss. Tilt and swivel under the camera for self-portraits. Fold it flush to the camera with the LCD exposed for shooting or protected for travel.\n\nFACE DETECTION AND SMILE SHUTTER TECHNOLOGY\n\nThe camera can automatically detect up to eight individual faces and adjust focus, exposure, white balance and flash to help deliver crisp, properly lit images of family and friends. It can also prioritize children or adults. The a37 allows you to capture a smile the moment it happens. Simply select the Smile Shutter mode and the camera takes the picture automatically and you can adjust the smile sensitivity. \nHDMI OUTPUT FOR HD VIEWING\n\nEnjoy HD movies and stunning still images on a compatible HDTV9. The camera includes an HDMI output. In addition, the BRAVIA Sync system works with compatible Sony BRAVIA HDTVs enabling you to control camera playback using the television's remote4.\n\nANTI-DUST TECHNOLOGY\n\nAnti-Dust Technology helps keep the CMOS sensor clean, resulting in consistently clear pictures. A static-free coating on the sensor's low-pass filter helps repel dust and the vibration automatically dislodges dust from the sensor. \n\nBUILT-IN AUTO POP-UP FLASH\n\nTo help you shoot more effectively, the built-in flash automatically pops up and fires as needed when the camera is set to certain scene selection modes. The built-in flash can also trigger a wireless accessory flash (sold separately). The integrated hot shoe enables you to expand your lighting options with a range of accessory flashes (sold separately).\n\nPHOTOTV HD COMPATIBILITY6\n\nOptimizes compatible BRAVIA televisions for gorgeous display of digital pictures.6\n\nUP TO 500 SHOTS OF BATTERY LIFE5\n\nTake up to 500 shots on a single charge with Sony Stamina battery power.5 Sony's InfoLITHIUM battery system enables you to see the percent of power remaining, so you can keep shooting in confidence.\n\nSIX CREATIVE STYLE SETTINGS\nControl how the camera processes your images with six finishing styles: Standard, Vivid, B&W, Sunset, Portrait and Landscape. You can even fine-tune contrast, saturation, and sharpness to your personal taste. \nSLOT FOR TWO MEDIA TYPES\n\nFor cost-effective, convenient storage and sharing of your images, the camera accepts Memory Stick PRO Duo/Memory Stick PRO-HG Duo and SD/SDHC/SDXC media (Class 4 or higher recommended). (Memory card is required. All are sold separately.) \n\nPOWERFUL SUPPLIED SOFTWARE\nTo help you refine and manage your images and video, the camera is equipped with computer software including Image Data Converter SR, Image Data Lightbox SR and Play Memories Home software8 \n * \n * \n\n1. 1.
