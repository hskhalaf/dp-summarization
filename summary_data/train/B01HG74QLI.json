I\u2019ve been using them awhile now and they are now notorious for being the spit rags that milk literally rolls right off of onto the floor. They are very soft and cute prints which is nice when I dab baby\u2019s mouth, but they really just don\u2019t get the job done. I ended up having to purchase some Aden and anais burp rags because I had a couple from my first baby and know they are large and super absorbent. I really wouldn\u2019t recommend these Burt\u2019s Bees ones unfortunately.",

YES, you have to buy burp cloths, and you should buy these ones. They are way softer and way more absorbent than other towels. These ones are great because the pleating makes it easy to make them wider/narrower, and the fabric is very absorbent, but also they stay on your shoulder. Very important! My only complaint is the same one I have of all burp cloths: why is there a tag? It just gets in your way; I\u2019ve cut all of mine off.",

I also place it on the mattress below where the baby's head goes in case she has any spit-up when first placing her down. My only complaint: At new & after many washes, much of the spit-up stays on top of the cloth instead of absorbing more into the cloth, so baby can dip their face back into the spit-up and cover themselves with it :( Note, these are almost identical to the cheaper \"Unisex-baby Newborn Gerber 3 Pack Knit Burpcloths\" (I have both, can't really tell a difference between them).",

That way, when she spits up, I dont have to change out the mattress cover. Good idea, but these are not long enough. Nor are they long enough to help restrain babies arms in the Snoo sack as Happiest Baby recommends.",

Also, they are super soft for baby's face and hold up nicely after the washing machine. Cute patterns, too. Would totally buy again.",
