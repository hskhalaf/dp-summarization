      "text": "This is a great monitor. I'm a professional photographer and I needed another monitor since I has having serious troubles color matching on my old one. Since I shoot a lot of models, and since most of the models and photographic professionals are on Instagram, I really wanted what was on the screen to match what the models would see on their phones. I know, right? The times we live in.... Anyway, I took the monitor out, plugged it into my MacBook Pro, edited a photo, and uploaded it to my phone. Without any callibration, the photos matched perfectly. All of the extra USB slots in the back and the ability to daisy chain monitors is also great. Thanks ViewSonic!",

We're ditching the supplied stands for something that will enable holding the monitor with its bottom edge touching the desktop and angled slightly up, a much better ergonomic position for extended use.",

The panel itself seems marginally above average for a typical IPS panel circa 2019-2020 though it still exhibits usual characteristics of IPS panels in general.

If I connect my wireless mouse (USB dongle) to the monitor, the mouse movement becomes erratic and pauses frequently. Moving it back to my MacBook Pro fixes it. Furthermore, there is NO firmware updater for this monitor for macOS. It's Windows only. Hello? It's 2019. Most people own Macs.",

The base is rather large, but of course that makes it more stable, and I simply place other items on top of the base, so essentially it doesn't take up much desk space. I like the adjustments, especially that you can swivel it without moving the base. It'll tilt, swivel and raise or lower to any position you may want. It's just the right size for my photo editing without being too large for my desk. Previously had Viewsonic monitors that gave me many years of service.",

I would use the monitor for the inspection standard and compared the image to the physical part. I also used it to review images sent from suppliers to compare colors visually. Now I also use them for my own personal monitors as they hold up well and have great color when looking at photos and watching videos. I highly suggest you consider this level of color accuracy as it makes a difference. This is more or less an entry level color accurate monitor but, if that makes a difference to you this is a great monitor at a great price.",

My recommendation if you are an artist is to just be aware that this is an IPS panel and screen burn is a reality. Don't leave your screen on full blast for more than 10 minutes unattended.
