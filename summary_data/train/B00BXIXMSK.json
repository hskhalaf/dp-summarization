Footing is a little slippery on the ropes, but these aren't designed for that. Leather material is awesome. Using the zipper after a match is way better than untying/unlacing.",

I do t know if this will be an issue because the product is legit and great quality. The zipper on the side makes getting them on and off easy. Lining seems to be quality padding and cotton/poly material that is comfortable on the leg since these go up to mid calf and is also absorbent. I am very happy I spent the $40 more than the Adidas shoes I usually buy and wear out in about 6-8 months of training.",
