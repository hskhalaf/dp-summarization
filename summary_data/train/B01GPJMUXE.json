My harley battery died over the winter (go figure) and was totally dead no lights at all. I figured instead of buying a new battery why not try this little trickler a try. Threw it on and let it sit for 24 hours. To my surprise the bike fired up with no hesitation, I was blown away that it actually worked. I give it 5 stars.",

My bike was dying over night.and this thing only took around 2hrs to charge from full dead.may have been faster but didn't check until 2hr. In short its well worth the $ in my opinion",
