So if your goal is to walk 30 minutes, you'd better be speed walking or keeping up a pretty fast pace every minute or you need a different way to track that. Pretty weak not to have that very common feature. If you're out of shape, slower paces might still be aerobic for you, but this gizmo doesn't \"think\" that way.",

Seems accurate (I often wear more than one pedometer to check against each other), love that it automatically resets each day, keeps a memory, keeps a separate tally of aerobic steps/time. One thing I didn't think I would necessarily use but have found invaluable is the CLOCK ... as I rarely wear a watch. Doesn't accidentally reset easily (has happened once) and the safety clip prevents a fall (has happened a couple of times). Definitely would recommend, in fact I'm buying a couple as gifts.",

I am an RN and work a variety of shifts and wanted to know which shifts I was the most active on and keep track of how busy I am each shift and this little guy helps keep track and accurately calculate that.

It fits snugly in my pocket, and I switch back and forth between miles -- so far today a bit less than two miles -- and steps -- 5,5665. Oh well, I do have to sit at my computer for several hours today, and I can rest on my 19,000 steps last Friday. Did I mention that I'm having fun?",

I found it's best to carry in a pocket or clipped on, as there's too much jiggling in a purse. I doubt it's totally accurate as to number, but keeping track of daily steps gives an incentive to increase the number daily - which is the whole point of a pedometer. Highly recommend using the tether to avoid dropping it.",

      "text": "This was a slightly different model than I have worn for the past 2 years, and at first, I wasn't sure about the slightly bulkier detachable clip holder. (The other one just had a spring-loaded clip on the back.) Once I got it on, though, I liked the larger display and was pleased to learn that this model can be placed in your pocket, or inside a purse, if needed, and it still appears to count steps accurately. Very pleased with my purchase.",

    "description": "AMAZON.COM\n\n\nPRODUCT DESCRIPTION: OMRON HJ-112 PEDOMETER\n No matter where you're going, make every step count with the HJ-112 Pedometer. Using Omron 2D smart sensor technology, this dual-axis pedometer tracks steps accurately, whether it's in your pocket, on your belt, or clipped to your bag.\n\nWHEN YOU KNOW YOUR NUMBERS, YOU'LL GROW YOUR NUMBERS\n You'd be surprised by how many steps you already take each day. A few hundred walking to the bus, a couple thousand going a few blocks down for lunch, and with an Omron Pedometer, you'll know just how many steps you're taking and begin looking for ways to see that number get bigger every day.\n\nEVERY STEP COUNTS\n Omron Pedometers use smart sensor technology rather than the standard pendulum system to get a more accurate reading. Many Omron Pedometers, including the HJ-112, can be programmed to your personal stride length to provide you with an even more accurate count.\n\nTHE OMRON HJ-112 PEDOMETER OFFERS:\nOmron Dual-Axis Technology--Counts steps accurately and quietly, whether positioned vertically or horizontally.\n\nAutomatic Reset--Start with a clean slate each day to track your steps more accurately.\n\nWeekly Log--Store up to seven days of information in memory; resets to zero at midnight, so you're ready to go every morning.\n\nSix Tracking Modes--Track steps, aerobic steps, time, distance, calories, and fat grams burned.\n\nTracking for Two Kinds of Steps--The HJ-112 tracks both regular and brisk steps separately.\n\nTHE OMRON HJ-112 PEDOMETER FEATURES:\nOmron HJ-112 Pedometer +View LargerOmron HJ-112 Pedometer Features +View LargerCompare full line of Omron Pedometers +View LargerA FEW STEPS TOWARD A HEALTHIER LIFE\n Walking is a great way to stay healthy. In fact, walking 10,000 steps a day is widely recommended by health and fitness professionals. And when you track your steps with a pedometer, like the Omron HJ-112, studies show you're likely to increase your total number of steps a day by about 2,000, or 1 mile.*\n\nGETTING STARTED\nWarm Up First--Before your walk, stretch (arm circles, hip circles, and leg lifts) to get your blood flowing and reduce the risk of injury.\n\nUse a Pedometer--Omron Pedometers are the partners you can count on when you want to accurately track your daily routine and help you reach your recommended 10,000 daily steps.\n\nSet Goals--Begin slowly and work your way up. By setting goals you'll push yourself farther and achieve more.\n\nMix It Up--Add variety to your routine by changing pace, walking uphill, or just changing your route.\n\nAdd Resistance--Include some upper-body exercises as you walk, such as arm reaches or carrying water bottles in each hand to increase your calorie burn.\n\n *JAMA. 2007; 298 190:2296-2304\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\n Omron HJ-112 Pedometer, lithium battery, holder, strap and clip, and instruction manual.\n\nCalorie Chart +View LargerTRADEMARK INFORMATION:\n Omron\u00ae\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nWhether you're taking a walk or taking steps to meet your fitness goals, you'll love how Omron's HJ-112 Dual-Axis Pocket Pedometer easily and accurately tracks your progress.
