More so, the new colorways that blend in perfectly for spring only give a refreshing look that suits the blossoming spring season.",

I got them for a great price, and they're still wearable so I'm happy. These ones will get more use on the thick socks days in the winter! I also was able to get another pair of keds (at regular price) that fit perfectly by going 1/2 size down! The cushioning sold them for me. I love the look of flat shoes but some flats are just so devoid of any comfort. These I can say feel really nice!! That's why I decided to get another (smaller) pair in a different color.",

      "title": "More Comfortable Than Regular Sneakers - Molds to My Feet!",
      "text": "This pair of Keds fits my feet just perfectly and they are so comfortable on my feet. You see I was concerned because I have very flat feet and when I stand or walk around in regular (non sneaker types of shoes), then I find that my feet ache. However, when I wear these Keds, even all day, my feet feel great. And I have tried many different support type of shoes and none worked for me. Strangely, the Keds work for me. So let me tell you this: These are 100% recommended by me and by my happy feet!",

      "text": "I bought the white leather sneakers for $38 at a DSW store awhile ago. Let me tell you, they do NOT last. I bought Keds hoping for a quality, practical, and stylish shoe that I could wear with anything for a few years. This is what you could expect a few years ago, that Keds were STRONG shoes. Well surprise, they barely lasted one season. The bottom sole of the shoe came unglue from the rest of the shoe, and most of the white leather chipped off leaving patches of brown. Looks terrible, no way worth my $40.",

Oh, and the heavy, ugly, orthopedic shoes recommended by my podiatrist. When I need a break from the ugliness or the heaviness I turn to my keds in 8.5 EE. Mind you, Amazon doesn't carry that size. I have to go to one of the other online vendors. I don't know if these are exactly like they were in my childhood. I just know that 8-8.5 in EE fits my deformed feet. I sort of wish I could get them here......",

They ran true to size and have enough support to be worn without my normal arch supports (I told you I was an old lady!). For just $25, they're a real bargain. I'll probably buy at least one more pair and maybe I'll be wild and get the red ones ;)",

She researched online and found there are others who report this same reaction to Keds shoes that are manufactured after 2011.",
