Eventually, the battery ran out and we retrieved it. I ignored all The reviews on this, but that was a mistake. Please, if you want to get an underwater drone, DO NOT CHOOSE THIS ONE!!!!!!!!!",

If you do buy one, make sure to buy a roller for the cord. Video is hard too see when it's really sunny, also have to watch out for small rocks and clam shells plugging the horizontal motor if you are close to the ground.",

The thruster has a front position, and what the drone does? Yes. It is nodding the head. And your video on your iPad's screen is shaking up and down with intervals of 1 seconds!!! So you can see nothing! It's a HUGE mistake of engineers! Guys. PowerVision is NOT a DJI!! I sold it on the next day after I tested it in my pool.",

I\u2019m super impressed with the subs quality and 4K video. I needed something that could operate with speed in the ocean current and maneuver fast out of the way of fishing lines and got it with this. Had a hammerhead bit down on her and it only got a little scratch, the plastic is super solid! Love the endless possibilities with this ROV and has been a great addition to our TV show.",

The set up and ease of use is a real bonus on this machine, we tested the total package on the Delaware River in swift currents and its performance was flawless. We have plans to use on our next adventure in the Florida Keys, testing underwater surveys on larger vessels and aiding in peir structures, piling inspections and of course looking at the under sea life in a whole new perspective. Need help or training or would like to setup a test drive feel free to reach out to our educators. DroneAcademy.net",

Simple to setup, no calibration, easy wifi connect and super easy controller. Drop it in the water and go, it will take some time to orientate the control of the ROV but once you have down its pretty straight forward. 4K camera is great if you have clear waters to dive in, it does take a bit if adjusting via the app to get the correct aperture settings. Overall I'm very happy with my purchase.",
