But I was wrong and don\u2019t have to lug it along any more. These lenses do the job very well. I believe these are the future and DLSR cameras will be history soon. The lenses are made with optical glass and the frames are made of solid metal. The clip has a soft pad in the interior so it won\u2019t scratch your phone. You can tell that this is a good quality product. I use the telephoto and the macro lenses the most. I love my Shuttermon lenses!",

Of equal importance is the follow-up e-mail that customers will receive giving a detailed description and use of the lenses. The sellers promptly and courteously responded to my question when I e-mailed them. I think the lenses are a great buy for the price paid.",
