I tried several cheaper brands, but none made rice as perfect as this one does. This rice cooker is small and doesn\u2019t take up much room, perfect for 1-3 people! Make sure to use the measuring cup the rice cooker comes with when measuring rice. Comes out fluffy and delicious every time, without being too wet or dry! EDIT: I\u2019ve since graduated college and live on my own, still using this rice cooker! It\u2019s still holding up great and works just as well as when I first bought it.",

There is no countdown timer until the last 9 minutes. Once cooked, it keeps track of how many hours the rice is kept warm. The display is really dim. It's hard to read where on the menu display the arrow is pointing to start cycles and also difficult to read the display time. I have to practically press my nose against the machine to tell what's on the display.",

Having a larger one can be a pain if you don't really need it. It doesn't look as premium as some of the more expensive ones(My mother would disapprove of it in her kitchen) but functionally does a good job. It's not a preasurized cooker, but it cooks the rice all the way in without making it dry and keeps the rice texture. It does other grains/beans as well too.",

My only complaint is if you're sleep deprived and accidentally pour rice into the cooker without the bowl, it falls beneath the floor and into the electrical compartment. You have to disassemble the entire chassis to get the rice out. My fault, but still it'd be nice if the two sections were compartmentalized. Some users complained about the smell, but I only smell something while I'm washing the bowl. Once it's dry there is no scent.",

I tried making congee (rice porridge) with it and the water bubbled out so the congee ended up thicker than I wanted even though I followed the instructions.
