There's enough give to them when walking that even when I'm walking at a fair pace, it doesn't feel like I'm slapping my feet on the pavement. The toe-box is surprisingly roomy, and the width is perfect, which is touch for me since I have relatively wide feet. I'm curious how durable the sole will be and how long it will last since it seems a bit soft, but as of now, I've no complaints and only compliments!",

Columbia makes some of the highest quality outdoor clothing and products in the industry and these shoes are no exception. Right out of the box, I could tell they were a high-quality pair of footwear. I put them on and didn't want to tal]ke them off! They are super comfortable and are still comfortable after wearing them all day. I ordered the black pair and have been wearing them as sort of a \"dress\" type of shoe, so I just ordered the gray ones to be my everyday type of shoe. Again, I cannot stress how comfortable and well made these shoes are.",

Mainly while pushing heavy things on smooth concrete, while climbing through gravel and while climbing up or down rocks. The shoe also has weak structure. The bottom of the shoe easily slips to the sides of my feet which creates unpredictable movement. The shoe overall isn't bad and it looks and feels nice however, it isn't what I need.",
