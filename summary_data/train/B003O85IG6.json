They are her all-time favorite markers, in fact she doesn't even use any of her old markers any more. She even loves the box they came in (even though I offered to get her a nicer permanent tote box or bag). Highly recommended and I will order more in the future as these get used up. Personally, I love the variety and scope of colors, and the shape of the markers allows for fine lines as well as shading and filling in. Nice!",

Since none of them have named colors on them, it'll be tough to tell if the 101st marker is a copy of one of the other hundred! What's more, they were less than $15 altogether, including tax! They all came in a compact box, which is tough to spread apart compared to the instructions. They sure work good, for markers that ain't Crayola! If you or someone you know loves drawing and coloring, try this little-giant marker set today!",

One stars, however, because there were 2 or 3 colors in the package that either had no pigment in the ink or were nearly used up or dried up (probably very little ink to begin with). Seller replaced original package, but the replacement package had the same problem. Very disappointing, since I am an artist relying on these colors to do several coloring courses for school students. I will be making art supply recommendations, and this set may not be included if I keep getting bad markers in the mix.",

I have my second for back up because I have 2 markers that I use a lot that are almost empty. Most of my first box are still going strong and I would recommend these markers to anybody.",
