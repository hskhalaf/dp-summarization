      "text": "I bought this for my husband after he kept having to use my \"girly\" scented products, and he's loved it. I was concerned about the overwhelming bourbon smell, thinking he might get pegged as a heavy drinker at work, but it's actually really subtle. It smells nice and clean and after one of his showers, the bathroom continues to smell really good. My favorite part is that it's cruelty free and is relatively natural without being sticky, drying, or rough like some other \"natural\" products out there. It lasts a while with the pump, so we've had it for a few months and now I'm back on here to re-order.",

That is not the case with Olivina body wash. It lathers up way easier with less product and the scent is so fresh and unique. My girlfriend loves it and says she can smell it on me all night after I shower. It also has natural ingredients and makes my skin feel better than those other brands. Best body wash out there. I will be trying the other scents after I run out of Bourbon Cedar.",
