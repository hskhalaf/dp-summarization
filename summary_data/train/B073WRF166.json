A fun new inflatable couch was just the thing. It took a minute for us to figure out how to inflate but the boys are loving it! Tip: you either need some wind to help with the inflating process or a long stretch of straightaway to run and inflate. Two runs or swipes into the wind gets enough air to roll it down and clip closed! I hope This review helps someone! We had a good 15 minuets of trial and error and looking a bit silly.",

It stayed inflated the hole time I was binging on Netflix, no issues. Then outside I just ran in a straight line for a few seconds to get enough air then twisted to seal and sat! Like other reviewers have stated the material does get a little hot in the sun, but what chair doesn't!!! Just bring a towel. Love this chair!!!!!",

You seal it like you would a dry bag, so you want to get at least 4 good folds on the end before cinching it shut. Kinda slipper too, but overall cool to have. The kids love it. I'm a larger than normal guy and it holds me, but it is a little tough getting out of it.",

Then just roll the end shut and clip the lock to hold it tightly closed. Ours sits in the TV room for the kids to use, and it has remained inflated for days at a time, so it seems air tight. When we need more room for other activities we can simply deflate this couch, and put it away in its little storage bag.",
