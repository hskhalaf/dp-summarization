      "verdict": "The Brooks Adrenaline GTS 17 was agreeable enough, according to many testers. The supportive and stable mid-sole worked well for a lot of them. There were those who also welcomed its cool design and its secure construction. Conversely, a number of runners weren\u2019t able to acclimate well to it; there were concerns about its sizing scheme, its width, and the responsiveness of its platform. But overall, many were able to enjoy this road stability running shoe.",

      "text": "Bought 3 pairs of the Gts 14 as they fitted so well, finally had to take the plunge and get some new ones. The reviews convinced me that these should fit the bill, but in reality they aren't the same 'fit' as the earlier ones. The 'fix' to stop the trainer wearing out when worn by those of us with odd shaped feet, the reinforced band just behind the big toe, has meant that these are now noticeably tighter. I thought they'd wear in but rather than doing so, in my case anyway, they have become more uncomfortable. Disappointed in the these but, in fairness, it may just be my odd feet shape.",

Hopefully these will be similar. The heel is higher than I was expecting but I was able to put in some good time when I broke them in last night. The colour looks great. One thing I do like is the lace eyelets. Although I have not had a problem with the other pairs these look more sturdy",
