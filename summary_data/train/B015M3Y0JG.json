I don't feel bloated every day which has help my jeans fit better so that's a plus! I'm curious to see what the long term effects will be but so far this product seems to be working well. I did get some cramps at first but like all literature on probiotics say, it's part of your body adjusting to the product. You will go the bathroom a lot! Luckily for me, my schedule is usually twice a day, so it's not the frequency of bathroom trips it's just you go a lot when you do go. It's been an interesting experiment.",

Eventually, I realized that I needed to start looking carefully at the labels on my supplements, too. I loved my probiotic, but it wasn't vegan so I knew that I needed to change. I'm so glad that I found Ora Organic Probiotics. Not only has it provided me with the probiotics I need, but I'm also staying animal-free. Two other benefits; it's about $20 cheaper than my previous probiotic and it doesn't need to be refrigerated (which is a pain when traveling)!",
