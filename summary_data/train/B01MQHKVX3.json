When I saw this car seat it was love at first sight. The new born mesh like insert is super soft and breathable compare to chicco keyfit 30. Very large canopy. I love the one button handle! Clicks in and out of base easily while feeling very secure. This base itself is great. So happy I snagged this on Prime day for under $130.00 when orginial price is $199.00. Only con is not many colors.",

We are very excited to use this for our little boy in a few short months. Seems very worth the price tag.",

My wife and I don't think the weight is too bad. Yes the canopy fits through handle snug but to me that is a minor issue. My number one worry about car seats is SAFETY of baby.

I was so incredibly excited, but was also nervous about the canopy from reading a couple of the reviews, but took the risk anyway. Well, although I love literally everything else about the car seat, the canopy is so disappointing. Makes it really difficult to adjust the arm bar because the canopy is so bulky. They are basically the same exact size, so they clash rather than smoothly flow together. I see a lot of difficulty with it in my future, and am sadly thinking about returning it. This carseat would be amazing if it wasn't for that. It really needs to be redesigned.",

      "text": "After countless hours of researching car seats I finally landed on this one. It only took a few minutes to install and I was able to purchase an extra base for my husbands vehicle. I love how far the canopy comes down to help keep the sun out of my daughters eyes (and to keep unwanted hands from touching her while out and about). The only complain I have about it is the lack of space between the handle and the canopy. If you want to pull the canopy down you have to wiggle it passed the handle. It has great safety ratings though and my daughter seems cozy in it. Overall it\u2019s a great purchase.",

I think with the tallness is because i still have the head thingy in making the shoulder strap be off alittle. Overall personally I do recommend this Car Seat",

Will try to update after baby uses it.",

Base installation is the best I've ever seen, it's super quick and there's absolutely no question about the security of the base. My only gripe with this carseat is the lack of brackets on the backside of the carrier to attach it to a shopping cart. Every other carseat I've owned had these, and the lack of makes shopping precarious.",
