I got the XL side so there's enough room and I wouldn't have to stretch it. 3 DAYS after wearing it, the stitching has all busted, the Velcro is already coming off. This is very very upsetting to know I spent $30 on something that did not last me even a week. Now I will have to spend another $30 on another belt elsewhere because I really need it and that is not fair at all.",
