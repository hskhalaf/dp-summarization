My only issue is that she wished the case has a small strap that could be held around the wrist if you don't want to hold the phone in your hand. Over all this is a great product. Improve the wrist strap and it would be 5 stars.",

I have a liquid screen protector and this hasn't affected it, so it fits nice and snug.

This is also due to the fact that bills must be folded to fit inside. Then again, if it was long enough to accomodate the full length of the bills, it would make the wallet an inch or so longer than the phone, which might be awkward. Oh well... I'll let the engineers figure that one out. ;-)",
