Other then that dialog sounds very garbled in them too. I noticed while unpacking the back speakers had very noticibly different zip ties on the cords. I think I was sent out one that was defective a repackaged. That is potentially supported by the fact that when picking up the box the bottom fell out as the sealing sticker on it was apperently loose. Going return. Right now I am not happy.",

It's not really a true 5.1 surround sound unless you plug it into a true surround sound card. Few things have that card except maybe for some scattered computers. Nonetheless, the fake surround sound isn't too bad. Better than listening to the tinny TV speaker by a long shot. Make sure you have audio OUT ports on your TV (either a headphone jack or RCA).",

I went to try to return the product only to find that it is not returnable; however, after a one minute phone call with Amazon, I was told that I would be provided with a full refund of the product even though it couldn't be returned.

The two front speakers have it the worse, and even if I turn the volume as low as 2 or 3, you can still hear it. But if anything is playing, I don't notice the sound.",

There's no remote so it's not ideal for a large room. For a larger home theater setup I'd recommend a combo of surround sound amplifier and speakers.

I expect that a system should be able to handle sound almost to a maximum volume level before distortion. I feel distortion happens around 80-85%. It isn't bad, though, considering the little speakers are just that: little. I am very pleased with it and the bass is pretty neat.",

Another issue is that the speakers aren't wall mount, so I had to use double sided sticky tape to hang them up. Also, the cords aren't nearly long enough.

If the sound is not good then that is because of the media but not because of the speakers. I tested it. I'm glad to get this kind of speakers for this price. Extremely satisfied and I hope it will stay this way. Yes, lot of wires but can't complain for the price.",

Even after going through the Logitech site for guidance I struggled. Eventually I got this hooked up and working, but the struggle made me not like this as much as I wanted to like it. Some troubleshooting for novice users would be helpful! The sound quality is OK for a basic system that we only use for Netflix and kids PS4 games, in a small living room. There is no remote, which for us works well since the kids can't randomly turn up the sound.",

The speaker quality sounds great especially for the price. BUT look closely at the low star percentages. It seems that there is a 1 in 4 chance you will be receiving a defective product.
