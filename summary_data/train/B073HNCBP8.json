The volume control is counterintuitive by requring you to roll the volume up to turn it down, and then to roll the volume down in order to turn it up. This was used once or twice a month for a CD, so I was hoping it would last longer. Started with the radio not working, then more and more CDs seemed to skip. Finally, the power would no longer turn on.",
