I have come to learn and understand over the years that your phone is only as good as your service, but your service can FAR surpass the goodness of the phone. Therefore, I must say that I love Boost Mobile [for which this particular version of the HTC EVO was made]. I get great service from them, and stick with them instead of getting my iPhone with another company. That having been said, this phone is pretty nice. It has most of the bells and whistles, for about a third to a quarter the price of the aforementioned iGadget. I love it, and use it a LOT.",

I will never buy another HTC!",

The shipping was quick got it from the mailman within 2 days. I upgraded from the Rush phone. I dnt see the hype why its a 300$ phone. Look into improving the battery life.",

Its about the same size of an I Phone and it looks like one too. Crisp image and lots of features, really like the Hot-spot option when you have your laptop and want to access the web on the run. I really recommend this phone if you want to save money and hate bulky phones that wont even fit in your hands.",

That said for a quarter of the price it does the same thing so it's more than worth it in my opinion. Great value for the money especially with boost unlimited, I have everything I need in a smartphone without having to break the bank!",

The phone so far has been amazing. It's not particularly intuitive, so I downloaded the entire manual to be able to take advantage of all it has to offer. There are LOTS of features I would not have known about had I not read it.",

    "description": "Connect with your world wherever you are with the HTC Evo Smartphone. The Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) Operating System allows you to complete any task. *SIM Card not included\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\nDual-mode 3G/4G (View larger.) EVO Design 4G runs Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) (View larger.) 4-inch QHD Capacitive Touchscreen Display (View larger.)  The HTC EVO Design 4G offers a dual-mode 3G/4G experience on Boost Mobile.\n\nFeaturing a 5 MP rear-facing camera and a 1.3 MP front-facing camera, the EVO Design 4G lets you view it all on the 4-inch QHD capacitive touchscreen display. The EVO Design 4G runs Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich).\n\nKEY FEATURES\n * Android 4.0 ICS with HTC Sense\n * Dual-Mode 3G/4G\n * 4-inch QHD Capacitive Touchscreen Display\n * 5 MP Rear-Facing Camera with Flash and Video\n * 1.3 MP Front-Facing Camera\n * SMS, MMS, E-mail\n * Wi-Fi Capable\n * Stereo Bluetooth\n * Mobile Hotspot\n * Visual Voicemail\n * Boost Zone\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n * Internal Memory: 768MB (RAM)/4GB (ROM)\n * External Memory: up to 32GB (2GB SD Card included)\n * Headset Jack: 3.5mm\n * Battery: Li-ion 1520mAh\n * Video files supported: 3GP, 3GPP, 3G2, 3GPP2, MP4\n * Audio files supported: MP3, MIDI, WAV, M4A, AMR, OGG\n * CDMA EVDO capable\n * Network: CDMA EVDO Rev A/ WiMax\n * Chipset: MSM8655 (1.2GHZ)\n\nVITAL STATISTICS\nThe EVO Design 4G weighs 5.22 ounces and measures 4.8 x 2.4 x 0.5 inches. Its 1520 mAh battery is rated at up to 6 hours of talk time.\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\nHTC handset, Battery, Charger Head, USB cable, 2 GB microSD Card, Printed Materials\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANDROID ICE CREAM SANDWICH OPERATING SYSTEM\nThe HTC EVO Design 4G runs the Android 4.0 operating system (dubbed Ice Cream Sandwich), which adds powerful new ways of communicating and sharing while improving on the best Android features: easy multitasking, rich notifications, customizable home screens, resizable widgets, and more.\n\nThe new Ice Cream Sandwich interface features an onscreen navigation bar that replaces the hardware buttons for Back, Home, and Menu found with older Android-powered phones. And with Google+ integration, you can video chat with groups of up to 9 friends as well as easily upload and share photos and videos. Other features include:\n\nFace Unlock\nYou can now unlock your phone with just your face using the Face Unlock option. It takes advantage of the front-facing camera and state-of-the-art facial recognition technology to register a face during setup and then to recognize it again when unlocking the device. Just hold your phone in front of your face to unlock (or use a backup PIN). \n\nAnd the lock screen now lets you do more without unlocking. From the slide lock screen, you can jump directly to the camera for a picture or pull down the notifications window to check for messages. When listening to music, you can even manage music tracks and see album art. \n\nHome Screen Folders\nQuickly access related apps right from the home screen by organizing apps and shortcuts into folders--just drag one app onto another to create a folder.\n\nMultitasking\nMultitasking is even easier and more visual in Android 4.0. The Recent Apps button lets you jump instantly from one task to another using the list in the System Bar. The list pops up to show thumbnail images of apps used recently--tapping a thumbnail switches to the app. \n\nVoice Input\nThe new voice engine in Android 4.0 lets you dictate the text you want, for as long as you want, using the language you want. You can speak continuously for a prolonged time, even pausing for intervals if needed, and dictate punctuation to create correct sentences. As the voice input engine enters text, it underlines possible dictation errors in gray. After dictating, you can tap the underlined words to quickly replace them from a list of suggestions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOST MOBILE SHRINKAGE\nTHE LONGER YOU STAY, THE LESS YOU PAY\nWelcome to Shrinkage - an easy way to save. Here's how it works: For every six on-time payments, Boost will lower your monthly payment by $5.\n\nWhile it's best to make regular on-time payments each month, payments do not have to be consecutive. If you miss a payment, you do not have to start over. The on-time payments made to the account will still be credited toward your next savings milestone.\n\nNew customers simply need to activate on a Monthly Unlimited with Shrinkage plan. Existing customers must visit \"My Account\" to sign up and receive savings.\n\nPlans with Shrinkage After Six On-Time Payments After 12 On-Time Payments After 18 On-Time Payments Monthly Unlimited $45 $40 $35 Android Monthly Unlimited $50 $45 $40 BlackBerry Monthly Unlimited $55 $50 $45 Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA), also known as CMAS, is a part of a national alerting system called IPAWS (Integrated Public Alert and Warning System) that enables emergency management officials to rapidly disseminate the warnings and safety information via text alerts to wireless phones based on the phones\u2019 geographic location. The Federal Emergency Management Agency or FEMA is responsible for receiving the alerting information and forwarding the alerts to participating wireless carriers such as Sprint. Such alerts may come from the President of the United States; the National Weather Service, state or county public safety officials.
