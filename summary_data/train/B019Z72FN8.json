The bad: it's not powerful (forget cutting something thick), the batteries don't last long ... At least you get two..., Edging isn't very accurate and will take some getting used to, the length of line you're allowed isn't large so cut radius is small and it's easy to bump the line feed accidentally. If you have a medium yard or bigger go gas. If you have something relatively small with no thick brush, get this.",

The line feed feature is great and works well. A single battery lasted for all trimming and edging front and back. Battery didn't give up till the last bit was at hand. The edge trimming feature works perfect, a simple pull and twist motion turns it from trimmer to edger and back again. Lightweight, comfortable to use. Would definitely recommend.",

I can't finish trimming my yards on just one battery, though. If the battery lasted longer, I would say this trimmer is ideal. However, as long as you buy the version that comes with two batteries, you'll be just fine.",

The batteries don't last nearly as long (glad I have my old ones) and the line doesn't last any time for edging (which is odd because I used the same line in my previous one), it works ok for trimming, but don't buy this for the edger if you have very much to edge, might try a different brand.",

But the B&D gets the job done after mowing. As I have aged it being light is a plus. It also uses the same 20V batteries used on my other new lawn care items I have bought from B&D. The string issue is the only thing I worry about. It does appear to use more string than I would like per use. The button to extend the string is a great idea. But I feel I bush it more than I would like.",
