Go back to the previous version. I had purchased the Scrabble Deluxe Edition Game (Amazon Exclusive) in December , Amazon please bring back Scrabble Deluxe Edition Game (Amazon Exclusive) which was better. You could store all everything inside the bottom of the game. And clean up was quick and easy.",

Even the printing on the board is low-quality, with many smudges in the ink. Hasbro should be ashamed and embarrassed to sell something this low quality.",
