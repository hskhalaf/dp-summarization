I purchase two beach chairs, and found that they carried a 190# rating - I weigh about 230#, so I bought this chair. It was rated at 250#, so I didn't expect and issue. On the third day of use at the beach, the main legs folded over and broke. The chair was junk. I have never had a product preform this poorly, in this short of a time. I would NEVER purchase a RIO product again.",

The design has changed; presumably for easier shipping, but now there is a hard metal bar that hits you in the back and the \u201clay flat\u201d support is another folding bar. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s cheaper to ship this way from China, but if everyone returns it because it doesn\u2019t match the picture - is it really cheaper? Disappointing.",

This chair is a little lighter, but I wish it had the backpack-style carry strap; the shoulder strap is extremely uncomfortable. The key benefit of this chair is, it doesn't have the solid metal bar under the front of the seat. So that doesn't dig into your thighs, and you can stretch out comfortably. And I LOVE the adjustable back, that's why I stayed with this company instead of going to another brand. The adjustable seat back is what really takes the cake. ... though I do wish it had a headrest :P",

Only other negative is it's actually not very easy to adjust. It doesn't slide very easily and gets stuck, and usually takes me a few min to finally adjust it to where I want it to be.

I ordered the green which shows a bent bar in the pic however my chair has a straight bar. That said - it's not bad at all. Most folks sit with a towel on their chair anyway, which softens the feel of the bar. 4 stars is appropriate because it's a pretty great chair aside from head comfort! For the price - hard to beat.",
