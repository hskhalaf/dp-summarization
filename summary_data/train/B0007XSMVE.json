I applied this to my face 5 times, just for my friend to say, I think I see some color. I did put on my legs and it worked, and lasted for days. One of my friends is fare skinned, but tans naturally and the other is friend it Japanese and Caucasian. They both get great color from this product.",

I finally found Shiseido and went with it because out of all of the self-tanners, this had the best reviews. I exfoliated and did everything right. I was actually very calculating with my application- the next day, streaks. I decided to do it again that evening to hopefully fill in the gaps. It just made it worse. I am not sure what the solution is out there, but this isn't it.",

The gels of recent years have been especially good, and Shiseido's Brilliant Bronze Self-Tanning Gel stands out among all of them. It goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly without that unpleasant sticky period, and produces a lovely bronze glow that's heightened after two or three days of repeat applications. Like all bronzing products, there's an less attractive phase if you stop to use the product, but a single re-application makes it all good again. The price is pretty typical, but here you're paying for one of the finest bronzing gels you can get.",
