I dress casual with khakis and mostly blue stripped shirts so I picked the blue one. No regrets on that. I really prefer this model over a Rolex submariner. I\u2019m a Bond fan, what else have to say. The anti reflective sapphire is awesome. I bought like 8 NATO straps. I love to change them according to the situation. I bought the watch 2 months ago and I\u2019m still in love.",

I am at an APO address, so I was concerned about potential theft in transit and various potential shipping delays. None of that happened. I took it to a local German Omega retailer and they sized the band for a small fee - they were kind and professional. I\u2019m very happy with all aspects of this purchase.",
