      "text": "I love native shoes and had very high expectations but have found two major problems 1. despite wearing the shoes constantly for a few days to scuff up the bottoms - they still slip on my gym floor making them impossible candidate as workout shoes. 2. I washed them, and put them on after washing and drying to discover they had shrunk, my foot still fits but it now slip out at the heel when i move actively. They are now only a pretty shoe, not a practical shoe. Such a bummer, i LOVE my other Native shoes.",

The heel is thin enough for flexibility, but thick enough to provide enough comfort. They do slip off my heel sometimes, but that's because of the cut and design of the shoes. I want a second pair!",
