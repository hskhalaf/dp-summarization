I can't recommend this enough. Everything else is trash that you will only get a season or two out of before it strts to crack or drip. It's 1000% worth the little extra price.",

In my opinion, it is better to buy a cheap nozzle and through it away when it fails instead of buying a well made expensive product that fails at the same rate with no product support to fix Its simple problem.",

And sometimes hard to regulate it to a gentle spray to water vulnerable seedlings. When you turn it down it has a tendency to dissolve into a dribbling mess rather than staying in a distinct spray but at a lower pressure. Still happy with it though.

Downside to this is you have to twist it through the settings and to turn it on off. Slight downside.",

They are both good, but not exceptional as the original. Not sure what the difference is, but these aren't made as well as they used to be. Still better than most nozzles though.",

Exactly what I needed. The jet stream mode isn't as powerful as the cheap-o pistol like nozzle I had before. Not sure why. I think because it just doesn't narrow down the stream as effectively.

I have no gripes about the amount of water it delivers, though. Update 3/2012: Still working, but the uniformity of the pattern is degrading somewhat. When set to \"fan\" out, it is as if some grit may have got into the mechanism so the water pattern is uneven. Other than that, its working well. 2010 update still valid.",
