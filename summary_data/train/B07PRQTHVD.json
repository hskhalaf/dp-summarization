I have sensitive skin to begin with and I ended up with bruising that almost looked like a small hickey lol.

But when you get into the nitty gritty of is this device actually removing or reducing my clogged pores, my answer was fortunately no. I tested each head of the suction power, it was absolutely as hardcore as my skin could take, I have no idea if this is just a personal problem and I have exceptional thin skin or something like that, but I truely couldn't use the vacuum on my forehead, cheek, or chin without developing a bruise. In my case, this meant doing pretty much nothing.",

It works so well that can give addiction and easily become dangerous.

There is a learning curve to using it without leaving redness on your skin but if you follow the instructions you should be fine. The reason for only four stars: I wish that there had been better cleaning instructions included (the filter...are you supposed to clean the tiny filter? How often are you supposed to change it? Where can you purchase more tiny filters?)",

It definitely takes some getting used to and adjusting the suction power according to what region you're going over. I really loved the roller ball attachment as it has helped the bruising. I also follow the suggestion of putting ice on your face after use and that has helped as well. I'm very happy with this product and have noticed my pores getting smaller!",
