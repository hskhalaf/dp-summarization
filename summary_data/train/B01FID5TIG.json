Semi-major: The display gets dimmer and dimmer as you view it more and more from below horizontal. This is a problem if you hang it on the wall above sitting eye level or use the built in stand on a high shelf, as the stand tilts it backwards (towards being dim). Minor: The indoor and outdoor readings are the same color and size, and so are the indoor and outdoor humidity readings. If you are close to it, you can see the tiny text indicating which is which, but from across the room you have to know and remember which is which.",

With the remote sensor standing not far from the display, you got differing indoor/outdoor readings in both temperature and humidity. Not major differences, though, and at times they agreed. Secondly, the remote sensor has a mounting screw on the curved upper portion of the unit, so if you have it secured tightly (so it won't get blown or knocked off), the unit doesn't hang straight (see photo).",
