But it is so mild it does not bother me. ..which is a miracle. What it does do is make my dry and often tired eyes feel much better. And Bonus-it forces me to sit back and relax for a few minutes, I spray it with warm water , turn heat to 5, and lay back for 10 top 20 minutes... Love it!!!!!!",

It doesn\u2019t make contact with the eyelid, but the convenience of electricity for the 5 temperature settings and time in 10 minute increments with auto shut off when time is up. I\u2019m sold, would recommend and would buy for a friend.",
