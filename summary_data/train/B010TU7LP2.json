Have played with other couples before and \"alliances\" certainly form - in our game, each couple was secretly not screwing over their own significant other (e.g. stealing their cards, putting the exploding kitten where it would hurt them, etc), but this later turned into a guys vs. girls game because the girls were winning so often!

We just watched the video, played a practice round, and then for round 2 we were all set and loved it!

The nsfw version is hardly explicit at all i mean after a while you dont even really read the cards you just know you need defuse cards and avoid the exploding kittens. But the downside is the quality of the cards, very poor quality put into the one and only thing you use.....CARDS! After 2 or 3 games we had the exploding kitten cards start to come apart at the corners, unacceptable!!! and we were very gentle with shuffling and gameplay. Fun game, poor product!!",

While the couple it was purchased for did enjoy playing it all the other couples, including myself, found it very confusing and not really funny at all. The cards do have off colored jokes and sayings on them but there is no part of the game where it is required to read them so I saw no point. The couple it was purchased for said that it does get more fun as you become more familiar with the rules but we only played one hand and no one was disappointed to move on to another game.",

I like that it is portable and on its own case bug the instructions were poorly written and having to watch a video was a little time consuming. Probably would not recommend this.

I have purchased and played both editions and prefer the standard edition because once you've seen the funny NSFW cards a couple of times, you stop pointing them out and just refer to their type \"Skip, Attack, Nope, etc.\" I think it plays best with 4 or 5 players. Its more interactive and there are more exploding kitten cards in play compared to a 2 or 3 player game.",

Also, the NSFW pack isn't really all that.. you're better off buying the original in my opinion.

In this highly-strategic, kitty-powered version of Russian roulette, players draw cards until someone draws an exploding kitten, at which point They explode, they are Dead, and they are out of the game -- unless that player has a defuse card, which can defuse the kitten using things like laser pointers, belly rubs, and catnip sandwiches. All of the other cards in the deck are used to move, mitigate, or avoid the exploding kittens. This nsfw version of the game contains the full version of exploding kittens, but the artwork on each card has been replaced with content too horrible/amazing to be used in the original exploding kittens game. The nsfw edition can be played with 2 to 5 players or combined with another deck to play with up to 9 players.",
