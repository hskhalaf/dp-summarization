The new gameplay mechanic (skylines) is a cheap trick to make combat/travel seem more interesting in adverts, it does not. It allows for an easy escape from combat and provides no assistance to travel as they are only located in combat specific areas. If you liked the previous Bioshock games then stay away from this one.",

The first time through I felt a little lost. - the ending was quite emotional for me, particularly the second time when I understood it better. - when it ended, I wanted to go back.",

Sky cities, airships, and a storyline worthy of a science fiction book award This game will have you dangling for your life, shooting bad guys in a world where the crazies have taken over the asylum. Based in an alternative timeline, infinity takes post American civil war issues and builds a world around it. Like the real world it deals with some adult issues that some people may find distasteful however,fear not because you are one of the good guys. You are out to right the wrongs and save the heroine!",

Main criticism would be that there is very little flexibility in plot progression. They have a story to tell and you follow the plot. No scope to go off the beaten track or develop your own storyline. Battles wouldn't be overly taxing....but that's a minor complaint. Overall a highly enjoyable game to play none the less.",

It doesn't quite have the same atmosphere style of the original but it's a pretty good attempt and will be a game you play more than once.",

Forced to trust one another, Booker and Elizabeth form a powerful bond during their daring escape. Together, they learn to harness an expanding arsenal of weapons and abilities, as they fight on zeppelins in the clouds, along high-speed Sky-Lines, and down in the streets of Columbia, all while surviving the threats of the air-city and uncovering its dark secret.\n\nUse a variety of weapons and \u2018vigor\u2019 powers to defeat your enemies (Click here for a larger image) GAMEPLAY\nBioShock Infinite is a first-person shooter with role-playing elements.

Booker gains powers and abilities by using \u2018vigors\u2019 and wearing gear that are found through Columbia.
