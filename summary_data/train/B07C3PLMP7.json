The wide blade is great for heavy duty chopping and scooping. The rounded blade is great for those long chopping sessions or fine mincing. The handle is beautiful and it has stayed fairly sharp, all though I sharpen it frequently. It\u2019s a show stopper and not only is it functionally a great knife but people commonly comment on how beautiful it is!",
