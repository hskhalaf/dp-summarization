However the last two cases I bought were too mushy in consistency as if there was something wrong with the formula, or perhaps the formula had changed. My dog wont eat it anymore. I have since bought a couple of cans from Petco to check and the consistency was much firmer like it always had been. I am not sure what to do now, I do not feel like buying it again from Amazon and then dealing with returning it if it is still mushy... Perhaps someone at Amazon can look into this for us? I read another review with exactly the same issue.",

When you open a can of this, it's got a fatty gray substance on the surface. Its extremely sticky also. Watch for choking accidents. No kidding! Bought a case from pet shop near by. Great texture! Not sticky! Beau loved it! Hes been a little constipated lately, glad we were able to get a good case of fresh food! Also, most were dented. Showed you that Amazon is selling second rate dog food stuff. Buyer beware. Also, pet store sold it at a slightly lower price... Something else to consider I think!",
