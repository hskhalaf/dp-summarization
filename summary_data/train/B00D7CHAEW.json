No idea why this happened so quickly, my father is a 130 LB non hiker. These shoes shipped out quickly on July 26th, it is now early September and they are TOAST. Have not got a response from merrell customer service and don't really expect to as they really don't owe me anything. IMO quality isn't there anymore in 2016, something is wrong.",

They'll have to be replaced with something better, so factor that in to your budget. Merrell can afford to provide better insoles - very disappointing. The wide toe box is a bit roomier, if you have a wide forefoot. Sole feels like it should provide good stability and grip. Will update review after putting them through their paces.",

I thought, \"let me get some non-waterproof ventilators and I'll have a version for summer.\" WRONG. The ventilators have a different heel cup. My Rovers are super comfortable walking or standing. I stand A LOT. While hiking and/or running in the ventilators might be great, standing in them isn't. The heel cup is very small and put pressure on my heels. After a few hours of wearing them, I was in pain. Had to return them.",

My suggestion in deciding what size to purchase is maybe buy them a little larger than you would a normal dress shoe especially if you plan on wearing them with anything thicker than a fairly thin sock or barefoot.",

This is good shoe for day hiking on groomed trails, but the sole is too light for use as a hiking shoe for walking cross country or on primitive trails. I have gone thru Adidas, Nike's, and Reebock's in this class of shoe and the Moabs are the winner, at least for my feet.",

Walking on pavement you are gonna have a rough time unless your feet are cast out of stone, they are just not designed to cushion on a hard unyielding surface without putting in a better insole.

      "text": "ive been wearing these as my everyday shoe for about 3mo now, while they are not waterproof as some have said they have gotten me though my daily city, suburban, rural and festival journeys quite well, they were comfortable from the first hours i had them as they are now. no break time required as so many others have also stated. the one drawback i would say is that the soles dont seem to provide much grip, or as much grip on wet stone or pavement as i would like from a 'hikeing' shoe, but that could be my over expectations. TLDR: comfortable all day from day one, worth the cost.",
