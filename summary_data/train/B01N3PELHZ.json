It comes with two speakers so you can place them in whichever room suits you. It is loud and can be heard clearly. It is also weatherproof. The ringer part stays lit so it's easy for someone to find in the dark. I would highly recommend. It is definitely worth the money.",

Instructions for pairing the transmitter (the button beside the door) and the receivers are easy to follow and yes, there are many 'ringtone' options, but you will have to cycle through them in order to choose. Each receiver can be set to a different ringtone and a different volume. For a unit with two receivers, this is a competitive price.",

Only gave this a 4 star rating because for all the chimes it has, there really isn't just a ding-dong sound. There's horses neigh'ing, alien spacecraft noises, EDM type noises, but not just a simple ding-dong. Somewhat disappointing since I don't want my house to sound like a video game when someone rings the doorbell.",

There are a multitude of chimes/music for you to choose from, but the bonus in my opinion, is the backlight when someone rings the doorbell. Many of the other wireless doorbells I browsed on Amazon, did not have this feature. Win-win, people! Don't hesitate to purchase this one.",

Range is excellent, even in a large, 2 story house. Volume easy to adjust from soft to really loud. I liked product so much, I bought a second set for my own house. Ripped out the old wired system and installed this. However, my dog informed me the \"barking dog\" sound effect was not acceptable. Neither was the \"whining cat\".",

It has a bunch of tones, and the only really \"negative\" about this is that you can only switch tones in a single direction... if that makes sense. If you accidentally push the button to the next tone, instead of pressing a \"back\" button you have to cycle through all the tones. Big whoop. If you don't want to break the bank, buy this. If you're annoyed because it seems cheap, that's on you.",
