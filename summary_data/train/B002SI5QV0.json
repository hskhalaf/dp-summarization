I finally contact them, and they (ta da!) offered me 10% off the next pair i'd buy another. Look for something else!",

They're light, cover the eyes well, did not obscure my view at all, and felt like they weren't even there. Here in Atlanta with all the crud in the Spring air I think they will also help keep that out as well. For $35 I am quite pleased.",

The design around the nose can be aesthetically improved. Lastly, the price can be lower, albeit this brand is already far cheaper than the glasses produced by Luxottica (Google Luxottica 60 minutes to learn more about glasses industry). It cost a few dollars to produce these glasses and without any special polarized lens $30 is not justified.",

Rated four stars because my head hurt more than usual after an hour of shooting. This is probably related to the ear pieces (which are longer than those found on range-specific glasses) being compressed by the hearing protection. So for those of you who are going to wear these as everyday sunglasses, I doubt you'd have the same issue.",

When I nitpick though, the center nose things block my vision in the middle slightly and the lenses scratch a bit too easily for my taste. I don't even recall putting them down!

Well, I found the solution; these JiMarti sunglasses are lightweight, fit snugly (do not slip AT ALL), are very comfortable, and provide very good protection from the glaring sun. On top of everything else, they look rather sharp! Considering how great this pair of shades is, the price is unbelievably competitive. Not having purchasing JiMarti sunglasses previously, the product turned out to be far better than expected.",

Wearing it regularly makes the skin around my eyes lighter than the rest of my face. Oh well!",
