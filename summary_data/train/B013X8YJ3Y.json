And I get all this without the need for a cable or satellite subscription. And the picture is Amazing!

Also it is annoying that I cannot watch HBO now through TiVo. You can watch HBO Go, but the point of being on TiVo is to be cord free, and HBO GO is only available if you're paying for cable.",

Even the initial setup did not work, it took several software updates to even get the cable to work.

It's super quick, great interface, has a year's worth of programming guide and service included. The 4k on Amazon looks amazing and works great with a 4K Vizio tv.
