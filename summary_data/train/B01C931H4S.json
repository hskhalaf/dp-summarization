      "text": "This guitar is an super-ok guitar, i have 0 complaints, $150 well spent, only thing you have to remember is they do not stretch the strings so when you get the guitar and tune it, you have to stretch the strings yourself, i didnt know that and was getting bad buzzing from my E string, but after realizing the strings were not stretched i stretched and re-tuned and the guitar sounds 100 times better! just thought id share that with the rest of you.",

If you are a beginner, as I am, it is very important to have this guitar set up by a professional. The action from the factory is quite high and frustrating if you're new to guitar. Lowering the bridge and filing the nut, in addition to new strings, completely changes it and makes it so much easier to play.",

Have owned several top end guitars, but just wanted something to play, out on the porch, at night. The sound is amazing. I did put lighter gauge strings on it, and lower the action just a bit. But a few bucks of added expense makes it play several hundred dollars better. .. impressed, even as it came out of the box.",

The action is a little high, but if you spend an extra $30 dollars at guitar center having them set it up correctly and adjust the action for you (takes about 20 minutes) You end up with a guitar worth much much more than $200. I played this and compared it to a $900 Martin guitar. This blew away the Martin. It was louder richer and the strings rang and sustained longer and richer. I am blown away, no, completely blown away. I find myself wanting to play this guitar every single day, without finger fatigue. I recommend replacing the strings with some good strings. It's worth it. Completely happy with this purchase.",
