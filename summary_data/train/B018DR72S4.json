After the first wash, it already had the appearance of being washed a dozen times. After a few more washes it started to tear at the seams. It just looked awful. We maybe got a few months of use out of it. I would try something else.",

Only thing im not too happy with is the price. I feel like it's overpriced for basically just a huge couch sock. Could be like $25, same you would pay for a more durable,protective mattress cover. overall good product and you get exactly what you see in the picture",

There's enough substance to the fabric that I don't feel like it's going to tear. I haven't washed it yet but it seems like it'll be fine in cold water.",

The second piece (the cushion cover) was square shaped, very small and tight so it actually kind of deformed the \"T\" shape of my cushion. The ends of the \"T\" shape curled in, and it ended up looking like a stuffed umbrella, lol. I had to return it, which made me give it 1 star because the return process was seamless!",

      "text": "Really disappointed at the fit even though I measured and got the \u201ccorrect size\u201d. The cushion part is not wide enough, had to buy clips so it would not lift and the top part is way too big. Maybe it is just not meant for every couch. It is hard to clean even after a wash with strong detergent, I still see the same stains. I use it in my toddlers room so it is mainly liquids like milk or juice nothing strong. Would not recommend to friends.",

These couches have oversized cushions so I got one in XL and the second one in Large. Great fit and super easy to put on. Might have to try it a couple ways before you figure the placement but after that, you are good to go! True to color they arent super dark and with a very slight tint of blue but it looks true to gray when put on. And the wine colored ones are true to color too! Absolutely love them!!
