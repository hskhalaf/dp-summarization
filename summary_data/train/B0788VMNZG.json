While most of the Mach\u2019s users admired the design and structural elements, and many others found it pleasant to wear, some found faults in the shoe\u2019s fit and feel. Overall, the Mach was a comfortable shoe, but some improvements are necessary for a completely praiseworthy performance.",

        "One user was mostly contented that the arch blisters that they used to get in the Clayton were no longer in the Mach",
