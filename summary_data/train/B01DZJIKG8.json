This product is protein heavy with mostly large chains. The people leaving bad reviews could be protein sensitive. If you use this product and find it dries your hair out or leaves it like straw, that is sign of protein overload. Please don't blame this product. Educate yourself about your own personal hair and find what works for you! :)",
