The heavy band already has a tear in it, and the extra heavy band broke completely with a very loud snap while it was in use. They work well while they last but they're not as durable as the description claims. Also, I wish you could get multiple bands of the same or similar strength instead of such an array of different strengths. I never had a use for the lighter bands so those were kind of a waste.",

I am not very fit, 4'11\" , and didn't think I would have to jump straight to the x-heavy. But, I just double them up when I do certain things, like squats. If you are a pro I would look into heavier duty ones. I have a little bit of issue with rolling, but it depends on the type of pants/fabric I wear. If it's on my bare skin I have no issues. I think they are great for starting off.",

I'd definitely recommend if you need a moderate amount of resistance. However, if you use them frequently or need a lot of resistance I'd recommend checking out recommended bands by youtubers.

And since I do very long range flights I can take the loops on the flight and do the exercises on the airplane. Neat! I ordered sets for my two friends of same age and lifestyle.",
