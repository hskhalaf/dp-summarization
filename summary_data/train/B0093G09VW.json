The texturing doesn't help at all either, they're slippery silicone grooves that just make big sliding pads for anything you're trying to hold. I would stay away from these.",

I liked their silicone grips so bought these due to a similar design, good reviews and the Cuisinart name. They were much more expensive than my last mitts, but with all the stores closed I bit the bullet. At the top tip of the left mitt where the fabric joins the silicone the fabric is already pulling away exposing the white padding inside. The heat resistance is excellent, but the durability of the item stinks. In short, they are overpriced cheaply made gloves. DO NOT BUY!",

They are well-insulated. I hesitated to purchase these because of the price, but they are worth every penny of it and I expect they will last a long time, too.",

Would have considered returning, but honestly is too much hassle. Will continue using the damaged/defective one until it gives up (or things get too hot).

      "text": "These are amazing quality, super well sewn and thick sturdy material without being awkward and bulky! I bake almost everyday so a good set of mitts are very important. The silicone grippy part allows me to get a handle of small objects like a 3 inch ramekin which is great. Used it yesterday with the oven on at 475 and my hands were cool as a cucumber, this is the only oven mitt that I have ever used that did not transfer any heat at all to my hands! Buy them you wont regret it!",

I can now pick up my cast iron without worrying and hold it long enough to pour/scoop food out. The rings to hang the gloves are made of metal, which, if you hang it above your oven like I do, end up getting hot. If you place this somewhere, I'd recommend not above heat. I don't have much of a choice due to wall space, but I may have to find another solution. Overall, I'm very satisfied.",

      "text": "These oven mitts hold up to any temperatures that I roast, braise, bake, etc. at. They appear to be relatively durable as well. I took one star off because the thumb portion of the mitts are large enough that it can be difficult to keep from dipping them slightly into casseroles as you take them out of the oven. Maybe that's just my technique, but I seem to do better with mitts that have smaller thumbs.",
