      "text": "I bought these for kayaking. I'm 5'-11\" tall 165 lbs and bought medium. They fit well; wetsuits should be close fitting and they are. The quality of construction exceeded my expectation for this price point. The stitching is very high quality with no loose threads anywhere. The seams are not sealed but for use in a kayak that isn't a big problem. For a wetsuit used for diving it would be a major problem because it would allow a lot of water to flow in and out of the pants reducing their insulation performance. Great value for the price and my intended use.",

Any one that thinks they can 'just slide in' a good wetsuit is in for a shock. They are tight for a reason. If they aren't they will not protect you from water temperatures. When I arrived home, I jumped at the first chance to try them on. Tight and good fit. Jumped in a cold shower and soaked them down. Initial water was shockingly cold then the suit did its job and I didn't notice it anymore. These, with my drytop will be my fall/early spring kayaking suit.",

I found some videos on Youtube that were quite helpful in learning how to carefully pull them on and take them off without damaging the neoprene material. I am 5'6\" tall and 190 lbs and the men's size large fit just right. There is a little extra up around my butt, but that is because I have a 29\" inseam and a 36\" waste. So, my proportions may not be typical. Have not used them yet but I suspect they will work perfectly when I am kayaking and fishing from my kayak in the colder weather.",

      "text": "Very disappointed. After reading all of the reviews on sizing- I was sure I had finally found something that would fit. I was wrong. I am a short stocky man with tree trunk legs. After a lot of struggling I was able to get the pants up over my legs. But then there wasn't enough material to cover the buttocks and stomach. So if you have bird legs and a skinny mid-drif and backside- these will fit you.",
