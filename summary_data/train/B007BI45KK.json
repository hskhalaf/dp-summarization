They are smaller than your foot (unless you have really small feet) and they are pointed on one end and round on the other end, so I turned them where the rounded end was under my toes. When I knew we would be walking in snow for a long period of time, I used these on the bottom of my feet and put a toe warmer on top of my toes. I stayed toasty warm.",

I was debating on whether to wearing them on my bare skin and slipping my sock on over it because my feet get so cold, but I tried them on my socks, and they got so hot that I had to take a break from them.
