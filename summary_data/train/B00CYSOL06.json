The stands are cheap some parts made of plastic and a piece was even broken when i recieved it.. the softboxes are a pain the butt.. with poles to stick into the boxes and the light its really goofy was hoping for a foldable pop up version.. I rated a 3 because the lights are really amazing and if your planning on just putting up in your house and leaving it along its great.. if you plan to travel with it.. yah your going to get some frustration.. because its going to start to break down after awhile the stands ect..",

      "text": "I purchased these lights back in 2015. I'd give them a 5, but they're a little light weight. (not always a bad thing) The important thing is this company stands by its product. I was having trouble keeping the softbox at the right angle. It insisted on drooping. I contacted the company and within days they contacted me, and I had replacement parts that helped fix the problem. I love any company that reacts and responds this way. If you're considering these vs another similar product, DEFINITELY choose these.",

      "text": "UPDATE: June 2015 - The manufacturer took care of me on this and gave me a replacement hardware kit that solved all the problems. They said they were aware of the issue and I assume this means it comes with the correct hardware now. ---------------- The lights and the materials themselves are fine. My problem with the entire kit is the hardware. After only 2 months of using 4-5 times total, the heads of the lights constantly fall down and drop despite tightening the hardware. The reason why is the plastic clasp can't sustain the head of the weight and loses its grip. Very infuriating unfortunately. Other than that, the setup is fairly simple (took 30 minutes in total).",

I brought the main lights literally very close to the subject and was just really disappointed at the results I go. Total darkness at 200 iso. I had to crank it up.

I didn't even have to use the counter weight for the light when I first put it together. The light fixtures and availability to turn each bulb off on the 2 main diffused lights is great.
