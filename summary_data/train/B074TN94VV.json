So if you are likely to move, much easier to transport than a traditional box spring. Third, not friendly to the aforementioned creepy crawlies; no cavity for them to nest (yuck to even think about!) Also not a collector of dust bunnies or any other allergens. Highly recommend!",

I knew this would happen, but still worth noting. Second, because the outside of this frame is metal, when you place it inside your existing metal frame you\u2019ll find it occasionally squeaks and you\u2019ll have to adjust it or add felt lining to prevent this.

Second, each slat is held in place by velcro. The support ledges on the side of the frame have velcro on them, and each slat has a velcro patch on each end. The result is the slats stay in place, and there is no squeaking when you use the bed. This has exceeded my expectations and I would highly recommend.",
