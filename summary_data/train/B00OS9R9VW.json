Unfortunately, I actually use mine and it has already stopped working in less than 6 months. I ONLY walk on this at a 2 speed and it is already broken. If you are looking for an expensive hanger this is perfect. If you want a treadmill for long term use spend a few extra bucks and buy a better one. Expensive lesson for me....",

Assembly and operating instructions in Spanish only (I cant read Spanish). AND FOR A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TREADMILL. 5. Huge waste of my time and energy",

Perfect, smaller treadmill and great buy for the price. I didn't need anything fancy but was worried buying something at this price would junk but I'm so happy I bought! I'm 5 foot 2 and was able to bring into my house and assemble within 20 mins. Heavy package but definitely doable!",

      "text": "I easily assembled it by myself. Fits nicely in a small apartment, folds up without a problem. I don\u2019t use the incline as it is probably a 1.5-2 incline at the most on the highest setting, has to manually set so can\u2019t be changed throughout the run. I\u2019m not a fan of incline anyway so that doesn\u2019t bother me. Runs smoothly even up to 8.5mph, not too loud. Good quality for the price, though I would recommend a device holder if you plan to watch tv on your phone or tablet or read as the console sits around mid torso level and you would have to look down the entire run/walk to see (I\u2019m 5\u20197\u201d for reference). Overall highly recommend.",

I will usually start it and put it to 2mph then jump on. Not a big deal but something to take note off.",
