Love the low collapsed height, allows you to stow under your workbench or as I do, under your parked motorcycle. Raise the bike to a height that you can work with while sitting on a stool with rollers. Comes with to moveable wheels which allows you to push the work in progress bike into a corner and stay out of everyone way!!!!",

      "text": "This thing has not let me down yet...I was a little skeptical buying this as i was afraid it would not be wide enough for my 2014 Harley Davidson StreetGlide. The width is perfect and it seemed to lift the bike with ease. I am very happy with the lift. The only criticism i can give is that the handle to pull the dolly is ridiculous. It attaches to the lift with one screw and the castors on the lift do not seem to roll freely making it very difficult to move the bike around once lifted...Other than that...Im happy.",
