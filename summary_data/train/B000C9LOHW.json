GM uses a fiber mesh in this filter, much like a synthetic felt. It keeps ALL the trash out of the transmission valve body. Perfect fit and function, as it is a GM part.

From my experience OEM parts seem to fit better and are easier to install than a lot of aftermarket parts, although not all. This filter came with a better gasket than the Wix (a brand I trust) filter from my local auto parts. The price difference was a bit more but, for the better gasket it was worth it to me and Amazon had it for a good price. It was packaged very well from ACDelco. The gasket was sealed flat instead of folded in a box like a lot of others.",
