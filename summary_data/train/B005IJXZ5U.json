      "text": "I had a similar experience as another reviewer. Three months after I bought these, the glue disintegrated. The stitching became exposed. The stitches held but stretched, allowing the sole to be pulled away just a bit. The side looks very iffy now, especially near the stitches, as though it might rip out at any moment. I wore these shoes in a casual shorts and t-shirts office environment in a desert / San Diego. Heh. No rain or water got to them. So it's unclear why the glue would just fail. I had other Sperry shoes and didn't have much of an issue other than the soles wearing a bit fast. I'll post photos soon.",

      "text": "By reputation and general specs the Billfish is a top boat shoe. I previously had a pair that ran narrow and was carelessly finished with a seam placed in an uncomfortable position that jabbed the outside of my right foot. I hoped the shoes would work themselves out, but they never did. I finally had enough, threw them out and took a chance on a wide width. I could see that the inside of the new pair was finished more carefully on the inside and I am happy with the shoe so far. One big tip: Buy the shoes with a free return option as the fit and finish may be a hit or miss proposition.",

However, after my husband wore these for a few weeks while teaching, the sole started falling apart on the right shoe. Unfortunately it happened on day 31, so the return window has been closed for this item. Very disappointed in this shoe, especially considering the price. If these were cheap knockoffs, I would think we got what we deserved. However, for $100, this is very troubling. Looking at other reviews, this seems to be a problem that needs to be fixed. Will not be buying again.",

The soles have separated from upper on one shoe and stitching is pulling apart on other shoe! For the money...should have lasted more than 4 months..... Maybe worn them one a week... Poor quality... Disappointed and will contact seller... Tried some generic brands.. which lasted about a year.. Came back to the Sperry brand! These shoes are comfortable and durable... Will buy them again!",

My first pair was comfy right out of the box - not sure if the construction changed over the years. Of course, everyone's feet are different, so YMMV. PS, these are much more comfortable than the authentic original slim soled Sperrys. I can walk all day in the city with these with no problems.",

Then I noticed that these were made in the Dominican Republic, and my old ones were made in China. Apparently, some of the sizes are now made in the DR, and that particular factory just doesn't quite live up to the same specs. I tried some 10.5s and those were made in China and were much nicer, but if course didn't fit. Very disappointing. Please take note, Sperry.",

    "description": "Enjoying the essence of the ocean from the deck of a boat creates an entirely new experience \u2013 one you'll want to relive again and again. A salty mist carries the scent of the sea on the air, as you hear the soothing sound of waves lapping against your boat's hull. You watch as foam forms on distant breakers as they swell with the changing tides. If you're lucky, maybe you catch a glimpse of dolphins surfacing. Enjoy this experience all day long in the comfort of the Billfish 3-Eye Boat Shoe from Sperry. Sure footing on deck requires a shoe with great traction for a firm, sturdy grip. The Sperry men's Billfish shoe comes fully equipped with Wave-Siping on the rubber outsole to provide stability on wet and dry surfaces. Perforated side panels allow increased breathability, while shock-absorbing enhancements create a comfortable sole for all-day wear. Both dark and light tan tones offer a sporty vibe that is just as stylish on land as it is at sea, so you get maximum use out of your boat shoes. If you're aching to experience the magic of life beyond our shores, don't let any more time go to waste. Slip into the Sperry Billfish and head toward that blue horizon, where discovery awaits.",
