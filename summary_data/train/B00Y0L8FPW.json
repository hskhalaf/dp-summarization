All ages are on a level playing field and that makes the game a GREAT one for us! The deluxe version is not worth the doubling of the price. We wanted to have more people playing so I made an extra score card, bought some dry erase markers and now many more can play at the same time. Fun Fun Fun",

Not a \"Trivial Pursuit\" type of trivia game. Some answers you may know, some you may not. What you lack in trivia skills you can make up for in betting skills and vice versa. 3. Easy for kids to play. All answers are in number form (weight, year, number etc)",

Surprisingly, the tactics and strategy required to win are more complex that initially thought. A person who is behind can start making some interesting guesses and bets to skew the odds in their favor. Being correct may not be the best course of action on every turn. Very much enjoy playing this. We had to add higher denominations to our set to accommodate the action within our group.",

Players then show their answers, place them in order in the middle, and then pick which answer they believe to be the closest, without going over.

The game itself is ok when played with a family of 4 adults and 12 yo and 8 yo. The knowledge difference is great and the 8 yo is just learning to grasp to wager with the person most likely to know the answer. I think it might be more fun when played with a peer group.",

At first, we were concerned it wouldnt be as fun as the non-family edition, since the betting in this game was slightly different than the betting in the non-family version. But, after playing a few rounds, we fell in love with it. We realized this betting style makes it easier for any age to play. We are a family of 5 (our kids are ages 6,10, and 11). All 5 of us enjoy this game tremendously. It has quickly become our favorite game to play on family game night!",

      "text": "I played this with my nieces and nephews of diverse ages. This is fun playing single or on teams! The questions have only numbers as answers (1 to 1,000,000), and anyone can bet on anyone's answer. You win points when you choose the closest number without going over. Questions are similar to this... \"How many times does a bee's wing beat in one second?\" The answer surprised me, and the kids were closer. Adults don't have an advantage either because there are many contemporary questions that pertain to kids' interests... Lots of fun!",

Not to mention the outside of this game offers a lifetime replacement of any part that goes missing from the game. Love it.",
