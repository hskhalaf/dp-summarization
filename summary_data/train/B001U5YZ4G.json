The sound was good--better bass than iPod buds, for sure--but I had to adjust them almost constantly to keep them from coming loose while running.

Now, for 30 odd dollars I won't complain because I just leave them by my bed, but if I had paid more I would be upset. Anyway, I think they are ok.",

I threw away some much more expensive earbuds because they didn't fit the bill with respect to bass. These fit the bill exactly. The cases are not small, but the sound keeps improving the longer I use them. Sound isolation is reasonable given that they have no active noise canceling technology built in. I've used them on planes, walking to school and in cars, and I've been happy with my purchase.",

The difference is enormous. That said, I think there are two draw-backs in my opinion: (a) even though the fit is snug, when I run do other mobile activities, the earplugs fall out occasionally (b) this isn't the worst thing given that the noise canceling probably doesn't make them the safest to wear when running or biking.",

After 5 minutes of trying to make them work and feeling how uncomfortable they were, I decided to return them. They're manufactured by some off-brand that I have never heard of, so obviously quality control at that company is sub-par. I would most likely steer clear of these.",
