I have had zero issues with water getting into the battery area and the upgraded design on the lid has shown no signs of cracking. This is strictly a hand wash only item.",

Took apart unit (2 bottom screws) and when pulled loose, noticed water in-between black plastic and aluminum carafe, AND then pieces of black plastic fell off from area near top of handle. So, unsure if it came defective or not. $20 for 2-months of use is questionable?!?? Unsure if I'll buy another one. If I do, I will closely inspect it upon receipt BEFORE using it.",

I use it every morning for 2 cups of coffee with supplements. Washed and set on dish rack till next morning. So why are they breaking? Oh well, I'll get another design and see if it lasts longer for 1/2 the price. But I really really luv these mugs when not cracked! Sherry:)",
