It's well made, looks nice and provides some insulation on cooler days, especially when I lay a little blanket across the top. I bought the sage color and am happy with it, note that it is lighter than the picture. I've tried a few other cat beds with hoods, and this is the one my girl loves. She can easily jump into the large opening, the top stays up, and there's plenty of room for her (9 pounds) to move around. I'm so glad to find a cozy nap nook she loves!",

What a mess! But the housing came out of the wash in perfect condition, soft and clean, and kept its shape. I have washed it again since and it still looks as good as new.

She likes to be really warm so she hides in this house and curls up in a tiny blanket to sleep while I watch tv or read. Material is very soft and cleans with a soft washcloth easily, inside cushion can be machine washed. Package arrive quickly and was as pictured on the site. Attached is a picture that the vet uploaded of my dog enjoying her stay in their Pet Resort in this house :)",

I will probably buy a couple more to put in other areas of my house, as I have multiple kitties. Armarkat products are wonderful - great quality and well-priced. I have many different Armarkat items in my home and am very pleased with all of them and will continue to purchase this brand of cat products.",

      "text": "Both cats love it, but one is too big to get in (though she'll still try - and end up with her front half in it and her butt hanging out). My more petite, average cat loves it because he feels like he's hiding. Very soft, holds body heat well and washes like a dream. It comes vacuum-packed flat, so when you open the bag, it resumes its normal shape, though ours ended up with a bit of a permanent dent in the top. Still looks fine (though a bit lopsided) and the cats love it.",
