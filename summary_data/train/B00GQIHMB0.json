Loves playing with the little house as I read which is the perfect concept for a story time activity. It brought us together as a family:) I FULLY recommend this and will purchase as a gift for someone soon!",

Even when it was time to put toys away, the 4 year old liked putting the puzzle pieces back together. This helped make clean up fun and easy. This toy is so creative, not expensive, well made, easy to put together and easy to put away. Thank you Storytime Toys!",

It's the perfect size where it isn't an effort to bring it out everytime. Constructing it was fun, and it let's children use their imagination. I read while we both played with it and made the story come alive. As an avid reader myself, I think these kits bring the magic alive for young ones and reading. Love it!",

This compact toy is easily stored or may be kept out without taking up half of the living room. It also allows for children to create their own stories and use their imaginations.

The pieces are already bending from the small amount of adjusting I've done.

But buyer beware: the illustrations are glued to foam, not wood. Since Melissa and Doug sells a similar wooden \"piece together\" house for the same price, I'm not convinced this is $30 worth of toy. Within a few sessions of taking it apart and rebuilding it the pictures began separating from the foam and need to be glued.",
