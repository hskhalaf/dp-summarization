I keep actual Queen founded colonies but was curious about the killer gel design I keep hearing nightmare stories about. And it true! I used ant traps to catch a few different species of feral ants(not at the same time) from my backyard and every species died! DUMP THE DEADLY GEL and you can fill it with a good natural ant friendly substrate and then it\u2019s ok, not great but OK for small to medium size ant species (not for harvester or carpenter ants).",
