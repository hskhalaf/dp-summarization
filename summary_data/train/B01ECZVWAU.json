Strongly recommend purchasing ice bags if you want to make & store ice conveniently. Great way to have ice on demand if you were smart enough to not get an ice producing fridge (cause those are notorious for leaking). The ice maker is very simple to operate and quite compact. You do need to be around to monitor and empty the ice tray every 20 minutes or so. I do marathon ice making, fill up an 8 lb ice bag and then clean the machine out until next use.",

So no more ice gets made. I get that it\u2019s not abnormal, but it happens a lot more than I think it should. As far as the noise, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too noisy. I notice it, but nothing you can\u2019t get used to.",
