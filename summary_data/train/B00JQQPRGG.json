When I plugged my camera into my computer today the file said 3100. Upon further inspection, I noticed the bottom said 3100. Make sure your camera is what it says it is!",

It's too sensitive and shifts too much for my purposes, which is distracting, so I just keep it off and manually refocus every time I change position, which I try not to do very often.",

I want to be able to run my battery all the way down to 0% while I'm taking photos. I was unprepared for this when I first started using it and was bummed that I had to stop taking photos sooner than I anticipated because the camera literally locks the shutter and doesn't let you take anymore while there's still plenty of battery left. There may be some reason for Nikon to do this, but I have no clue what it is. Besides this, it's a great quality camera!",

I use a remote shutter cable a lot more than an IRF. The 3300 and 3400 eliminate that port in favor of HDMI. That's fine if you plan to do a lot of video work. I do not. I also considered going full-frame with a D750. But, after sending off a few shots for professional printing at 16 x 24 and seeing the results, I can wait until later. I'm basically a hobbyist and the D3200 does everything I need at the moment. This used camera was like new. No problems.",

I absolutely think this is a MUST HAVE for anyone with child(ren) The Nikon D3200 captures every moment in high quality. The set up is super easy and the battery charges very fast, I also enjoy the feature that tells you approximately how many shots you have left before the battery will run out. It is not the most user friendly if you are use to point and shoot cameras, but if you read the manual (or just sections) for the settings you want it does not take long to figure out.",

This camera is 24MP compared to the 10MP Canon G7 it replaces. The variety of lenses and low light capability completely make up for it though. The movie capture at high res detracts a bit though, thus 4 stars. I'm not a camera guru but I would say that the high res movies don't appear 'fluid'.",
