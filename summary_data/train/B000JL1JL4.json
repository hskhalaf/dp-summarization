You have to make sure the canister is thoroughly frozen and the ice cream mixture is chilled, which means you have to think way ahead. But it's not that difficult. It doesn't really make a lot of ice cream, so if you want a lot, real quick, then go to the supermarket. But for that homemade taste, this is a good choice, and it's enough for about four people.
