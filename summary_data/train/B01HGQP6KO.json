I give one chew to my 6.5 lb cat ~20 minutes before I need to do something stressful, like nail trimming, vet, or travel. It doesn't put her to sleep, it just makes her calm, like the bottle says. If the stressful event doesn't take very long (like a quick nail trim or something) she does go to sleep afterwards, but I mean she's a cat so that might've been on her schedule anyways. I don't think she's caught on to the fact that they do anything to her; she still likes the flavor and gobbles them up.",
