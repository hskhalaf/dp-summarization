They are the best product on the market, hands down. That said, I thought they couldn\u2019t be purchased outside of a retail dealer/installer? The battery life on this new remote is amazing. I\u2019ve has this for several months and use it at least twice daily and have not had to recharge since the first time! My other vehicle has an older version of this exact remote and it must be recharged weekly. It\u2019s been that way since installed new. So great job Viper for drastically improving the quality, battery life and remote transmitting distance! Love Viper!",

I know that it is just a programming issue. I love the distance out of this compared to any other system that I have owned. I haven't tested the distance, but it has worked every time that I have tried. I've been in the back of a local department store and parked in the back of the lot.",

Works really well for manual cars too, you just got to get used to the sequence before you get out of the car, its a good thing though, it makes it so you won't leave it in gear, no one needs to run anyone over or wreck the front end of your car.

    "title": "Viper 5706V 2-Way Car Security with Remote Start System",
    "description": "The Viper 5706v Responder LC3 is a complete security and remote start system with a full one mile range. The remote has easy to understand priority icons and a text screen on a LCD display. This allows you to command and monitor the vehicle with simple and prioritized buttons. The five buttons control up to 24 different functions on two cars! Plus, it is the slimmest display remote on the market today but still packed with the latest features. Not only is this a security system but it also has remote start capabilities. If the Active Temp Check is selected, the Responder will display the temperature inside of the vehicle instead of the time. This comes in handy as it lets you view the temperature before actually walking to your car. Not cool, or warm enough in your car yet? Use the Runtime reset to extend your runtime and let it reach the perfect conditions. If anything happens to your vehicle, the security system will notify you right away if you are within range, playing the Revenger siren tones.",
