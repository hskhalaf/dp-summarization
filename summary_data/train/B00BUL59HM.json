If you're a gym goer, the silicone ear cuff doesn't absorb or wick sweat, so you'll have some moisture going on. On the cuff again, it's slightly shallow and likely won't seal well for most people = poor sound isolation.",

The sound is great, especially for the price these are at right now (a little over $20 vs the $60!). The only downside is after wearing them for an extended amount of time, the ear-cups that sit on my ears start to hurt, since they don't have a lot of padding other than the silicone-based covering.",

I did a 3d test on youtube with them and it was fantastic, however the bass test really sucked. They really need to work on the bass. Also another thing i didnt like was theres hardly any noise cancellation but again these are 50$ headphones. All in all I am satisfied",

They aren't noise-canceling headphones, despite their size; you will hear the guy on the train next to you, and they won't blot out the sound of the engines on an airplane. The padding around your ears could be a bit more plush, but you get what you pay for and these are reasonable for the price.",
