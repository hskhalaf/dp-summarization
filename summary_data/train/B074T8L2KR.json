No worrying about temperature, since it nailed it first time and has maintained it throughout. I will buy three of these before I buy a styrofoam one again. I lost a lot of eggs and chicks due to incorrect temp, fluctuations, humidity changes, etc. It is worth it to know that if an egg is viable, I can hatch it now.",

I would give it 5 stars, but the instructions are quite aweful, terrible English translation. Also, the temperature is in Celsius so having the option of farenheight would be nice.

Also, make sure to put metal bar (used to turn eggs) in the hole on the slide. Also remove the top platform and slide a few days before chicks are due to hatch or metal turning bar will puncture an egg or chick. Follow directions on changing temp according to days in incubator. Successful hatches!",

      "text": "Great incubator and easy to control humidity since the surface area of the bottom is large. I have had the temperature read low on my second thermometer on a few occasions. I lowered the preset temp to 37.8 to keep my temp closer to 99.5. The viewing is minimal but this is a set it and forget it incubator. I suggest a secondary thermometer for a while until you feel confident that the temp holds. Will see how the eggs do this round with the fluctuations.",
