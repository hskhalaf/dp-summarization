Sears quality control clearly isn't what it used to be. If I'm going to get crappy tools, I might as well get the same set from HFT for $7! Also, I checked and my local Sears sells this set for $27.99 as opposed to the $37.95 on Amazon.",

A carrying case would have been nice, even if it was more expensive. Also, as others have expressed, cut the fluff and call it a 16-piece set. Who cares about a craftsman dog tag???",
