I do not use McAfee, think it is pure marketing with no added value, because my current OS and provider keep me more than safe. The only challenge was proper antenna positioning, had to surf the internet quite a bit. Ended up with rear antennas headed straight vertical, front ones slightly inclined with 105 degrees between them, as on official pictures. Always check wifi signal strength, because every home is different: I used android apps - IOS does not allow you to see wifi tech details for some reason.",

Even in advanced mode you can\u2019t do much more than change some basic settings through \u201cwizards\u201d. I\u2019ve had the router for a few months and I\u2019m finally sick of it, so replacing it with an edgerouter and unifi AP.
