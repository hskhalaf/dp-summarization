It gets a little scary to see the saw and extension heading to the ground and the control end in my hand. Luckily it fell on the grass so no damages. I ended up putting several wraps of black tape around the release button to keep it from unlocking while using.",

Detaches from pole to use like conventional chainsaw, strong 8 amp motor (don't know why the item header says 7.5 amp?) it is an 8 amp motor, chain tension adjustment screw, electric (good for the environment) ... If you a looking for a electric extendable pole chain saw, consider this one as I highly recommend...",

It easily cuts off limbs that are about 4 to 5 inches in diameter as the blades are really sharp. The ability to convert between a pole saw and chainsaw is nice. Converting between the two configurations only takes about 10 seconds and doesn't require any tools...just a push of a button. Great saw for the money!",

Wish I had bought one of these years ago so I wouldn't have so much trimming and cutting to do now.",

Probably the only draw back I have is the oil reservoir can be a bit difficult to read at first and oil can spill out if you open it and the saw is not secured to something flat. Works best on branches with a diameter between 2\"-6\". Smaller branches tend to get gnarled up. You probably should use a different cutter for those. The pole is very sturdy and I am impressed by the quality of this saw for the price thus far.",

It is lightweight, seems well-constructed and cuts extremely well. It does consume oil at a fairly rapid rate, so you need to keep an eye on the indicator window on the side of the tool. Contrary to what some reviewers have said, no oil was included with the product, so I had to go to the local big box store for that. Overall, very pleased with my purchase and I will never use a gas-powered chainsaw again!",

Plenty of power for the bar length.",

    "description": "Color:GreenSAW WHAT YOU SEE \u2013 WITH THE ONE SAW THAT DOES DOUBLE DUTY! Tackle those hard-to-reach branches with ease. The Sun Joe SWJ806E 2-in-1 convertible electric pole chain + saw takes the danger and difficulty out of trimming your overgrown trees. Stand safely on solid ground and simply adjust Sun Joe\u2019s telescoping pole to gain up to 15 feet of overhead reach. Later, when the limbs are down and there\u2019s wood to be cut, Sun Joe quickly converts to a hand-held chainsaw to make light work of loads of logs. Powered by a robust 7.5-amp motor, the SWJ806E can handle the most stubborn tree limbs up to 7.5-inches thick. It features a durable, 8-inch Oregon bar and chain with an auto-oiler to keep the bar and chain fully lubricated during use. Unlike gas-powered tools, Sun Joe is powered electrically, so you\u2019ll power up reliably every time with the push of a button, without having to deal with smoke, fumes, spark plugs or costly tune-ups. Plus the SWJ806E comes equipped with a built-in safety switch to prevent accidental starting. The Sun Joe SWJ806E convertible electric pole chain + saw carries a full two-year warranty.",
