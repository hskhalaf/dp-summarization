Within a week it warped and the bottom is no longer flat; as such, it doesn't sit right on the stove burner and gets hot spots and half of it is a lot hotter than the other half. This has made cooking in it quite problematic. On top of that, it has developed a weird white spotty stain in it that's only visible when it's dry (see pictures). I have emailed Cuisinart's customer service over a week ago and have gotten no response at all.",

I have tried different ways of removing burnt on stains including soaking with baking soda and vinegar, scrubbing with steel wool pads, scrubbing with the \"Ringer\" chainmail device and lots of elbow grease. None of the stains will come out. I have even ordered Wenol and when it arrived, I still could not get the stains out. I have only used this skillet a few times and I am throwing it out. I also have All Clad stainless steel pots and Revereware pots. I have never had this problem with them.",

We bought this in Apr 2020 and last week the nonstick coating has started to flake off the edges of the pan. BTW - this pan was $60 when we bought it in Apr and today (Aug 21) its now $83. At either price point, I expect more than 4 months of use... I have no idea what pan would be better without spending 2x or 3x the money, but this one is not the money. I cannot recommend.",
