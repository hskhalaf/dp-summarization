      "text": "I'm going broke buying these! I've got 21 canned lights in my house and now all of them have this bulb. Very highly recommended. Awesome capabilities from lighting intensity to an infinite color variation ability. The only down side to these is that if you think you're just going to do one fixture in the house, don't do it. When you do, it will be so awesome, you'll find yourself going to Home Depot to buy more. They'll be out so you'll have to do it online. And after that..... your house will be awesome but your bank account will be..... \"un-awesome\". Highly Recommended",

Screw into a floor lamp or (in my case) recessed ceiling fixture, turn on the light, and find the light in your Philips app. It's a bigger version of the standard dimmable color changing bulbs and seems to adjust brightness and colors a little faster. It works with all the apps the standard Philips bulbs work with like the SyFy app to color match to scenes in their (very limited) movie selection. One star off because it still costs too much for a solitary lightbulb.",

In my experience, they seem to last forever. I've had my oldest ones for a few years. I have other colored bulbs, but these are the most reliable and have the greatest range of colors. Plus, I can control them from a variety of apps. IFTTT even lets me trigger them with motion sensors, so in the middle of the night I can have dim lights on the way to and from the bathroom.

I rebooted, moved it, moved the hub, tried dozens of ways to fix it. Its just done. So now I have five. These are WAY too expensive to have one fail after 8 months.

      "text": "These things are cool, but keep in mind this is the first gen BR30 bulb. Look elsewhere and find the second gen. This literally does not do blues. Set it to any shade of blue and the bulb will glow purple. The deepest shade of green is a washed out yellow with a greenish hue. Pretty disappointing for a $50 bulb advertised as being able to display millions of different colors.",

      "text": "The coolest thing since sliced bread. I bought these to change moods and accentuate the room we put them in. Set up was pretty easy, naming and syncing the light were just a tad rough but I managed it. You do have to download the app. I would highly recommend the \"On Switch\" app to accompany the Phillips Hue app. I was able to set up the bridge for two Ipads and Iphones. The only issue is that the range of green is very limited, I was inable to reach a very dark green. When you shut the lights off they default back to white. These are the bulbs only, you need the bridge to control the lights.",
