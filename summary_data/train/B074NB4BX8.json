Some people planted the wrong herbs next to each other, others claimed that the planter/soil killed their plant. Coconut fiber soil is great, but doesn\u2019t provide the necessary nutrients to sustain a plant by itself. You need to add the right plant food to accompany your herbs of choice. I personally mixed mine with potting soil and slow release nutrients. Months later, and everything is thriving.",

My only issue was that the soil that comes with the planter is not fertilized at all, so you need to make sure there is some kind of plant food situation happening. Other than that, it's pretty great.",

I ended up using half of the included soil and half potting mix, as suggested by another commenter, which ended up doing really well.",
