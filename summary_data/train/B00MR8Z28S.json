The faux leather padding is made from a cheap plastic material that started falling appart after 8months of use. Now I have to buy replacements for my perfectly working headphones. I wish Jabra could make better quality pads for this otherwise great set of BT headphones.",

After further investigation, I found an FAQ on the Jabra site where they explicitly state that they do not recommend connecting directly to a computer, and that they are \"optimized to be used with other Bluetooth devices, such as, smartphones or tablets.\"",

Second, after an hour of listening the ear pieces get very uncomfortable. Lastly when connected to two devices, the headphones inform you that your connected to two devices again interrupting what your listening to until you disconnect the second device.

The worst part of these headphones is the trouble with the mic. It's almost unusable to accept a phone call which isn't a huge deal for me.

You can turn off the annoying voice commands that come out by holding down the volume down button when switching on the headphone. The amount of tension to keep the headphones on is good enough for running and weight lifting. Battery is good enough for about three 2-hour trips to the gym.",

This makes them useless because I lose so much time to resetting them, whether I'm using them to transcribe data for my thesis, or listening to a show while cleaning my house. If the manufacturers have any ideas, I'm open to hearing them, but I wouldn't advise this purchase without a clear troubleshoot",
