The screen is much nicer in terms of both brightness and ghosting, the load times are faster, and it's lighter. I love it, and highly recommend.",

If you look in the manual, it shows the additional cords {purchased separately} and, it shows where the strap goes, and DOESN'T say \"sold sep.\" So, where's the strap SONY?? I also think you should get a \"USB\" cable , too-- wall plug charging is kinda \"old skool\", don't you think?? Other than that, seems to be a decent HH, especially with a 4 Gb card.......Haven't got a chance to \"introduce\" it to my 60Gb PS3...soon!",
