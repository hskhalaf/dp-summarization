If you are willing to learn to switch to save files in cloud form or to USB it will work for you. I installed Microsoft it works well. I'm able to retrieve documents easily. I am able to check emails watch videos on YouTube. I find no lag time and opening new windows in opening applications. Easy navigation. Prints well. Clear screen and good sound. I find no issues and believe it's right for the money. I use it for emails, Zoom, YT, recording video, office duties, etc. No gaming.",

Setup was super simple, and she was up and running (even with creating a new google-for-kids account from scratch!) in less than 20 minutes. She definitely loves the pink (rose gold) color. The only thing I don't love is, while I was typing on it, I noticed the space bar had a tendency to not register as typed. If you strike the center of it, it works fine, but my right-thumb naturally strikes the far-right edge of it, and it doesn't seem to fully register all those keypresses unless I'm intentional about hitting the space. All other keys seemed fine.",
