My one complaint is that it comes in a vacuum sealed bag so when you try to put it back in the plastic bag thing it's very difficult and I ended up rolling it sleeping bag style to jam it in there. But that's not an issue if you're not going to put it back in the bag. Buy this comforter, buy it now.",

My kids told me they are helping to keep them warm on the cool nights. Currently they use sheets, fleece blanket and now these comforters. Previous to getting the comforter they did say they were cold some nights. Since getting these I haven't heard them mention they were cold at all.

I love how easy it was to wash because some bedding can get clumpy and gross when you wash it in the washer and dryer but it came out looking like it did in the package. Great buy. The yellow is a little brighter than I thought but still looks great!",
