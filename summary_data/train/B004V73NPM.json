I bought these specifically for the laces/Velcro at the ankle combo. It makes for a very secure fit. Others stated these arrived pre-sharpened. Mine, however, not certainly did not. This was a $5 fix at my local rink, but for the inaccuracy in product description I dock 1 Star (I\u2019d only knock off a half star if that were an option because these are otherwise stellar.) Perfect for a skating enthusiast who prefers hockey over figure skates.",
