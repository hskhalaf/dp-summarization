I've used it so far on hard surfaces only and clearly it's been beneficial for balance and footwork at speed. There is a learning drill for the many moves reviewable on the internet so one can pick and choose for your sport. I like combining it with my home weight program as variety is fun and engaging. No question that my tennis footwork will bet even better with its,regular usage. I would buy this again without hesitation. Regards. Catus.",

Also, the product has a nice bag, but it's a pain to get it back in there and the bag is huge - not super portable if you keep your equipment in the car like I do for my training job. If you can keep it down, it's much nicer to use. Additionally, keep in mind for the ladder component it's only 5 boxes, which is not a lot to work with.",

The box did not exhibit external damage so I'm going to say it didn't happen during transit. The second dies a horribly dead the very first time a player stepped on the rung during a workout. The ladder becomes useless as soon as the scissor part is broken. Sorry SKLZ - back to the drawing board with this one.",

The only reason I did not give this a 5 star was because the stakes are pretty cheap and bent on the first time I put into the ground. If you do NOT stake down the latter well, kids will trip while trying to get through the ladder. Only other advice is to pull the ladder taught when inserting the stakes. Other than that, I did see a pick up in form and speed through the season.",

If you plan to use strictly indoors, I suggest you completely spread out flat for a few days (3 tops) to unfold the nylon side straps. There is no need to do so if you are using outdoors.
