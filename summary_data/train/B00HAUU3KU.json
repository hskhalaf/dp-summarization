Despite that, I have had 300lbs (136kg) loaded on the bar catches with no warping, I have yet to drop the weight on the safety bars but they seem fairly strong and have supported at least 250lbs (113.4kgs) resting stationary on them. The chin up bar is nice and sturdy and supported me at 240lbs (108.9kgs) without having to be anchored to the ground, although I do have to bend my knees in order to fully lower myself at 6ft (1.83m).",

The fact that delivery was included was extremely helpful to me because I don't have a car and therefore couldn't easily buy one from a store or warehouse. This is my first rack, so I can't speak with too much confidence or compare it to other options.",

There are 3 or 4 spots where the paint is bubbling off so im sure it'll begin rusting before too long but really and truly its a rack for a garage, a little rust wont hurt.

Chin ups (unweighted) no problem...it's steady front to back and side to side. No wobble. If your squat is over 500 or 600 you already squat on an expensive commercial rack.
