This will insure a snug fit. We were confused as to what the clear plastic horseshoe shaped collar was for. Fortunately, another reviewer posted photos showing that the collar is used to prevent the caddy from sliding forward on the shower feed pipe.",

That head broke and was replaced with a shower head that included the wand within the head, making for a larger shower head.

      "text": "I really like the design of this shower caddy. It's simple, offers plenty of space for our needs and the price was very reasonable. When I've purchased shower caddy's in the past, before using, I remove the suction cups and give it a couple of thin coats of clear anti-rust type spray paint (such as Rustoleum CLEAR Automotive). When the paint is dry, put the suction cups back on and hang. Reapplying the clear coat from time to time will make it last longer and definitely resist rust - at least that's been my experience.",

Too bad, because I really liked it otherwise!",

I've only had it for a little while so can't speak to the rust, but I got the white like someone recommended in the comments and no rust yet. Definitely recommend.",
