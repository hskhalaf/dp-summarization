My Kill-A-Watt meter says it draws 37 watts rather than 36, but that's close enough for me. In my estimation it is a little bit brighter than the old 80 watt fluorescent fixture I replaced and it is extremely lightweight, so if you wanted to be able to move it around to different spots, that would be very easy. It's totally silent as well, another improvement over the fluorescent.",

A noticeable difference in brightness as it illuminates our two-car garage very well. Product comes with two wires (as in picture) to hang the light up. Cord is about 4 feet and going LED will definitely save on electricity bills as it draws only 36 watts. (as stated in product info) For the price, I can't complain and recommend this product to anyone wanting to upgrade to LED lighting or a replacement overhead light.",

The plastic clips in back of the light broke during installation because the plastic is too thin . Luckily, the lights still work. Poor quality case - plastic is too thin Poor product design. Would not recommend. Seller should not sell this poorly designed product until the plastic case is redesigned and reinforced.",

I ended up using zip ties to secure these to the rafters to make sure there aren't any more plastic failures.

Pretty expensive for a lot fixture that needs to be replaced after only 4 months. ==== Original February 2019 Super light-weight. Incredibly bright, white light.
