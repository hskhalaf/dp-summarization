Volume compare to other Bluetooth speakers is less but sufficient for the single room,laptop or cell phone speakers, this product is great for that. Only issue is volume control buttons are missing on the speakers.",

It is a good speaker and up till now it would have been a 5 star review, but don't expect it to work well for long.",

The bass is good, but not great and it will get distorted at the highest volumes. All-in-all you get more than what you expected for the price. The only downside is that there's no built in way to pair or daisy chain multiple speakers together (that I'm aware of). I'm not sure it why it makes mention of being able to in the product description unless they consider connecting them to a splitter as pairing.",

(Actually, my opinion of it tracks closely with the CNET video review that's available online). One other caveat: I would NOT, under any circumstances, take this unit on an airplane. It looks too much like a grenade, IHMO. It is my opinion that official reality (the TSA) might well confiscate the unit.",

      "text": "Sound quality isn't great. It makes a nice portable speaker for the pool area, or deck -- if you don't need to blast it. When volume is turned up, it gets a little staticy. Also, the base is pretty weak. Also the Bluetooth range isn't great, and often gets interrupted when you walk through the open space to phone/player. I use my Bose Soundlink around the house (absolute BEST sound quality and holds a charge for portability - great volume too) and use this grenade around the pool. Still looks freakin cool, though. Everyone comments on the form factor and color.",

While I know this isn't completely Philips fault, it does show the importance of having physical volume buttons on your bluetooth speaker, which this does not. Hopefully Motorola will fix their issue in their next update (like many other manufacturers have), or maybe Philips can give better instructions on how to fix this on their support site (they only tell you to update your phone and then it should work).",
