I am very picky with a tableware and I like a good glass craftsmanship (I do not like glasses which have a think circle on top of them, which stands out). These glasses are absolutely gorgeous, look like expensive glasses. Skinny, light yet seem durable. They are also of perfect width and are very easy to hold. I bought two more sets after I received the first one as I think they might be used for any occasion.",

These are nice looking glasses with simple clean lines and held up a few weeks until one shattered while getting ice from the fridge door. They are obviously way too thin at the top if an ice cube can break off a piece. When I went to pour out the ice the rest of the glass also shattered. Was hoping these would replace our good set.",
