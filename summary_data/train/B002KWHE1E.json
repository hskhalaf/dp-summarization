Bad because towards the end of the season my two kitties found it an ideal out door toilet. :( So it was something that I had to take apart every day and \"clean\" by tipping it up and shaking it out. There was no \"access\" panel to get at things without taking it apart. Which reminds me. I had read complaints about the zipper but for me it worked each time. Still this gave the kitties so much joy and I plan on using this again next year!!",

This was only the third time we've used it. Looking at this, neither my husband nor I can figure out how this happened as there is clearly no way to get it back into that enclosed space at the top where the other rods go.",

Honestly, the thought of buying a tens of dollars anything for the cats, that isn't a cat tower or medical attention, is hard for me. That said, this lets them out and enjoy time with us outside. Harnesses are fine but it restricts their movement and it clearly makes them uneasy. At least, with this tent, they are able to roam and are not encumbered by a restrictive harness. As an aside, it takes my cats a couple of minutes to adjust to being inside of the tent. They test the boundaries and paw at the enclosure until they mellow out. FYI.",

They are leery but I'm sure they will soon get used to it, especially if I leave some treats inside. Inventive and very much worth the money. Thank you.",

Both owner and furkid relaxed and at ease. I field tested the canopy in my backyard. Kirby begged to go back outside after we chilled for about an hour. Recommend to cat owners with cats that enjoy the outdoors.",

My husband is too worried about what the neighbors/people driving by will think because it's not every day you see a cat tent, but I don't care.
