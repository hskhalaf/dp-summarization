As a long-time purchaser who has been in a \"PC building break\" for a while, I was shocked by how \"bendable\" this case is. Even the USB ports feel crappy and loose. And I won't be surprised when anything screwed to the too-thin steel strips out (stand-offs, slot covers, expansion card retention screws, etc). I wonder if Corsair power supplies have become similarly junky? Bottom line: Corsair - we expect better.",

This allows for more control over air-flow management. While the picture clearly shows there are no covers, I very wrongly assumed that was being done to show that the ventilation option is there. You can literally see where the snap points _would_ be, if the panels had been included. I checked Asus' website, and I do not see any option to purchase them as an add-on. Looks like they just took the old model, and threw away an important aspect of it to hit a price point. Very disappointed.",

I'm not so sure where all the negative reviews are coming from - but for a case that is about $70 - you cannot go wrong. Don't get me wrong - this isn't a $250 case - but if you don't demand much for a low-cost case, then this is your ticket. Never had a Corsair product before - and they won me over.

And the one 120mm exhaust fan in the back doesn't move air well, or quietly.

      "text": "You won't be taking pictures to brag about your PC with this case, but it does more than enough. It doesn't let too much noise out, it has great space to hide the excess cables, it's got 3 places for external fans. GPU and CPU temps never reaches any high levels even when I ran them on full utilization for 3 days straight. The aesthetic is not the best out there, but I like it this way better. I like it more when things are great on the inside despite not looking too good on the outside.",

The Corsairs were designed by someone who builds computers, not by someone in marketing. Now I have four home-builds in them. Love them.",

Luckily it came wirh an extra standoff. Also, I had to remove the rear fan because it made it extremely difficult to install the motherboard because the ports JUST BARLEY fit under it. Again, I just put the fan back on after the mobo was installed. After all is said and done, Id highly recommend this csse for beginner's or someone on a budget.",

      "text": "This case is very subtle and includes most of the bells and whistles that enthusiast builders look for and expect. Tons of flexibility in terms of cooling and discrete cable routing. Fit my ATX mainboard and large graphics card easily. It only includes one 120MM fan... mounted high in front, which also provides the RGB factor of the Corsair \"sails\" logo on the face of this case. Many previous reviews brought to light their one con: they only received one SSD mount bracket... well, my purchase of this case on 2/12/2020 actually included the second SSD bracket (and thumbscrew). Perhaps Corsair heard their criticisms and rectified it. This is an excellent case, both in looks and function.",

I had trouble with the power switch on the old case too, but not with this one. It is responsive and well-constructed. I will definitely stick with Corsair for future cases.",

Thumbscrews for opening the side panels and tool-less drive bays are nice. The overall finish is quite nice, but some parts of it seem a bit plasticy and cheap (e.g. the drive bays). Not an issue for me but if you're looking to dress up a fancy gaming rig and you want it to look super fancy, this one may not be the right choice. Not listed in the specs, but comes with 4 SATA cables.",
