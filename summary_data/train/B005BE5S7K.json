When the scratches got too numerous, I moved the table into my son's room so he can continue using it for his scratchy projects and bought a new one for the living room. So far, no scratches.",

The table is also lightweight for being glass (which is a good thing in my book). I did read some of the reviews and some customer said that their tables developed white circles where the steel circles meet the glass due to too much pressure. In attempts to prevent this, I did not overtighten any of the screws. I tightened it just right so that the table is stable. All-in-all very nice product!",
