I would definitely recommend this product for anyone considering purchasing. Great product!",

The benches easily seats 3-4 on each side. The only caveat is the bench is narrow, so make sure it\u2019s set up on flat surface or it might tip over.

Some bits of glue stick, crayon, etc. just won't come out even with soaking and a brush. I feel like we got our money's worth though. We haven't been easy on this little table set.",

Also the lock on the table Is not tight enough to keep the table completely flat on uneven ground.",

Unless I\u2019m already sitting on it the benches wobble as my toddler tries climbing on. Ultimately they should have made it to where the benches connected to the table for better stability or widened the leg supports to assist with that issue.",

They will easily fit 6 adults and they are really sturdy, with the center bench support there is no movement at all. The fact that these fold up and can be stored out of site is a major plus. I'd highly recommend these!!",

I will give it a good field test and get back with you later on down the line. I do not baby anything i own so it will be interesting to see if this is built to last.",
