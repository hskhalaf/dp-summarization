I threw the 3rd one into a Ziploc bag and placed that one in the refrigerator. These do not have the added preservatives like Slim Jim, so they must be stored in a sealed container in a cold place. As other reviews have stated, they will mild over if not stored properly. The package is not resealable unfortunately.",

I take 5 at a time for lunch at work. (I don't take an actual break, I eat while I'm working and it's usually full of interruptions.) So I get about a week's worth of lunches for $14, not bad.

So, \"as is\", no thanks, but put in some baking time and GREAT FLAVOR! Probably too much fat in these, so to bake off the fat and wipe them down, makes the product more tasty.",

I cut the sticks in half, and put them in a Glad container in my mini fridge at the office.

These also had a more acrid flavor than the tub packed linked type. Obviously I prefer the tub of smokey link like beef sausages. But both were acceptable, kielbasa textured and flavoured sausages.",

    "description": "At Old Wisconsin, we craft the finest sausages because we pick only the most premium cuts of beef, pork and turkey. Next we use the perfect recipe of spices passed down by generations of sausage makers. These spices complement our meats, ensuring that they enhance the natural flavors while never overpowering them. We use no binders, fillers or extenders\u2014just enormous care to ensure that our sausages are always mouthwateringly delicious. We hand craft our meats into a variety of shapes and sizes before we begin the smoking process. We smoke all of our meats slowly over real hardwood fires in our traditional pit style smokehouse to ensure natural flavor. We leave them hanging for as long as it takes until we're satisfied with the flavor. After we smoke our meats, we pack them immediately to seal in the freshness and flavor. Quality control procedures are in place at every step of the process, and goods are stored under optimal temperatures to maintain freshness and quality. But our products rarely sit around. We ship to retailers all across the country, allowing everyone to experience the true taste of Wisconsin.",
