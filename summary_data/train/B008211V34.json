This one, however is awesome. The handle comfortable and the ability to fill it without having to wait 5 or more minutes of cooling down makes it so much more useful. It gets up to temp quick and has tons of pressure (you pump with the handle) to knock out serious stains and grime.",

Fill it up with water using the built in measuring cup, attach your cleaning accessory, plug it in and you are ready to go. I especially like the extra long power cord and the steam cleaning accessories that came with it. This is a great steam clearer to use all around your home!",

I have thoroughly cleaned all of my beds, living room furniture, curtains, throw pillows etc. And I'm just getting started. I'm very pleased with it. One gripe is that the bendable attachment is difficult to work with. Other than that, 5 stars from me. And it's definitely portable for travel or on the go. I will definitely recommend to family & friends.",

Having the use of the flexible hose would be nice for certain situations though, so will need to contact someone about getting the broken piece replaced. Otherwise, it worked great.",

The cord is pretty long and although it only holds around a cup of water, if you bring a water bottle with you where you're using it, it gets the job done well! You have to depress the back end of the spout to make steam and I found using my elbow worked great when I need both hands. Very happy.",
