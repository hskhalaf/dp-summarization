With that said; this unit was difficult for me to manage. Keeping device stable while processing over a pot was a challenge. I had to try to use my thumb to hold handle part level - which seemed to help. So if you have small hands, size six women's, this will be your challenge besides not getting pissed off if and when the scraper breaks! 2 Stars for stainless steel construction.",

You waste a lot of food because it doesn't do a good job of pressing the food all the way through. I can do a better job with a fine mesh sieve, a silicone spatula, and a little elbow grease.",

This is great for professional kitchens, people who cook a lot of food, or someone who has to have restaurant-grade everything. However, if you're like me (a regular cook) you'll do better to get something smaller and less expensive.",

It is not a tool I use a lot, but when you want to mash potatoes or make a tomato sauce, the quality and efficiency of the Cuisipro is well worth the additional cost. The Cuisipro is so superior to the other two food mill's that I have owned that I am regretting the money I wasted on inferior products. I made mashed potatoes for sixteen this Thanksgiving in half the time thanks to the Cuisipro.",

    "title": "Cuisipro Deluxe Food Mill",
    "description": "Cook\u2019s Illustrated Recommended \u2013 Winner!\n\nWith a simple turn of the ergonomic, non-slip handle this durable stainless steel food mill purees a wide variety of fruit and vegetables while straining out skins, seeds and pulp. Instead of manually scraping the underside of the mill, the innovative scraper automatically scrapes as you turn. This increases efficiently by allowing a smoother, more continuous flow of food. The deluxe food mill also sits high in you pot or bowl keeping the mill out of the food. Comes with 3 different size straining disks; 2mm, 3mm; 4mm. Comes part for easy cleaning.\n\n\n\nAMAZON.COM\nFor smart and tidy baking and cooking, Cuisipro's deluxe food mill makes a valuable player in any home chef's starting lineup. The extra-large round vessel fits securely on top of another bowl or pot with a plastic-coated roll bar on one side and a long, non-slip handle on the other. To operate, simply place the fruit or vegetable to be pureed inside, and turn the knob on top. As the food moves through the straining disk, unwanted parts like skins and seeds get left behind and a handy plastic scraper underneath sweeps the puree down. Three interchangeable disks in 2mm, 3mm, and 4mm sizes allow the chef to choose a finer or coarser consistency. Crafted of 18/10 stainless steel, the food mill disassembles for cleaning. It is backed by Cuisipro's 25-year warranty. --Kara Karll",
