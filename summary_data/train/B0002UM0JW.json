I tried the next 2 generations that replaced it, and they all had issues that detracted from the experience of using the original MX1000. I finally found an MX1000 on Amazon, but when it arrived, it was a BlueTooth version of that venerable mouse. I was happily surprised to find that it shared all of the reasons that made me love the original MX1000, and the BlueTooth actually makes it feel even snappier in gaming. No way to actually prove that it responds faster, but it does feel that way. I use it for video editing, gaming, and everyday life. Can't recommend it highly enough.",

      "text": "There is one other review that says \"mouse died after two weeks\", and that also happened to me ... I eventually found out the reason is because as well as plugging the base station into the computer USB port, you have to plug it into a power outlet (or the mouse doesn't recharge). While this sounds stupid, it's the first mouse I've ever owned that needed to be plugged directly into power and there is nothing shouting at you that you must do this (you have to look at the diagram for \"how to plug the mouse in\") and the plug is easy to miss in the packaging. However, after solving that problem the mouse works very well.",

The second is that the scroll wheel feels a little flimsy compared to the old one. The best improvement over the older designs is the left/right scroll wheel. Overall I would recommend it.",

I really like the back/forward and document flip buttons. There is one draw back with this product. I'm sure Logitech made it's size for the average hand. I have small hands and little fingers, so if you do too, expect to have to reposition your hand at times to reach some of the controls. Children would have problems too. Logitech should investiage this, and model more than one size. I would have rated it 5 star otherwise. But, I still recommend this product.",

Finally decided to change to a MS Explorer 2.0 Wireless IntelliMouse (on sale) which I like much better. Hate to admit this as I'm one to avoid MS if I can. On the plus side the battery was excellent, lasting a long time before needing recharge.",

The button placement is great, and the software allows for a lot of customization. I upgraded the software online to the newest version with no problems. The base has a very small AC adapter that fits easily on your power strip between other plugs. The mouse tracks very well, and is very well designed. I highly recommend it!",

The second the mouse configuration software would not always allow me to configure the mouse when after losing the config settings when switching computers. The extra features are OK, but I don't use them. I just wanted to be able to use the scroll functions and not change batteries all the time. This mouse satisfied those requirements.",

      "text": "I've had the MX1000 since last September (2006), and it's everything it says it is. Even though my family and I put it through its paces for hours every day, the rechargable battery runs for days without recharging. The wireless feature has never interfered with my wireless network, and the multiple button features work great. I highly recommend the MX1000 to anyone looking for a dependable, multi-featured, rechargable, wireless mouse.",

      "text": "I love this thing. I tried the MX700 and it was a pig, too big and slow. I'm using the MX1000 w/a Mac G5 and it works great. The tracking is frankly amazing, super sensitive but you don't feel like you are on edge trying to control w/micromovements. I have a small platform for my mouse to sit on so I was wary of this thing being too big, but it works great. In the last 6 months I've been through 5 different mice. This is miles beyond any of the others (including Apple's, Kensington's wireless, MX700, the Bluetake).",
