      "text": "By far and away the best macro lens I've ever used... and I have quite a few! The image clarity is beyond incredible, and when used on a crop-sensor (APS-C) camera (such as the Nikon D500) it is effectively 157.5mm, bringing the detail even closer with (surprisingly) zero noticeable reduction in quality (not that I can see, anyway). Sharp as a knife, colours are faithful to reality... sure beats the lens tubes I was using a few years ago, and the lesser macro lenses I was using up until I bought this one. If you are into photographing insects, or detailed shots of plants, or even portraiture... this is definitely a lens worth buying!",

The optical stabiliser on full setting (2) is just as good as being on a tripod, suppose that depends on how steady your hold is as well but none the less the stabiliser does its job well. Build quality is on par with Nikon and around HALF the price. For any photographer other than a professional I'd definitely recommend this gorgeous third party macro lens and save yourself a fair bit of money.",

Medium distance objects also focus perfectly, which is one reason this is good for portraits and taking pictures of plants and animals. Automatic focus works well and quickly. The fixed focal length seems to give about the same perspective as the human eye, so is a unique magnification distance.",

Play around with the manual settings to get a greater depth of field. Probably benefits from RAW format to get the best resolution but it still gives good results at the highest jpeg setting. Haven't tinkered with that yet. It is heavy though. Must be twice as heavy as my Nikon 55-200 macro zoom. You need to get close to the subject so it is only good for stationary or slow moving things that don't mind having a lens shoved in their face.",

Image quality matches lens at twice the price and the macro is a genuine 1:1.
