While I wish the charger was wireless, it's not too difficult to get it seated correctly in the dark since it does use magnets. They get away with a full circle by not including an ambient light sensor but I've not found that to be any problem. This watch lasts me almost two full days on a single charge with regular use. My other devices usually barely made a single day. Also, I've had people compliment it then realize it's a smart watch because the screen is so crisp and vibrant it looks like a real watch.",

Yes it is a little more bulky, but after a short while I did not find it uncomfortable. This adds WiFi (which the original G Watch does not support), but I did not yet notice that it synced any differently by using Bluetooth alone. The display is bright in most indoor locations but like any display of this type, it can be difficult to read outdoors.",

I charge my Samsung S4 every night so no issues putting the charging station right next to my phone.
