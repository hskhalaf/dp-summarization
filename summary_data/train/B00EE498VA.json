However.... now that they are broken in... I love them! The sole contoured to the shape of my foot. The straps are adjustable. If you are accustomed to wearing cheapo flip flops/sandals from Target/Walmart, you will have an adjustment period. But all in all, I feel safer wearing these sturdy sandals. I got them muddy by accident, so I let them soak in a bucket of warm water and they cleaned up just like new. They seem to be well made.",

Around the edges of the top footbed layer and cork where it is glued together is separating in multiple places. To be honest, they aren\u2019t comfortable for long walks. I spend a day in the city and a few hours in, I was regretting wearing these. Very disappointed in the price I paid. I\u2019ve had knockoffs last longer and look better for 1/3 of the price.

Also, parts of the soft footbed were missing, so there are some black spots. Then it looked as though clear glue surrounded the edges. My guess is they had a used pair and tried to repair the footbed and resell it as new. Definitely got a refund.",

Also, all other Birkenstock\u2019s I have bought come with metal buckles. If I wanted plastic buckles I would have ordered from the Birkenstock Betula line. I must admit the picture and the soft footbed are accurate. However, I usually go off the product description since pictures can be misleading.

I don\u2019t know whether my feet have changed or grown over the years but I read the size chart and how the sandals are supposed to fit... I ended up ordering a size larger but in narrow fit both because they are unisex and my foot is rather narrow. They fit perfect. The stone color is great and complimentary neutral. I \u201cbroke them in\u201d for 5 days around the house before traveling to NYC and comfortably walked 23 miles over 4 days without any foot/ leg/ back pain!",

A lot of reviewers on Amazon also recommend purchasing a narrow if you have a normal width foot, but the birk pros told me that birkinstocks are DESIGNED to fit a bit wider and looser, and that's the way they should be worn-- no if you have a narrow foot order a narrow-- if you have a medium width foot order a medium.

The only problem is that the suede stretches quite easily, and my daughter had to make a new notch to keep the shoe fitting (and she has a wide-ish foot), so I would say they run a bit wide and about right for a 39; however, if you are more of an 8 than an 8-1/2, they would be a bit big, I think. We got these for a good price, and I would recommend them, just knowing that they might run wide (or stretch wide).",

The Birkenstocks keep my foot from splaying and allows the ligament to heal. The shoe has good arch support and stiff footpad. I use it at home when I can't stand tennis shoes anymore; especially in the heat here in the West. All I know is my foot is finally healing, but REALLY slow going, and doesn't hurt when I walk in the birkenstocks, versus other sandals. Hope this helps!",
