It would be 4 stars for the price, but I need to constantly re-tighten the temple screws as they get loose when you flip the visor up and down. It's a minor annoyance that starts to grate after a couple of hours. I wish there was some midrange option between this and the $100's surgeons loupes, but I haven't found one yet, so this does the job.",
