I finally got a nice job and able to purchase a top notch straightener and I have gotten so many compliments in the few weeks I've had it! My hair looks and feels so silky, doesn't kink, and it even tackles the wavy fibers up under my neck. My hair is naturally curly/wavy and I have dreamed to have hair this good since I was itty bitty. It took me about 20 years but I finally have the look i've always wanted!!! Thanks CHI!",

The blades are EXTREMELY difficult to close, so the hair slips through, and requires multiple passes over the same piece of hair. That means much more hair damage from heat, and it hurt my hands having to press the blades so hard! 4. The temperature control disc is tiny and it requires glasses to see the numbers on it. I have a flat iron by PING. It\u2019s the best! It\u2019s the same size as this one and the blades close easily. I\u2019ll stick with it. Thank you.",
