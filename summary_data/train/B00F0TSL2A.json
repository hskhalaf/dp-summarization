It mentions pulling the crown out to the second stop to set the date and it's very ambiguous and indecipherable. While trying to set the date by pulling the crown out to the second stop, the crown pulled (completely) out of the watch. Note: I am not Hercules or Superman. At this point, when the crown was inserted back into the watch, it wouldn't stay in the watch. Other than that, it's a great watch! But I returned it because we wanted one that allows for the date and time to be set.",
