Good price . Came in two days with Prime as promised . I am well satisfied .",

Not too cumbersome, takes up very little room in our nitch, yet provides room for even an oversized bar of soap. I have been using it for 2 months. So far, no rust. One suggestion is would be for the bottom to have small silicone pad at the corners. I am careful when moving it, so it does not scrape the tile's finish.
