I\u2019m happy with the purchase, the last brand I had came loose more often than I\u2019d care to mention and also rusted apart from the salt water in less than a year. So far so good with this one, the quality is there. Give it a go.",

Mine is perfectly round so I had to reshape the lower clamp arm a little with a couple pars of pliers then it fit perfectly around my wheel ring. This knob is very nicely done. Beautiful polished finish, nice spinning action, no slop or wobble. Honestly I didn't expect much for 13 bux but was very surprised by the weight and solid sturdiness. Dramatically improves maneuvering ease. Will never boat without one again. I highly recommend this item and seller.",
