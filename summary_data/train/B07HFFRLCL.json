      "text": "We had a special birthday in our family. You know, one of those which end in \"0\"! I decided to try my hand at putting together a Charcuterie Board, Cheese Tray, Nibbles for the food table. This Bamboo Board was certainly the centerpiece of my table. What I liked---the indent on two of the corners to hold small bowls for mustard or mayo, the indents around the sides for crackers, etc. But my favorite part was the slide-out drawer with four utensils compatible with the theme. I thought the table looked nice. I learned a lot! And I am very glad I added this piece to my entertaining collection!",

      "text": "I like the product, it is functional and pretty. However, it isn't polished, and you run the risk of getting splinters every time you open the drawer, or touch the edges. Also, the two ceramic bowls are fragile, and the edges break off quickly. We have now had the product for less than three months, and it has cracked in two. This is most likely because I washed it after using it. Either way, the product has now fallen apart, and its two ceramic bowls have chipped. No heavy usage, just some happy hour snacks, but no longer useable. A good idea, but poorly executed.",

The two ceramic cups were a profound benefit over charcuterie boards that do not have anything similar. Cracker wells also a great improvement over other serving boards. If the board was just three or four inches wider it would seem less crowded. Tight fit to serve Brie, Pate, and 2 cheeses. Absolutely very happy with the purchase. Super happy I purchased two to give one as a Christmas gift to my sister who is a professional caterer. She will love it",
