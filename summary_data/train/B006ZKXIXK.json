The filters are also stupidly expensive to replace for what they are. There is no timer on this filter, so manual on/off It is not as quiet as it suggest, you can not have this in your bedroom and sleep When mine was turned off i heard a high pitched buzzing noise, sounds dangerous so had to turn off at the mains. The above concerned me a little as I've read on how a few have burnt out. So yes, item sent back.",
