The issue with the others was the straps, buckles or seams rubbing under the arm (e.g. the Camelback was the worst). The lighter weight Nathan had an attachment strap that wanted to run directly across her breasts, which was irritating. This one, while a little more bulky, was perfect for her. There are lots of storage compartments, including one that fits her iphone 7+. Her nathan handheld fits comfortably as well, so she can carry an electrolyte in addition to the water in the vest. Overall, 5 starts for comfort and function.",
