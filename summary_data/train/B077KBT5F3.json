      "text": "This is my second purchase of this speaker after being an audiophile for decades downsizing to a condo and not having room for a full on system with separates this speaker is a great compromise. Sound needs to be adjusted with type of music often. Speaker provides a full sound with emphasis on mid to bottom range. The multi room function is what sold me being able to fill multiple rooms with sound perfectly in sync with no lag between. Sometimes there is connectivity issues but nothing that can\u2019t be overcome. Good looking, kind of like a little practice amp.",

This is the loudest and most clear speaker I ever owned. The Bluetooth is functional but it has a lag and you can't watch anything on your TV with WOBURN be as the speaker. I haven't used the Wifi yet after few months owning this speaker ... Didn't see the need. If I ever use the Wifi, I will update this post. I got to give it a 5-Star even with the problem with its Bluetooth.",
