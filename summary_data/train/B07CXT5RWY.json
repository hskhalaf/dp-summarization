I bit the bullet and bought this one while only spending $20 more than a comparable canvas counterpart. It's a great bag. The elastic fits on each sleeve are a very nice touch, and the leather is of excellent quality. If you are in the market for a leather knife roll, purchase this one and save $200 to buy another knife to fit into this beautiful roll.",

I have a few custom knives and a few fine Japanese blades and one can't carry those around in a polyester bag. It just wouldn't be right. I do believe it should be double stitched because the leather feel like it's going to last for 50 years. And as for water-proofing, just treat it with Armor All leather care as I did and don't leave it on a prep table. You wouldn't do that with a polyester bag anyway. All in all it's great craftsmanship at only $110.00",
