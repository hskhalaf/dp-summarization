I definitely recommend this coat. Much better quality than Eddie Bauer and cheaper:)",

It is a very warm cozy jacket so I don\u2019t think there will be a need for layering either. I love the colors and the fur hood. Very great quality, I bought to use snowboarding.",

Despite the low price, this coat has all the bells and whistles - fitted wrist bands with a thumb hole, waist garter to keep snow out of your coat if you fall skiing. I usually wear a 10 so I ordered a Large but it's a little big. In hindsight I should have stuck to the size chart a little closer and ordered a Medium. I'm not going to return it because I'll just layer underneath anyway, but be forewarned.",
