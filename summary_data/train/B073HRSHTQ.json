After that, I tried 4 different shredded Memory foam pillows on Amazon and they were either too flat or too fluffy this one is perfect! It has the ideal amount of density and height, easily plumps up as necessary. It also has a stay-cool cover to keep your head from overheating at night. Thank you Wondersleep!",

I used to wakw up with a stiff and sore neck and I have not had this happen since using these pillows. I took out filling from my pillow (a gallon sized ziplock bag full). My husband uses the other pillow and after putting it in the dryer his fluffed back up. I've never been happy about pillows but I am this time around. We will buy more for our children and the guestroom.",
