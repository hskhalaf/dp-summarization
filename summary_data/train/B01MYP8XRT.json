      "text": "I got this to bring to eastern Europe over the holidays where it basically snowed every day and ranged from 25-40 degrees Fahrenheit. I wore a long-sleeve thermal and sweater underneath, and it kept me warm the whole time! It's very comfy and easy to assemble the two jackets. I am 5'4\" and 135lbs with a large bust, and I ordered the medium and it fit perfectly! The outer shell is totally waterproof, and has a large hood to protect your face from the rain. When it's not raining, I just wear the inner coat by itself, and it keeps me warm in the California winter (basically 40-65 degrees Fahrenheit). Very happy with this purchase, and I definitely recommend it!",

This is a gorgeous coat and I love the color. It's true to the photo. The inner liner is easy to take in and out of the main coat. I found that even on cooler days I need it though to keep warm. I run a little cooler in the winter. The pockets are great, they are angled so your gloves and hat don't fall out. The zippers do not snag on excess fabric. I highly recommend this coat.",

It\u2019s a liiitle snug, but the large was huge and dumpy looking and the sleeves were really long. I can still wear a sweatshirt under the medium so it\u2019s the winner. This is the only liner of the 3 that I\u2019d wear on its own. I was concerned about the sleeves since there are no cuffs, but because of the way it fits, it actually doesn\u2019t bother me at all. I got the green which is a beautiful, deep olive green.",

But if I was to order a North Face jacket again, it will be in stores and not on Amazon.",
