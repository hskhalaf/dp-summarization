I bought it for the Thunderbolt 3 interface, expecting I'd be able to buy a dock and use it at home with dual monitors. I spend several hundred dollars on a Thunderbolt 3 compatible docks, nothing sees this notebook. I tried asking LGs customer support, they just came back and told me they can't tell me what's wrong with my dock. I recommend do not buy this. Yes it light, yes its screen looks good. It can't do what my old heavy HP notebook and dock could do. Total disappointment. I just don't have time to mess with this endlessly. DON'T BUY ONE",
