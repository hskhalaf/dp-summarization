Frequently disconnects and reconnects from the wireless network at random intervals - sometimes once a week, sometimes several times in an afternoon. As I'm writing this review, it already disconnected twice. Once it begins it doesn't stop until the device is completely powered off and restarted. I'd expect this from some cheapo bargain repeater, but this is an overpriced $90 jape. Don't waste your money again, and steer clear of TP-Link in the future, they seem dead set on ignoring the problem now that they have their newer products out.",

I got it because I thought it would be better than the router (Touch P5) working as repeater but now I regret so much from buying it. It almost seems it is broken. I thought they would release a new firmware to correct it, but it never happened. Right now it is a paper weight for me because I can not even turn it on otherwise it will mess up with my internet. I had a TL-WA850RE and it worked so perfectly. but this RE590T is horrible.",
