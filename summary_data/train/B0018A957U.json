Cuisinart's lifetime guarantee is worthless since it costs as much if not more for shipping and handling for a return than the pot is worth. I knew I should have stuck with Le Creuset! A lot more expensive but definitely worth it.",

The paint around the handle then started to chip and it just keeps getting worse. Will be contacting Cuisinart customer service tomorrow for warranty information but given other reviews here, I\u2019m not very hopeful that I will get good results. Plus, their warranty advises that the customer must pay shipping charges to and from Cuisinart, which I find ridiculous as this item is very heavy. You are better off saving your money and buying a le crueset...Far superior in every way to this piece of garbage.",

Not only is this product defective it's dangerous and shouldn't be on the market. Amazon needs to pull this its website and stop selling it before someone gets hurt.

So I cleaned the pan and seized it ... twice. Same results. Everything sticks to its surface. Possibly Cuisinart used some sort of super glue in its construction? Have had it sitting around to use as a weight on top of grilled cheese that I make easily in another fry pan.",
