The rc controller is a nice touch and durable, however the directions are completely wrong when setting up and linking devices. What are the chances more act like the two that I received, I reckon I'm not the only one that received bad drones. Switching out batteries did not improve their functioning at all.",

If you do pick this drone up definitely buy these batteries.",
