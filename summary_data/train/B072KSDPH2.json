Unpacking is very, very easy, no problem. But as for packing it up, not so. I've tried leaving the tent unzipped, I've tried it zipped, but it hardly makes a difference because the material gets lumpy in some areas so much that closing the case is extremely difficult, to the point where the seams look like they are about to burst! Makes me worry about its longevity, considering its high price tag.",
