This book has wonderful content- it is so much more than a cookbook and would be a great starter guide for anyone new to the keto diet. She has done a lot work, including breaking down what to buy at certain stores (Costco, Trader Joe's, Safeway, etc.), and an easy \"swap this for that\" guide. My entire family eats a keto diet and her recipes are both family and budget friendly. Highly recommend!",

Also the serving sizes are misleading- The carb amount listed is OK for a meal but serving sizes are such a small amount of food that you can\u2019t eat a meal and stay below your carb max.

However, I am using the myfitnesspal to track my food, and every recipe is in the food database and does include serving size. Otherwise I would have given 5+ stars for this cookbook.

I saw her on Kelly and Ryan and that's why I bought her book. I received it Friday afternoon and began reading it in the evening and the next thing I new, it was nearly midnight. This is the only diet book you'll ever need, especially if you've been struggling all your life, have tried just about everything and nothing has stuck. I have also joined the Keto Karma facebook group and it is quite helpful too, however, I wish that everyone on there bought her book first before entering the discussions.",

It is difficult to stay on the amount of daily carbs recommended, but cutting them significantly makes a big difference. This is well written, lots of recipes and the author's personal challenge with weight loss. After starting this plan about one week ago, so far I have lost 4# and will try to stick with it until the next 15 are gone. Weight Watchers worked well for me, but constantly having to document what you eat, try to figure out every point...it became a pain, even though it worked well. This method is simpler. Also, it makes you feel fuller longer and feel better mentally---so far.",

I like that in the beginning she takes a moment to explain the science behind Keto and foods to avoid. Her book is very educationa, so if you are just starting you will find what she has to say very valuable. I also love that she shared her story; I found it to be so relatable. As far as recipes go, she knocks them out of the park. My family is full of picky eaters, but all of her recipes have been a hit. There isn't any that we have tried that we dislike. 10/10 I would buy this book again.",

The book gives you every little detail that you can imagine. it has her story from day one, the progress, and final results. Also the book has cooking recipes, Shopping list, 1 month meal plan, etc... Now I will be doing my grocery shopping from this book and will start in KETO soon.",
