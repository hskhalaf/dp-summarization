The assembly was super easy, just a bit time consuming as is most furniture you have to put together. Took my husband and I about 2 hours. The drawers have a left and right side. You\u2019ll know this because they won\u2019t close unless they are put in correctly. The piece when finished is beautiful and just what we were looking for in the empty space we had next to our fireplace. The four drawers are such an added bonus.

It very easy to damage during assembly because pieces are precariously balanced, which is why it gets one star for the shallow cam depths that rip right through the pressboard if not handled with kid gloves. I badly damaged the side of drawer piece in a very visible way, but 2 hours into assembly I\u2019m not turning back and will patch and glue the damage later. I wish I\u2019d bought another closet maid bookcase that went together in 20 minutes instead of wasting my time and money on this shoddy piece.",

One drawer\u2019s line is cut on the wrong end. It\u2019s impossible to know until you put it all together and then the drawers won\u2019t close together. I tried many different variations of putting the drawers in different orders before I figured this out. Once I did figure out which one was the problem, I was able to flip the face the opposite way and turn the handle around and get it all to fit together.

Unfortunately when the unit is fully assembled the drawers clearly aren't all made the same.
