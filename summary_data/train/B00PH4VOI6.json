Those individuals with defective units should just get them replaced instead of whining here about it!!",

I spent a lot of time researching before I bought it- I wanted something small that could easily fit on my nightstand, and wanted to be sure the diffuser didn't heat the oil/water (not good for oils). I run this in my bedroom at night- it helps with the dry air (due to electric heaters) and keeps the room smelling wonderful. I add 5-6 drops of essential oil to my water and let the diffuser go to work. My favorite scents to use are eucalyptus and rose otto. I would highly recommend this for anyone looking for a serene/spa experience at home.",

I like that I can turn it on with zero lighting at night or during the day, select one of the different light settings i can also set it to alternating through all the colors.",

It has been wonderful and I have had no problems with either diffuser. At night I love watching the changing colors, which I find to be very calming.
