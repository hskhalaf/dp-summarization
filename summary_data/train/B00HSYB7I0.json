I ordered my regular shoe size, and even though I have wide feet, these fit comfortably right from the get-go. The first pair developed a hole in the tongue - the stitching was too close to the edge. I got a return label from Amazon, shipped the boots back the day my new order arrived (in perfect condition). They're wicked good!",
