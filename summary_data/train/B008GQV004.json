When you first take it out of the bag, it is new of course so it's pretty fluffy, your pet may tumble over a little bit until it stabilizes and takes to his/her shape. After that, you're golden. It's soft, deep and dark, just like they want it! You should get it, in fact, get two, so you don't have to keep taking it to one room to another all the time like I do. I'm ordering another!",

I will be buying another one as they out-grow these. We live in Georgia and don't have a whole lot of extremely cold weather and with these I feel confident out little band of felines will be safe.",
