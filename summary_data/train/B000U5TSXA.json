Close-ups was my main reason for getting this type of camera. The reason I put this here was because I waited too long to give DJsDealAlerts here on Amazon a 5 star rating. I am very very satisfied with DJsDealAlerts and Amazon for the camera I bought. Again, it's great for close-ups. I had taken a picture of a penny and I could see every scratch and dent on it clearly and up close... That's how good this type of camera is...",

The face detection frequently will not detect the face of a child because a child's face moves a lot. The red eye is not removed unless the face is detected. Even when the face is detected the red eye is often not removed. I love the Z5 I have, and other than the red eye removal I like this camera also. The camera will provide a slide show with music accompaniment. Small size and great user interface are good features.",

It takes longer for the software to process the images taken. The Face Detection feature is almost useless, it is a good concept but it was poorly executed. For the money, in my oppinion, you could get a better camera. Might want to consider the Casio, Canon, Nikon or Sony units from the same price range!",

If your plans are more than just pictures of that sort then I would not recomend this camera. It takes great pictures but the software that comes with it is not so great. I wish I would have done a little more research and not just bought it because of the color but still it is a good camera.",

If I need to sell stuff, I really enjoy the auction mode because it automatically takes smaller size pics and therefore it's easier to upload into the auction! It's also a wonderful shade of pink! I know I will be enjoying this camera for a while!!!",

    "title": "Fujifilm Finepix Z10fd 7.2MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Midnight Black)",
    "description": "Color:BlackFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe FinePix Z10fd is a slim 7.2-megapixel digital camera, wrapped in the stylish curves and rounded edges of a slim 20.5mm body with a choice of five vivid colors: Midnight Black, Hot Pink, Sunset Orange, Wasabi Green, and Wave Blue. In addition to its sleek and compact body, the Z10fd packed with stunning technologies designed to offer beautiful images and fun playback functions. \n\n \n\nThe ergonomic design of the FinePix Z10fd fits comfortably in your hand, enabling users to carry it around anytime. It features the traditional Z-series lens cover, and has a 2.5-inch LCD and simple button layout on the back side of the camera. These features make the camera easy and fun to operate.  Offering high-resolution 7.2-megapixel photos, the FinePix Z10fd also boasts the acclaimed Fujifilm\u2019s high sensitivity up to ISO 1600 at full resolution and enables users to take bright and blur-free photos. In addition, Z10fd is equipped with the hardware-based Face Detection Technology. Point at the subject, and the camera will immediately find up to 10 human faces in the frame and automatically optimize AE and AF on the detected faces. Additionally, the FinePix Z10fd features the newly developed Auto Red Eye Removal, which leverages Face Detection\u2019s strengths to do its job. This system finds red-eye on the human faces, and corrects it automatically within a few seconds as the shot is taken. There are additional features of the Face Detection in the playback mode, such as cropping, zooming in, and slide show. \n\n Fuji FinePix Z10fd Highlights \n\n \n\nFace Detection technology The new Z10fd Finepix digital still camera features Face Detection to significantly improve your picture taking by identifying human subjects' faces in the frame (up to 10 faces) and in real time, determining the optimal focus and exposure settings for the absolute best results possible in any shooting conditions. Behind Fujifilm's Face Detection technology is a newly developed LSI chip combined with patented software that allows the FinePix Z10fd digital still camera to reach a level of performance in digital photography never before possible.  Picture Stabilization Technology The FinePix Z10fd with Picture Stabilization will automate professional photographic techniques to help reduce camera shake, freeze subject movement and improve low light background detail. Picture Stabilization utilizes higher sensitivities, up to ISO 1600 in the Z10fd, an incredibly high signal to noise ratio, and faster shutter and operational speeds to deliver virtually blur free images where conventional digital cameras cannot. \n\n IrSimple wireless transfer Transfer your images quickly and easily from your FinePix Z10fd to any IrSimple-equipped device. A fast infrared technology, IrSimple makes getting those photos out of your camera a breeze. Want to share with your friends? No problem, you can even transfer images to another IrSimple equipped camera too! \n\n \n\nFive Unique Color and Finish Designs The FinePix Z10fd is designed with style and fashion in mind for the youthful photographer that\u2019s on the move. Five exciting and vibrant color schemes are available: Midnight Black, Hot Pink, Sunset Orange, Wasabi Green, and Wave Blue.  xD/SD-compatible slot The Finepix Z10fd features an xD/SD compatible slot, allowing the use of either xD Picture Card or SD media to store and transfer your photos. This convenient and flexible capability assures compatibility with a wider variety of applications than ever before, and allows users to choose the media technology that is right for them. \n\n \n\nBlog Mode copies images for easy e-mail & web sharing Now you can post pictures to Blogs, Websites, or Auctions or email with ease. The Z10fd features a new Blog Mode feature that will automatically resize any image you\u2019ve captured to a 640x480 (VGA) image size, right in the camera, with the touch of a button! Your original high resolution image is saved, and an additional VGA image file is created for use in web applications or email where smaller file sizes and faster load times are needed. No editing software or additional work is necessary. Just push the button and upload!
