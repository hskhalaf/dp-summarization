But my favorite-legendary status-hammer has been the Vaughn 19 oz. milled face with curved handle. Mine was recently stolen. This replacement feels like made in China low quality. It says made in USA. I doubt it. The head is quick cranked out of a machine. The edges are sharp, not hand polished like the old ones. The balance feels off. I miss my old hammer.",

As with myand, I find the balance just as perfect as one would expect of a hammer with the Vaughan name. The curved white hickory handle fits very comfortably in my hand and the 17 inch length gives me a nice extended reach for those places that are hard to get at. ~ The Boss",
