      "text": "This brand and product is the best spray clear coat I've ever used. The semi matte was not what I was looking for, however. The other option I've used, 2k high-gloss was too glossy and stood out against the rest of the vehicle. So this time I bought the semi matte, but it was too matte. I don't know if there's an in between option, but if there was it would be perfect. In the future I might buy the high gloss and just take it down a bit with sand paper. WEAR A MASK WITH THIS STUFF! It's really toxic, but like most modern products: that's how you know it's going to work.",

This was mentioned by multiple other people in their reviews. My plan now is to wet sand these white areas down in order to try and save my time and money. Original review: Bought this to finish a project and ended up ruining that project. Ate through the paint and down to the primer. I could not be more disappointed and upset. Complete waste of money and a ton of time!!",
