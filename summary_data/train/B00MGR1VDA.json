It also comes in one solid piece with the top attached. The back has openings for plumbing, which makes it very convenient. It comes with the knobs and pulls and the drawers and doors are soft close. Great product and service, I would definitely recommend to family and friends.",

The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because the countertop on outside of rh side bowl was cracked. I had read other reviews complaining about arriving cracked, but for the price, deliver logistical nightmare and size of crack and visibility, I am not sweating it. Just downgrading my review by one star.",
