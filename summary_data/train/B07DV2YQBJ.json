      "text": "I bought this mixer specifically to try when making French Onion Soup. The SAKI was attached to a 5 Quart pot. I then added four cut up baseball size yellow sweat onions along with a cut up stick of butter and some red wine. With the temp set for 210 degrees I turned on the stirrer. It had plenty of power to handle this batch of onions. Every 20 minutes or so I would go into the pot with a wooden spoon to assist the mixing from top to bottom as the onions cooked down. The SAKI stirrer worked perfectly. Very easy to clean. This device will get some use in my kitchen.",

I charged the unit for a full cycle and it will no longer turn on. Had to return that one as well. Seeing as I've tried this twice and neither of them worked I'm giving up, which is too bad because I really could use an automatic stirrer when I make cheese.",

I set it up with 106 oz crushed tomatoes in a pot, turned the gas heat onto mid-way, and turned it on. The charge did last two hours (on low rpm) and by that time, it was reduced enough. Despite the heat being at medium, there were ZERO burn marks on the bottom of the pot. I am very impressed. Now the only issue is whether or not the battery/motor holds up after multiple uses",
