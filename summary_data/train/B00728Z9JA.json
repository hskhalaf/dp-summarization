The high-def videos are incredible, the photos I take are wonderful and the features on the camera...well, I'll never use them all. Lightweight with a big display, I like being able to shoot a video and take a snapshot as the video is filming. I take it everywhere. I searched for this particular model based in a review I read somewhere and they were right. I picked the Panasonic because the controls are all so similar to the other models I've owned and it was a great choice.",

But it's up against \"smart phones.\" If you have a smart phone, do you need this too? Ask yourself why. If you want a small point and shoot and are not a pro photographer on National Geographics payroll, this is a damn nice, sturdy camera",

It's a point and shoot for me (I have a larger digital SLR that I can use for artistic type stuff) and it's small enough that I can stick it in almost any pocket and go. It's been particularly useful in helping me document installation procedures or steps in a process. I installed a fuse box on my motorcycle and wanted to build a sort of \"how-to\" for other folks to use. I just stuck the camera in my pants leg pocket, pulled it out to take photos when I completed a step, and stuck it back in my pocket. Very useful and it took fantastic, crisp, close-up photos very well.",

If you're looking for compatible products, I purchased it with the Panasonic Lumix Leather Black Slim Case for FS62/ FS7/ FS15/ FS25 (DMW-PSS13XEK) and the Transcend 8 GB Class 10 SDHC Flash Memory Card (TS8GSDHC10E), and have been happy with both of those products too.",

I ordered it because I had an older Panasonic Lumix which has proved most satisfactory with ease of use and quality of photos so.

Even more amazing is the weight of this cams. It is soooooo light.

The problem was that they where going to send a far inferior camera as a replacement, one that retails for half of the SZ7! After insisting, they offered a refund of my purchase price, which will take 6 to 7 weeks to process!!!! So, buy a camera which breaks after a week, then wait 3 month's before it gets resolved! The worst consumer experience ever. Don't buy Panasonic!!!!!!!!",

I can edit them out with Photoshop, but that is time consuming. In short, the SZ7 is the last Lumix I will ever buy, despite the good pictures.

      "text": "Form factor, ease of use and price are all great attributes of this camera. Image quality does not quite come up to my expectations especially for travel/landscape photos. This camera is very easy to use and if your need is for a handy, reliable camera and you need only small images (web, 4x5 prints) you might be delighted with this one. If you're a pixel peeper - keep looking as you won't be satisfied upon examination of image details. I also own the DMC-LX7 \"big brother\" to this camera which is more costly & bulkier but of superb image quality.",

    "description": "Style:SZ7-BlackThe LUMIX DMC-SZ7 combines a powerful 10x optical zoom with a 25mm ultra-wide angle LEICA DC VARIO-ELMAR lens, in a slim and compact body, making it extremely portable and easy to carry. It can also shoot full-High Definition, 1920 x 1080 60i videos and with Light Speed AF, it has a super-fast focus response time of approximately 0.1 second - making it easy to capture spontaneous must-have photos.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n The Lumix DMC-SZ7, a part of the Lumix SZ-Series of digital cameras combines a powerful 10x optical zoom with a 25mm ultra-wide angle LEICA DC VARIO-ELMAR lens, in a slim and compact body, making it extremely portable and easy to carry. The Lumix SZ7 has 14.1 megapixels and can also shoot full-High Definition, 1920 x 1080 60i videos and with Light Speed AF, it has a super-fast focus response time of approximately 0.1 second \u2013 making it easy to capture spontaneous must-have photos. \n\nPanasonic Lumix SZ7 Highlights \n\nShooting Modes\nThe Lumix SZ7 features two new shooting modes \u2013 Miniature Effect and Panorama Shot. In Miniature Effect mode, the peripherals are defocused while saturation and contrast is emphasized to make the picture like a diorama. Video recorded in Miniature Effect mode is played back in 10x fast-forwarding, making it comical and fun to watch*1. Panorama Shot makes it possible to shoot a horizontal or vertical panoramic image by taking consecutive shots and then overlaying the photos for the effect of a panoramic photo. Furthermore, the Lumix SZ7 feature Creative Retouch which includes six filters -Toy Effect, Soft Focus Dynamic Monochrome, Expressive, High Key and Retro, each of which give the photo a more artistic look. This camera also features an Auto Retouch function that adjusts contrast and brightness to give the photo a different look \u2013 all with a single press of the button. \n*1 Sound will not be recorded with [MINIATURE EFFECT] in Creative Control Mode and approximately 1/10 of the time period is recorded. (If you record for 10 minutes, the resulting motion picture recording will be approximately 1 minute long) \n\niA (Intelligent Auto) Mode\nTo help ensure that the Lumix SZ7 is easy to use, it features Panasonic's popular iA (Intelligent Auto) mode. In iA mode, a suite of technologies are automatically engaged and the camera chooses the best setting based on the shooting environment. For instance, iA includes the new High Dynamic Range, Intelligent Handheld Nightshot and Motion Deblur together with AF Tracking, Intelligent ISO Control, MEGA O.I.S., Face Recognition, Intelligent Scene Selector and Intelligent Exposure. \n\nAdditional Features \n\n * 3.0-inch Intelligent LCD that automatically adjusts the backlight based on the environment's lighting \n * MOS sensor to support full-HD video \n * USB power charging in addition to the conventional AC power supply \n * 3D Photo Mode allows the user to take 20 panning shots and then the camera automatically selects the two most suitable images \u2013 one for the right eye and one for the left eye \u2013 to synthesize a 3D composite. \n * Dedicated video record button which lets users instantly start recording a video without having to make any extra settings. Additionally, the full 10x optical zoom is available in video recording mode \n * High-quality stereo sound via Dolby\u00ae Digital Stereo Creator accompanies the realistic HD videos. The stereo zoom microphone comes with zoom noise reduction system, and the Wind Cut function helps to block noise from background wind",
