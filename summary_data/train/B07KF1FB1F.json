The build quality is really nice with the whole controller wrapped in a rubberized material making it feel good in your hands. The sticks are smoother than the Vantage.

Unfortunately, the real issue has revealed itself a few months down the line, and it's a deal breaker: the left stick will stop responding overtime to the point where your game character will either stutter or simply stop moving while pushing forward. No amount of calibration or software reset resolves this issue. It appears to be hardware related. They should figure this out, get a hardware revision out, and do a recall to replace the left stick for those who already bought the controller.",

It is a shame since the controller otherwise seems very good quality and is very comfortable. I am keeping it incase I ever figure out a solution but currently am just using the regular PS4 controller with the newly released playstation paddle attachment.",

Mapping only via cable is crappy as well, and using the button on back is confusing and a pain. Why can't I edit and save wirelessly? Seems like adding wireless function but literally nothing to do with it outside the connection is absurd. Really making it hard for me to love this controller. So much potential.",

Updated: The Astro customer support is super amazing and helpful they sent me replacement parts for free and when it still didn't work they had me send the controller to them for free and sent me a brand new one back and it works perfectingly.

      "text": "This controller feels *amazing* to hold (even for a long time) but that's the only premium thing about it. It suffers from frequent ghost inputs (despite calibration) that hold the analog stick or button inputs too long. PC software is barebones and doesn't offer calibration configuration or battery information. This is one of the most expensive \"afterthought\" products by a company that I've ever purchased which is really disappointing because there's real potential with this one in an under-served premium controller market. The underside buttons and optional USB wired connectivity this controller has are not worth its issues.",

After some research I have learned that the sticks are the Achilles's heel. So do your research if you're looking, I have located an aftermarket fix for the stick issue and am waiting for it to be delivered. For the price I am disappointed at the quick failure but I can live with it if the aftermarket parts perform as advertised.",

Contacted Tech support again and surprisingly I was told my WARRANTY has expired! 7 months of owning this controller and it is no longer under warranty? WTF, this is what companies like ASTRO do to customers when their inferior products fail! Six month warranty for a $200.00 controller? Proof to me ASTRO knows their quality is substandard.
