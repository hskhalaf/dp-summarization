I had to send it to Jacksonville and there my sister sent it to PR via boat. Notwithstanding, it works like a charm. I bought it for my dad who uses a CPAP machine and with the battery it can run all night. Thank you so much for the product, it really has helped a lot during these times of crisis and calamity after Hurricane Maria.",

I'm planning on building an American module power pack and if anything works inside (good luck on that!) like the inverter, I'll cannibalize the guts and use it on a real deal device.

At first I thought it was weak solar power, but I took it to my office and it has been charging this for a week now. It is still at 3 of out 5 dots. I can look at the power load on my controller and see that it is pulling between 6.1 and 6.8W (I disconnected everything else). Not sure where that power is going exactly, but it is not into this battery. Bummer because it was not cheap!",
