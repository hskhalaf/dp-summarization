      "text": "I needed something to hold onto my phone better since I got a bigger phone, but I think Pop Sockets look really dumb. When I was in Tokyo in the spring, everyone had folio phone cases with wristlets or else they had these ring-style holders. I love these things. They stick on with 3M adhesive, so they don't fall off or melt off easily, they stick to any flat surface (I have one on a faux leather folio case and it's holding just fine) and I feel like I get a better grip for taking pictures or just holding my phone. I don't make a habit of dropping my phone but I'm even less worried about it now.",

This sticks like crazy so make sure you line it up EXACTLY how you want it before putting it on and probably stick it on a case rather than directly on your phone. There is an air bubble or space in the center but it really doesn't bother me that much. I love that this helps me keep a grip on my phone since I have the dropsies all the time. The ring spins to different angles, even though it is a bit tough to turn at first but seems to be getting better.",

The design with the clear secure sticker is brilliant because my phone has a decorative cover and it doesn't interfere with the design. My husband likes the ring also. Good idea!!!",

If this is just casual use for propping your phone up every once in a while, go for it. But if you intend on using them pretty heavily to hold your phone a little easier and moving their position frequently, I wouldn't reccomend these. Or if you don't mind replacing them every few months I suppose you could, because they have great grip and just feel more natural in the hand, to me, than a pop socket, but that's just a bit unnecessarily pricey for me.",

And the stiffness is not excessive so as to make it difficult to reposition the ring. The biggest challenge would be to stick the ring in the right position to stand up your phone at a good angle. Fortunately, the stiffness in positioning the ring allows you to adjust the angle without slippage in the angle of adjustment. Also, putting your finger through the hole allows you to have a more secure hold on your phone when playing games or taking selfies. I don't know how well it would work with a heavier tablet.",
