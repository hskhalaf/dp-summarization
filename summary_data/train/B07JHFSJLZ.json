I originally ordered the Cael v8.0s in a 10.5US and had to return them because they were too narrow. I ordered these in an 11US (a full size larger than normal for me) and they fit comfortably snug. I got them for martial arts and they will also be good for weight training. They grip great, but still allow twisting without catching on the mat. I like the mid-high top design as they keep my heel in place and add a bit of extra ankle support. The tongue is not too bulky either. Doesn't hurt that they also look totally cool.",

Most of them recommended getting a full size up, but I went with my gut feeling and just got a half size up. I usually wear a size 9 1/2 for most regular shoes, so I went with a size 10 for this boxing shoe. Fit was perfect. Of course, boxing shoes will always have that snug/tight feel, but the pair I got had just the right amount of tightness. Overall, I am satisfied with this purchase! I will buy this again in the future when the one I have wears out.",
