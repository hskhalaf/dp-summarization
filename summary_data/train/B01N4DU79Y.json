      "verdict": "The All Out Blaze 2 is one of the many Merrell hiking pieces where comfort and support work in unison. However, opposing these rather beneficial characteristics are its sizing and sole design. All in all, the good-looking Merrell All Out Blaze 2 is a light hiker with a decent amount of good points slightly outnumbering its bad points. Interested buyers must be wary of its disadvantages.",
      "pros": [
        "Lots of hikers stated that it was lightweight",
        "The arch support given by the All Out Blaze 2 was appreciated by a multitude of owners",
        "It was a comfortable pair of hiking shoes, according to the majority",
        "Based on a moderate percentage of consumer reviews, it had a wide toe box",
        "Less than a handful of verified purchasers liked the pleasing design of the All Out Blaze 2",
        "This Merrell hiker helped a few wearers remain planted on slippery surfaces with its fantastic grip performance"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "Several users disliked the squeaking sound it produced when walking",
        "It had a stiff sole, as mentioned by a few disappointed hikers",
        "Some Merrell loyalists noted that the All Out Blaze 2\u2019s predecessor was a lot better"

      "text": "After returning other shoes due to problems, I tried once again with these as I final online attempt as clothing is always tricky I guess. For me: They are very comfortable, look the part like they are ready for action rather than a more casual trainer look. Very light in weight. I\u2019m not wide footed so there is plenty of room forward of the lace area which felt a little odd at first but are fine. Usually an 8.5\u201d I stuck to that on my order and they fit well. Very small slippage on heel... Purchased in Xmas so very good deal and as always, excellent delivery from Amazon. Very fussy, I would recommend :-)",

      "text": "Solid, all weather, warm show with great grips. I wore these for the first time during a snowy/icy day here in Scotland and they performed brilliantly. Would recommend. One thing that annoys me is the difference in prices: size 12s are half the price of 12.5 or 13. I hate gambling on shoe sizes, but have found even old favourite shoes to be tighter recently, so often buy a size up in things like this (walking shoes), because they are often worn with thicker socks. Being charged almost double for that is ridiculous. Hence one star dropped for what is a great product.",
