      "title": "Great Book Novice Graphic Designing",
      "text": "This is an awesome book. The author clearly builds on proper design principles using outstanding examples of poorly and properly designed bulletins, personal stationary, postcards, resumes, etc. Although I have been using Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and InDesign (formerly Pagemaker for years), I have a lot to learn about graphic design. Considerable emphasis is placed on the focus for the particular design followed by four easily understood design principles. The last one-half of the book concerns use of type. The book does not and should not teach specific brand-name computer applications. This is one great book. Seriously. I highly recommend the book to any beginner or low intermediate designer. Thank you very much.",

      "text": "This is a book about good design principles for communicating with text, and toward that end it is certainly very informative, and even enjoyable to read. There is a great deal of useful information in here about typography, color, and organization. However, the book treats images only as decorations, rather than as alternative means of conveying information. So it does not address the design of media that rely on text and graphics alike to get a message across. Further, if there is a fifth edition, I hope it will also include some discussion of the use of typography and color that work well for people with color vision deficiency and other visual challenges.",

Coming from a more technical background I appreciate how succinct this book is and clearly lays out the point and purpose of what you need to accomplish. You won't come away as a design master from this book, but it is a wonderful intro to the field of graphic design principles and I would highly recommend it for newbies, or those simply interested in learning graphic design principles for their own personal projects.",

Regardless, the foundation this book teaches will help with about any design program. Thanks Robin Williams!",
