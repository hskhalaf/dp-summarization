The snare throw off is well made and moves easily. The size is fantastic...easy to transport and light to carry. The finish looks good, hoops are quality. I highly recommend.",

However, it's best applied to ska, reggae, Latin, and jazz. If you use a lot of rim shots you will love this drum! Also, the price cannot be beat for the value of the instrument. Suggestion: Use a Remo Ambassador with this drum. WARNING: Don't tune too tightly!! It's tempting since it's such a highly pitched drum, but tuning it too high is bad for the drum (and the head).",
