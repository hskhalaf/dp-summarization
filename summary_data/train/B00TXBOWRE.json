The Megaboom sounds okay for what it is. I didn't expect to be amazed, so I wasn't disappointed with sound quality. What was disappointing was the unit's inability to hold a charge. Unless it was plugged into a charger, it wouldn't stay on for more than a few seconds. Not terribly useful. I've returned the unit and am now looking for a replacement. I found the control and connection locations to be inconvenient. The Android app was completely useless. It wouldn't even turn the unit on.",

Loud enough indoors in small to mid-sized rooms. Have not used it outdoors too much. Bought a long key lanyard to carry it, but since the loop is on the bottom of the UE the power button is now the bottom of the unit.",

Whatever little speaker they put in this thing must be very high quality, and not to mention the battery life is impeccable, have been using about a week straight off and on and it's still on full battery. I would reccomend this speaker to anyone who wants a higher quality speaker that will last them a long time.",

My friends always compare it to the Bose soundlink and try to figure out which is better. Let me put it this way, if you are active and plan to bring your speaker places, then get the Megaboom.
