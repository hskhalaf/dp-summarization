Nice compact packaging and the Barely Nude is a natural color for day wear. You might want something a little brighter for evening. I will definitely try some of the other colors.",

It also keeps my lips moist and eliminates the need for Chap Stick. I highly recommend Infallible in \"Blush\". Very pretty and a tube lasts me about 3 months with daily wear.",
