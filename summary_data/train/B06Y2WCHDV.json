Another complain I have is that the single cup setting doesn't work like a normal Keurig, where it will automatically pour a coffee of the right amount, instead it just keeps brewing until the tank is empty overflowing any cup you have. One must make sure that they put in the exact amount of water in the single serving tank to prevent it, which in my opinion, defeats the purpose, and convenience, of a single serving setting.

The carafe is double wall insulated and keeps the coffee hot for hours.
