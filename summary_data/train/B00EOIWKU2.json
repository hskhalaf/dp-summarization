While the hassle factor elimination certainly has been achieved, the adequate power factor has not. Bear in mind that I'm using this blower only to clear grass from the edges of my driveway and sidewalk after I cut / edge the grass on a typical 0.5 acre suburban lot. It's performance is below adequate even in this non-taxing use. I realize that I took a risk going from a gas powered unit to this one, but given the speed / CFM specs published, I certainly expected more than this model delivers !!!",
