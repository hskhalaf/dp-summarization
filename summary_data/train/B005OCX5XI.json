As soon as I start stirring it, my American Bull Dog starts barking, then she starts jumping around with enthusiasm and proceeds to Wolf Down the food. The way I figure it the dry dog food gives her the nutrition and the gravy makes it taste delicious.",

The fact that it's \"meat chunks\" instead of \"ground meat\" makes it easy to scoop out a portion and mix into dry food.
