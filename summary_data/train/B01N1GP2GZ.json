It is heavy so anticipate moving it with two people or mod it with wheels and wheel locks. Further the case is made out of solid metals and thick tinted tempered glass. This product isn't cheap but that has to be due to the material it cost to build. Another great bonus is it has 4 140mm RGB fans pre-installed. I had lost faith in TT, this case might have just renewed that.",

Never received a reply or answer. The case is great after I fixed the things they messed up. With that said, with the support I received, which was none. I would recommend anyone not to buy from them. If you have a problem. No matter how minor. You will not get help for it.",

Unless your pump and reservoir are Thermaltake, look elsewhere unless you want a ton of headache. Besides that? It's still a great case. It is one of the very few cases still on the market that natively allows quad radiators for watercooling. It allowed for insane overclocking performance on my brother's core i9 9900k, which runs hot as a furnace normally.",

If you buy this a dual custom hardline loop is the only way to go. And if you\u2019re gonna spend that much on a cooling system you might as well get the best parts money can buy. This case is ridiculously big and I love it! This is a showcase in which the design satiates the need for form to fit function. Not only is it beautiful, it\u2019s modular design makes building even the most insane PC much much easier!",
