If you are a DIYer or even a contractor that doesn't bore that many holes, then this kit is a great value. The arbors are cleverly designed to change out quickly and easily. I've used cheaper versions of this tool in the past that required a crescent wrench and a pair of channel locks to get apart. Not so with these. If you define value in terms of quality per money spent, then the value of this set is hard to beat.",

The marking should be stamped on the TOP of the bit (and if they wanted to be frickin awesome, put it on the inside as well), and painted so you can see them. I labeled the inside of the case top with the sizes, which helps.",
