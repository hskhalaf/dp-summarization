As the name suggests, it is designed with stability in mind, making sure the foot stays supported throughout the walk. Its cozy knit upper also contributes to the experience with a snug and breathable coverage.",
      "pros": [
        "Wearers agree across the board that the Stability Fly feels rather comfortable",
        "People with bunions, hammer toes, arthritis, and plantar fasciitis highly appreciate this shoe for accommodating their foot conditions",
        "The trainer can be comfortably used with custom orthotics, according to multiple buyers",
        "Its mesh upper keeps the interiors ventilated, as stated by several customers",
        "People with wide feet appreciate this model\u2019s roomy fit and the availability of several width options"

      "cons": [
        "A few disappointed purchasers wish the shoe had better underfoot support",

It looks like the bottom was just glued on and is wearing off now. I had to use crazy glue to keep it together on both shoes. The tongue of the shoe folds very easily and makes wearing the shoe very uncomfortable upon insertion. And trying to fix it is a pain. I just gotta hope it doesnt fold every time I put on the shoe. Simply put, I would not buy again.",

That said, the glued-in insole is terrible and my feet hurt right now after spending most of the day on my feet, which has been the trend for the 2 months I've had these.",
