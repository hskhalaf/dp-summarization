The shoe also has a very comfortable sole, which Is some times hard to find in a snow boot. I read recent reviews saying you should get a half size up, I agree. I usually wear a 5 but got a 5.5 and they fit perfect (even with thick socks)!",

I never found any water proof boots that looked good enough to try again and the prices were over $100. These boots are so well made and durable, I'll be wearing mine even if it's not raining as it's cold at night much of the time here in the bay area, California.",

      "text": "After reading some of the reviews I ordered one size up. I wear a size 10 and they didn't offer a 101/2 so I ordered an 11. They fit perfect. I live in Montana where we have very cold temperatures. When I got these I put them on with thick socks and went out to clean the snow off of my car. I stepped into the snow by the car and sunk in about 8 inches. My feet stayed dry but they were cool but not cold. It was 20 below after all so I can't complain. I love, love, love these boots. By the way they where very easy to slip into unlike some customers stated.",

We have had several inches of snow this winter. The boots stay dry. They do the job I wanted and also look attractive to wear to go shopping and other errands. I did order a half size larger than my regular shoe size, as the reviews I read said the boots did run small, The fit is perfect so I would follow suit and order a half size larger They are a great product!",

My only complaint is that I wanted a size 9 and wound up with a 91/2 because they wanted $30 more for size 9.",

There is also very little arch support.",
