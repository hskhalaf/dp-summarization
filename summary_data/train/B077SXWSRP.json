Only complaint is that the volume level is different by application. For example, Hulu sound may be just fine. Ask it to play music and it is really loud even though you have not adjusted the volume. Hopefully they fix this in a software update. Otherwise screen is good. I have it integrated with our home automation so it is nice to be able to tell Alexa to turn off the basement lights etc.",
