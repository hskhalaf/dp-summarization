One of the reading passage answers quotes an answer for the question before (the question asks the student to find evidence for the prior question's answer), but the quote in the answer key isn't actually the prior question's answer -- it was one of the options eliminated (support for the prior answer, not the answer itself). Haven't looked at the rest of the book yet, not sure if we will.",
