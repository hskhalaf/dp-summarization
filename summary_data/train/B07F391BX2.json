Certainly held our cat's attention - it shut off once or twice thanks to the auto shut-off feature and we had to turn it on again, because he kept looking for the feather! Would recommend to other cat owners! Update a month later: Still a huge hit with the cat! From the minute it is turned on and he hears the sound, he is totally engrossed! Highly recommend!",

Whenever I'm trying to get some work done at the desk and bored cats come looking for attention, I just turn it on and they flock to it. The nighttime feature is really cool, too, as you can really see the blue glow. The cats like the feather's movement and variety in coming out of several different spots on the toy. Definitely a favorite in our house of 5 cats.",

She ignored it the first 3 times I turned it on, giving it a wide berth as she walked by. But she couldn't stand it anymore and had to check it out on the 4th try. At first, she waited by the first hole the feather came out, being too stupid to realize it came out of different holes each time. Once she figured that out, she actually started to play with it. I found it highly amusing to watch her, so I guess you can call this a people toy too.",

Seriously though, even when its not on she lays on the floor with one eyeball at one of the holes. My only suggestion for improving the toy would be a remote control, she's so obsessed I'm constantly getting up to turn it on again. But I'm not complaining, its good to see her happy, after all she's the queen and I'm her servant. ha ha",

We found she likes it best when we place it on the ottman so she can sneak up on it. She now meows so we'll turn it on for her! We also love the fact that it entertains her when she's looking for attention and we're busy or heading out. It's great that it automatically turns off. Happy we purchased it.",

It is entertaining and gives them some surprises as the feather pokes out the various holes. Product feels substantial, not flimsy, and batteries seem to last fairly well. My only wish is if it would turn itself on,( that is from my 3 cats!).",
