      "text": "bought this for my dad who has dry macular degeneration. he loves it. easy to use and he loves the feature for different color backgrounds and fonts. He has not been able to figure out how to attach the wrist or neck band that was provided. this would allow him to carry it around. unfortunately, I live far enough away to help him with this. Also, for reference, he says the 5x magnification is what he uses and more than plenty. The product is well designed. Based on my dad's feedback, i would highly recommend the product.",

She tried it for 6 days and then went back to her magnifying glass. When I purchased this item they said I had 30 days to return. Not when I go to return to Amazon they are declining to take it back. Nonsense about it have batteries that you can't ship... really, they got it to me int eh mail.... The I chatted with a Amazon person online and they stated its classified under drug and beauty supply and the do not take then back... What!!! Buyer beware!",

      "text": "I bought it for my legally blind mother in the hope that it would help her read better. While it is excellent for looking at one item, such as the Rx number on a prescription, it does not work well for reading a page in a book or paper. Trying to move the magnifier around to get a line at a time proved very frustrating. It took too long, gave my mother headaches, and made her feel even worse about her vision problems. The company who sells the Eschenbach is excellent. Their employees were very helpful, but the magnifier just didn't come close to meeting my mother's needs, so we returned it without a problem.",

It was far too large to fit inside my purse. And when I tried to read with it I found I had to magnify things far too large to make reading easy. I am legally blind and so the product might work better for someone with better eyesight than I have. It worked just the way it was described but I think just having the four magnification settings was not ideal.",

    "description": "The SmartLux Digital is a revolutionary, portable video magnifier that has a multitude of features, all for a very economical price. Newly enhanced, users can expect a battery that lasts longer (Samsung) and charges more quickly, a screen display that is brighter with higher contrast, a new reset button, a lanyard is included, software fixes, electronic hardware improvements, and new attractive packing. The large 5\" LCD TFT display provides 5x, 7x, 9x, or 12x magnification (even less when used in hand-held mode) along with 5 different viewing modes that include full color, black on white, white on black, black on yellow, and yellow on black. Illumination is provided by 2 hi-tech SMD LEDs and the tactile control buttons are easy to understand and use. Images can be captured and up to 20 can be stored. The SmartLux Digital features a generous depth of focus and includes a stand that, when placed in its fully extended position, is ideal for reading. When placed in its half-extended position, it is ideal for writing. The two small SMD-LEDs on the underside of the device can be switched off when viewing other backlit displays, such as cell phones, to avoid screen glare. The screen has a high resolution of 800 x 480 pixels, is hard-coated for scratch protection, and is made with an additional anti-glare layer of film. The device is completely portable at a lightweight of 7.8 ounces and fits in a purse or large pocket. Simple control buttons are symbolically marked and there are only 3 to learn: On/Off, Magnification setting, and the Contrast Mode. There is a 2-year warranty. There is an automatic shut-off feature that will activate between 2 and 5 minutes of non use to save battery time. The SmartLux Digital is ideal for anyone who is visually impaired and wants an economical, portable video magnifier!",
