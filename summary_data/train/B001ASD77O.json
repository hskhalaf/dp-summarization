      "text": "I purchased this unit (390) with a matching hood 2 years ago for an install in our new home. The installation was done professionally, so i cannot speak about it's ease or difficulty. I can say that the unit has performed extremely well. I installed LED bulbs so they should last for many years. lighting coverage is very good. The fan is powerful and easily draws cooking odors out of the kitchen. I've seen complaints about the noise when the fan is on high. You can certainly hear it blowing, but it's on high. I kind of expected it to make some noise at that setting. it's certainly not bothersome. I would gladly buy this unit again.",

Not yet sure it does much on low...but that is very quiet. Great light...one setting for 2 bulbs. Two are always on. Bulbs are pricey compared to previous ones...and you won't find them at Walmart. Overall we are pleased. The cost of this set up beats the box stores by a lot. I'd buy it again...its great to customize how you want your hood to look...kind of priceless when you get to control its appearance.",

On high it does get a little loud but I don't intend on using that setting very often. It was all within my expectations. I would buy this again.",

The squeaking went away for a few months and then returned. Now, after 3 years of use, the motor binds up on the 1st speed setting. No more squeaking, no more suction, no more warranty. Unfortunately, I will probably buy another one of these as it would be expensive to make another unit fit. I will buy a warranty this time and request replacement as soon as it starts squeaking.",
