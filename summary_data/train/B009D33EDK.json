The little triangle flaps won't provide a whole lot of side protection for the seating area if it gets windy or during heavy rain, but is more than adequate for normal rainfalls. Great for sun protection, too. Two things to make this cover better. 1) Longer or adjustable straps 2) Straps could be sturdier",

I removed the J hooks and replace with 2 bungee tie downs used for tarps. Not risk of scratching and allows more flexibility to where I attach. For the price, you can't go wrong if using as a simple touring cover.",

Perfect for road tripping when space is an issue. The only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 is the metal hooks, which need to be wrapped or replaced with plastic, and the lack of antennae holes for the tour pack. For less than half the cost of the factory half cover. Highly recommend",
