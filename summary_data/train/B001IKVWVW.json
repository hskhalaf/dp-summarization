All have uneven distribution of water, and I thought I could live with small flooded areas of the gardens. But, after installing the 75' hose in a new garden bed and having a flood in the first 10 feet, I give up. Guess I will be returning the unused hoses and requesting my money back on the 75' hose.

      "text": "Nice soaker hose. There are a few dry spots running along the hose so I can't give this item 5 stars. Other than that, I am quite pleased with this item. UPDATE: Now that I am at the end of the growing season, I'm finding that the soaker hose really isn't meeting my needs anymore. It now only soaks in some areas of the hose, not all. I'm not sure if it got to hot or what but I'll probably end up replacing it next year. I'm downgrading my review from 4 to 2 stars for this reason. If anyone has found something better, I'd appreciate knowing what you bought.",

I started a pretty large garden on the side of my house and needed a 50 ft soaker hose as watering each plant one by one was just getting too tedious. This hose works best under minimal water pressure. I turn it on and leave it for 2-3 hours while I get to work doing other things. Also, this hose can attach to other hoses or even a water barrel if you make one. The opposite end is capped but can be unscrewed to become another connector end. I highly recommend it.",

Used them all last summer and didn't notice any problems until right at the end of the season the 75 foot hose developed a couple of spots where the water sprayed instead of dripping . The shorter (50' and 25') hoses were great all the way through. My thought is to use shorter hoses for big areas and either end-to-end connect or use a hose splitter to even out the pressure over the length of the soaker hose.",

The end of the hose gets flatter and the hose doesnt drip equal amount of water, throughout the length of it. You get more water dripping neer the connection.",
