This thing has gotten me through intense winds and rainstorms. It has been in the mountains and in the middle of the Grand Canyon. I don't use a footprint, and I ditch the bag it came in to shave some weight. The stakes are decent and don't require replacement. The weight is amazing for what you pay, and the quality is there, as well. I plan on buying this model in other sizes so I can take my dogs or husband with me. I currently own the 1P.",

The tent sets up in minutes and packs tight in a backpack; without the tent bag.

Perfect for 1 person, with extra space, or an adult with child. Two adults would be a bit cramped in the 2 person version. It\u2019s packs up very small, and is very light. Under or very close to 4 pounds if you\u2019re watching weight.

Nice idea having the color-coded straps. The temp only dropped to 60, so being cold was never a concern but it was noticeably warmer in the tent than outside in the morning. It's apparent to me that if you wish to lay out some equipment, a two-man tent is the right size for one person. For example, I preferred to keep my pack inside. There would not be room in a single person tent.",

I rolled up the tent and fly together and put a strap around it to secure it firmly and put a velcro strap around the tent poles to keep them secure. This all fit neatly, including tent poles, into my Ortlieb Bike Packer Plus Panniers. The packed tent would probably work well in a backpack too if you're good at organizing your gear. RB",

This isn't the lightest backpacking tent, but it is a good value and it has performed well on the couple of trips it has been taken on. It keeps you dry and has plenty of room for keeping your gear dry either in the tent or vestibule. I personally use this for 1 person and can't speak to using it for 2 people.",
