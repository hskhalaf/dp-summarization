This is a cool concept but the only benefit I can see, is it cuts branches on the ground without having to prop the branch up for clearance. With the exstension, it is heavier than a pole saw. I have a lot of worx equipment and love them all, but you would be better off getting either a electric chain saw ( also sold by worxs) which is a lot lighter, or a pole saw ( depending on your project) It's just a little to heavy for a large projects. Hope this helps.",

Now if you don't have any of the tools I mentioned then go buy this or get the pole saw only. This is safer to use though but I still prefer the pole saw over this.",

Ours stopped working because a part snapped inside. We called customer service and since we were under warranty, they were able to figure out what the next step was.

I did accidentally cut through the power cord, I suspect this was operator error rather than a flaw in the machine ;-) . It works well and requires minimal maintenance between uses. (disassemble and clean out the protective housing, fill the oil reservoir.).",

      "text": "The Worx Jaw Saw does an excellent job of cutting. The idea of an open claw (jaw) serving as a guard for the operating blade and protecting it is an ideal design to hold the saw in place during cuitting. The other plus in the design of the Saw Jaw is the is the oscillating small blade enhoused in the Jaw making for easier and safer cutting. I used the Saw for the first time this afternoon, Friday, !/ 16/ 2015. It met what I desired in it's performance. Downside: The head, working end, is extra heavy, especially with the extension attachment. I highly recommend the tool. Bill Alexander",

The extension pole is a must have, the tool itself does not allow one to reach very high into those overhead projects. It is electric so you are tethered to an extension cord but I believe this is outweighed by the ease of use, how light it is compared to a chain saw, safety of the jaws, optional extension pole, and how quiet it runs compared to a chain saw.",
