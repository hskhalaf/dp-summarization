Compared to all the other brush sets on amazon, I took a chance on this one since it seemed so ample (Almost too good to be true). Wow - it is true - highly recommend this brush cleaner set. The smaller brushed are great for the nooks and crannies of doctor brown inserts etc., which I also use. Thank you!!! And yes, the thank you note was beautiful and much appreciated.",

I find the bristles on the two largest brushes to be severely lacking in firmness. They become bent apon the first few uses and don't clean as well now. A baby bottle brush I had before was better.. As for the other three smaller brushes the firmness is perfect and they have worked well for me, no problems.",

Only the largest brush has a decent amount of bristles on top, but of course, it doesn't fit in most bottles that needed to be cleaned.",

When cleaning bottles, however, things can get stuck in the bottoms (caked on things from smoothies to diatomaceous earth...the top of the bottle brush isn\u2019t completely covered with extra brushes but is metal, so a little extra examination is necessary to be sure I got it clean. Otherwise, very nice.",

The handles are easy to grip and hold onto and non slippery which is a major plus!! The bristles are firm but not harsh and easy to insert into both bottles and supply cups and are great and scrubbing and fitting into hard to get grooves of the bottles and cups! This is a fantastic set that I am so glad I took a chance on getting!! I\u2019m definitely going to recommend these to my sisters!!",

They're really strong and help get crud off of hard to reach areas. My only concern is how easily bendable the wire connecting the bristles to the handles are. At the moment it's great for helping reach those particularly difficult spots but I'm worried it will snap in two. So far everything is great and I would definitely recommend, especially for the price :)",

Equally amazing was the actual handwritten note that came with the product. Seriously, nobody goes that extra step anymore, and I found it extremely refreshing and admirable.",
