This one came fully assembled, painted as shown, and seems rock-solid. Dad loved it. Do note the size -- it's hard to tell from the photos, but it's not overly large -- just a couple of feet tall with stands that can hold about a 6\" inch pot. But it's good-looking and appears well-made, which is all I needed. Dad was very pleased and said it one he'd had his eye on already.",

That being said, you cannot put a plant on the the bottom 2 shelves that take up all the circular space. Only the top one is fully available. As others have done, I had to use smaller potted plants, or leave them slightly off center. Still works for me, as it keeps them off the floor and it is a nice looking planter.",

You really have to be careful how you place your plants (i.e heavy on the bottom). It is best to put this against a wall as it can sometimes be knocked over if the wind is too strong. The leaves are only painted in the front, so you will have to angle it just like the picture to enjoy the art. Overall a very nice product and way better quality and cost than what you would find at local big stores (i.e. HD, Lowes, Wal).",

      "text": "This is really nice except for the fact that the center post wasn't made long enough for stability. It was almost an inch shorter than the other legs. Since I'm using it on my deck I was able to put a small disc under it for the needed stability. But if I were using it inside my home, I would have expected it to be uniform.",
