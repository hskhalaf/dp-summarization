Very good battery life, quick to charge. Sturdy rubberized splash-proof outer shell. Now I use it constantly at home. I own a Bose SoundLink-Mini, but this one sounds even better and is so easy to cart around from room to room. In my opinion, it is the apex of small Bluetooth speakers.",

For some reason, the Bluetooth connection sometimes has to be renewed as each new playing session is begun due to periodic lapses in the sound. Once this re connection is made, it works perfectly.
