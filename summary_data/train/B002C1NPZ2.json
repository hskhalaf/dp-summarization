It holds approximately 288 individual dvd cases. i used this as an over flow from another dvd cabinet, so what you see in the picture is not 288...but each shelf holds 12 dvds and there are 24 shelves. I like it and would recommend it...it's good for the price. I'm not sure about VHS tapes....below is pic of how much space is left at the top of each shelf with my dvds on them.",

I was able to fit approximately 2 1/2 bins full of DVDs on the rack. It spins like it\u2019s supposed to and was easy to put together (and I\u2019m definitely not Bob the Builder). The instructions include diagrams my 5 year old could decipher. Simple. Please keep in mind this thing is made of particle board (which I fully expected upon purchase), so don\u2019t bang it up against anything while building it. My only problem is I like it so much I need another one to hold my CDs and games!",

I weep for this country when I read some of these reviews. Yes, assembly took me the better part of a day, but it would have been quicker if I'd had a third hand. No, the instructions aren't foolproof, but they're good enough, especially if you don't mind doing some test fitting and giving the matter some thought. No special tools required, no DIY experience necessary. BTW the base that comes with the kit seems plenty sturdy, but if you're using this to display your anvils, by all means go with the upgrade.",
