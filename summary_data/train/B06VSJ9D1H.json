Unit has NO SUCTION POWER FOR DIRTY WATER.....SO CARPETS STILL DIRTY!! Yes...I went over the carpet several times....I've had a Bissell pro before...no problems with it till it stopped spraying...it was about 5 years old so bought this to replace one that worked beautifully....had a bottom to it too...this was MORE EXPENSIVE...and is absolutely worthless...called bissel...their representative...could not understand her broken english...no help at all...sending back....worst product ever!!",

      "text": "By poor design, the roller brush continues to spin when you are using the hand tools. They direct you not to let it remain in one place for very long so that while trying to clean upholstery or stairs with the hand tool you must stop and move the machine around or risk damage to the carpet or floor. If the cord is underneath it , the rollers strip the wire\u2019s protection off. The continuous spin rips the brush pices out of the roller and destroys the roller belt. At two months from receipt of the machine it is useless to me and I\u2019m one month past Amazons return. Would not buy If you ever want to use hand tools.",

The main unit brush on the Hoover could be turned off. I called Bissell thinking I was missing something. Their reply was the brush can't be turned off and their recommendation was that I just lean the machine back so the spinning brush didn't hit the floor. Very big design flaw in my mind.",

I also kept stepping on the power cord but I fixed that today when I cleaned the carpet in my den. I also went over the same areas more than 2 or 3 times to suck up as much solution as possible. That was something I didn't do when I cleaned my hallway last week. After you use it a couple of times you will get it dialed in to your style. I am very satisfied with the cleaning results and believe me my carpets were DIRTY.",

The machine seems designed for use in small areas, the detergent tank and the waste water tank are too small for use in larger rooms or far from a sink. When using Hoover Pet Messes Formula the waste tank foams so much that the useful capacity is only about half before the float stops the suction. Hopefully a defoamer solution will fix this.

Overall you can tell that it definitely cleans very well with the dirty water being black. It does leak so I was cleaning up dirty water whenever I stopped the cleaner. So be sure to not stop it on carpet or it will leave a black spot from dirty water. Otherwise it did it\u2019s job well. Cleanup is pretty simple as well.",

It has ok suction, just remember to resell the rubber seal on the waste tank. But the two tanks need to be removed and either emptied or refilled at different times in the cleaning process. Makes for lots of trips to the laundry room or kitchen sink. Also the other Bissell cleaners had dials to switch from using cleaner or just rinsing. This one uses the cleaning solution at all times. I find that it takes longer to clean my large family room with this cleaner but it does a pretty good job.",

Out $500 for a machine I will never use again and $5k worth of wool Berber carpet which is now a matted, fuzzy mess. And machine didn\u2019t even remove the dog pee stains. Very bad design.
