I think it's left like that to meet Food/Health regulations though, so probably won't see at change. The option for lower times is still there, you just have to keep adding time until it cycles around. I just wished there was an adjustable vent on the top.

Unlike the Crock Pot brand slow cookers I've used in the past (4 quart and 6 quart models), this never seems to cook evenly or consistently. I decided to watch a soup progress rather than leave it unattended -- and was concerned when I noticed the soup never reached a boil. Very disappointing. I'll be sending this back and buying the similarly priced Crock Pot brand 7 quart option instead. It doesn't have a timer, but there are various wall outlet timers available you can use in its place.",

PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER.\nY. Callewaert5.0 out of 5 stars Frigidaire Slow CookerReviewed in the United States on January 10, 2014Verified Purchase I researched many slow cookers, reading reviews, asking other owners about what they like about theirs. Price was not a major concern in my case, so I looked at far more expensive ones than this one.\nI considered the one which you could use right on the cooktop for searing meat. However, was not pleased with the idea of a non stick layer, which apparently had peeling issues as well.\n\nI checked out many of them in stores. Another concern I had was the glass lid, and the screw to hold the handle in place. I read many reviews where the screw started rusting and dripping rust into the meal.\n\nWhen I purchased this one, now 2 years ago, I wasn't sure what to expect as there weren't many reviews at the time.\n\nI was extremely pleased when it arrived, the lid fit well on the insert, the insert looked beautiful, ceramic and the options for settings were more than sufficient for my needs.\n\nI have used this one off and on for the past 2 years. I love the large capacity, but have also cooked smaller meals in it without a problem (as long as you have enough liquid). I use it mainly for beef stew and beans.\n\nHaving said that, I do get the same results with my old cast iron pot and low temperature oven, but I still like my slow cooker as well.\n\nI would buy this one again. After 2 years, it still looks very good although I do not wash it in the dishwasher. I hand wash and dry both lid and insert (and it only takes a minute or less)\n\nHighly recommended!\n\nJan 2016: I have had this one for 4 years now and use it weekly, mostly in winter. Still love it and still works fantastic. No regrets.Read more 12 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse JG5.0 out of 5 stars Had a little problem but a nice unit. Just got it made in 2010 !! READReviewed in the United States on December 10, 2015Verified Purchase I just received this unit and there was a problem, the glass lid wobbles not giving the top a good seal, instead of returning it I called Fridgedare customer service they were extremely nice and helpful they will be shipping me a new lid for this cooker. I tested the heating and electronics and they function fine. A very good looking slow cooker which I am sure will perform well with the new lid this is why I gave it 4 stars. I would to add that when I gave the serial number to customer service they were a bit surprised this unit that Amazon sent me was made in 2010, I was a bit surprised and so were they ! I didn't know that Amazon keep items for sale on the shelf so long !!\nUPDATE:\nWarranty sent a new lid and included a new ceramic crock insert my request was made on 11 of Dec. and I received it on the 16th of Dec. very fast service, all fits perfect now. I just cooked a large roast in it today and it turned tender and perfect ! I decided to change my rating to 5 stars this unit is well worth the money!Read more 3 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Joshua5.0 out of 5 stars ... for about 18 months now and it has been great. I spent hours (daysReviewed in the United States on July 6, 2015Verified Purchase Have had this for about 18 months now and it has been great. I spent hours (days?) researching slow cookers and comparing them on Amazon. One thing you'll notice is that a majority seem to have only a single-screw handle on the lid. I was adamant to avoid a single-screw handle again as that was one of the main failure points of my last slow cooker. As you can tell, this has a nice metal handle with 2 screws through the lid to help distribute the load.\n\nThis thing cooks nicely, is well built, and even looks nice. There are plenty of temperature, hold, delay options and it can hold a lot of food or liquid. The pan itself has been through my dishwasher a number of times and always comes out clean with no issues.\n\nThe only drawback to this unit is actually the brushed stainless steel exterior. Any drippings or food that gets on it seems to stick a little more to the metal than it does some of the plastic exteriors. Not too big of a deal as it will eventually come clean, but the only drawback that I can think of.Read more 2 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Kannada4.0 out of 5 stars Great with caveatsReviewed in the United States on October 25, 2013Verified Purchase I've only used it once so far, but here's my experience.\n\nThe Pros:\n\n1) The temperature control seems ideal. It took roughly two hours, two and half hours, for the high setting to reach it's maximum temperature. At that stage, my food was simmering but not boiling. Per Cook's Illustrated review of slow cookers (this model wasn't among their test subjects), best results come from high temperatures around the 200 degree mark, which this appears to do. At the end of the day, temperature control is probably the most important feature of any slow cooker.\n\n2) Design pluses: Programming is easy, plenty of settings, interior dimensions are good, looks good on the counter.\n\nNow the cons:\n\n1) The lid is not great. It doesn't fit snugly, which I guess is fairly common? The lid has a slight dome and this allowed a bit of steam to run off into onto the lip of the insert, which then dripped down over the front of the cooker. Worse yet, when I served some of the food out of the insert and left the remaining food cooking on warm, the air pressure built up and we heard some rattles as the lid popped up and down. More liquid dripped down onto the lip, or just plain escaped so that I turned the cooker off for fear of drying out the food. (It was still at simmering temperature about a half hour or so after it went to warm.) I don't understand why these lids aren't designed with a small hole to release air pressure without releasing liquid.\n\n2) Other design flaws: The insert handles are too short, which means they get too warm. The lid handle also gets too hot -- there really should be a bit of silicon under the handle. The exterior of the cooker gets pretty darn warm. I have NO idea why this is endemic to slow cookers -- wouldn't it be more efficient to insulate them?\n\nI debated long and hard between this and the Crockpot touchscreen. I'm still debating whether to return this and try the other... I particularly like the 20 hour feature on the other, but 12 hours certainly isn't a deal breaker.Read more 7 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse See all reviews from the United States \n\n\n4 STARS AND ABOVESPONSORED\nPage 1 of 1Start overPage 1 of 1 Previous page of related Sponsored Products 1.
