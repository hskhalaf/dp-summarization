I'm a larger woman with larger feet. Although by the size standards on the picture they would recommend I get a medium, I got a large and they fit perfectly. You want these to be tight, but not cutting off your circulation. These definitely helped alleviate blistering and calf pain during longer runs. They're a pain in the butt to get on, but so are any clothing item that is so form fitting!",

The best part of these socks which I cannot find elsewhere in the 20-30 mmHg range or thigh-highs, is the odor control from the silver drysat. Regular compression socks get so smelly especially when paired with the hot box of a clog-style non-slip shoe. I have not had any problems with these!",

These really helped reduce swelling, and I continue to use these socks for running and hiking. It is worth the extra cost over other cheaper brands that don't really have the structure necessary. I recommend watching a video no YouTube on how to put these socks on, otherwise you will struggle. Once you know how, it is simple.",
