It gives a little cushioning and makes the ring more comfortable. I purchased it to deepened my backbends and have left the ring in my bathroom so that I have it handy for frequent stretches. If I can make a request: offer thicker versions for maximum comfort. It does dig into my back if I use it for a couple of minutes.",

The yoga wheel is unique, in that it incorporates a greater stretch, along with that \"rolling\" feeling. My job requires me to spend a great deal of time in a car and this has taken a toll on my hips (specifically tight hip flexors). I have been spending about 10 minutes a day on this thing, just before going to bed and I am benefitting greatly from it. The yoga wheel just might be the antidote to sitting all day at work. Thank you for a solid and effective product.",

Although the cork is merely a thin laminate on foam for esthetics, it does provide sufficient cushion for me at 165 lbs. I don\u2019t think it could be any wider before it would dig into your shoulder blades when rolling. I\u2019m giving it 4/5 stars because I think the advert is a little misleading in reference to the cork. Also, I thought I would like the wood grain but in person it looks very fake. It reminds me of cheap furniture I had as a kid. At the end of the day, I do enjoy this roller and I believe it is durable.",
