Even wrapped up, my cat wouldn't tolerate counting 10 drops in each ear. So what I did was used scissors to cut off the needles of my diabetic syringes and put the meds in 2 syringes. I wrapped her in a towel and was able to get the syringe deep enough, I think, that it wouldn't be flying out when she shook her head or leaking out. That made it quick and easy.",

Not a factor for me, but worth noting that this treatment also has what I consider to be a very pleasant smell. Would recommend",
