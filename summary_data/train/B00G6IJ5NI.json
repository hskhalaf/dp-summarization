Even with music tuning the EQ, sounds are clear and great. bad thing about this is the battery and dock charger. Docking charger sometimes will show it has half it battery left but the headset died due to low battery. Love the concept of switching out battery when gaming. Also dont leave the display on the box on, mine lcd display has ghosting text from burn through. I can always see the playstation text even when I switch it to PC.",

This headset has great functionality, however after first impressions, i'm subtracting 1 star due primarily due sound quality you are getting for the price. It's good, but not $300 good. On the other hand, i'm thinking that the sound quality of this wireless headset is lacking in that area to compensate for battery life. The functionality of this wireless headset definitely beats all other competitors in it's class. I definately would recommend purchasing this wireless headset and I'll update this review, after I've had a chance to test thoroughly.",

Very comfortable; does get steamy in the earcups but its tolerable. Swapable batteries is a deciding factor for me over buying the A50 The Transmitter just looks awesome. Cons: Wish it had bluetooth. Pricey but hey, get what you pay for. Conclusion: I'm planing on getting in on VR in a big way and needed a wireless, quality gaming headset. The Series H met all my requirements and I highly recommend them to anyone who can afford them. By my research, the Series H seems to be the best wireless gaming headset currently available.",

It is perhaps a bit too small and snug, makes it uncomfortable because I have earrings. Wireless sound is no less than analog, but there is a noticeable static from the left, maybe interference with the microphone. Final thoughts: I like it, but it would not be worth a $300.",

But that's probably due to the components to allow for the swapping of the rechargeable batteries (a feature I absolutely love!).",

It's amazing for gaming as well. 10/10 headset, well worth the money. Sidenote: I had the Logitech G35? The wireless one, before this. The logitech wireless headset died within 2 weeks with constant disconnect issues because I live in an apartment building where people use microwaves. No issues with this headset whatsoever.",
