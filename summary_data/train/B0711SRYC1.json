This will allow the wheels to sit at the corners instead of the middle. It really improves the stability. Only drawback is that it won\u2019t fold down 100% but I think it\u2019s well worth it, especially if you have children. Tips over in any condition other than flat ground. Injured my son when it fell over and hit him while he was napping. Your engineers should be fired. There is a reason cars have 4 wheels and not 3.",

It fit all of our beach chairs, towels, wet suits, and a small cooler. I wouldn't recommend over packing it, but the wheels are large enough to handle a decent load.

When I pull it, it ends up extending to it's full length, and most annoying of all, and rendering the wagon pretty pointless, is when I need to back the wagon up, the handle telescopes back down to it's shortest length making me bend over so far that I end up pushing it from it's frame and not using the handle at all.",
