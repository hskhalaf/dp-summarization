It worked great the 1st, I have used it approx 8 times or less because of all the work it takes. It leaves the pulp wet so I have to refeed it through the tube as to not be wasteful - and the pulp is still wet. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ LOVE: I use this juicer once a week and I love it! The pulp is mostly dry and if it's not dry enough, I run the pulp through one more time! It makes quick, easy, and delicious juices!",

It still works but now I have to juice twice as much fruit and vegetables to fill the mini pitcher which is a bummer. However, I do believe Breville is a great brand.",

Definitely not disappointed. Still functions perfectly for our once-a-day juicing of mostly vegetables. \"Shouldn't fix what isn't broken\" pops to mind, and this product meets our needs perfectly.",

It does juice kale, the secret being to run apples through the system after the kale. It is not too loud. I leave it out on the counter because it looks classy enough to do so.

It's super safe, it literally won't start unless the glass is locked in over the blade and It would be extremely difficult to touch the blade while one even if you tried to.

    "description": "The Breville JE98XL's dual Speeds allow you to juice both hard and soft fruits and vegetables Get into the world of juicing with this no-nonsense dual-Speed juice fountain. Ideal for first-time juicers, this juicer runs on 850 watts and has two Speeds, 12,000RPM or 6,500RPM, for hard and soft ingredients.\n\nHIGH QUALITY JUICING, ENTRY-LEVEL PRICE\nFruit is largely composed of water, but its selling point is its nutritional value. How do you extract the juice from fruit, without leaving the nutrients behind? Breville\u2019s Nutri Disc and patented juicing system extract more nutrients than other juicers and transfers less than 1.8F of heat to protect enzymes and maximize nutrient absorption of select nutrients.\n\nThe dual Speed, 850 watt motor allows you to juice hard fruits and vegetables like apples and beets on high Speed at 12,000 RPM, while the low Speed (6,500rpm) is optimal for softer fruits and leafy Green vegetables like cantaloupe and spinach. The Juice Fountain Plus cutting disc is so powerful that pineapple can be juiced in large chunks with the rind on. In addition, this juicer features an extra-wide 3-inch feeder chute that accommodates large chunks or entire pieces of fruit or vegetables, eliminating the need for chopping vegetables.\n\nThe JE98XL is not only easy to use, but also easy to clean. It is pulp-ejecting and comes with a large-capacity pulp collector and most parts can be cleaned on the top shelf of the dishwasher.\n\nThe extra wide 3\" feed chute makes pre-chopping most fruits and vegetables unnecessary PRODUCT FEATURES:\n * Heavy-duty 850 watt motor with dual Speed control: a low Speed (6,500rpm) for softer fruits and vegetables and a high Speed (12,000rpm) for harder fruits and vegetables\n * Patented extra-wide feed chute (3\u201d wide): juice large fruits and vegetables with little to no cutting or preparation\n * Patented direct central feed system for maximum juice extraction\n * Nutri Disc with stainless steel blades and stainless steel mesh filter basket for spinning out the pulp\n * Heavy grade polymer body for durability\n * 1 liter juice jug (34 fl. oz.) with froth separator\n * Large capacity pulp container with integrated handle\n * Cord storage: the power cord wraps around feet and clips into position under the base for a reduced counter-top footprint\n * Safety Locking Arm prevents the juicer from operating without the cover locked into place\n * Overload protection prevents over-heating, automatically shutting the machine down when it senses that the machine is overloaded\n * All materials that come in contact with food are BPA-free, ensuring safe use\n * Easy clean-up with the included cleaning brush. All parts except for the mesh filter basket/Nutri Disc and food pusher can be washed on the top shelf of the dishwasher.\n\nModel BJE820XL: Juice Fountain Duo 800JEXL: Juice Fountain Elite BJE510XL: Juice Fountain Multi-Speed BJS600XL: Juice Fountain Crush JE98XL: Juice Fountain Plus BJE200XL: Juice Fountain Compact Key Feature Die-cast juicer with soft fruit attachment and variable Speed capability 'Rolls Royce' of Juicers: die-cast metal matched wtih power Variable Speeds maximize yield across variety of fruits Makes thicker juices and yields more juice for leafy Greens and wheatgrass than non-masticating juicers Great entry price point for Breville juicers Compact design takes up less space, with all of the juicing capabilities of the other juicers Type of Juicer Centrifugal Centrifugal Centrifugal Masticating/slow juicer Centrifugal Centrifugal Motor 1200 watt 1000 watt 900 watt 240 watt 850 watt 700 watt Speed 5 Speeds ranging from 6,500rpm to 13,000rpm Low Speed of 6,500rpm, high Speed of 13,000rpm 5 Speeds ranging from 6,500rpm to 12,500rpm 80rpm Low Speed of 6,500rpm, high Speed of 12,000rpm 14,000rpm Materials  * Heavy grade die-cast metal body\n * Titanium cutting disc\n * Stainless steel micromesh filter\n * Stainless steel puree disc\n\n * Heavy grade die-cast metal body\n * Titanium cutting disc\n * Stainless steel cutting disc\n * Engineering grade polymers\n\n * Stainless steel body\n * Stainless steel micromesh filter\n * Stainless steel cutting disc\n * Engineering grade polymers\n\n * Painted Premium plastic\n\n * Heavy grade polymer body\n * Stainless steel micromesh filter\n * Stainless steel cutting disc\n\n * Titanium cutting disc\n * Stainless steel micromesh filter\n\nInnovations  * 3\" circular feed tube processes whole fruit\n * Centered dual knife blade asssembly\n * Stabilizing knife\n * Second juice disc purees soft fruits for 100% fruit smoothies\n\n * 3\" circular feed tube processes whole fruit\n * Centered dual knife blade asssembly\n * Stabilizing knife\n * Dual high/low Speed switch for hard or softer fruits and vegetables\n\n * 3\" circular feed tube processes whole fruit\n * Centered dual knife blade asssembly\n * Stabilizing knife\n * Unique 5 Speed smart juicing system maximizes juice yield according to softness and hardness\n\n * Direction control\n * Two step safety start\n * Filter basket with auto-purifying\n * Crushes and squeezes to make juice with nutrients and a little fiber for a thicker, smoother texture\n\n * 3\" circular feed tube processes whole fruit\n * Centered dual knife blade asssembly\n * Stabilizing knife\n * Dual high/low Speed switch for hard or softer fruits and vegetables\n\n * 3\" circular feed tube processes whole fruit\n * Centered dual knife blade asssembly\n * Stabilizing knife\n\nCompare Breville Juicers.",
