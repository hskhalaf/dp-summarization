Neither the screen nor the keyboard has any flex, which is indicative of good build quality. The screen is very nice and isn't set in underneath a bezel like a lot of cheaper laptops (something I dislike greatly). The touchscreen functionality is good and the trackpad is large enough that I don't always need to bring a mouse. All in all very pleased with the laptop and look forward to using it more.",
