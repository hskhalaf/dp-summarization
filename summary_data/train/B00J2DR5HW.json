As soon as I opened the box, it made my whole house REEK of what I can only describe as PAINT THINNER like fumes. It was SO strong and I cannot believe this is Greenguard Certified. The #1 reason I buy this brand is because they claim that their products are \"better for air quality\" and safer as far as chemical content is concerned. This product really makes me question their reliability.",

The only thing she was disappointed in (not the sellers fault--we should have measured to make sure) is it is not as large as she thought. It is replacing the type of bins that are slanted and is made of plastic. She sent me pics of it put together & my grandson fussing over it, so if he likes it that is a plus to me. I will definitely be ordering other items from this company.",

My class funds weren\u2019t huge so I knew I wouldn\u2019t be getting solid wood cubbies. These cannot fit personal white boards (across), pocket file folders, or our textbooks. Unfortunately these have flimsy shelf liners that pull out (and fall in) when my students get their very limited supplies from the cubby storage. My students\u2019 families were generous enough to help me buy these. The cubbies do the job of taking up less space but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re worth the price sacrifice.",
