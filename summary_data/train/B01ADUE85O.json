I've had this wooden table for a month now and my son has used every crayola product on it and playdough and there has never been a stain until the use of these! I'm so upset. This table was not cheap and was supposed to last for years to come and with one use of these markers its been stained. Ive scrubbed 5 times so far.",

My granddaughter used a different brand at the library and they seemed easier. My set seems to have a couple of dried out markers, especially the orange.

Highly recommend this company! *Original review* The only downfall of this product is that when we opened the packaging, one of the Dot Markers didn\u2019t come with a lid. :( Unfortunately we bought this for homeschool & didn\u2019t open the package until a few days after the return window. But other than that these are fabulous markers & love the activity insert that\u2019s included!",

The first few times you dab the ink comes out really quickly and tends to pool, but after that it is much easier to manage. If you hold them down more than a second, it'll start to bleed through cardstock, so keep that in mind. The colors get brighter as the ink dries and they do dry quickly, which is a great plus. Even with the negative aspects, I still think these are a great buy and I'd purchase again!",

Easy to use, fun to work with. We don't do tablets or smart phones in our house. So, I am always looking for creative ways to spend time that is quality time with my son. These paint dots are super fun and fit the bill for a creativity outlet. Great price because I got them during a \"lightening\" deal. Otherwise, I probably would have not purchased.",

I like the fact that you have to twist the caps back on vs snapping it on because its easier for my kids to twist. Great for many learning activities and it also comes with a few stamp pages. There is also a link included that you can go on and get free dot print out activites.",
