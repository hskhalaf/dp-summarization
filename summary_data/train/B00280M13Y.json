After a month, I noticeably don't need to supplement with sodium, magnesium, potassium, bone broth etc as often. Completely worth the $$ as this also has a probiotic included ($20-30 separately at Whole Foods). Personally, I love taking two times a day as it seems to aid digestion (no longer buy separate digestive enzymes either). I'm recommending this to all my friends and family and just re-ordered for myself. Will continue for the foreseeable future.",

I look like a damn teenager so sadly I will have to find someone to give these away to and try to find a women's multi V that does NT contain Biotin :(",

Boy were those reviews right! I've been taking them for 2.5 weeks now and my skin has cleared up considerably and has a healthy glow (even my boyfriend noticed). I also have noticed that I have much more energy when I take them. Can't wait to see what other health improvements come with taking these long term!",
