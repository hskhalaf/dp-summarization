I am amazed how much power is packed in such a small drone Love all the flying modes and movie setting Best build design i have seen so far By the way everything folds and easily packs into such small case you can definitely see the time and effort they put into creating this product Only downside is the wifi connection I believe it works better in nature or the countryside where there is little to no wifi connections around, but in the city i will always lose signal at 300-500m distance Still very happy with my purchase and i would higly recommend it to anyone",

It is so forgiving when I lose my bearings or lose signal ... it just comes back! And the pictures and video... breathtaking, you just never expect the images to be so fantastic, especially if you are not much of a photographer! If you are thinking about a drone and cannot afford this, then wait. Save up. Sell a relative you don't like on ebay, but don't settle for less! Did I mention WOW.",

      "text": "Very steady in the air and very easy to fly. Hard to crush in normal mode. Everything you hear about it on you tube is truth. Revolutionary - I have a lot of fun showing to people what it can do like first smart phone when came out. Super fast in sport mode. It is a RC plane with auto pilot - that is something extraordinary. Absolutely worth it. Go for fly more because extra batteries are still hard to get and the bag that comes with is brilliant - you pack everything and you can run with it.",
