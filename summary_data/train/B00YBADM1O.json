We also didn't want some soft sleeper like a dockatot, not that they aren't nice. This sleeper has a mattress much like a basinet so hopefully the transition will be easier. The mesh allows her to press against the sides without suffocating. The metal frame keeps us from rolling on top of it. It fits right in the middle of our queen bed, allowing us both enough room to sleep. We couldn't ask for a better product. The price is a steal too!",

I was terrified that she'd smother herself so we bought this co-sleeper. At first it seemed almost too big for her tiny frame, but now she's definitely growing into it nicely! She loves sleeping in it, too. There's times she just doesn't want to be held and as soon as I lay her down in the co-sleeper, she gets this happy look on her face. My only complaint is that one of the sides is stuck and won't let me fold it up for travel.",

It saved us a couple of early nights when he would only sleep if he was right next to us - we put it in the bed & while it was tight in a queen, we were at least able to get a couple hours of rest. Now that we're further along, we use it as a nap spot on the coffee table where we can easily replace a dropped pacifier or attend to other nap interruptions quickly. Would definitely recommend for newborns.",

But the baby is protected from it. Just wish they had covered those ugly bars for a less medical sterile feel and cozied it up since that is the essential idea/feel behind the co-sleeper -- to cozy up to your newborn. But no regrets!!",

Update: My baby is now 6 months and since he's rolling over and lifting himself to grab things over the sides, I don't leave him unattended in it anymore, but still use this occasionally because it's so convenient still for diaper changes.",
