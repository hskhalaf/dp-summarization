I returned it and the trunk bag and will have to select a competitor\u2019s model. Too bad. The trunk bag was rather nice. 1 star, Topeak, for a nice bike rack that doesn\u2019t fit because of a design flaw that has a seemingly simple correction.",

Everything I read indicated this should fit my Trek Verve 2 but when I put it on the bike it didn't have enough clearance between the rack and the tire. If you are ordering for a Verve 2 then you probably need the 29er rack which should be slightly taller. I just ordered the 29er to see if that works better if not I'll be returning both. Disappointed that they don't have a way to adjust the height for clearance as I really liked this rack system to go with the bag. If the 29er won't work then the entire system will go back and I'll have to find another brand.",

      "text": "Installation was around 30 minutes on a '14 Specialized Rockhopper 29, medium frame with disc brakes. Works exactly as I'd hoped, and exactly as described. High quality stainless steel attachment hardware (including the rails that attach to the thread seat-stay bosses). When installed those rails are bent down to form a surprisingly tight arc, so they're not straight as the installation documentation suggests, but they stay in place without issues. My one complaint is that I cannot a reasonably price rear light kit (or adapter) to fit on the back of the rack, but that could just be my poorly-conducted search.",

Unfortunately, my bike didn't have the correct mounting setup, so I had to buy some c-clamps at the hardware store to attach the rack (I don't consider this as a negative as it's more of a point against my bike). It added little-to-no-weight to my bike, which is great! I really enjoy that it's solid underneath so that it also functions as a back fender to prevent nasty splatter during rainy rides.",

      "text": "I recently bought the Novara Madrona and wanted to be able carry groceries home. The rack was simple to install. It is solid and works beautifully with the set of Ortlieb Sport-Packer Plus panniers. I bought a rear light to attach to the rack upon the store sales person recommendation, but I just couldn't figure out how to mount it. Rode the bike back to the store and a little modification to the rack & light was done by removing the left side bar of the rack light mount (pliers and rasping the rough edges off) so the light switch is easy to reach. These same racks cost about $50 in the stores, so this is a nice savings.",
