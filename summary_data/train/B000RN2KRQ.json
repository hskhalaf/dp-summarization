      "title": "Wonderful camera",
      "text": "Only after we decided that we need a back-up camera for FX100 did we realized how good this camera is. We bought the latest Canon touch screen recently as a primary camera (now it is a backup one). Lumix is fast (have no idea what one of the reviewer was saying about this camera being slow), has very good low-light performance. I believe the sensor FX100 has is much better than the ones used now in almost all of the cameras",

For example on the FX01 the paint on the selector wheel would chip off. This has both better paint and a redundant image of the wheel on the small screen. 12.2 MP is perhaps overdoing it, but if they can pack that much info in such a small space, why not? My only criticism is the lack of an optical viewer (the Canon models all have one). The screen is bright, but in full sun it is difficult to compose a photo. Having said that, the lack of the optical viewer didn't stop me from buying the camera.",

The FX100 has problems:1. The \"superior\" lens cannot reproduce tne detail in anything white. Only in macro mode 2. The smallest aperture is F5.6. Theoretically this is F11. in 35m.m. Yet,shooting scenics is a joke.3. The auto focus will not repeat. One shot is fairly sharp, the next is not as sharp. And,don't forget,there are no manual controls. I suggest you buy the FX100 only if you want to take snapshots that you really don't care too much about.",

    "title": "Panasonic Lumix FX100K 12.2MP Digital Camera with 3.6x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black)",
    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\nManufacturer Description The compact Lumix DMC-FX100 is the world\u2019s first camera to feature 12.2-megapixel resolution with a 28mm wide-angle lens. In addition, the DMC-FX100 delivers 3.6x optical zoom, f/2.8 brightness, a 1/1.72-inch CCD and Intelligent Image Stabilization with Mega O.I.S. and Intelligent ISO Control. It's equipped with a 2.5-inch LCD screen, and a slim, lightweight design makes it extremely portable and stylish. \n\n Furthering Panasonic\u2019s commitment to \"Living in High Definition,\" the DMC-FX100 can also record 1920 x 1080 high-definition still pictures and 1280 x 720 at 15 frames per second motion pictures, both perfect for viewing on 16:9 plasma HDTVs. \n\n Lumix FX100K Highlights \n\n Bright f2.8, 28mm wide-angle Leica lens and 12.2-megapixel CCD An advanced 28mm wide-angle, 3.6x optical zoom Leica DC lens system featuring four aspherical lenses (including an EA lens) with five aspherical surfaces. A large 1/1.72-inch CCD with an effective 12.2 megapixels -- the highest resolution in its class. These features add up to make the FX100 a superior camera with extraordinary expressive power. The FX100 also features an Extended Optical Zoom, which extends zooming to as high as 7x. And zooming is super easy: just press the Easy Zoom button and the FX100 jumps instantly from 1x to 3.6x to 7.0x. \n\n \n\nIntelligent ISO Control in action Intelligent ISO Control prevents motion blur Intelligent ISO Control makes it easier to take clear, crisp shots even if your subject moves. Offered in the FX100, this innovative feature detects any movement and automatically raises both the ISO setting and the shutter speed accordingly, preventing motion blur. If the subject is still, the camera shoots at a low ISO setting and you get beautiful, natural-looking images.  Prevent hand-shake blur with Mega O.I.S. Hand-shake is a problem with most small cameras, but not with the FX100. Mega Optical Image Stabilization (O.I.S.) automatically compensates for hand-shake. You get clear, beautiful shots even when shooting in dim lighting, shooting macro close-ups, or taking self-portraits. \n\n Consecutive shooting at 8 frames per second Mega Burst shooting lets you take consecutive shots at a swift two shots per second. The new Hi-Speed Burst Mode goes a step further, letting you snap off consecutive shots at a lightening-fast eight shots per second. This makes it easier to catch the perfect action shot of a fast-moving subject. \n\nCapture up to 8 frames per second  Additional Features \n\n \n\n * 20 scene modes including the enhanced High-Sensitivity mode up to ISO 6400 with flash from up to 16m away \n * 16:9 wide high-definition motion images (1280 x 720 pixels at 15 f.p.s.) \n * Category Playback sorts images into categories such as portraits, landscapes, nightscapes and events \n * Quick settings without taking your eyes off the subject \n * Up to 320 shots on a single battery charge",
