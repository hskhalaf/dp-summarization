The charging case has a good capacity to keep them topped up. The case is also compact and looks high quality, as do the earbuds. They perhaps don\u2019t look quite as slick as Beats, but the specs are much better, they sound better according to most reviews I have come across and they are so much cheaper.",

      "text": "I bought these X2s for exercising, exclusively for use on a personal spin bike after my previous pair of wired Bluetooth headphones died (I suspect from copious amounts of sweat). So far they have been great; they have a secure fit that doesn't move for the entirety of the workout, and can fit over the headband I need to wear at the same time. The only downside I can see so far is the size of the case. This isn't an issue for me as they won't be traveling anywhere, but the case is notably much larger than my other true wireless Soundcore pair - Life P2s (pictures added to compare).",

I\u2019ve used a few pairs of earbuds with and without ear clips and these by far are the best stylish looking, very comfortable and snuggly to wear and the sound is of exceptional quality.

As it is, I can't recommend and wouldn't bother purchasing this again. I'll be returning this one.",

However realised Bluetooth do not penetrate into water when u swim with this though. Easy practicability, love u can wear just only one piece if u like for normal day call taking. Long battery life.
