      "text": "I loved this bag when I got it. It is well made with lots of space and extra pockets. Plus I really wanted a backpack as the only time I will use it is for travel. Not on a daily basis. I tried to put my ASUS 17.3\" laptop in it but it is not big enough. It fit the long way (16.5\") but not the depth which is 12.5\" and the pocket in this bag is only about 12\" wide. I was very disappointed to have to return it. If you have a smaller laptop go for it!",

I will say that it is a bit too long for me - would be hard to deal with stuffing this under a seat - luckily the only time I've used it so far there was enough room in the overhead.",

The padding on the bag is a little heavy or I would have given the bag 5+ stars. The padding is more than enough for being knocked around in the overhead storage or under a seat. The backpack is comfortable to wear and strong enough to carabiner (karabiner) clip my CPAP so I can be hands free moving though the airport/train station.",

Comfort while wearing is generally good, though the length of the backpack seems sized for someone a few inches taller than I am (5'7\"). There are some pads on the outside which rest on your back as you wear it--a nice innovation.",

It's also a bit heavy. If you have a really big laptop and carry a lot extra's with you and and can store it in an overhead - it'll be fine. Otherwise, much it will be empty space and you'll be hard pressed to get under the seat (and you can forget about what little leg room remains). For my needs, I need something more compact as I have a 13\" X 10\" Lenovo (bag is ~15\" x 19\") and limited accouterments.",

This bag is great for that but not for anything else. Pros: Quick to process through security checkpoint. Great straps and back support. Cons: Too tall for a 15\" and under laptop. Compartments are all stacked on top and front of each other. Some compartments are too narrow and deep. I wish this bag came in a much smaller size. The zippers should go further down when opening. I will be checking to see if they make any improvement on this bag in the future.",

The only knock I have against the product is that the external water bottle holder could be a little bigger so that larger bottles don't flop around as much. Standard sized water bottles seem to be fine. I can't wait to find out if the local airport security checkpoint has a problem with it.....they shouldn't.
