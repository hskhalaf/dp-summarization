The size 4's are also on the small size, should have gotten 4 1/2 but he needed them right away for school, so i will be buying the next size up in no time I am sure. Be sure to go one FULL size up, not half size (so if your child is a 3 1/2 go with a 4 1/2). Otherwise, he loves them. Says they are very comfortable and easy to run in at school.",

Except this package had one 4 size shoe and one 4.5 size shoe AND to top it off, they are different styles. Seriously. Everything that could go wrong with this order has gone wrong. Now I have to pay to send back something they messed up. This absolutely surprised me about Amazon. I've come to know them as a better quality company than this. Why can't they overnight me the correct pair for free!!",
