      "text": "I love this strap. It is very sturdy and heavy duty. The holes that your mat goes into is adjustable so it is very easy to remove/replace and would fit mats of all sizes whether they be thicker or thinner. You could also fit two mats in there if you wanted to because there would still be enough room to carry it around on your shoulder. I use my mat at a college yoga class, so I carry my mat around all day and this strap is very comfortable to wear. It is not stretchy at all and pretty thick. It's an awesome deal for the cheap price!",

      "text": "I recently bought a 1\" thick mat for my return to teacing inside at the Y. Mats are no longer being provided and I like some cushioning under my knees. The mat didn't come with a strap, so I looked around and bought this one, because it's adjustable. It fits fine, although it won't be a shoulder strap, but more of a handle, due to the thickness of the mat. I needed something to keep the mat from unrolling during transport and to aid in the ease of carrying it from place to place. I think this strap will work well.",

I love how dynamic the material is: it is stretchy enough to hang onto my mat but doesn't compress it and leave marks like other straps I've used. I also liked that it was long enough for me to strap over my body on my walks to and from the gym.",
