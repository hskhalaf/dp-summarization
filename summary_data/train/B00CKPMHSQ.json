      "text": "Easy to use, Great quality of the image and easy to fit anywhere. Very good on the shadows, better than other famous brands so for motorcycling or biking works better as it usually in this sports it points to the ground instead of the sky. It would be the best camera around if it has a replaceable battery, but apart from that, it is the best for me. That said, the charging port starts to get loose because of the repeated recharging on camera. Not so good quality image underwater.",

The pic is from a 7:30pm game and the camera is sitting on the towards the floor near the dugout. It does capture everything.
