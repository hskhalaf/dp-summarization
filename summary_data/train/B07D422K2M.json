I tried these shoes on for 15 minutes and couldn't stand the pain. These may be great for stability, I don't know. They're definitely not comfortable or cushioned at all.",

I\u2019ve found myself slipping and sliding for a few months to the point that it\u2019s time to retire these permanently. I\u2019d keep wearing if the tread lasted longer, but it just hasn\u2019t help up even to relatively light use after one year.

The downside: in only 4 months the mesh broke open on the first pair. So, they get an average 3 stars, 5 stars for for comfort and looks, and 0 stars for durability.",

However, the right shoe was larger in length and width by several millimeters and resulted in an otherwise comfortable shoe feeling strange while walking. It caused my heal of my right foot to make premature contact with the ground which was very uncomfortable. The size issue aside, these shoes are very light. The soles lacked a hard rubber component which decreased weight but I suspect would lead to rapid wear.",
