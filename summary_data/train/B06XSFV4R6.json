We use it when she is in the rock n play, bassinet, pack and play, and on the changing table when we change her. It has done wonders!

    "title": "Babymoov Lovenest Baby Head Support | The Worlds First Pediatrician Designed Pillow to Prevent Infant Flat Head (From 0+)",
    "description": "Style:Lovenest| Color:GrayThe Babymoov Lovenest was designed and patented by Dr. Manuel Maidenberg, well-known Pediatrician, who noticed that a side effect of having babies lie on their back was the development of postural plagiocephaly, or flat-head syndrome, due to the weight of the baby\u2019s head lying in the same position for a long period of time. The Lovenest\u2019s unique ergonomic design helps to remove the pressure from the back of the skull and distribute it evenly, allowing the head to maintain its proper shape while the skull is still forming during the first year of a baby\u2019s life. The soft, breathable cotton fabric ensures comfort and ventilation, while baby sleeps. The Lovenest can be used from birth \u2013 an added benefit to its design is that it creates a cocoon-like holding effect that soothes and reassures the baby. PROMOTES PROPER HEAD SHAPE: A baby\u2019s head remains very malleable up until around the age of one year. The patented tilt and special shape of the Lovenest combined with its unique breathable cotton fabric ensures even distribution of pressure across the baby\u2019s skull, which helps maintain the proper head shape until the skull is fully formed. The pillow can be used from birth to begin promoting healthy skull development beginning with the first days of your child\u2019s life. HELPS TO PREVENT FLAT HEAD SYNDROME: While the correct lying position for a baby is on his or her back, a potential side effect is the development of plagiocephaly, or flat head syndrome, as the weight of the baby\u2019s head lies practically in the same position. The Lovenest removes the pressure from the back of the skull and distributes its evenly, helping the baby\u2019s skull to remain rounded with no compromise. The simple design of the Lovenest means that it can be used for your baby throughout the day as an insert in a baby swing, rocker or stroller to continually promote healthy head shape and skull development. VERSATILE DESIGN AND USE: The Lovenest\u2019s simple and unique heart-shaped design makes it very easy to use. It is an ideal insert in a baby swing, bouncer, or stroller to maximize the head and neck support for your baby throughout the day. The pillow\u2019s breathable fabric provides perfect ventilation for your child\u2019s head and neck. LIFETIME WARRANTY: All Babymoov products carry a lifetime warranty. Simply register your Lovenest at service-babymoov.com within two months of purchase.",
