      "text": "These are very nice looking pool balls. However, I played a few games with them, and had no trouble deciphering between solid and stripes and numbers but when racking them the third time, the 3 ball looked odd. It looked small. So I lined them all up and placed a straight flat item over the top, and learned not only was the three smaller, but most of the solids were smaller than the stripes, and the 12 ball (stripes) was the same smaller size. So they are mixed diameters. So strange. I will end up buying new balls from a billiards store in person, and donate these to the club house. So disappointing. They really do look great!!!",

The price was very fair and I hope to get many years of use out of the set.",

The other issue is that the swirls sometimes make it a little difficult to distinguish solids from stripes. Overall they are a great value for the price and they look great on the table.",
