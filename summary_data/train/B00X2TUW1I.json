      "text": "Living in Florida and dealing with the bright sun; I find these shades are helpful in lessening the amount of heat and UV rays coming through the driver's window. The glare is controlled by positioning the shade on the side window - the only negative is the film which allows the shade to remain in place creates a slight distortion when looking through it - making it necessary to sometimes removing the shade to be certain of traffic movement. Otherwise, it serves my purpose for purchasing this product.",

I was concerned that it might fall easily on my new grand baby. It does not move without your removal of it. There comes a set of 4. I keep two in my car and two in my husbands car to shade my grandchild. They came in a small pack to keep them in. They fold easily to put back in pack if you don't want to leave them up. I have used these on my front windshield when my sun visor tore. Love these will be buying another set.",

      "text": "they are pretty flimsy - they stick to the windows ok but they will come off in extreme Texas summer heat. You can't roll the window down, even a couple of inches, without removing them, or they scrunch up. , And it is likely illegal to drive with them on because it is difficult to see oncoming traffic. So you have to open all the doors, peel them all off the windows, fold them up and store them every time you want to go somewhere. I still have to open all the car doors and let the heat out because they do not cover the entire window so you still get a lot of sun in the car",

I also like that if they do fall (or get pulled) on to baby, they're lightweight so they won't cause any harm. They seem to remove and re-stick well thus far. They cover the majority of my back windows of my Subaru Outback and help to provide shade to the carseat. My only complaint is that the borders are somewhat thick and they make it a little more difficult to see out of the back drivers' side window. I'll be taking that one down, but it seems to work well on the passenger side backseat window.",

My truck has a light tint on the front side windows and I did not want to darken the window permanently because of night driving. This window reflector works so well by being able to fold easily and store in the side door pocket. When the sun is blinding me as the driver I can just lift it up and it flips out on its own and practically jumps on the window by itself. The reflector adheres well to the window and will not fall off. Sorry for such a long review but I am so impressed by this purchase. Thanks Enovoe",

On super sunny days, it does also seem like our daughter is bothered with the sun in her face even through the shade. Good start, but not a complete solution for blocking out sunlight in the back seat.",
