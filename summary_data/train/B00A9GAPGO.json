      "text": "I purchased this phone and returned it within the first two weeks. It stopped ringing out loud half the time. And most of the time I had to put it on speaker phone to hear the calls, as 9 out of 10 times they would be absolutely no sound if I put it to my ear. Also notice when using certain apps such as Google Maps, the phone would get incredibly hot. I ended up buying a similarly priced phone the Moto E4, which turned out to be fantastic by Leaps and Bounds. I am so happy I returned it.",

      "text": "I bought this phone to use in the UK but it does not work properly. The screen disappears when on call. It does not show back until the other person hangs up. Same thing happens when I get the voice mail. I cannot hang up as the screen gets black. I press the button on the right side of the phone and it does nothing. Voice mails in the UK take several minutes to end so the recording takes several minutes and only then when the voice mail finishes the screen gets back to normal. Also the volume for whatsapp audios is too low that I cannot hear anything it's said.",

Never had anything break even tho I dropped it more then a dozen times. Cons. Terrible battery life. By the end I was charging it twice a day with minimal use. And that's after I switched batts more then once No SD card slot and not enough internal storage, I was always backing things up and deleting them because my storage was full. Overall a pretty durable phone but has its flaws",
