It has 24 levels and is quite impressive how hard is to run with the highest level. If you are a beginner in using this mask, then start with a lower level because you will have hard time breathing just like me. I expect to improve my lungs muscle and to have better results overtime. Overall, the mask looks good, great quality, and very easy to use. Also, it provides a wonderful case that will keep your mask safe. You will not regret if you buy it.",

I am glad I finally decided to get my own and try it fr myself. The first use was a blast! I could not believe the value it adds value to my resistance training. Its way harder to do any exercise with it. In time I noticed considerable improvement in my gym workout and in my resistance trainings. 5 stars!",

I 155ish, so I ordered the medium size. It holds up, but i almost run out of velcro in the back to tighten it. One of the valves doesn't work properly, but the other one does perfectly, so you can feel the difference in air restriction when switching levels. Overall, it works, not a perfect fit for me, but I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and have nothing negative to say about the product.",
