One of my cats, Harlequin, gets aggressive when on the 'nip, haha! I let them play with it for the day, then had to hide it, because they kept going back to it, going nuts, tossing the toys all over, and sweet Bubbeigh kept getting attacked by queen Harlequin, so a time-out was definitely needed lol. There was a slight imperfection with one of the \"toppings\" (yellow bell pepper), looked like smeared ink, or something, but aside from that, it's a really great quality product that I definitely recommend.",

She\u2019s chewed the box up a bit (which isn\u2019t much different than an actual small pizza box, which I often have around anyway lol).

They are big fans of chewing and jumping on the pizza box. They chase the stuffed ingredients around and the sound the image side makes when rubbed or scratched gets their attention. They are not too sure about the actual pizza. The underside makes a loud crinkle sound which frightens the more skittish kitten away. The kittens do not seem very interested in laying or playing on the pizza and tend to walk over it as if they don't notice it at all.",
