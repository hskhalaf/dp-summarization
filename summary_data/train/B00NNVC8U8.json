I find the in camera light meter to be extremely accurate. My images nee little post processing. I can now take one camera instead of a body with numerous lenses. I use my Canon SLR now only for macro. The macro in the Leica isn't as good as a dedicated macro lens. Great camera for travel and for street photography. But when I am traveling I cover up the Leica name with black electrical tape.",

Really impressed with the video and focusing. Easy to carry and use. Good quality pictures for general use.I would give it a five star rating but I noticed that at 400mm the images area not as sharp as with my Nikon lens; then again, it is no where as expensive as my Nikon lens. At any rate I would recommend this camera.",

I have used Nikons in the past but this is so much lighter and easier to use. The pictures are better and I don't worry about crap on the mirror from changing lens. It is such a capable camera that we are only start to touch the surface of its abilities. Well done Leica. !!!",

Most specifically - the switchers and levers on the camera body and lens are unaccepably poor quality (on/off switch, lens focus/ois switch) all are poor quality with at least 0.5mm of movement play. Seriously doubt that these switches - particularly the on/off lever will last a year with routine regular use. This is unacceptable for a Leica camera of any model (I own the Dlux 5 and 6 models - which are half the price and far better engineered and quality). There is no way I would keep this camera.
