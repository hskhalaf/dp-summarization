It actually arrived broken, part of the wood frame came apart at one of the corners where the dovetail didn't look like it had been put together properly. Nothing a little wood glue and some clamps couldn't fix. However, having seen this I don't think I would trust it with nice dishes in my kitchen, especially if they are the heavy ceramic ones. As a plant stand it's a nice use for a small space. It is a light bamboo color, so it should easily match other items of the same material.",
