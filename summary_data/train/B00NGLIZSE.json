      "text": "I like the product -- no smell and pump is very easy to use. My problem is with the slow leak of the container, so slow that I never noticed it at first. I initially thought it was just coming from the pump so I washed thoroughly the sides of the container each time. I came to the conclusion that iti's coming from the bottom of the container, but I can't be sure because the leak is so slow. So I need to keep the container in a small bowl (this is a very concentrated and it will leave marks on most surfaces). I remember seeing the same complaint on previous reviews.",
