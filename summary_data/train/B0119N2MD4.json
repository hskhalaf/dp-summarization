Included are images of both. In addition to a very slim fit, this jacket also has shorter sleeves than the regular, which were actually perfect for me. The nylon is extremely high-quality, and blocks the wind well. It's also quite warm. I'll be sticking with the slim and returning the regular.",

The medium, fits sort of tight (if you want that slim look while wearing a t-shirt) You can pull off a hoodie as well, but its going to be kinda tight and it better be a thin hoodie) In a perfect world I would want one of each.

It looks better than my old regular fit MA-1 especially in the arms and shoulders. It's not puffy or baggy on me. It sits just below my belt. The only thing is the sleeves could be half an inch shorter. It causes the cuffs to tunnel inside the sleeves. Other than that it's made well and looks great.",
