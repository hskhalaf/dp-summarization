I know the metal stems holding the bowls look flimsy but when I place my hand on the top bowl and added pressure (like a pound or 2) it still felt solid. I will update if I need to but I dont think I will. I may buy a 2nd one as a gift",

Has no plastic odor. So many things could be of use for this item not just food but for kids toys as well, Legos, puzzles, I could use 100 more of these.",
