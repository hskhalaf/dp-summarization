      "text": "I'm a high school teacher that uses this product for end-of-year assessment reviews and place them around my walls. This is a phenomenal product on many different levels. It very easily moves from the students desks to the walls. It is also within the requirements of what is allowed to be used on the walls according to district and school policy so it doesn't ruin the paint. The paper is very sturdy and also does not tear easily. The writing surface is clean white and I have used Expo markers Sharpies and regular Crayola markers and they have all worked without smearing. I also received this from Amazon warehouse deals which was a phenomenal price.",
