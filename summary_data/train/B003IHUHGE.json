They're also frightfully better looking, classic, like something out of an early Desmond Llewelyn laboratory. The build quality is something to be honored with a national holiday. No plastic! I honestly do not know why people spend so much money on those other brands, when the B&W P5 can be had for less. Now that you know about these, even if you don't purchase them, you can silently laugh at every person you see walking by with Beats headphones. What idiots.",

They're comfy, but I would not recommend these for working out. They're not noise-canceling, but the pads block out quite a bit of ambient noise. I use them at work to drown out the sounds of other cubicle noise and they're amazing! The fact that they double as a mic for your phone is a huge plus as well. I would definitely buy these again. Oh, they're also pretty snazzy looking. Yum!",

I've mostly used Bose Q15s in the past and was expecting similar sound quality for these ones particularly given their premium price point and also I assumed that more $$$ were going into the sound rather than the noise-cancelling features of the Bose. The mid and high ranges are good. The low range bass is definitely lacking compared to the Bose. To get a good bass sound, you have to press the earphones closer to your head. Maybe it's partially due to the ear pieces not being entirely over the ear?",

    "description": "Style:Headphones| Product Packaging:Standard Packaging\n\nBowers & Wilkins P5 mobile hi-fi headphones deliver natural, highly-detailed audio on the move. \nview larger The P5 headphones are the perfect partners for your iPhone, but the interchangeable cable means you can use them with any device. \nview larger P5 HEADPHONES\nWith P5 mobile hi-fi headphones, the sound you hear is completely natural \u2013 as close to the sound of the original recording as we can possibly take you. Bowers & Wilkins call it true sound, and believe that you will know it as soon as you hear it.\n\nNOISE ISOLATION\nA closed-back design with rigid metal faceplates and sealed earpads ensures that all the detail and dynamic range of your music is kept intact, while preserving just enough ambient sound to give you a sense of place. Perfect for listening to music on the go.\n\nLUXURY MATERIALS\nP5's high-quality sound and luxury materials are supported by smart design and user-friendly features. The Made for iPod cable allows easy control of an iPod, and the microphone facilitates calls on an iPhone. The leather earpads are magnetically attached, and can be quickly removed to swap the supplied cables.\n\n\nThe specially designed drive units inside P5 are created to produce as natural, true-to-life sound as possible. \nview larger P5's earpads are crafted from high-quality leather for a gloriously luxurious fit that aids noise-isolation and audio performance. \nview larger LISTEN FOR LONGER\nGimmicky effects like exaggerated bass or artificially enhanced treble quickly become tiring with extended listening. The P5's natural audio performance brings you close to the sound of the original recording, as you were meant to hear it. Which means you can enjoy your favorite music for longer.\n\n\nWHICH HEADPHONE IS RIGHT FOR YOU?\n\nBowers & Wilkins P7 Headphones Bowers & Wilkins P5 Headphones Bowers & Wilkins P3 Headphones Bowers & Wilkins C5 Headphones Design Over-Ear On-Ear On-Ear In-Ear Changeable Ear Cushions Yes Yes Yes Yes Foldable Yes Folds flat Yes Carry Case/Pouch Yes Yes Yes Yes iPhone Compatible Yes Yes Yes Yes Weight 290g 195g 130g 20g \n\n\nThe control room of Studio 1 at London's Abbey Road Studios, which uses Bowers & Wilkins 800 Series loudspeakers.\nview larger Nautilus was the result of a five-year research program to create the perfect loudspeaker. Many technologies developed in this project are now found in all Bowers & Wilkins products.\nview larger BOWERS & WILKINS HISTORY\nIn leading recording studios around the world, music that will soon be heard everywhere is first heard through Bowers & Wilkins loudspeakers. In London's world-famous Abbey Road Studios, all three main studios use Bowers & Wilkins 800 Series speakers to capture the output of the world's biggest-selling artists.\n\nENGINEERING INNOVATION\nEvery discovery Bowers & Wilkins' scientists make in their dedicated Research and Development facility influences how speakers all over the world are designed and built. Technologies such as Nautilus Tapering Tubes and Flowport start life in their high-end loudspeakers, but are also important factors in the likes of Zeppelin Air and their headphone range.\n\nDOING IT FROM DAY ONE\nWhen John Bowers set up Bowers & Wilkins in 1966, experimentation in sound and recording was escalating rapidly. It was the time of Sergeant Pepper and Pet Sounds, and Bowers had a pioneering spirit to match. His ambition was revolutionary for the day, and remains so: to create a loudspeaker that neither adds nor takes away from the music. Bowers & Wilkins has been exploring the world of sound ever since. And they'll never settle for less than perfection.\n\nRELATED PRODUCTS FROM BOWERS & WILKINS\n\nBowers & Wilkins Headphones Bowers & Wilkins Wireless Music Systems Bowers & Wilkins Computer Speakers",
