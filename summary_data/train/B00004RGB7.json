I bought this to expand my collection and sadly the steel is noticeably thinner. It still works but I am wondering if it will last like my vintage farberware has. It is sad that some higher up thought that they could make more money and skimp on the level of quality, not pass that higher profit margin on to their employees but probably pay the CEO more money so he can get a bigger boat. I could go on about this being a recurring theme in most products made nowadays but I digress.",

The handles stay cool and the pots are still in great condition after two years. My only gripe is that the insert has a groove on the inside (where it sits on the rim of the lower pot) that is difficult to clean if food gets into it. I've had to either soak the pot in water or use a toothpick to clean it out.",

Pop in the boiler insert to melt chocolate or gently cook custards. Without the insert, the saucepan and lid are great for everyday recipes like wild rice or minestrone soup. A full cap base featuring a thick aluminum core surrounded by stainless steel provides rapid, even heating on any stovetop, and the double boiler is oven safe to 350\u00b0F and conveniently dishwasher safe for quick, easy cleanup.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nYou want hollandaise on poached eggs and chocolate sauce on a cake, but to do it right, you'll need a double boiler. Is it worth the grief? Yes, and this convenient midsize outfit reduces the grief by quickly providing what is needed for smooth sauces, while incidentally adding an extra 2-quart pan to a kitchen's repertoire. The pieces are made of highly polished stainless steel, and have phenolic handles that stay cool, are oven safe to 350 degrees, and have metal hanging loops; the large \"knob\" handle on the lid is also easy to get a hold of in a hurry. The pans are also dishwasher-safe. --Richard Farr",
