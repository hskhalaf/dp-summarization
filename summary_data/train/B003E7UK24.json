I put it together by myself (I'm a 31 yo female) and didn't run into any issues. It was all packaged VERY well, no damage on anything. There's also no smell mentioned by other people, mine didn't smell bad or stink up the house. The material is very solid and well made. I've had nothing but compliments so far!! I bought an 8\" memory foam mattress for the top and plan to buy a 6\" memory foam mattress for the trundle, so there's ample room for bedding. Very impressed with this bed and very very happy with it!",

I need the underbed and the drawer space and cannot do anything with what I have. It is too disappointing. Check what was ordered and what I got.",

I'm still looking for another caster made for plush carpet. Overall, I'm satisfied and would purchase it again.",

The older version glides out and has swivel wheels. The newer version was made with a weaker thinner material and the bed wobbles. We have already had the reinforce the bed frame as it cracked the first week. It\u2019s a shame the quality has declined so much as we love our original bed.

Too much hand screwing on the rails and drawer runners that would not allow a cordless drill to make things faster.

You actually need to put your thumb in the handle, and your fingers on the BOTTOM of the drawer to pull. This pulls down and it comes out. If you try to open regularly, you are pulling up and it is as if the drawers are locked. Great product though.",

It was fairly easy to assemble. Only one drawer front had issues (drilled holes were too deep) Thankfully, my husband is quite handy, so it was fixed quickly. Overall I would definitely recommend it. Especially with the free shipping.",

The Bed looks really nice and is very sturdy, the only thing is the drawers tend to get off track every now and then but no biggy. I assembled the bed by myself without any problems and to this day nothing has broke and the paint has not chipped. Great bed!",

So you can managed to put this thing together with minor help from someone else. I left the boxes in the garage. And assembled in the bedroom only bringing in the pieces I needed. The drawers in the bottom is an extra plus! It is a tall bed. Long drop to the floor. When my granddaughter sleeps in it, I pull out the bottom bed also, so if she rolls off she will hit the bottom bed.",

I bought an 8 in for the top and a 6 in for the bottom which fit perfectly. I decided to switch and put the 6 in on top just because of how high it was, so the 8 in fits pretty tight on the bottom. I added a pic of what the trundle space looks like. The bed is open in the back.",

The only downside is that 3 screws were missing which I had to go and buy from HomeDepot which was not a bad thing. One thing to note though for future buyers, the bed is quite high after putting the twin-bed, so a toddler sleeping on it may have some trouble to go in. In addition, you will need to get a railing so that your child won't fall of from the bed, but overall this product is nicely finished and very good looking.",
