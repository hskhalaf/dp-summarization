      "text": "Have used it a few times and it does the job very well. Holds loose items in very well and if you are using a tarp it will prevent it from flapping around. My truck is a standard size and find it is plenty big enough for what I do. Is made of stretchy material similar to bungee cords so it adjusts to your needs but better than a bunch of bungees and less expensive as well. Have no idea how long it will last but I store it in the truck not in the sun so I expect a few years. A very good solution for occasional use.",

This cargo net is complete crap I would not recommend this in any way.",
