It is powerful and comes with the charger cord that plugs into a usb outlet. The roller is wider than the previous brand I had, it also it angled very nice and feels comfortable in your hand. It\u2019s a great price and great quality. I would recommend to purchase this.",

I\u2019m pretty happy with how well it worked on my thick calluses. I will update review if after I charge this completely it lasts longer than 5 minutes before requiring another charge. The product is easy to use. I wish the was a super-coarse roller for my feet, but I will try again with this coarse roller. The good thing is it would be very difficult to hurt yourself or take too much off because the skin comes off so gradually.",

This electric file is so easy to use and not scary at all. I was concerned I would take off to much skin by accident. The file turns itself off if you push too hard, so it would be very hard to hurt yourself. It is more like a foot sander, very little dead skin comes off at a time. Excellent results after one 10 minute session. Very impressed, it is well worth the money. It's my new go-to pedicure tool!",

It says you can use it wet or dry, but I don't find it works very well wet. I always make sure my feet are completely dry before using. They claim you can use it 80 times before having to recharge, but I find that laughable. Maybe it's a typo and they meant 8, which is more like it. Not a problem, though. It's easy enough to recharge. All in all, I'm very happy with this file.",

This filer is sleeker in design also. The only reason I gave it only 4 stars is because I couldn't find a link to order refills. However, the other brand's refills actually fit so do not hesitate to give this a try.",
