If you're not sensitive to the allergen in Schmidt deodorant, I highly recommend it: It's the best deodorant I've ever used. It takes a little longer to apply: Scrape enough out of the jar to roll into a little ball, massage under arm, repeat for the other arm, wash hands. I keep a spray deodorant for when I'm in a real hurry, but in general, I use this.",

My best advice is scoop out a small ball, stick on your underarm and close it for a few seconds. The warmth of your body will make it more easily spreadable. More hassle than I needed. I love the stick formula of Schmidt's is the Lime scent. Its still a bit rough to spread, but works beautifully.",

I make my own now that I apply with my fingers (the hippie lifestyle is a slippery slope), but I still recommend this to people.

It does work best when armpits are shaved, so that is something to take in to account. I take a pea sized scoop (you don't need much), rub it between my fingers to warm it up and then smooth it out on my armpit. Works like a charm. Highly recommend.",
