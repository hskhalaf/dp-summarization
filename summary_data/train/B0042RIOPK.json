I wouldn't do that for a full-size dog, but ours is only 12 lbs and is enticed by the taste, not by the quantity. She loves these and responds very well to them (and the liver flavor, too). As the human, I like that it's made in the USA, and that the ingredients are quality and identifiable - I know I'm not feeding her toxic garbage.

She was a picky eater, and because they could not find a commercially available treat to satisfy her finicky palate and yield to her allergies, they ended up baking their own. When they whipped up a batch of Samantha\u2019s low allergen dog treats for a local animal shelter fundraiser, the treats were a huge hit and people started calling wanting more.\n\nBeginning with Buddy Biscuits, Cloud Star has since expanded to include a wide variety of wholesome and natural dog treats, grooming products,and Wag More Bark Less\u00ae merchandise. Simple, easy to read ingredient statements resonate with pet parents and thrill dogs with even the most finicky palate. Our treats and grooming products are made in the USA,with only first-quality ingredients.\n\nThe company has come a long way since the first batch of Buddy Biscuits was born in the home oven, but we remain committed to providing our customers with the most wholesome and natural products available.\n\n\n\nGiving back, thanks to you!\n\nAs part of Cloud Star\u2019s commitment to giving back, we have pledged to donate at least 10% of our net profits to nonprofit organizations that benefit animals, women, children, and the environment. It\u2019s a simple premise that can provide incredible results.\n\nOur green way of thinking has been in place since we started business in 1999, and we remain committed to being good corporate and environmental stewards. We aren\u2019t doing these things because they are trendy, rather we feel that, in the current state of the world, this is the only way to conduct business. We too have children to whom we want to leave a world that is a little better than we found it.",
