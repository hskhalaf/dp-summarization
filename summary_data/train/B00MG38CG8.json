The only drawback is that the game will cost you a lot of money later, buying more figures and traps to continue with the game. Occasional crashes on Ipad mini 2. My son loves the game, but it is getting too expensive. I use this as a way to give him reward for good school work. Some of the figures I have to hunt down to get, and the prices are not uniform. For Light and Dark trap, be sure to buy the expansion packs.",

My son has been asking for the Skylanders game for a long time, had read all the books, watched the shows, etc. We don't have any type of video game system, and I really didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars on one. For this price, I have a very happy kids playing Skylanders, I am very pleased.",

There are areas where you need to use a character with a specific element in order to get through. For some of these areas, it still won't let him through when he is using the correct element character. It also will tell him he needs a specific trap and when he puts that trap in it doesn't work.. this isn't all the time, but it's often enough to seriously diminish the enjoyment of the game experience.",

Lots of puzzles and mini-games and variety and you can evolve your characters (which have great physical toys that work in the game wirelessly). The new tablet version has to be the ultimate road-trip game. The wireless game controller stores away inside the portal. Very cool! My only criticism - the portal should use AA instead of AAA batteries, because I have some Skylanders that light up as they get near the portal (\"Lightcore\"), and that drains the portal batteries a little quicker.",

The only tablets it will work on cost over $250; Kindle must be a 6 or 7 edition; iphone 6 did not work. The only device we got it to work on was a galaxy mobile phone, and we did not want to go that route. Also, the figures and traps are the same that come with the actual game for a console like Xbox, and there are too many in circulation to sell them off. My son wanted this for months and is now very disappointed, as are we.",
