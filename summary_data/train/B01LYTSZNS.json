Upon opening my package I discovered that one of the bottles had spilled throughout the entire package. NOT HAPPY. Especially since they're not cheap. I'm unsure how that came to be. The leaky bottle looked as though it had a different cap than the other 9 bottles in the box. Either way, it made me pretty upset.",

They made a noise similar to champagne being opened when the lid was twisted off, and the smell of the oil was very off putting, especially when compared to the other two boxes that were fine, and quite pleasant. Basically I was really only satisfied with one of the three I bought.",
