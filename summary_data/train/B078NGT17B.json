      "verdict": "The Outmost Ventilator from Merrell offered satisfactory features that hikers and outdoor lovers would enjoy. It was positively rated in comfort, breathability, and lightness. Not to mention, it comes at an economical price. However, its unreliable traction on wet grounds and the not-so-flexible sole rendered some hikes off-putting. To summarize, the Merrell Outmost Ventilator can undoubtedly perform in dry, summer hikes. However, tackling wet grounds with this shoe is not advisable.",
      "pros": [
        "A majority of Outmost Ventilator owners were convinced with the shoe\u2019s comfortable feel",
        "It rendered a decent amount of arch support, according to a few users",
        "Most wearers commended its lightness",
        "The Merrell Outmost Ventilator was indeed a breathable gear, based on numerous customer reviews",
        "It was a budget-friendly pair, as mentioned by several online buyers",
        "Some hikers approved of its overall snug fit"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "A handful of day hikers were crestfallen when the grip of the Outmost Ventilator from Merrell failed in wet, slick surfaces",
        "The sole was a bit stiff as if walking on a rock, as noted by a couple of users"

I returned the shoe thinking I must not have noticed that it was a men's shoe but I just looked again (to replace the order I returned), and it says it's a women's shoe. Not ordering again as I don't know what I'll get. Love this brand and have had many Merrell shoes but this product listing is confusing.",

I have tried every kind of insole and I haven't found a solution in over 5 years, I've even spent 150$ on red wing shoes and it hasn't helped. These are the perfect solution, great support, built to last, and light enough to keep moving all day, I've worn them daily for over a month and could not be more pleased!",
