I bought the warranty after hearing that some people\u2019s broke. However, after two months, my hoop is still intact. There is a small (size of pinhead) chunk of foam missing from a piece- I think one of my cats dug their nails into it. Still- the hole hasn\u2019t gotten any bigger weeks later. Overall, very happy with this purchase.",
