Most times, some will turn off at the designated timer time, but at least 1 light will stay lit without interruption. They simply just don't function as they are designed to. Save yourself the money, and just buy regular LED bulbs. Until they improve the functionality, these are just absurdly priced, occasionally functional light bulbs. Definitely not worth the price tag.",

They 'forget' their state when you set a dimness level, turn the switch off then turn the switch on again. They also turn on by themselves at random times even though I have no schedule set in the app. This means I have to turn the lamps off at the mains when I go out, defeating the whole purpose.

My only complaint is that as a chandelier bulb it is very large, and sticks far out the top of our fixture and is almost too wide. It does still work though, and I probably could've avoided issues by taking measurements from the description. As the only chandelier smart light bulb I could find it works well.",
