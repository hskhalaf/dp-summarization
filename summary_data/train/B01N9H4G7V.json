      "verdict": "Vasque created the Grand Traverse to be an all-around hiking shoe. The careful selection of the features did not add bulk to its weight. Hence, it collected positive remarks. Its strongest points include durability, support, and performance. These pros, of course, raises a few items for improvement. Its minimal cushioning and narrow fit left outdoorsmen yearning for more. To conclude, the Vasque Grand Traverse is a low-cut day hiking shoe which may not work well with wide-footed individuals. Nevertheless, its list of benefits still leave prospective buyers enough reasons to check it out.",

At this point they\u2019ve held up fine so I\u2019ll know about wear and support in about a year but my experience with Vasque was very good from about 15-20 years ago. It helped that amazon price was 30$ less than other internet suppliers.",

The Vibram soles are grippy, the shoes look sharp (get lots of compliments),and are a perfect fit for me. I've worn a lot of Vasque shoes over the years so I knew they'd fit great. I order the same size I wear in a Nike running shoe which is a half size larger than my regular shoe size.",
