It's not nursery lullabies, but music like Canon in D, Beauty and the Beast, and other songs that I actually enjoy listening to. It can easily put me to sleep in the middle of the night if I turn it on while feeding baby. Please let me know if you found this review helpful and feel free to comment if you have any questions!",

The way people were raving about it makes me think some of the reviews must have been paid for. It's just to hard to believe they are talking about the same product I received",

I am so happy with this purchase, it moves the right speed but as far as I can tell the speed is not adjustable. The feature that sold me on this unit specifically is that it has volume buttons, it can go from fairly loud or it can be turned down all the way to mute it. The spinning can be stopped as well. I have this attached to a simple screw hook in the ceiling and the mobile attaches by a split ring, both went on with ease. Highly recommended!",

You can also have the songs play without the mobile turning. Solid construction, and even though it came direct from china it only took a week to be delivered. Really very very happy with this.",

Well, here's the problem with those theories...The room is not humid or dusty, and the only thing ever hanging on it is the mobile, which is not heavy.

Then I found this mobile on amazon which as separate switches for the music and rotation, volume control, music selection. Now I can just turn on music on one mobile and make both mobiles rotated; or, I can just leave on mobile music on as a background music soothing my twin girls while they drinking milk or sleeping. Life saving, great buy and nice price too!",

I thought for sure it was defective. But I put in different batteries and it worked perfectly. So, if this happens to you, before you toss it out the window and leave a scathing review, try fresh batteries. Otherwise, man I love it. 30 minutes of straight functionality without me having to run to the crib to wind it every 2 minutes. And the music is great. I've heard Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninov and plenty of Disney tunes as well. This thing has my baby girl smiling ear to ear.",

Hopefully it lasts longer than two weeks, which seems to be the common consensus of this product. Will return to alter the review if that should be the case.",
