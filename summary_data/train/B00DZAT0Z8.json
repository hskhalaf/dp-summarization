I love the memory foam earbuds because my earholes are small and they provide a snug fit but I never felt like I was compromising on sound quality before. I hope they go back to making these the way they used to!",

My whole family is using the and they consistently perform well. We use the with our iPhones, iPads without issue. In general they sound very good. They don't have the best bass but (in iOS) if you set the equalizer to treble reducer it makes them sounds lot better.",
