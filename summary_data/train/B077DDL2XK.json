Little did I know, I had more fun just knocking her over on her keister than actually turning up the heat on our kink. So interested in taking out some frustration on a significant other without all the bruises? Buy them. Pesky kids that whine and complain all the time and need bounced around? Buy them. A couple of kinky freaks that want to oil yourselves up and have some bouncy foreplay? Buy them. Worth every penny.
