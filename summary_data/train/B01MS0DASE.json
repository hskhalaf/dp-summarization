But it cannot mount to the OEM integrated crossbars (AS PICTURED) and neither Tepui or parent company Thule make a crossbar that's suitable for this vehicle. Because this was a gift, we've passed the 30-day return period. I'll repost if I can find any manufacturer that makes a product that will allow this to mount safely and properly. But until then do not buy for any Subaru with integrated crossbars!",

Pros: \u2022 Fits on stock crossbars for 2016 Subaru Outback \u2022 Very Lightweight \u2022 The blue color way is sweet \u2022 Easy set up \u2022 Affordable \u2022 comes with all hardware to install (1 standard wrench + 1 ratchet wrench) Cons: \u2022 Very hard to put into stock crossbars (Nothing to do with tent but the cross bars) \u2022 The size for 2 people is quite small, it\u2019ll fit perfect for sleeping but not so much to hang out in",

We absolutely love how easy it is to set up and take down. The only thing we added was a foam topper, as the mattress provided can be a little too thin for an extended use, like ours. We were able to insert the foam topper into the zipped mattress cover, which was helpful.",
