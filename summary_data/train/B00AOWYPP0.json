It's really important that the sides are mesh because she can lay down and still see out so that she doesn't feel alone. I'm surprised at how many doggy car seats I looked at that were solid on all four sides--not good! The front bar is sturdy and does not collapse when she stands on it to look out. The pockets on the front are really nice to have to be able to store treats, toys, etc.",

I have a 15 pound dog, which the instructions said this would hold, but she had to curl up in it be able to get her head in to lay down.
