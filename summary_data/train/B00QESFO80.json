I was slightly suspicious when I opened the box and saw a little dust on the stethoscope. I opened it to find that this didn't match the picture at all. The binaurals were a weird red-brown metal, they were scratched, and they totally clashed with the copper chestpiece. I placed the diaphragm to my chest and realized the sound quality was inferior to my MDF. At school, the Littman models have all seemed to be superior. This leads me to believe I was totally ripped off. I am returning and we will be ordering from elsewhere.",

It's on the shorter end, but that doesnt impede on its function. Love the color... usually dont splurge on stuff like this and the price is a bit high for a stethoscope but figured I use it, I'm going to continue needing it in my nursing career, and you get what you pay for! Ear pieces are comfortable and sound quality is great. Would definitely recommend.",

So far these are great very comfy in my ears which was important to me and I can hear well. Relative to the others I found online it seems like these are a great value as well. I went with the navy to match my scrubs but the fact there are so many color options is cool too",

As you get older, do not expect the hearing to ever get better. So improvment of hearing heartsounds prominently wasa a vaery nice surprise. I highly recommend this model. Lot's of colors allows one to pick a color no one else has, so someone does not accidentally walk away from my stethoscope.",
