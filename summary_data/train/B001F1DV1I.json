HOWEVER...I think it damaged my sense of smell. I didn't use it for very long but I noticed a difference. After I googled it, that seems to be a known side effect! Nasalcrom doesn't appear to give me any side effects (based on occasional use for several years). I recommend giving it a try!",

NasalCrom is not an quick fix like decongestants and anti-histamines, it takes a couple of days before you start seeing improvements. But there are no side effects (for me at least) and no bounce back like you can get from other products. I've tried the steroid sprays that my doctor prefers, but when I use them regularly I seem to catch colds much more often. My only complaint about NasalCrom is that it is becoming harder to find in stores.",

NasalCrom works differently from other over the counter allergy products and brings relief from chronic allergy symptoms before they begin. When used before exposure to many common allergens, NasalCrom can prevent the onset of nasal allergy attacks and build protection against future symptoms as long as you continue to use it as directed. It contains no steroids and is safe to use with other allergy medications. NasalCrom does not cause drowsiness or jitters, plus it is non habit forming. NasalCrom is safe for kids ages two and up. To enjoy the full preventative power of NasalCrom, it\u2019s important to note that you should start using it a week or two before you expect to encounter problematic allergens. Fortunately, NasalCrom will still provide relief while it builds up full protection against further symptoms.",
