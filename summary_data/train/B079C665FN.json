I do recommend the machine be placed as high as possible to efficiently remove particles in the air from the ceiling down, as this is how the needle point ionization works ( I noticed that the picture in the box has the purifier sitting on the floor.) The needle point acts like pine trees in a Forrest to remove heavy air particles. I was also very please at how fast it arrived once I ordered it.",

I was a little bit hesitant after reading some of the reviews related to the ozone output. However, we simply followed the instructions that came with the unit, and it is working fine. Neither our dog nor our cat have had any issues. When we walk into the house, it truly is a breath of fresh air. I highly recommend this unit.",
