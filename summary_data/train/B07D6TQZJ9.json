Also, the tie had been pinned to the shirt so it had a noticeable hole in it. The shirt itself was actually dirty and it appeared that it had been worn and then possibly returned to the seller who then attempted to repackage it and send it. As for the shirt itself, it was a little thin but felt okay, but due to be dirty and the tie unusable I returned the item.",

An undershirt has to be ironed due to the fact that you can see every wrinkle or flaw through the shirt.",
