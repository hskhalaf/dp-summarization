This thing is AMAZING in my tiny house, HIGHLY recommend- it was SOOO easy to install, and it's light weight- very powerful- and I definitely use it as a shelf, which I didn't intend to, and it's probably not made for it, but in a tiny house- the next thing I knew, I had all my spiced, oils, vinegar, sugar etc, so conveniently sitting on it as a shelf, and it holds it without hesitation. Can't say enough good things about this unit! You wont be disappointed!",

We don't use a range hood much (a handful of times a year) so we thought this would be a good option to the aforementioned issue. It's mostly for light purposes. However 2 nights ago when we turned it on the high speed it was barely running. On low speed it is so quiet I doubt it is working at all. Unfortunately our 1 year warranty is now expired. Truly a shame that a product of this expense (vented systems are much cheaper) doesn't last much over a year with extremely minimal use.",
