We have packed this speaker across the country to provide us tunes while on vacation and use it often at home with our 3 young kids, who enjoy spontaneous dance parties in whichever room of the house we are in. We often take it to the neighborhood pool which it has held up nicely for, even without being waterproof. The only negative I've found is that if you really pump up the volume the sound does get distorted. But for such a small speaker it does a great job, especially at the price point this comes in at.",

As is, the one solo speaker has impressive sound for its size. No, it doesn\u2019t have deep booming bass...it\u2019s a tiny tiny speaker. But the sound is quite good, and the ease of use plus how portable...total win. Maybe my favorite feature...it can be used plugged in or by it\u2019s built in battery.

You can barely hear it from 10 feet away when it kicks into this mode! It's extremely frustrating considering without use, just sitting on the counter without playing anything it loses charge in about 12 hours. Then, you plug the unit in and it doesn't bring the volume back up until it fully charges again, We ordered a second unit thinking it was defective but had the same problem the second time around.
