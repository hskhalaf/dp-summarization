Unfortunately the structure and durability of these are poor quality. I only bought these 5 months ago and obviously they were not cheap so I\u2019m very disappointed.",

I was a little skeptical about purchasing outside my normal and couldn't be happier with these headsets. The microphone works great in my online parties playing games with friends, they hear me loud and clear. You simply turn on the headset and sound is transferred to the headphones and when you turn them off the sound goes back to your normal speakers your using hooked up to your tv or console which in my case a sound bar. Games sound really good in these. I'm impressed and I highly recommend them to all PS4 gamers online or offline.",

The microphone is plenty clear for people to understand in game and it is easy to adjust microphone volume in the PS4 settings to compensate. The headphone app is a very cool feature and works like a charm for bass boosting. Again the sound quality is better than any headphones I\u2019ve purchased and they are well worth the price.",

Superb sound pick up as well. My voice is always crystal. Even if I have to whisper at night so the kids don\u2019t wake up! Battery life is great, even with kids messing to it I only have to charge every few days. They can definitely take a beating. Everyone knows it\u2019s lag\u2019s fault, but these things kept on ticking. That steel frame bends so it sort of absorbs the blow and is easy to bend back. 10/10 would buy again for ps4 gaming",

Left ear is completely dead - which is odd considering the left side buttons and charging ports still work fine. Should probably be a bit more durable given the price. Other downsides - Expect headaches while breaking in the rubber band if you have an adult-sized head.",

The plastic broke on mine so now it doesn\u2019t fit properly anymore. I suggest buying a different headset at a better price",
