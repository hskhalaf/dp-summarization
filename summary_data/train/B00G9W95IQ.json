These were much lighter weight than the old LL Bean ones, but they seemed to work fine for what I needed, which was compressing clothes (and a pillow) in my suitcase for a trip to Europe. Overall, I was very happy with their performance. However, in cranking down on the straps, one of the ladder locks broke, pretty much rendering that strap locked in place (the webbing strap won't release or tighten because of the break). Otherwise, I'd buy these again as I was happy with their performance.",
