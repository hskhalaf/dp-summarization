      "text": "Takes great pictures. This camera has everything I was looking for-- long zoom, good for close shots, not too heavy/bulky, HD video capability and much more. I also like that it uses lithium battery. I've had negative experiences with rechargeable AA type batteries, even the pricey ones. The li battery on this camera lasts and lasts. Feels good in my hands; just the right combination of functionality and carry-ability. This is my 3rd Olympus camera and I've been more than satisfied with all of them.",

I HIGHLY recomend this camera to everyone and especailly those that might not have as steady a hand as they would like.",

Very handy as no need to have a separate camera and videocam to take in any occasion. Wow, I'm amazed of this product.
