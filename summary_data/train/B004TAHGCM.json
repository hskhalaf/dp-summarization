So then we had to contact squaretrade which the warranty was through they had us ship them the speakers then was told they can\u2019t fix them do to overload but we found that to not be true cause the other 2 are still playing. So I advise you not to purchase these and the warranty is bull crap. SAVE YOUR MONEY!",
