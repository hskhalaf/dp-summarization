Within a week, my 7 year old is making his own circuits from the user guide(he had never touched circuits before). The guide is really easy to follow and starts at an easy level. The sample code is really well documented. I am going have to get another one as now my 6 year old wants to play too! Having their names come up on the LCD was like xmas! :) They cover the majority of basics, i do wish there were some capacitors and a couple more different resistors in the kit.

That being said, this is my first foray into physical computing, so I don't know that I would know the difference in quality. The instruction guide is pretty easy to follow, and the projects are great for beginners. I only wish that there was more information included on HOW the things work. I feel like knowing how circuits and electricity work is crucial to being able to branch out into my own projects instead of following someone else's step-by-step instructions. Other than that, a terrific kit for beginners interested is seeing what this is all about.",

It does not assume any significant prior experience with circuits although that certainly helps. This is good for an introduction to simple microprocessors connected to hardware.

The Kit comes with a DC motor (not sure of the actual specs assuming its 1.5v-3.0v 300+ mA) and is used on Circuit #10 in the instruction manual Arduino states minimum 6v for the UNO board. When connected to the USB on Your PC its only receiving 5v DC (minus losses can put You as low as 4 mine was 4.7v) this is enough to work up to this point. When You enter a speed into the Serial Monitor window the motor will try to start drawing on the board lowering the voltage to the point the Arduino board freezes. Hope this helps someone",

I found one mistake in of the circuit (the diode orientation is reversed), which a bit of challenge before I make it worked. But nonetheless I'm giving it a five star. Recommended to get you started. My suggestion to those who want to learn Arduino, get a starter kit like this and get also some other books on Arduino as complementary. Also if you're new to electronics I recommend this book  (Getting Started in Electronics by Forrest M. Mims III)",

It is 100% the Uno R3 board and made in Italy. You get everything in the picture, nothing more, nothing less. Got this for a school project and would recommend it as gifts for students who want to tinker with things. It is also good for anyone who likes to build things.",
