I had several different ones from various brands (including Martha Stewart brand) and after gong through the dishwasher they would collect water in the handle... coming in from where the whisk meets the handle. So the next time using the whisk (even days later), old water would drip down the whisk into the food you were making. This is the only whisk I have found that doesn't have that problem. I ended up replacing all my other whisks with these ones.",

This wires on this thing is made of stainless steel and feels super sturdy. My old, cheap whisk had wires tangling all up on each other like two love struck teenagers unlike this whisk. In addition, the grip is comfortable to hold and prevents slippage while you whisk. I've been using it to beat eggs, flours, etc. without a problem at all. Highly recommended!

I\u2019ve had random, cheap whisks where the wire in the whisk connects to the handle through openings that allow water to come in, only for it to not dry fully before I use it. Which means I would randomly sprinkle water into a bowl of dry ingredients while mixing, which became very annoying. It\u2019s also easy to store, since the wire is flexible without being too bendy.",

I have never owned any good whisks and have always used those ones you get in the \"bargain\" section at most department stores or mass merchandisers. I am not sure if the OXO brand is the best whisk you can get, but judging by the one I got, I would say it is definitely a brand well worth considering. The wires are not extremely rigid like the cheapies, but they don't feel like they are going to bend either. They have just the right amount of give to make whisking together ingredients a snap. Very pleased with my purchase.",

The OXO whisk doesn't trap water or leak which makes it worth recommending",
