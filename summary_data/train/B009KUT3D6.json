The driver software now lets you capture game activity. In other words, you can turn on this capture feature in the driver when you start to play a game and the software will create a perfect AVI video of all your game activity. I use this to capture the activity with my Phoenix Flight Simulator and it does a perfect job. Update: I bought this on 11-07-12 and it's 02-08-15. The video card is still going strong. The NVIDIA GeForce Experience software that comes with it is very good.",

I did extensive research, and found that this EVGA product (like all their others) has a great performance temp (42C) and would handle Skyrim quite nicely. I purchased this and put it on a system running the following: MSI B75MA-E33 Intel Core i3-3220 Corsair Vengeance 8 GB RAM Cooler Master eXtreme Power Plus 500w Power Supply Win 7 64x SanDisk Extreme SSD 120 GB Boots in 12 seconds, Runs Skyrim on Max Settings @ 1080p 60htz around 42C all day long.

Installing a new video board is a task NOT for the faint of heart. The board works as a port to the integrated graphics on the motherboard, but has NONE of the features of an accelerated graphics processor. I feel as though I've wasted $170, but it serves as a hard-earned and expensive lesson that upgrading hardware on a desktop computer system should be left to EXPERTS ONLY.",
