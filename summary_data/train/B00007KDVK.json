Speed drops off when distance increase to over 100 feet and there are ubstructing walls, including an exteriior stucco wall that has signal eating chicken wire. However, multiple machines are hanging and banging on this technology without incident. The best thing: NO MORE CABLES!",

Word of suggestion to reduce conflicts with XP: instead of following Linksys installation directions (CD software first then hardware) install the adapter first, let XP install wizard start-up and tell you when to run the CD. That way you install the drivers without installing all the proprietary software that can cause conflicts if you change wifi locations often. The seller described item correctly, it would not have been apparent that this was V2 instead V4 like I had previously.",

Then just slide it into your notebook's PC Card slot and enjoy network access with your notebook computer, while retaining true mobility. Once you're connected, you can keep in touch with your e-mail, access the Internet, and share files and other resources such as printers and network storage with other computers on the network, wherever you wander. At home, you can surf the web or use instant messaging to chat with friends while sitting out on the patio.You'll also be able to connect with any of the growing number of public wireless hotspots springing up in coffee shops, airport lounges, hotels and convention centers.
