The light color is white, not blue. Which is what we like. The installation took less than 10 minutes and was easy. I didn't even need to move the angle of the LEDs, they lined up properly with the plug-in. We have only used these for a few hours thus far. I'll try to update later.

I have a feeling this is why the light is bright to the sides but not so much down the road. These would be great if only they could fix the light scatter of these bulbs.

      "text": "Bought these in June for a 2006 Honda Pilot. From unboxing to installed & lit may have taken 10 minutes if that long. I wanted to wait several months to review to get a sense of durability & brightness. So far these LED headlights are excellent. They turn on instantly and illuminate well in all driving conditions. Light obviously is a crisp bright white light -- much better than the soft yellowish glow of the many incandescent lights I had used previously in this car. Frankly these were cheaper than the Ultra incandescents we had used previously. Will continue to update if or when reliability changes but these LED lamps far exceed expectations. Strongly recommend.",

      "text": "Bought these because we desired brighter low beams on our 2015 Prius. These are definitely NOT 200% brightness of the stock halogen bulbs. They may be brighter, but not twice as bright... Still couldn't see well while driving at night with these. Bought the Hikari Ultra ones, and they are BRIGHT!!! These ones (Cougar Motor) might be the right/maximum recommended brightness for a truck, where the light is projected from higher, to prevent blinding other drivers. The Hikari's are likely too bright for a higher vehicle, where these would likely be perfect.",

I am not a mechanic....and that's an understatement. I had these bulbs put in around 5 minutes. If they arent turning on...like with my case, they just have to be reversed because you may have the plug in reverse. 3) super bright and looks great. I love my car even more than I forst did with the factory halogen bulbs. They work....they are bright, easy plug and play and for a good price. There is no good reason to wait any longer. Get 'em!!",
