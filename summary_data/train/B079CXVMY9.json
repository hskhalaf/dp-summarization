I am a Realtor and not only work out of my car, but often have clients in it as well so I needed a solution that would keep all items handy but out of sight for a nice clean look. The fold over messenger style flap on this organizer is genius. Not only does it hide my items out of plain sight, but if I choose to take it out of the car with me it can pass as a messenger bag. It\u2019s a smaller size than others I\u2019ve seen but still holds everything I need it to. I highly recommend this.",

A simple knot fixed the problem, but a sliding lock or strap securing device would also be a handy fix. Regardless of the one trivial issue, I would highly recommend this organizer to anyone who has to have binders, notebooks, notepads, even laptops in their vehicle.",

It's affordable and is an excellent design for a busy person like me.
