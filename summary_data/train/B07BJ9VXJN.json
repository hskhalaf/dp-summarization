It's a wood and metal design which is nicer to look at than a bunch of plastic for a VERY good price. Perhaps people should look at the prices of things from the 1920's instead of always wanting things for free.",

The alignment of numbers is crooked and unless you press firmly, they come out illegible. If you're interested in buying this for aesthetic reasons and for personal use, it should work fine. I like the little stand it comes with. Pretty cute. I wouldn't buy this again though because I need it for more professional purposes. I'll be needing to buy a new stamp and keep this one because it's too much of a hassle to try to return.",
