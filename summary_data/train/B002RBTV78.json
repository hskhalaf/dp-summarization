As it melts, the Inside flows into your mouth. It is a voluptuous, soft, velvety, thick pudding-like milk chocolate center that flows into your mouth. It is a very sensual & enjoyable experience especially if you\u2019re a texture person. Delish times 100....!.",

There are many options from the rather sweet white chocolate to dark chocolate. I keep them in the fridge so they keep their freshness.

I resisted buying chocolates from Amazon in the summer, but thought I'd give it a try once I read a few recent reviews that said that melting was not a continuing issue. They were right. Not sure if the manufacturer, dealer, or Amazon should take the credit for the packaging, but it was handled well. For this order, the box received was the original retail packaging. I'm not sure if that was the case on previous orders, but the product quality and taste has always been consistently great.",

Anyway, I did not know exactly what to give them for an Easter gift and I was looking on Amazon and I saw this box of Truffles and thought: Perfect! So, I ordered it and put them in a really cute basket and OMG! They went crazy!! They were so excited, I think they had eaten about 10 of them by the time I came back out from having my cavity filled (talk about irony!). I love Lindt LINDOR Truffles and this is a great way to give the gift of truffles to a large group without paying a large price!",

They\u2019re that good. And kudos to Amazon on shipping. Inside the cardboard box was a small styrofoam ice chest and inside that were the 2 boxes of chocolates I ordered \u2014 and a frozen gel pack to keep them cool. Since Lindor truffles melt very easily, I appreciated them taking those measures to make sure they didn\u2019t melt while sitting in a hot delivery truck. They arrived perfectly intact.",
