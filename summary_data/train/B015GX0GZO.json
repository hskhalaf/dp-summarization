When it arrived, this one seemed to be much better quality than prevoius one. Handle was much tighter. Already used it several times (probably close to a bushel of apples) and quite pleased with the replacement so far.

This product is great, and I really love that I can use it on any flat surface. I have only two small issues with it: the suction only stays on for an apply or two before needing to be re-suctioned (which isn't a big deal), and if you have a bruise (or a softer part) on the apple, the blade has a hard time peeling nicely in that spot. Not big deals, in my opinion. Otherwise, it peels nicely...it cores easily...and it slices like a dream. Can't wait to try peeling potatoes!",

The shaft is so short that the peeler blade can easily cut your fingers badly when you attach the apple, and you can only attached medium-sized apples. The peeler only peels the first half of the apple, and then gouges the same place over and over until the apple is a mess. It doesn't make even slices; some slices are paper thin and others are the right thickness. The peeler itself is so light weight that even if it worked, it would break within a year of usage. Buy a cast-iron peeler if you plan to do a lot with it.",

Took seconds to peel core and slice my gala apple. The skin shavings had almost no flesh on them and the core function took just what it needed not leaving behind seed etc. Turning was very easy, no muscle needed. After reload from counter and washed. It is small so storing it is easy for quick use. Not sure about longevity of blade but it is replaceable so not an issue.",

It cleans up easily and quickly and I am happy with the product.

We go through alot of apples my 2 daughters will eat 2 or 3 at a time but only of they are peeled, cored, and sliced thinly- they're 5 and 2 so I'll make the concession to get them to eat fruit.

The efficiency of peeling, coring, and slicing all at once with the turn of a handle allowed me to prep apples for applesauce in 10 minutes before work. They are currently cooking in a crockpot and I cannot wait to try the finished product when I get home. I rate the product quality a 5 out of 5! The only negative feedback I have is that the color was a little duller than what it looked like online. I thought it would be a shinier candy apple red and it was more of a flat red. Still love the functionality!",

I suggested this particular peeler to a friend before I used it. Her peeler was broke and never could peel an apples. She sent it back.",
