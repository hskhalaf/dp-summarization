The \"darts\" are not darts at all but weighted missiles that have a tendency to bounce out of the target area so you need to really aim well and develop the correct technique for success. The pieces seem to be well made and they are safer to use around small children and pets than the old styled darts.",

Keep an eye on the kids, the darts can become a weapon if you get hit with one. The only negative are the target circles. They are plastic tubing folded and stuffed into the tote bag. The kinks will not come out to make a circular hoop to aim at and will not lay flat on the lawn. There goes the fun of the game. I'm going to buy 2 Hula hoops and give that a try.",

I like the sturdiness of them and they really work great and their loads of fun.
