It does not take much for this to work. and I say that because if you use too much you will turn your entire lawn brown. NOT GOOD. IT took over 3 weeks for the crabgrass to die off, but it did in those spots and i will use it again in the other spots. I didnt spray it all over the lawn because I wanted to test it first.

So I tried Green Light last year and was very pleased with how effective it was with just the first application. I do two applications about a week apart and it totally knocks out the mid to late summer crabgrass. I have found that putting a little dish soap, like Dawn, in my pressure sprayer with the herbicide makes a big difference. The soap acts as a surfactant that allows the herbicide to better absorb into the leaves.",

Keep your expectations in check - fully grown mid-summer crabgrass will not die off of one application alone. Cutting the target areas really low will help. I applied this liberally to crabgrass after a fresh mowing and noticed a good 80% of the spray areas were starting to die after a day or two. The best part about of this product is that is doesn't kill the grass along with it. I'm glad I took a chance of this product and the product should last a while at 3oz. per application. For the record I have a northern lawn, mostly fescue.",

I did four stronger than recommend applications of this product spaced out every week and a half and it literally had zero effect. My best guess is this product is dye and water. The one thing I can assure though is this product does not contain a drop of Quinclorac in it. Complete scam.",

      "text": "Great product. Did my research and this one has 2, 4D (weed killer) at 7.3% and quinclorac (crabgrass killer) at 3.5%. Higher percentage than other name brands and cheaper. I had lots of weeds including crabgrass in my backyard - emerald zoysia. Mixed as directed and sprayed with a tank sprayer, one week later I'm almost completely weed free. Very pleased with results. There aren't that many different weed killers available, most are strength variations of these two chemicals. I suspect negative reviews are those who didn't follow directions exactly. I couldn't be happier.",
