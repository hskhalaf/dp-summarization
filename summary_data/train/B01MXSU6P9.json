It takes four #2032 round batteries that are Included. Be sure to turn it it off since it stays on until you slide the switch,. Picture is previous method holding small unlit mirror. Do not buy if you want your daughter to continue to completely depend on you to help her get ready!",

It met my expectations with one exception having to do with its design, which I failed to notice until it was delivered: the mirror is lighted on the side that is not magnified. Since I was buying it specifically for the lighted magnifying side, this was disappointing. If your use will primarily be the regular mirror, then you will love it. Customer service for this product is excellent. I received a follow up email to ensure I was happy with the product, and had a great exchange with one of the company\u2019s owners.
