When the labels were removed from the board not all of the sticker came off and without ruining it even more some of the sticker are covering parts of the board that are meant to be colored.",

There are a few knobs on one end which \"clip\" into holes on the other end of the binding strap. The holes are too big and the binding just pops right open even with no foot in the binding. Junk. The board also had a big gash in the bottom and a bunch of smaller scratches on it. The label was also taped on like it had been removed. It seems like the board had been used and returned. I sent it back. Not happy.",
