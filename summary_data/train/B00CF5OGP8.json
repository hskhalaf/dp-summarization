      "text": "It's a great, cheap bag. It holds a ton of gear. But be _very careful_ when you pack it! Make sure all heavier gear (e.g., camera body, wide-angle lenses) are packed at the bottom. Things like flashes should be on top of those, and only very light items (e.g., remote triggers, flash sync cables) packed at the top. Otherwise, the outermost zipper (pictured) will open as soon as you put on the pack. The zipper just doesn't handle any kind of resistance. You get what you pay for. I'm still using it; don't get me wrong. But you should be aware of this before you potentially lose an expensive piece of kit falling out.",

The \"adjustable\" dividers are also angled to fit the taper of the bag, so even if your gear managed to fit in the bag, you can't reconfigure the dividers significantly. Realistic internal dimensions of camera gear compartment, at opening: 14.5\" H x 12\" W at bottom x 4.5\" Deep at bottom. At the top it is only 2.75\" Deep. They claim 7.8\" Internal. Even if they gave correct dimensions, this would be poor choice as it is almost non adjustable to the size of your gear.",

Overall it\u2019s a good value for the money, but probably not up to being your main camera bag if you\u2019re a pro and/or have a lot of expensive and delicate equipment.

If you plan to do heavy backpacking then maybe you been the more robust model. But I don\u2019t and this works great. Nice insides, functional and versatile design. My only question is how long the tripod holder will last befor the material starts to rip or fail. But then I\u2019ll jist buy a new one at this price.",

I wouldn't want to go on hike with this much gear, but for my every day needs, its perfect. I do think the shoulder pads are stitched on a bit weakly, but if they do fail, I'm sure I can either get them repaired by any good seamstress/luggage repair shop, or if I really want to, buy another bag since they're pretty inexpensive.",

The straps - one across the chest, and another across the lower midriff, are intelligently placed and have quick-release connections.
