      "text": "Amazing sound and value! I've contemplated Bluetooth speakers such as Bose, but this fits my on-the-go needs better with its easy carabiner attachment for clipping to packs while backpacking, camping, and boating - hence the waterproof feature is essential although I haven't really tested its H20 limits. Beyond the convenient Bluetooth connectivity, it also has an (out) aux sound chord for plugging into other none-Bluetooth capable devices such as older iPods. I use mine for connecting to my iPhone or older iPod for on-the-go movie time while camping. There is a reason I see this device sold everywhere - it's got more sound per pound. Would recommend and buy again.",

I'm still using it thanks JBL for good quality!!!",

This speaker has displayed all of the mentioned features without fail, and has even been soaked with me in the pouring rain and continues to play my favorite music as well as ever. Well worth the price, and you cant go wrong with JBL.",

Big enough sound to ride with traffic or just the waves. Only downfall is battery. So far it lasted about 9-10 hrs on \"on and off\" play. The battery on the meter showed about 750mAh.

Then I saw the Clip 2 on sale and took a gamble. JBL has redeemed themselves! The Clip 2 works flawlessly for the most part, and the battery lasts longer than the manufacturer claims. You don't get much range out the Bluetooth though...maybe 20 feet, and the buttons are difficult to find. Anytime I get a call, I'm always fumbling to find the answer button, or the off button, or the volume buttons.. A nice addition to future models would be a really small display to show callers name, battery level, Bluetooth range, etc.",

Contrary to other reviews, I like the on and off sounds JBL uses on their speakers - they let you know you've turned the device on or off. I would definitely recommend.

I purchased this bluetooth speaker after reading all the glowing reviews of how fantastic it was. I'm guessing either 98% of reviewers here have no clue what good sound quality is, or I was sent yet another made in China garbage that seems to be in abundance lately on Amazon. Seriously considering not renewing Prime and paying more at local stores if I keep getting sent poorly made, low quality items. If you are looking for a decent, potrable bluetooth speaker, keep looking. This one sounds as bad as you would expect from a small speaker.",

I would say better than average indoors, but not going to support anyone else riding with you. Will probably buy another for my husband's to use while we're out.",

Seems to work for now. But really how could u mail me a defective cord I haven't even used once!!! Not good for shadowing for the quality of this thing. Bad bad bad. As I'm checking the reviews there seems to be a lot of negatives.. even though it shows an average of over 4 stars....suspect...luckily I have no intentions of this thing lasting me more than 2 months",

Its not that uneven sound where the bass overpowers everything else or theres not enought bass, no. This speaker was built very well! It actually looks a bit stylish too. I havent tested it in the rain or anything yet. I prettymuch baby it. When it rains I cover it with my rain gear lol I dont want to hurt it! But im sure itll work just as good. I have had jbl products in the past and they ALWAYS deliver",
