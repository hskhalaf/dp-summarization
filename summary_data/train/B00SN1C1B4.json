That being said it scratches fairly easy, and is hard to take off. In addition I've noticed some cracks along the edges of the case. I've never dropped or had any pressure placed on my Macbook. Also the lid portion of the cover is not very secure from the corners, which allows dust to get trapped within the case. Love the design, but its not worth $50 - $60 dollars.",

It's nice to put Polaroid photos on the inner side of the case and stickers come off very easier from the case and doesn't leave residue! The only downside is that the top portion is a little heavy and, if you're like me, and lounge in different positions, sometimes the screen will lean back.",

I feel confident that it'll protect against scrapes and minor bumps, but I don't think it'll do much for a major fall. It was easy to put on, it just clips in place - but I can already tell it'll be an absolute nightmare to try and get off. The case didn't come with any instructions, either, which I'm sure will prove to be problematic in a year or two when I go to replace it.",

The only annoyance, is the case kinda prevents the fan from running super effectively, so if your playing graphically intense games (Steam) or watching video in 4K, it may get a little noisy. The perfect fix for this is just to put any old book under the computer and that completely fixes the problem. I am keeping the case, it is way better than any of those cheap plastic cases you can get.",
