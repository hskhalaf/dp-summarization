      "text": "This camera is a lot of fun, although recording with no display on the back took some getting used to for certain applications. I bought it for scuba diving and didn't realize at first you'll need the separate dive housing from gopro to get clean images. The included housing works fine underwater, but makes the image very blurry. No blur problems using the cam with the included housing in above water but wet environments though! I glued the included housing to the top of my car to take some fun videos.",
