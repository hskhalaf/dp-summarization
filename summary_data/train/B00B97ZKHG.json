      "text": "I should review items more often. This Acer Projector lost me. I thought I was getting a fair deal when I bought it in April 2014. It started having problems in October 2015. $500.00 for a year and a half. The picture was good and I liked the 2D/3D feature but spending that much money on a product that is going to fail in a year and a half seems like poor quality from the manufacturer. I looked into repair and they sent an email asking for $255.00 plus the cost of sending the projector to them. I'm buying a different projector instead and recommending to everyone not to buy Acer. Companies shouldn't be rewarded for underpriced poor quality products.",

After doing all the research i decided to buy the Acer H5370BD - a 720p resolution PJ and today I absolutely do not regret on my decision, I do not see any reason to go for a 1080p PJ. This serves the purpose of a human eye fantastically well. An absolute value for money PJ!!!",

Could be related to SBS 3D movies, yet to try 3D Blu Ray. So a point less there. Even the fan noise isnt really a distraction when placing the projector on a table.
