Whipped Caviar is a gorgeous shade, definitely one of my favorite from NYX, I'm just saying the image shown for it is not accurate whatsoever. It is, however, a gorgeous color. Goes on a smooth matte and stays in place. I love it!",

It's a nice color, just don't assume it looks anything like the photo - do a google image search for the true shade. Bloody Mary is a fantastic bright red with pink tones that is the perfect summer red. I wish the texture of the lipstick was a little more creamy, it drags a bit upon application, but it feels nice when on.",

Lipstick, like shoes, should be bought in person. I probably would have passed on this color. I do like the price. The price is excellent.",

A true brown, that covers lip pigmentation well, but still looks natural and chic. Perfect for a bold eye. Doesnt even need a lip pencil to tweak the color. Gonna get more. ignore the picture. is a milk chocolate, matte brown. I like how its subtle enough that it looks like my natural lip color. there is a better representation of the actual color on the NYX website. #NYX fan",

Lol The only slight complaint I would have is that even when dry it does transfer a bit and over about five hours it's time to reapply. So maybe use a lip gloss or carry it with, just be prepared. But overall definitely one of my go to brands and colors.",
