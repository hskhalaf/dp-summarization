I kept having to renew it, so finally decided to buy it. It's really easy to follow and we've both learned a lot. A great book if you are unsure if you are going to enjoy Latin or not or are intimidated about getting started. It's laid out very well for a beginner. I wish he had follow-up editions!",

While logically teaching the language, it gives the student a feeling of success through each lesson. Everything logically builds. My student has progressed past the middle of the book now. Not only does she translate Latin to English, but now also she is able to translate English to Latin. Of course these are simple sentences. I have one question - there seems to be no second volume! Does anyone have a suggestion for what I should use after we complete this book?",

Rather, while teaching Latin, he reviews elemenatry English grammar as you go along. This is done to ensure the reader understands basic concepts. The on-line audio links that accompany the book are especially helpful. These eliminate any questions about how words and sounds should be pronounced. A great starter book! Perfect for the beginner, adult, or just younger student who is interesting in learning something about the Latin language. Excellent!",

This results in the premature introduction of exceptions and irregularities that make the study, for me, more difficult and confusing. The Linney text on the other hand, starts with simple, regular form vocabulary and reinforces the normal forms and rules firmly first and then gradually introduces the irregularities. Suits my style of learning very well.",

I know how to speak Spanish, so the verb conjugation style was familiar to me. This book does a wonderful job simplifying components and gradually adding new material. I would have like more of the common vocabulary words to be included regularly instead of just every once in a while. I also think it would be helpful to include a list of the latin roots of words - the building blocks of all the romantic languages.",

The slow pace is great for younger students and builds confidence (older students can work faster if they wish) but the major pedogogical innovation is how the book introduces grammar and vocabulary slowly and most of the book uses only first declension nouns and first conjugation verbs (except for sum and possum) which eliminates the paralysis that can affect an English-speaking student encountering the rather more complex system of declension and conjugation characteristic of Latin. A fantastic book, all around.",
