The extra thickness added to the sole area is especially sweet. Hiking or snow boots tend to run a bit large, so a boot sock is usually thicker. If you're looking for a super thick sock to wear in a heavier boot, these won't fit that bill. These fit like a standard sock but with extra cushion on the bottom. However if you're looking for a delightfully WARM and super SOFT wool sock, look no further. I'm definitely going to buy several more packages as gifts.",

That doesn\u2019t bother me. It has no effect on the functionality or comfort of the socks. They really are very nice socks.

Plus they\u2019re high elastic so some might think they\u2019re too tight to be comfortable but they wrap about mid calf and stay there. What was more pleasant was the bonus zip packaging it came in with as well as a gifted scarf. Just what I needed for my travels.",

I wear a women's size 6 and felt like these were great and could fit larger feet. I'm used to wearing baggy socks since I have small feet. I think these will be great year round socks. I usually use SmartWool and Lululemon socks for outdoorsy things but I found these had a bit more thickness to keep my feet comfortable against the rigidness of my shoes.",
