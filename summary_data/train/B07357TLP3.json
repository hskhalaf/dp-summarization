      "text": "I was excited to get this, as it had great reviews - but I was REALLY disappointed! First of all, not even close to being worth $85! It's not that great of quality at all. Second, the blanket does not attach. In fact, it arrived unattached. It has a strap and it literally doesn't fit around the blanket. It's SO poorly made. Also, the blanket itself has a velcro attachment to keep it rolled up, but the blanket is so junky the velcro immediately started tearing the threads on it. Honestly, do yourself a favor and pick something else. It's not durable. Returning.",

Unfortunately, i would never serve anyone a glass of wine in a dollar store plastic cup. Very upset about the GLASSES being PLASTIC. If i could recommend one thing with this product make sure your descriptions ARE ACCURATE..... and for almost 80$ its a rip off i could have bought an authentic wicker all in 1 picnic basket and it would look hella better",

The plates did not have the design on them that was pictured, and the cutting board is more so a block of wood compared to the carved one in the picture. The cutlery does have the wood handle. Overall it's a nice backpack and I think it makes for a nice gift. I like the backpack design and it appears sturdy.",
