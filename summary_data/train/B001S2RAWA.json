The best way to describe my use of them is as a novice woodworker, so I haven't really put them through any grueling tests but they've definitely proved themselves as a great value. They're not as solid as my rockler tongue and groove cutter bit set but they also cost less and you get way more of them. Overall, I feel like I definitely got more than I paid for... for once in my life. I recommend these to anyone even if you only use half of the bits.",

I've put a total of about 30 minutes of actual cutting time spread over 3 or 4 of them. So far they are all working fine in softwood and hardwood as well. For a newbie router owner it's hard to pass up a set of 15 bits for the price of 1 or 2 Bosch or Freud-brand bits. 4 stars for value. The wood box they come in is handy, not excellent quality but good enough. I'll update this review in 6 months or a year after extended usage.",

For the price, i guess you can't really go wrong or lose a lot. The positive reviews helped me purchase. If you're starting out and just want some bits to explore with, then this is your set. As 4 starts indicate \"I like it\" but I don't \"love it\" but I don't expect much more for the money. Happy woodworking.",
