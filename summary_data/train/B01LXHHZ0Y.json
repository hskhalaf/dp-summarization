      "text": "Come with a nice presentation case. Knife is sharp, very sharp. Like most knives with a steel blades, wash by hand, rinse and dry immediately. Do not throw in the dishwasher and do air dry. If you don't, you'll end up with small rust stains, where the water droplets air-dried. BTW, I have a fairly extensive extensive collection of Wusthof Classic Creme knives. I didn't purchase the Wusthof carving knife and fork set, which sells for over $200, This set matches the Wusthof knives perfectly! Few people will know these are not Wusthof knives unless the inspect the stamped writing on the blade.",
