      "text": "I previously purchased two sets of this Landmann rack, have been using them for probably 6-7 years, and they have held up well including an occasional bump as I have backed into them with my pickup. Each end on previous versions were however one solid piece of tubing. In the new version I have received, each end comes in three pieces -- the top upside down U and then the two legs, each making up half the total height, that you have to put together with screws. This is not called out in Amazon's description of the product.",

I had to add support to both sides of the rack in order to keep from losing my stack. once I burn thru the wood on this rack I'm sure they will be worth nothing more than scrap metal.

I am impressed with the guage of steel for the posts compared to others I saw. We put a good amount of wood on a 10' span of 2x4's and it is working great. I would recommend the sturdy canvas cover to keep the wood dry and protected, plus it's just nicer to look at if it's in a high visible area.",
