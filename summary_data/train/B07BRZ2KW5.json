      "text": "I replaced my Xfinity-rented box with this great device. It was very easy to install and setup, and works fine. The cable company's box had only 2.4 GHZ wifi, but the Motorola also does 5GHZ. The average wired connection to my PC clocks at 110-120 Mbps/s, which has not changed with the new box (I didn't expect it to) but with my phone and tablet switched to 5GHZ Wifi, wireless connections went from the high 20's/Mbps on 2.4GHZ to the high 60's/Mbps, a substantial difference. The monthly modem rental fee was up to $14 lately, so the expense is a no-brainer; I should have done it sooner.",

Still more than enough speed to stream HD video on multiple devices simultaneously. Was on the phone for about 10 minutes with Xfinity. They disabled their router and activated mine. I was on hold longer than the process actually took. Overall pretty painless. Just returned the Xfinity router, so I'll be glad to see the $14 monthly lease fee gone on my next bill.",
