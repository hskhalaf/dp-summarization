      "text": "My 12 year old tabbies were getting a bit too round around the middle and the vet suggested I try changing up their food. I initially tried a very expensive, all-protein brand that had an ingredients list out of an Atkins-Diet handbook. I figured it would be great. Turns out, not so much. The cats loved it, but even with their portions well-controlled, the weight only increased. It wasn't until I changed to the Nutro Weight Loss formula last year that I began seeing results. All of my cats lost a few pounds each and their activity increased accordingly (and I'm happy because this stuff is about $20 less per bag than the all-protein stuff was).",

No tummy problems, and we think their fur is feeling softer than it used to. Hard to say if it's helping with their weight yet or not.",
