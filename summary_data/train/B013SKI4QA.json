However, usb cable is relatively cheap just keep in mind to purchase it while you purchase the printer, so you're not stuck waiting and additional couple of days. It comes with a black and color cartridge and the printer itself is very easy to set up. If your computer doesn't have a disk player to download the software (I have a tablet with a keyboard), it's ok because you can just download the software from the company's site which is linked to you in the instructions manual.",
