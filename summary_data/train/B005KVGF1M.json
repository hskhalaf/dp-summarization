After a few weeks they started talking about how bad their clothes smelled after washing them, we noticed it also and the common denominator was this laundry detergent. We all tried different detergents and all our laundry smells good again. The smell was somewhere between wet dirty dog and vomit so unless you are into that smell I would stay away from this one. Sorry!!",

If you sprinkle over the laundry it\u2019ll leave marks. I toss the package the detergent comes in. If you use cold water there will be marks left all over your laundry. I did have a great reaction as I haven\u2019t broken out in a rash or hives. My clothes do feel clean and it\u2019s great for underwear. I wouldn\u2019t recommend or buy again though.",

The scent is wonderful, and I like more bio-friendly products, so this seemed to be a natural choice. My biggest issue with this product, however, is that the pods either do not completely dissolve or they dissolve but lodge on the clothing, especially in cold water. I will take clothing out of the dryer only to find that a chunk of detergent stuck to the clothes during the wash cycle and now is hardened like plaster. I don't think I would recommend these or buy them again.",

Happy to have the beautiful Vetiver scent back! Our family has gone through so many detergents, I\u2019ve lost count. We finally found the Vetiver scent and fell in love, until recently. I ordered about a week ago and the Vetiver pods we received had a floral/vanilla scent, which is no where near the usual crisp earthy scent we\u2019re used to.

The scent is not as potent as it once was and is also a bit different. I think less essential oils are used as a cost-cutting measure, blah.

Not good review because plastic bags don\u2019t disappear in water, I was finding plastic in clothes many times even after washing in warm/hot water (plastic was found in folds of clothes). I started to open the plastic bag all the time after but the detergent itself sometimes was still visible after washing, mostly was stuck in fluffy materials (like coat hoods, small fluffy rugs), meaning that ingredients are not mixing with water very well. Also, plastic is not good for you, particles may stay in clothes. Will switch to non-plastic bag solution.",

Every once in a while one will get stuck in somewhere and not disintegrate entirely but honestly it's a rare occasion and can happen with any pod but with liquid pods that can be more of a disaster than these powder kinds. The scent sticks on clothes even through the dryer. I have been using this for over a year and get a bit panicked when we are down to 10 loads left!!",

You may love the lavender over vetiver scent but I do love the vetiver more, to each his own as the saying goes.",
