Contacted DJI support but they could not come up with a solution, advised me to send it back to Amazon. Waiting for a refund. The second replacement drone would not stop beeping. Contacted DJI support. They said configure the joysticks, that stopped it beeping until you switched it off and back on again. They could not come up with a solution. I have sent it back to Amazon. So DJI need to get the software sorted. Avoid ..... keep your money in your pocket.",

Would definitely recommend this as your first drone or if you want to upgrade from the mini",

Comes with sore propellers and everything you else you need to get flying right away. Really easy to use and I\u2019m loving flying it. Image quality is spot on!",

The thing is, the Mavic Air 2 makes that look like a kiddies toy. Nearly impossible to crash with tones of clever features which make your videos look amazing. I easily get 30+ mins flying time or of the battery and it's so quiet compared to other drones. If this is you reaching reviews looking for a drone, get this or the new DJi mini 2. Both have the same feature set but the mini looks like it may suffer in the wind. This doesn't BTW.",

I believe some TV news channels now use the air 2 and that comes as no surprise at all. The power of the camera is simply amazing. Yeah it wont give you the same control a \u00a310,000 drone will give you but it is stunning what it can do! Money well spent. I bought a flymore package ;) Worth every single penny",
