This item has been one of the greatest additions to my winter wardrobe. It keeps my neck warmer than scarves do, and I can hide my face when people cough around me. The only downsides are (1) the fleece smells a bit dusty or like chemicals-- even after washing, and I notice it when I cover my mouth/nose, and (2) my glasses fog up when I cover my mouth/nose.",

Of course you may have to wear more to stay warm if you're not doing a lot of physical activity.
