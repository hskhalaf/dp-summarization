My hair is mostly fine, straight, silky, and shiny, except where it\u2019s wavy, coarse, damaged, and grey. I used to use a flat iron to smooth out the crown, but it left my hair limp and lifeless. This brush gives my hair the smoothness I\u2019m looking for, but also body and bounce. It\u2019s not stick straight, but it also doesn\u2019t look like anchor woman hair. It\u2019s easy to use, all you do is brush your hair. Just make sure your hair is completely dry, and don\u2019t forget to use a heat protectant.",

It has a great digital display that says OFF anytime it\u2019s plugged in and then you just press ON and the + or - for the temperature. She\u2019s growing out a perm and it glides through her hair once easily and was almost blowout straight. She\u2019s never styled her hair and she figured this out in a few minutes. So it\u2019s great for anyone who is new to hair tools. And she also said it didn\u2019t get too hot on her scalp.",

I'm still trying to figure out best way to clean in between the bristles but it's not a big deal.

That being said, this is a really good value for those of us that don't buy expensive blowdryers/etc on principle. It gets hair looking smoother and straighter in less than 5 minutes.

Instead of starting underneath like I do with the iron, I just sectioned my hair in smaller pieces and combed through normally. I started underneath and finished on top. I am pleased with how straight it got, almost no wave is visible. I can't say that with the hot iron. I recommend Googling videos on how others used it. This helped me a lot.",
