Trust me when I say these are the only way to cut the nail far enough without hurting yourself or paying a lot of money to have a doctor use the same tool. The price may seem quite steep compared to the traditional nail clippers, but these clippers seem to be incredibly well built as well, and I'd expect them to last a lifetime.",

The clippers are very sharp and cut well but I find them a little awkward to work with. I will keep them and continue to use them but only on the most difficult nails. Outside of my awkwardness in using them I think they're pretty good.",
