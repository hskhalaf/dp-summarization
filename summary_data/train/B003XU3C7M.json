That piece has a slight taper to it so you can choose from two heights depending on which end you use. Then place the top blade back onto the main. The last step which is to drill a hole through the upper and put a 1/8\" or so bolt and nylon nut....Enjoy!",

      "text": "This is the second one we've bought. For the price we figured, why not. But the same problem keeps happening...the part where the two blades connect keeps wearing away-when that happens it's useless. It no longer blends. I'm not doing anything crazy with it...just smoothies and protein shakes on a fairly regular basis. So disappointed. The first one lasted 10 months, and the second one lasted less. Now I'm in search of another blender...perhaps I can convince the hubs to finally spring for the Vita mix! \ud83d\ude01",

After about 1 year of wrestling it daily, the upper blade stopped catching on the post so it just floats without grinding, effectively leaving only the lower blade = even less effective. Finally I'm replacing it with a low-end Oster like I used to have, which at least blended well even if it had similar problems handing volume.",

      "text": "I had low expectations, like really low. I had a much nicer (read expensive) blender that I was gifted and it couldn't do what I needed. I need three things from a blender: hummus, smoothies, and margaritas. I made hummus the day I got this and it was amazing, zero issues with the hummus (60 seconds top and that's will adding my extras). I made mango sorbet with frozen mango and coconut milk perfectly blended with no problems. Haven't tried the margaritas but don't foresee that being an issue. I've been tossing it into the dishwasher after rinsing it and haven't had any issues so far. For just under $30 buy it for goodness sakes!",

I believe this product had been opened and possibly used before I got it (I was purchasing brand-new).",

It crushes ice to my satisfaction, about the same as any other blender out there- no better or worse. The problem is that after 6 months, the blender stopped working. At first it started only working if you pressed down on the button really, really hard. It required so much pressure to get it to work, that even my husband had difficulty getting it to work. Then it stopped working all together. I am very disappointed and will not buy another ninja.",
