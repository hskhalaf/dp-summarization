We have a 24' pontoon boat and docked up to a friends ski boat this weekend and they did an amazing job protecting both our boats during waves from the high volume holiday weekend boating traffic. If anything ever happens to these, I will order them again in a heartbeat. They were less expensive than what I saw at Walmart and the local marina and they arrived really quickly. They also come with good quality ropes too, so that was a bonus! Get them, you'll be glad you did.",

I also found out They float. I highly recommend these fenders.",
