It is a great size for us and I especially liked that it came with its own cart so you don't have to worry about counter space. It is easily removable, however, if you don't need the stand. Our popcorn comes out great and smells just like the theater. We use butter flavored coconut oil and add Flavacol before putting the popcorn kernels in. Our popcorn has come out perfectly every time. The machine is also easy to clean, and when not in use, it doubles as a unique decoration in our movie themed den.",

My only dislike is I wish you can adjust the lid to allow more steam to escape. Because of this the popcorn isn't as crunchy as I would like. Also one of the spokes broke off.",
