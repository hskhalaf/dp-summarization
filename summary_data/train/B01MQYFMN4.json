This could mean death in the event of a fire. The rungs seem to be sturdier than the Kidde brand and easier to put back together after deployed. The image on the phamplet doesn't match the actual item.",

We just made sure it fit our window and it seems like it will be much easier to use than some of the other models out there which require you to unfold them. The window bracket on this one is all one piece and made of sturdy metal. We practised an emergency exit scenario with my daughter and I think she will be able to use this ladder on her own much easier than the folding models. I'm very satisfied with this purchase. Hopefully we'll never have to use it but its good to know it's there.",

While you never want to have to escape out a window, I feel so much better knowing we have a way out if the need arises.",
