The Puma Ignite Dual NightCat offers exceptional comfort, solid arch support, excellent cushioning, and the kind of flexibility that runners look for in a well-cushioned shoe. Additionally, the very reasonable price and the simple, yet elegant look only makes this shoe even more attractive to runners of different levels.",

      "title": "Great running shoe!! Amazing price!",
      "text": "Love these shoes!! First of all, I bought my first pair of Puma running shoes just a few mornths before these and I was blown away! I had bought these in a Men's Size 7 by accident and had to return for a Men's size 7.5 as I am a Women's size 9. They are the perfect size, fit, and great for running! I run outside not on treadmills so I cannot attest to how they feel on machines. These are so comfy and have a great inner sole integrity! You will not be disappoint just remember they are Men's shoes so you will have to go 1 - 1.5 sizes down!",
