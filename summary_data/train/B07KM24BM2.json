Also the remote did not work. We cut a finger on this thing. Most other brands are totally enclosed in a cage like design - we sent this one back and got one of those instead. Save yourself the hassle and order the better designed ones the first time.",

The cage keeps it protected and there are detectors to avoid side collision so it flies in the open space in your room. The only thing is don\u2019t throw it up too close to the ceiling as the motion of the air will trap it against the ceiling as it ascends. However just push the one button remote and it\u2019ll slowly descend and land on the ground.",

They\u2019re so cheaply made that they broke almost instantly. They don\u2019t hold a charge whatsoever and propellers and pieces of plastic in different spots broke in all three!
