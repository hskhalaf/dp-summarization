If Fila fans adored the supportive build of the original model, they might find the modified Axilus 2 more appealing. Fila tweaked on the fitting and upper design a bit to enhance the shoe\u2019s breathability and improve its comfort feel. The brand also kept the hallmark features of the flagship all-court trainer, so it remains to be supportive. It\u2019s one of the extremely affordable trainers backed by an outsole durability guarantee.",

They're not uncomfortable, but there are more comfortable shoes to choose from. But they are fast on the court because they're low to the ground and lightweight. I usually have to buy New Balance because I have wide feet. These shoes fit my wide feet just fine. I also like the 6 month guarantee on the soles. I will look at Fila shoes each season when it's time to buy new shoes.",
