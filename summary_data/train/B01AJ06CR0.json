      "text": "I am in my twenties and suffered greatly from chapped lips since I can remember back in Pre-K. My lips would be chapped even during the summer months. I was constantly picking at my lips and making them bleed. Once I started using this scrub I noticed an immediate difference after just the first use. I continued to use it everyday for about 4 days. Now I can get away with only using it 2-3 times a week. It leaves my lips feeling silky smooth which is something I\u2019ve never experienced before. After using this scrub I follow up with Jack Back lip balm to seal in the moisture. Great product. Would recommend to others.",

A lot of other lip scrubs are a lot more dry and have larger chunks of sugar to exfoliate with; however, this sugar scrub has a finer grain of sugar and has a more oily consistency. I prefer this because afterwards my lips not only feel smooth and soft, but they also feel moisturized. An added bonus is the fantastic smell that lingers on the lips for a short period after. All in all my favorite lip scrub so far.",

At first I thought the texture was not rough enough but I added a bit more onto my lips and got the right consistency for me. A little does still go a long way and it smells great.",
