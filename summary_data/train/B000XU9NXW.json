It looks great It's lightweight The caribiner is cool and you can open paint cans with it very well. Bad The pliers will hurt you. Might not be today, might not be tomorrow, but one day you'll be gripping something kinda hard and they'll close real fast. They close tight and the skin on your palm will get caught so hard it will turn into a blood blister. Huge problem in my opinion. USE WITH CAUTION",

The Skeletool my seem like it has a limited number of tool attached to it but for normal use what it has covers 90% of what you would need. Its light its functional the blade is accessible without opening the tool (amazing feature). From my personal uses I've yet to break one and I've had to have one not be up to the task at hand. An amazing tool that i cant speak highly enough of. If you in the market for an EDC multi-tool this is my top of the list pick.",

With warmer weather came lighter clothing (shorts), and I find that the 5 oz Skeletool carries very well. I also carry a Micra on my keychain, which gives me scissors, a small file, and a small flathead screwdriver. Interestingly, I don't have the same problem with handling comfort that I had before.

The screwdriver comes in handy all the time and you can get a set of many different bits for the Skeletool.

      "text": "All of my co-workers own a Leatherman of some sort, many of them opting for the more expensive models, and I decided to give them a try after losing my pocket knife, somehow. This knife is SHARP straight from the factory, significantly sharper than my previous pocket knife, and with a much thinner blade than my EDC car knife. The pliers are stiff and a bit hard to use, but they have already come in handy, and the phillips+flat screwdrivers are also helpful. A really great product that should last for years, well worth the money.",

I can't tell you how often I pull this out at work for those times when I just need a quick screwdriver/pliers/knife. I used to have the version without the carabiner or screwdriver, but this fullsize skeletool is much better, and I don't notice the additional length of the carabiner in my pocket at all.",

In true Leatherman fashion, this tool opens and closes with ease. It hooks onto a belt. It remains securely closed. Blades are sharp. Tools are varied and fulfill so many different tasks. What makes this special? For me - the visual is A Plus. I love the design - the holes, the cutaways. It feels good in the hand and is pleasing to the senses. And it cuts a mean rope. 5 stars.",

If your like me and need something cheap now, the skeletool is an AWESOME choice, because you can upgrade it in the future to be just as good as the cx!
