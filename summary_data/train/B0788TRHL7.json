      "verdict": "Hoka markets the Bondi 5 as its most cushioned runner, which is quite a feat in itself as the Hoka brand is known for its oversized cushioning. The latest version of this ultra-cushioned trainer has decent arch support, more room in the forefoot, excellent ventilation, and the added benefits of an extra wide option. While some loyal fans of the Bondi are hotly divided regarding the shoe\u2019s performance, Hoka offered upgrades that have been generally well-accepted and welcomed by runners.",
      "pros": [
        "A majority of the reviewers felt comfortable while wearing the Hoka Bondi 5",
        "The wide toe box should be a welcome change, particularly for those who have slightly wider feet",
        "The extra widths available should be even better good news for those who require more room up front",
        "Some runners noticed how light the shoe is despite the oversized cushioning",
        "A handful of reviewers really liked the lightweight and breathable upper",
        "Some of those who have had foot, back, or hip problems felt better when running in the Hoka One One Bondi 5",
        "The traction is quite good for a road shoe that it can do adequately well on light trails, according to a few",
        "A small number of runners mentioned their stable rides in this shoe",
        "Several of those who are up on their feet most of the time during work valued the shoe\u2019s cushioning",
        "Outsole durability gets a boost with the addition of more rubber"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "Some loyal fans of the Bondi did not like the stiffer midsole, which took away their pleasure during long distance runs",
        "A good number of Hoka fans bemoaned that it still lacks the room in the toe box despite the added space in the latest version of the Bondi",
        "A handful of runners observed that the meta-rocker technology felt dead in this shoe and removed the smooth transition through the gait cycle",
        "The price of the Bondi 5 is quite expensive",
        "A few runners had problems with the tongue as it caused rubbing or irritation"
