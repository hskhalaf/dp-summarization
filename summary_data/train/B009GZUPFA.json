Before I place the order, I'm not realize that the software is so so important when cutting. The silhouette studio surprised me. It is very user friendly and very powerful. I was assume that I have to open AI or Photoshop to pre process my art work. but after I know how does the studio works. I never have to do so. I cut a golden banner for the Lunar New Year. So easy and so much fun!",

My portrait was under warranty and so I told them to just repair my machine or refund me. They did neither. I hope whoever reads then review to look for another product.

Silhouette America has come a long way since I bought my original Portrait in terms of providing set-up instructions and some tutorials about using the Silhouette with updated software. If you are not aware of some of the basic concepts used in electronic/digital cutting machines, though, it can be extremely confusing. Silhouette America was wise to bring on Kelly to write better instructions and produce video tutorials for them. All that being said, the machine itself is very good. I use it mostly for print and cut and creating embellishments for hand-made cards.",

Other times I have to double cut to get the vinyl fully detachable from the backing. The silhouette design store is okay. I wish they were more affordable on commercial prices.
