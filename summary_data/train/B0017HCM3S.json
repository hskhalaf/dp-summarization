Avid followers of this reliable brand have raised concerns on sizing as it tends to be quite narrower than earlier versions, while the opening appears to be tight for some. However, an adequate break-in period can remedy those setbacks.",

I\u2019ve got very sensitive feet due to an illness, and even though they don\u2019t have much arch support, I don\u2019t get sore feet. Definitely worth the little extra cost.",

It doesn't pinch or hurt on the width but I wish they would have kept the same width as the 6W. Either way I'm ok with the smaller size.",
