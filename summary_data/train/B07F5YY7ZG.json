I replaced it with this one, April 2019, and so far it is making no difference, at all. I cannot tell if it is functioning because there are no indicator lights to let me know it is doing its job. June 8, 2019 I had my levels read at a pool store and they verified that this ionzer is not functioning, at least not enough to make a difference in my pool. Also, any time I select the option to contact DR Global, it won't allow me because it cannot \"locate\" an order placed by me.",

    "title": "DR Global Solar Pool Ionizer Kills Algae and Other Organisms Using 85% Less Chlorine 100% Natural Save $300-$500 a Year in Chemicals Year Round Protection",
    "description": "How your solar pool ionizer works: This solar-powered pool ionizer acts as a algae cleaner for pools from 500 gallons to 35,000 gallons. It uses solar technology to generate a safe, low voltage trickle feed of solar generated electricity to ionize the copper anode. The copper ions help control the growth of algae as well as other harmful microorganisms. While it floats in your pool, copper ions are produced while being exposed to sunlight. Usually, within a period of a few days, a sufficient ion level for pool water purification will be attained. For pools with an extremely heavy presence of of algae growth, it could take up to 21 days to achieve crystal clear water. Your solar pool ionizer helps control pool algae while greatly reducing the amount of chlorine required saving you hundreds of dollars per year. Also helps to lower eye irritation while keeping water sparkling clear. This product includes 1 solar powered ionizer, 1 copper anode, 1 cleaning brush for cleaning the copper core, 1 bottle of test strips, and as an added bonus we include 1 additional copper anode for a total of 2 copper cores Copper anodes usually last about one year so your pool cleaning needs can be covered for at least 2 years.",
