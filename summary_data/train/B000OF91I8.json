She can get up on slalom now but she struggled for a little while and she thought it would be easier for her if she could have a handle on each side of the ski. Didn't help but that ok. I'd recommend getting a handle with the slot in front of the handle to help keep the rope straight if your learning. Only complaint is the handles do not float very good. I always put a kwik tek floating ball on all my ropes, but the handles sink pretty fast",
