      "text": "First off, shoutout to Goldie (top Amazon review) for the in-depth and thorough review. It helped me make the purchase. I'll just add that I've used the Angle 3 before, and this Ultra is basically more comparable to more mid-quality speakers like the JBL Flip 4 & 5. This speaker does not sound like a budget speaker at all. It looks, feels, and sounds like it should be closer to the $50-100 range. (Now, don't get any ideas, Oontz!) This speaker edged out the JBL Flip for me because it's in the same quality range with a significant price difference. You can get a higher quality speaker, but for the *value*, this speaker is a winner by a longshot.",

      "text": "After seeing all the glowing reviews (for room speakers), I bought one myself. I must say I am not satisfied with the sound quality. It is tinny and a little muffled sounding, the kind of sound we buy an external speaker to avoid in the first place. I wondered whether my expectation was too high, so I dug out another set of speakers I bought for $40, and my old ones definitely had better fidelity. I tested the Oontz via both bluetooth and audio jack. Perhaps this speaker is tuned for high volume outdoor use, sacrificing fidelity. But if you are considering it for indoor use, I would say look elsewhere.",

I've only had it for about a week and have had it plugged into the flex so battery life is unknown to me. Hopefully this unit will last a while.

I use the speaker largely to listen to music, mostly jazz and pop standards of the first half of the 20th Century, so reproduction has to be especially good to compensate for the dated monaural sound.

      "text": "#1 - This is a terrific little speaker with a wonderful, moxy sound - lots of base, clear mid-range & trebels. Expensive sound without the big price tag of competitors. #2 - I needed something clarified and reached out to the company through Amazon. Within about an hour I received a personal reply, complete with a representative's name. We wrote back-and-forth until she was convinced that I was satisfied. I LOVE GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!! #3 - I bought this for my college-age daughter's birthday, a music major and a bit of an audiophile. She gives it two thumbs up, and I am eager to get another for daughter #2 so they can hook them up.",

Not returning only because it was not that expensive, but I could go to a local big box store and get one for a lower price with the same sound (in my opinion only). I have had better/louder sound quality with other speakers for similar or slightly more expensive speakers. This one is good if you do not want it too loud in the garage.",

I feel like this is a great bang for your buck speaker - like if I were to spend a lot more money, I'd probably get something a little nicer, but what you get with this speaker, for the money, is a great deal.

It's a micro port similar to an older Android charging port. The problem is, it is very flimsy and the plug is wobbly when plugged in. A different type of plug would have been much better.

      "text": "I\u2019ve had Oontz Bluetooth speakers now for a while. Two of The smaller Curves (which always stunned ppl when I gave them a demonstration), then I saw these. Wow. I\u2019d put their ease of functionality, plus the sound quality against anything including \u201c higher tier\u201d but especially at this price point. I have a Jawbone and yeah they pack a punch. But this new Angle3Ultra has the dual stereo or separate left and right pairing modes when you have a set of two which just fills the room, with as much volume as you\u2019d need. The other cool features include the long range connectivity and battery life! Keep up the great gear for us audiophiles Oontz! Highly recommended!",
