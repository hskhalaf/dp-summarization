Faster then any iron I have ever used 4. Can use tab water instead of buying distilled water with this iron Cons: 1. The instructions warn that the iron will make odors the first use and its does. I highly recommend using this iron outside or on a porch the first 2-3 times you use it. After that the odor goes away and the iron continues to work excellently",

Retractable cord is great for keeping the cord out of the way of busy pets. Careful while retracting as the plug can get wild as it winds up. Price was ideal and further discounted with an Amazon warehouse deal.",
