Delivery was super fast. I had a couple of these shirts for at least 6-months, and they launder with no wrinkles and are colorfast. Thank you Van Heusen & Thank you Overstock.com for placing these on Amazon. Great delivery speed Amazon with free shipping and 2-days after order, they were on my front porch.",

My husband is on the shorter side for a man (5'6\"), but the average male height is not 6\"--why don't manufacturers take this into consideration?

The fit is what I would consider normal, not super slim but not cut for someone overweight or very muscular for their height. Maybe that is why some reviewers found the sleeves too short?",
