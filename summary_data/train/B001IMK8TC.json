That said, the instructions were clear and the wood is accurately cut and of good quality. You could match this with a twin XL Japanese-style futon mattress, but I found that a 4\"-thick 38x74\" trifold mattress did the trick just fine and folds more neatly for use as a chair. This type of mattress fits neatly inside a standard removable 41 x 85\" XL twin futon cover. Frame, mattress and cover in the photo were all purchased from Amazon.",

This pic is with the frame, tri-fold mattress, and a comforter thrown over and folded under the mattress with matching pillows. Great addition for a guest room. Might not be ideal for seniors due to it sitting so low to ground as a bed, but great for all other guests.",

The instructions were clear and the futon was easy to put together. I put it together on my own in about 2 hours (me: 40-something female DIYer). It's a great sized futon frame for a narrower space if you don't have enough room for a frame that's as wide as the length of the bed. Sturdy when set up as couch or bed.",
