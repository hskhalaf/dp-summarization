Regardless, after a few months every one I\u2019ve ever had starts to be unable to keep accurate time or date and eventually stops working all together. While it works it\u2019s awesome.

Downloading from the app and from the micro sd were very simple. The 1 minute clips make it quick to take what you want after you find it. Quality isnt the best on earth, but i haven't seen any other cameras that can pick out license plate frames from afar.",

It\u2019s super easy to set up, you can download videos directly to your phone, no removing the SD card needed to get footage, and you can add multiple cameras to the app. Comes with VHB and suction mounts, unit stays steady.
