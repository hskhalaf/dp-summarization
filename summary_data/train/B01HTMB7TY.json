The rubber rand around the backpacking boot's upper received praise. Similarly, its comfort right out of the box and breathability were approved. The component that dissatisfied the minority was the outsole wearing out quickly.",

They're light in weight have a superb lacing system which really holds your heel in place coupled with a great sole capable of use on any terrain. Toes are also well protected for use on rough terrain. I can really recommend these Boots.",

Never have I put a pair of boots on that are more comfortable with such a perfect fit straight out of the box. Really look the business but more importantly the fit is perfect. I am a complete convert and hoping these stand the test of time, as all being well I will be converted to Salewa for life. Really impressed.",

If anyone knows if I can get my money back or how to make them comfortable, please let me know. The look of the boot is great and hard wearing exterior are the only pluses.",

Have used for long enough now to report that they are very comfortable and totally waterproof. This is a personal gripe, as I like to use a surgeon's knot at top of foot section & again at final ankle position. This leaves only just enough lace for a double bow. Personally would prefer a bit longer laces - others will be happy not having excess lace.",

Salewa are a wider fit so the crows fit my feet, however the mountain trainer is far narrower on the instepand was uncomfortable for me. I had to return as a result but was a great shame as a nice looking boot and was a great fit for my wider foot at the ball of the foot. If they fit you then would be a good hiking/walking choice as well made boots.",

The boot has been designed to meet the requirements of both ascent and descents in mixed and technical terrain. This is why the Mountain Trainer Mid GTX uses a new midsole with Bilight technology. Dual-layer cushioning and ergonomically shaped for good grip inside the shoe and reliable comfort even during long hikes. At the ankle area, the Flex Collar allows increased freedom of movement to the back and thus much comfort when descent, even with heavy luggage. The lightweight, firm Vibram wrapping thread Combi (wtc) outsole ensures a stable and natural running feel. The patented Salewa 3f system provides flexibility, heel support and a bubble-free fit right from the start. The GORE-TEX Performance Comfort lining ensures optimum weather protection and climate comfort.",
