However, it has a quite a range of adjustment and I was able to position the monitor very close to optimal. Once setup, it's stable enough to use on a bed without much difficulty.

It can adjust to fit either iPad, and has lots of configurations do you can hold your tablet in either portrait or landscape mode, and get just the right amount of tilt. Since it folds up to a very small size, I can toss it in my junk drawer when not in use. Definitely worth the price.",

Essentially the grooves are not parallel with the backrest. If this was fixed it would lead to greater longevity and tablet stability, I don't know how they missed this.

It may not bother you, but it bothers me a little bit. For anything bigger than a kindle fire this would probably work just fine.",

      "text": "I use this with my Kindle Keyboard, in it's leather case, and the tablet stand works perfectly. With different adjustments to the width of the base and the angle of the back, it should work for many types of devices. After years of propping up my Kindle with a cookbook, a Perquackey game, a pillow... you name it... I finally have something that holds my Kindle at a good angle for reading while having breakfast or lunch. Now I can put all that stuff back where it belongs instead of cluttering up my kitchen.",

So, to help with this, while using the support with a tablet, the use of a light pull rubber band between the supports, helps quite a bit to prevent the shift.",
