My kids have maybe a total of 8 games which two can never update cause there's not enough space.

It works great, however it lags a bit when under heavy use. The processor is not the greatest, however for basic use, this may be perfect for you. I would definitely recommend for someone looking for a tablet to use for light work and light gaming. The tablet is light, never gets hot and the battery life is OUTSTANDING, probably the best feature of this tablet.",

So if you want something stable, fast, a good picture, and above average performance you will like this tablet. You can get Kies, which is a management program so you can add, delete and synce to all your devices. Made for the Samsung. Nice program. Get it at Samsung site.",

I am used to another make of tablet so I did need to play around abit setting this up for her. But it was mostly straight forward. I did download the kindle app and the skype app which was easy. I eventually got the hang of it. I am sure my mum will learn how to use it too, but she will probably only use it for a few things ie; kindle, skype, pictures",

I think they should tell you how much trouble you'll get in to up front ( you can use the device with out agreeing to all the software ) or We what you whole life and credit card number and we will give you the device for free which is what I think they should do. Data mining and demographic studies, are VERY Valuable.",

I hardly used it so I would expect it to last at least a couple to three years. When it did perform it was great but I cannot recommend it because life span is only one year.",

If you do plan to buy one, be wary of the problem that samsung hasn't fixed which is the charger port starts to fail after awhile. Apparently, Samsung hasn't fixed this problem its a known issue. To get around the issue you can opt to put something underneath the micro usb part to keep it charging. But you shouldn't have to do all that to get a tablet to work so i rate it 3 stars. Pros. low price point . Pretty good device for entertainment use. cons: issues with charging port.",
