A child, practically, ends up being squeezed in between the back piece and the between-the-legs-bar - Also, there is no where to put the feet, the little black foot peg is just too small to be practical - We actually ended up pulling up a very old one from the attic, and using that instead of this one.",

The high chair comes out of the box already assembled, which is good because I am too tired to assemble anything. The design is very simple to fold out to use and fold back when done with feeding. The covers for the high chair I wash on regular cycle in cold and the fabric holds up. I read a lot of reviews before picking a high chair. This was the only high chair for which even the bad reviews were good, just people being extra picky about color or pattern of the fabric.",

I originally bought it because it folds up and out of the way. But I didn't think about the fact that I would be holding a baby while getting the chair out. You have to have two hands free. So, we very rarely folded it out of the way. There are many steps to take the chair cushion out to wash it. It's just not worth what I paid ($118).",

I highly recommend this chair to anyone who wants a slim high chair, but still wants something of subtsance! This beats the popular booster chairs- it folds up very easily and is completely convenient forfolding away after each feeding and moving out of the way!",

The main issue that I have with this chair it's that the fabric is not easy to clean as the image shows. The fabric cannot be easily clean with a wipe. You need to put it in the washer and it takes time to airdry. Also, after the first 3 washes, the fabric started to break. I would have to say that it's a very comfortable chair but the cleaning issue is a NIGHTMARE. I thought about returning it but it's too late.",

Also just not very comfy feeling for our little guy. Definitely will be returning this high chair. Yes, it was a very good price. But I guess we've learned from this that you need to spend more money on products to ensure they won't be total crap.",
