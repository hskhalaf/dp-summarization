Now I have an expensive piece of junk in my house. To prove it lost all suction, I put a piece of tape in the dust bin container to fool it into thinking it is installed, then I put some tape in the air flow duct and it just won't move at all meaning there is no suction anymore. Please ecovacs, reach out to me to try and find a solution for my case.",

Hoovering-10/10( surprising results) NOT Getting stuck-9/10( smart machine since it has mapping system, just make sure there are no cables or loose clothes on the floor) Mopping-8/10 ( Using this feature to mop the kitchen floor and bathroom floor) Suction power-9/10 ( works really over on thick carpet, I am surprised by its power) Overall, I would rate it as 10, it is a great machine at a reasonable price and does everything I expect it to do.",

Without a doubt it makes robot mistakes, but that is to be expected. The memory of the house map needs to be improved, because each time it resets (every time you move the robot) it has to redo the map, and thus vacuum first. The next time, if everything goes perfect, it can mop. That is tough cause you have to insert the cleaner just ride, or it will reset. Overall though, it does an incredible job.",
