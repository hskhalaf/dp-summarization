We cooked with a large dutch oven and the grill started to tip after some time as it simply wasn't long enough to gain enough stability. We ended up using a log on the edge of the pit to add additional support while using heavier cooking pans. While using smaller cast iron pans and cooking food over the grill it stood perfectly straight and we didn't have any problems.",

But the specific unit that I received from this vendor wasn't in the greatest shape: out of the box, the screw that fixes the grill rack to the vertical pole is about 50% rusted over and the finish on the vertical pole has a half-dozen major scratches. But still it works well enough, and it is only camping gear after all.",
