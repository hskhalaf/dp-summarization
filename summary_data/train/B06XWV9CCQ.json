It can be quite taxing, but since using this, I can remain mobile and everyone can still hear me without havingto strain or raise my voice. Apparently, it does alter or tinnify (if that's a word) your voice a bit, but the built in speaker is definitely loud enough for the entire classd top hear me and the rechargeable battery lasts for weeks. A couple other teachers bought these as well after seeing and using mine. A very useful product.",

He wasn\u2019t sure about using this but it helps so much. He\u2019s even worn it at home. I can hear him without having to ask him to repeat many things. There\u2019s not much feedback either. It\u2019s got very good volume It doesn\u2019t sound unnatural.",
