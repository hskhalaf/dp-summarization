      "text": "These headphones are easy to connect and I have experienced no connectivity or synchronicity issues to date. The sound quality is as you would expect of a Bose product (very good) and the design follows suit. They really do not come loose no matter how hard you try with the extra wing tip parts to secure it in your ear. The battery could be slightly better but the charging case is a huge bonus and make them very appropriate for travelling, even over long distance.",

They do stick out a bit and are heavy in the ears. The sound quality is excellent when the left one doesn't drop out. I love the way Bose deal with base. Unable to use with my Surface pro - the main reason for buying. Overall perhaps not worth the money",

These are perfect. They stay in no matter how much snappy Head rotation and sudden movements I make. They sound great whether I\u2019m listening to Russell Brand\u2019s spoken podcast, Jazz, Classical, Deep Dub, Rock or Pop. Phone calls are a little quiet is my only criticism, but not a major one. Lightweight, comfortable, good sound, waterproof. Happy customer!",

The Bluetooth connection is rock solid and I have left my phone 10m away whilst in the gym and it\u2019s still maintained a stable connection. Now the bad (for me), whilst the Stayhear tips fit my ears perfectly and stop them falling out, the noise leakage is horrendous. They do nothing to block out outside noise which is arguably good when you\u2019re running as you can hear everything around you. I\u2019d have preferred more sound isolation but the trade off for the amazing sound has not been a deal breaker.",

The holding/ charging case is brilliant & the earphones are magnetic, so no trying to get it to fit into a tight space, like my previous Sony ones!

I\u2019ve used them for several hours without any drop out, even when a reasonable distance from my phone (iPhone XS). The bass is definitely the best I\u2019ve come across in such small buds it\u2019s deep and the treble is as good.

I like the find the device feature in bose app that let's me locate the geo location of the device while it emits alarm sound. The orange color I ordered looks different and less appealing than how it looked in the picture. If you wear it for a few minutes your ear starts hurting unlike the bose headphone. I am going to try it for a few day to see if my ears adapt to it but most probably I am going to return them since they are not most comfortable.",

If I don't use them again for say a week ill come back to them completely drained and the charge case will be completely drained which tells me that the case charges them then once charged will drain them and its self completely.

However the sound delay (lag) is too much if exercising via streaming, such as Peloton. Also sometimes the left earbud, would not sync. This is frustrating when you want to excercise, as cant be bothered trouble shooting wasting time. After reviewing other earbuds, going for Powerbeats Pro instead. Sadly they will cost more, but a better product.",
