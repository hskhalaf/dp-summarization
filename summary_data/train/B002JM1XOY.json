The scanner's great, even photos scan well. But something is off with this model. Epson does exchange the broken one for a free working printer, but it's the second time in 3 months, and it's a pain.",

Scanning is good quality, and easy to send to PCs that are setup on system. Haven't used Fax function because we got rid of our land line. Very happy with Purchace (under [...] with free shipping).",

As two of us use the printer, we keep it on and it goes to sleep. This could be why some folks report it as printing slower than the Epson 600 because it takes a few seconds to wake up. The print quality is excellent. I am very satisfied with the Epson 610.",

As for not being able to connect with Microsoft Office Document Imaging, they stated that this was Microsoft's problem, not theirs.

And, each print is made to last.\n\n\n\nBE MORE INFORMED\nThe new international ISO print speed standard Print speed is critically important when buying a printer or all-in-one. But how do you compare print speeds when different manufacturers measure in different ways? Now you can. Much like the \"MPG\" ratings on new cars, there's now a new industry standard for measuring print speed, which allows for an \"apples-to-apples\" comparison between different printer models and brands. The International Organization for Standardization (widely known as ISO) developed this industry approved and internationally accepted standard, specifically for ink jet printers and all-in-ones. It measures \"out of the box\" (default) print speeds using \"real world\" printing scenarios, so you can be sure you're getting a product that performs at the speed you need.\n\n\n\nFeatures/Benefits\n\n * Increase your productivity \u2014 save time with the world\u2019s fastest all-in-one1 in its class\n * Speed through critical documents \u2014 ISO print speeds2 of 15 ISO ppm black, 9.3 ISO ppm color\n * Dependable \u2014 instant\u2013dry ink for smudge, fade and water resistant prints; highlighter\u2013friendly too\n * PC fax \u2014 save paper by faxing documents directly from your computer4\n * Easily share \u2014 Wi\u2013Fi for wireless connectivity, and Ethernet for wired networking\n * Print three times as much \u2014 get about 3x more prints than with our standard 69 ink cartridges, when using the included 97 Extra High\u2013capacity ink cartridge\n * Small footprint \u2014 takes up less space on your desk\n * Save energy \u2014 uses up to 70% less power than a laser printer3\n * Save paper \u2014 save up to 50% of your paper supply with manual, two\u2013sided printing5\n * Get more done \u2014 30\u2013page Auto Document Feeder to quickly copy, scan or fax stacks of originals\n * High\u2013speed faxing in black and color \u2014 as fast as 3 sec per page; speed dial storage up to 60 numbers; fax memory up to 180 pages\n * PC\u2013free, borderless photos in a snap \u2014 2.5\" LCD and memory card slots for easy transfer of files\n * Individual ink cartridges \u2014 replace only the color you need\n * Product protection you can count on \u2014 2\u2013year limited warranty; phone support, without charge, for the life of the product; plus, access to exclusive templates, tutorials and offers with product registration6\n * Weight and Dimensions (W x D x H) \u2014 Weight: 18.3 lb, Printing: 18.1\" x 22.1\" x 12\", Storage: 18.1\" x 13.6\" x 9.3\"\n\n\nEco features\n\n * Uses up to 70% less power than a laser printer3\n * Save up to 50% of your paper supply with manual, two\u2013sided printing5\n * ENERGY STAR\u00ae qualified\n * Designed to be Recycled7\n\n\nRecommended Supplies \nEpson Ink Supplies \n69 DURABrite Ultra Black ink cartridge (T069120) \n69 DURABrite Ultra Cyan ink cartridge (T069220) \n69 DURABrite Ultra Magenta ink cartridge (T069320) \n69 DURABrite Ultra Yellow ink cartridge (T069420) \n69 DURABrite Ultra color multi\u2013pack (3 colors) (T069520) \n\nEpson Paper Supplies \nHeavyweight 8.5 x 11 in, Matte Paper, 50 sheets (S041257) \nPhoto Quality Inkjet Paper, 100 sheets (S041062) \nPremium Semi\u2013Gloss Photo Paper 8.5 x 11 in, 20 sheets (S041331) \nPremium Glossy Photo Paper 4 x 6 in, 100 sheets (S041727) \n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s in the Box\n\n * WorkForce 610 all\u2013in\u2013one\n * Instruction manual\n * CD-ROM with drivers and bonus software\n * Power cord\n * Telephone cord\n * 4 DURABrite Ultra Ink cartridges; one 97 Extra High\u2013capacity Black ink cartridge and three 68 High\u2013capacity color ink cartridges: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow\n\n\nWorkForce products\nEngineered for business.\n\nShow the world what your business is made of with WorkForce, Epson\u2019s exclusive line of printers and all\u2013in\u2013ones that are engineered for better business productivity.
