For now, it would be wasteful to put all that effort to install it, only having to take it out to move. P.S. Best on strong walls.",

I like that it came with hardware, but the pieces that were meant to anchor the screws in the wall don't fit very well; I ended up just skipping them and putting the screws directly in the wall (and I definitely should have used a stud-finder).",
