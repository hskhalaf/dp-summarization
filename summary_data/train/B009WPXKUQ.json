      "text": "My cat used to be feral so he is super food motivated, so this toy has been a wonderful enrichment tool for him. It will keep him busy for anywhere from 15-45 minutes depending on how difficult I make it for him. The most difficult part for him are the little goldfish bowls, so I only do those if I want him to be busy for longer periods of time as he does get kind of frustrated if I do it every single time. Here is a video of one of the first times he ever got to use his new toy! Enjoy!",

(This occurs almost every time.) The treats are about the size of a dime, and significantly thick, so this shouldn't happen. I end up turning the toy upside down and shaking it to get the remaining treats--- a frustration to me and my cat :(",

But to give you all useful information, this board is a great size for cats maybe up to 11-12 pounds, or for cats with small paws. We have a large tom that wasn\u2019t neutered before we got him, and he has a lot of difficulty getting his paws into the peg board. The bowls are so small that even our smaller cat with dainty paws can barely reach into them. (The cats work together to twist and rip the bowls out of the board instead.)",

      "text": "This came quick enough considering everything going on. The food puzzle/busy toy was packed well & was snug in the box. The item is clean looking and surprisingly sturdy. Couldn't wait to try it out. Kibble in a few of the cups, a few little smears of wet food in various places and let the cats have at it. They were occupied by the newest thing & were kept engaged until the snacks were finished. I enjoyed their attentiveness whilst showing them each hiding place and was thoroughly amused at them trying to snatch all the goodies. Very satisfied. Thx.",

I sprinkled catnip over it and started by filling the edges and the top of the tunnel with food. After a few minutes she came back and she clearly knew that this was a very special gift just for her. I'm sure it will take her awhile to learn how to use all of the compartments but tonight my cat is smiling with satisfaction.",

It makes me feel like he is dumber than previously thought, which has been insinuated by others in the past though it is absolutely maybe not true.
