      "verdict": "The 6th version of the Nike Downshifter gained the favor of a lot of neutral runners and shoe enthusiasts. They stated that they felt contented and secured when trying it on the pavement. For many of them, the underfoot cushioning felt reliable and consistent, as did the upper cover system. There were some who didn\u2019t enjoy this version, but that didn\u2019t stop the Downshifter 6 from getting such prominence.",
      "pros": [
        "A runner wrote that the mesh material used in the Nike Downshifter 6 had a bit of stretch to it, basically allowing their feet to feel unrestricted even when the material is hugging it",
        "Testers noted that the padding in the upper unit granted the dimensions of their feet with some cushioning during the running sessions",
        "The testers appreciated the inclusion of a molded insole, which gave contoured support to the foot-pad and the arch",
        "The underfoot cushioning was commended by many because of its soft and responsive nature",
        "This shoe didn\u2019t feel heavy and it didn\u2019t feel too lightweight, according to some runners",
        "for them, it had an adequate weight that\u2019s agreeable for many activities",
        "The Downshifter 6 looked visually appealing to a lot of those who tried it",
        "\u2018Comfortable\u2019 was a word many runners used to describe this shoe, as well as their time wearing it",
        "Based on a number of comments, this shoe was lauded for its affordable price",
        "The flat laces of this model gained recognition because they didn\u2019t unravel easily"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "Some of the testers felt that the Downshifter 6 was a bit large for their feet",
        "The toe box was a bit narrow for a few runners",
        "they wrote that it tended to clump their toes together uncomfortably",
        "The tongue was a bit lumpy and irritating to the skin, a tester complained"
