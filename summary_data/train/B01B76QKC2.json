The controls are intuitive. The walking surface operates smoothly and quietly. The height of the handlebars is comfortable (I'm about 5'5\"), though not adjustable. If you're looking for features like programmability, variable incline, collapsibility for easy storage, or compatibility with electronic devices, this is not the treadmill for you. If what you need is a very basic treadmill and a low price, I'd recommend this one.",

I took care of this by adding a board under the rear of the machine. Plus ++ it is quiet so watching TV is good. The speed read out is in metric. The pulse reader is better than most.
