However, after only a couple of months of use, the pump stopped working almost completely, so the spray is more like a lite mist, and the metallic cover slides off while I hold the bottle, which makes it very difficult to use. I have stopped using it completely. This is not a inexpensive item, yet it didn't last very long. I am surprised by all the positive reviews it has. I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS MISTER.",

This is the perfect size. The main drawback to having a small bottle is having to pump more frequently to pressurize it, but the pump is easy to use and gives you a nice long spray.

      "text": "Update: Have to say I'm thoroughly impressed by the owner. They really do care about their customers and made sure I was taken care of--an absolute rarity in the modern day. Thank you Gina! Leaves much to be desired. It doesn't work first of all. I followed the directions on the box as well as what was sent via email. I had to pump this thing 50+ times just for it to leak out of the nozzle. Second the actuation mechanism/travel time is so little, you're not even sure if you're pressing the nozzle. Quite disappointing since I've spent time researching oil misters before pulling the trigger on this one.",

If I tip it sideways to spray a pan for instance, I get only a tube's worth of oil before the tube fills with air. I personally don't see a design way around that limitation, but it is easy to right the sprayer, depress the nozzle, and allow the tube to refill. A nice addition would be to have a dual use nozzle - one position for mist, another for a stream.",

      "THE HEALTHY ALTERNATIVE TO COOKING SPRAYS - While store-bought cooking sprays are convenient, you don't really know what's in them. That's not a problem with our refillable CHEFVANTAGE oil mister, because you get to use whatever ingredients you want.",
      "VERSATILE - It's great for most types of oil (e.g. olive, coconut), as well as vinegars, juices, or even water. For example, fill it with lemon juice and spritz a salmon steak or spray it on fruit to keep it fresh.",
      "NO CLOGGING - Our mister won't clog, even if you add fresh herbs, say, to infuse your own oils or vinegars, thanks to its special anti-clog filter.",
      "EASY TO USE - Because this uses a non-aerosol air pressure pump mechanism, you do need to prime it with a few pumps to get it going. From then on, a super-fine spray will give your food or pans an even coating, every time - and use less oil, which is healthier for you and your family too.",
      "ELEGANT, PRACTICAL DESIGN - The oil chamber is made from scratch-resistant glass, which is also anti-bacterial and easy to clean, while the pump is cleverly hidden from view inside the stainless steel top.
