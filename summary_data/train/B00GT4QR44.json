Feels like a pretty well built jacket and I've had mine for four years still and it still looks new. Lots of pockets inside and out and even weird zippers for your armpits!? Comes with a button at the bottom and lots of Velcro. Be careful when strapping the Velcro as it comes loose eventually and will rip off as it has happened to me. I have not received this product in at a discounted price and do it solely for the customers information.",
