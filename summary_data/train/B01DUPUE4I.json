It is under All in settings menu, Picture, then Backlight. I measured the feet of the TV and at their furthest point they are 78 cm wide. The whole TV fits perfectly on my 1m wide table with no overhang.",

This is easily as good as the older 8000 Series Samsung that it replaced. Picture quality is excellent, it even does a reasonable job at upscaling SD. Sound quality is also good. Not tinny like some of the no name brands, but don't expect to feel the bass in your chest either. Love the smart features, we make regular use of the Amazon and Netflix apps. So much more convenient that booting up the Playstation or XBox. I would definitely choose this brand again.",

Sound is loud, colour and clarity are great the only thing to say is the blacks are not as good as they could be when watching tv (gaming seems to be fine) but some playing around with the setting may sort this out.
