I'm not sure whose fault that is? Ended up controlling my two devices on the iPad rather than my S7Edge. But, my iPad keeps going to my 5G wi-fi and iDevice does not support this and perhaps that is why Alexa keeps loosing the iDevice Socket. I wish Alexa made all the products and therefore would be more compatible?",

Though she can control the light, the nightlight portion still won\u2019t work. Overall 3 stars due to poor set up design and even worse step by step set up instructions.",

Instead I'm using it in a lamp and it works great. I will have to rethink the back porch light.",

Basically it\u2019s a ugly bulb that another bulb can go inside :P I would have kept it but if you power the switch on and off it blinks red for a moment then powers the bulb and socket ring \ud83d\udc4e. The leds also display as 4 points on the ring rather than a uniform diffused ring.",

NO HUB or subscription required, just connect to your Wi-Fi & use the iDevices app. Can be controlled away from home, too! Typical hard-wired timer switches are about the same price, but require additional cost for installation (unless you're handy). The iDevices Socket was just what I needed! I plan to order more for other lights. Programming & recipes are easy, even custom color-changing for mood/season, plus dimming capability. iDevices states that dimmable bulbs are recommended for best features results. I'm using LED bulbs (Cree).",
