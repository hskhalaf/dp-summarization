I tend to always look on the front of packaging for items that need refrigeration. So.... I suppose my poor little kitty has not been reaping the true benefits!! Double AARGH!! Anyway....besides my mistake, my cat didn't miss a beat when it was mixed with his food. I will be purchasing a new batch that I will keep refrigerated this time and hopefully see even further improvements. 4 stars is for the poor placement of the Keep Refrigerated verbiage.",

      "text": "My sweet little cat is unfortunately suffering from IBD. She gets 2,5 mg of Prednisolone in her wet food in a flavored suspension every day to prevent her from vomiting. Curcumin and krill oil are also great natural anti inflammatories that she benefits from. Prednisolone can wreck havoc with healthy bacteria flora in her gut, but this probiotic helps her a lot. She does not seem to take notice when I stir the powder in her pate. Very good product. Remember to keep it in the refrigerator.",

It has a chalky texture and doesn't mix well into wet food, nor does it coat dry food like previous kitty probiotics I've used. So far, the probiotic itself seems okay, but this also seems like a case of getting what I paid for. I'll be returning to Pet Dophilus or Vital Flora's cat probiotic from here on out.",

    "description": "Your search for the best, most effective probiotic is finally over! When you order from us today, here are just a few of the benefits that you can look forward to: \n\n\u2192Our ultra concentrated probiotic will help keep your cat's GI tract in the best health possible. Our precise blend of L.Acidophilus, L.Plantarum, and L.Salivarius will fight off internal infections, diarrhea, an upset stomach, and restore their digestive system to its proper state after taking antibiotics and/or antifungals. Give back the health and overall vitality that your furry friend deserves.\n\n\u2192With no added fillers or \"binders\" to hold a tablet supplement together, our specially-formulated powder does not contain any unnecessary ingredients. We only pack our probiotic with over 1 Billion CFUs/serving, which is far more than any of the leading competitors.\n\n\u2192Our probiotic has so many more benefits aside from a healthy digestive system. It helps with allergies and skin irritation as well. Excessive shedding and itching will be an issue of the past. Keep your kitty's comfort at the forefront with a steady regimen of our powerful probiotic.\n\nKeep in mind what we offer isn't a miracle drug, but an all natural supplement that seems to work extremely well on your cat.\n\nWhen you order today, remember you are ordering with the confidence of our 60-day 100% No-Questions-Asked refund, if you are not completely satisfied with your purchase. Your cat's health and happiness is, and will always be, our #1 priority\n\nRecommended Use: For all cat breeds over 8 weeks old, 1/2 scoop(scoop provided) added to food once daily or as needed.\n\nCopyright Superior Quality Products. Sold Exclusively by Superior Quality Products and its Authorized Dealers",
