No plastic wrap, tape, twist ties, zip ties, intense marketing stickers or photos. Box went into the recycling bin. When the toy is done it will get handed down or recycled again.",

He discovered it at daycare and his teachers asked me if he had one at home because of how much he plays with it. I hesitated to buy it because I thought he would lose interest in it at school--quite the opposite. He loves it and pushes it around our house and yard. \"Gruck\" now goes everywhere with us from parties to the beach. Other kids jump in and want to push it around too. I think the lip of the dumping bin on the truck gives it a good handle for pushing. I would highly recommend this toy.",

It's a fine enough toy if used outside the sand box, but our little one hardly plays with it in the sand box and sticks to other vehicles that actually drive in sand.",

Biggest downside he struggled with is the dumper back flips up super easy so he had to figure out how to avoid that. He did so by either pushing it backwards or putting his hands up in the \"crease/curve\" of the dumper bed near the front. Still loves playing with it and so does his big sister. All plastic, no metal, no sharp parts. Haven't put it in the dishwasher yet - only been inside so far.",

To my surprise, it didn't seem to mind at all. It may be plastic, but it's impressively durable. It's definitely going to stand up to some banging and dropping. His three-year-old sister found it mildly interesting and his five-year-old brother couldn't have cared less (he has much more detailed and advanced trucks).

Our son fills it with lego bricks, or cars, or small plush toys and drives them all over the house. This has become his favorite dump truck. It fills easily and holds a good amount. The dumping is better than many trucks as all of the stuff in the back can be dumped. We are glad we purchased it on sale.",

He has gotten a lot of \"trucks\" for his birthday, but most of them were too little for him to crawl and push. These are clearly his favorites. We have 6-7 of these vehicles now. It is true that they do not roll well on hardwood floors, but they scoot along just fine and it's not like he notices.",

      "text": "First off, there is absolutely nothing wrong with the wheels on this truck. Maybe they changed something since the few reviews that talk about problems with them, but it rolls great. My 9-month old is having a blast rolling and dumping things out of this truck. It is built really well. There are no sharp corners, everything is nicely rounded-off, and no places to pinch little fingers. Looks to be really sturdy, I am certain it will last for years. Love that it is made of recycled plastic. I'm having a hard time not purchasing all of the Green Toys trucks!",
