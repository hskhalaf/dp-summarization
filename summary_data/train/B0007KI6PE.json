Item came as described, shipped in original box. The fax machine is compact and lightweight. It doesn't take up a lot of space. Setup was very easy, plugged phone cord into my modem and it's ready to go. It's extremely simple to use, sends faxes fast, I placed papers face down, dialed # and pushed send. I love how small and easy it is to use. For the low cost price, it's well worth the money. I am happy with my purchase.",

I disliked cleaning the head due to residue buildup from the ribbon and disliked the fact that due to the ribbon hanging and sticking to the head, it would smudge the fax and jam frequently . However the environment the machine was placed in was extremely hot ... 100+ degrees, so I suspect this was the source of the excessive failures and cleanings. I replaced this machine with a Brother IntelliFAX 2840 and am happy with it.",

      "text": "I like this fax machine. It replaces another ancient Brother fax which served me well for many years. This one is smaller and although I have only used it a few times is simple to use. The directions for setting up were not the best, but the Brothers support line was very good. I spoke to a person right away who was very helpful and e mailed me several tips for using the the device. Delivery was very fast. (actually arrived on a Sunday). It will not get heavy use and that is the reason for buying an inexpensive machine.",

You can use the Redial/Pause button to store a 3 seconds pause in your speed dial ( to reveal your own caller ID ):- good feature; as some fax machines do not answer phone with caller ID blocked. I don't use it much so I don't know how many copies can I receive before the ink carbon roll is used up. It's fine for someone who send faxes and do not receive too many faxes. It served my purpose.",

If you want a machine that will hold a lot of paper and process more than a few copies at a time, this is probably not going to be a machine that you'd like. But if you want a \"plain Jane\" kind of machine that will handle sending up to a dozen or so copies at time, this machine will work for you. And you can't beat the price. .",

Not too many buttons, nothing extra, just the basic functions a fax machine should have. Putting it together was pretty easy too. The phone is about he size of your hand, which I don't mind because we hardly use it, but it's something that you might keep in mind if you do use the phone and the size of it matters to you. Overall it's been working quite well. Very happy I purchased this.",

I keep mine in the closet and only take it out on the counter when actually using it.

We got this because the local FAX place wants $2.00/page to either send or receive a FAX. This little bugger will pay for itself quickly at that rate. The cord for the phone part is a little short so I recommend getting a longer cord. And, since the included ribbon cartridge will only print about 30 FAX pages, ordering the replacement regular length ribbon cartridge at the same time is recommended. Amazon also had the best price for this FAX machine.",
