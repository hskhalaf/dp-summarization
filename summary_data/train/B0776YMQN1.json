I just don't like how I bought this \"new\" game, and it's code doesn't work. Like why? They have been reasonably for sending a replacement, so I'll give a star for that.",

The issue I had was amazon sent me a European region disc so when I tried to buy anything in the game through the PlayStation store it would not reflect in my online game. And this is due to the different regions. My PlayStation account is in north America and as I said the game they sent was a European region disc. It took a while and a few phone calls to figure this out. So if your having the same issue this may be the reason. Amazon did return the game for me and is looking Into this, so hopefully it doesn't happen to anyone else.",

What\u2019s next for rockstar? How about a game about weaponized vacuuming? Maybe if they spent less time pushing political agendas and more time doing their jobs they could make a better game.",

It's so easy to just get lost in the world, getting sidetracked from whatever you were doing because some other interesting thing popped up. I played it for probably over 100 hours, and played every day for a solid month. Have not played the online mode, so I can't comment on that; however, I would highly recommend it for the single player alone.",
