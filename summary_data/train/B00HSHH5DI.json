FX3 allows both lithium and AAA battery back-ups, FX3+ only allows lithium! That is a very large difference between the two products, I need something more reliable that can run on standard batteries if its charge runs out! Please spare other people the trouble I experienced and update your photos because some people may be ordering this product at the last minute and won' have the convenience of time to return it!",

Each time I moved the radio, the battery compartment door would come off and the battery would fall out. With those little wires connecting the rechargeable battery getting all twisted up and kinked when I put the battery back in, I have no confidence in its having a long lifespan. Finally put a small twig to apply pressure to keep it closed.",

The solar panel appears to barely work, leaving it on a window sill on sunny days for days didn't help much, etc. This product looks at a glance like a less expensive but operable version of the real thing but appears to be more of a miniature playtending to be the real thing. The Red Cross should probably test this product and require qualitative upgrades before renewing name sponsorship to the manufacturer.",

The best part of this upgrade, to me, is the increased charging capability offered by the 1000mAh internal lithium ion battery. It seems like my iPhone sucks down the battery faster and faster and this allows me to give it a little boost while I am still walking around doing other things. The digital tuner is also nice as it easily seeks out the next station either up or down automatically with a simple press and a turn.",

The solar will take all day to charge (maybe not to 100%) and the crank will take hours. If you really want to charge phones you'll want 2-3 square feet of solar panel.",

The FRX3+ seldom goes on sale while the FRX3+ can be had for under $40.00 if you look. Also an AC charger is a good idea and that can be had for under $10.00.

      "text": "Have tested all of the functions and it works better than any of the numerous emergency weather radios I've previously owned. It is the fastest to charge using the charging handle taking less than 30 secs. It also holds a charge very well, unlike others. A little expensive at around $50, but well worth the extra dollars IMHO. Would buy for my son. UPDATE: Still the best I've had but the solar charging is not very good. I've left it in a direct southern-exposure window and the battery has never had a full charge on it. Crank works pretty well though.",
