Cats cannot go without eating for long periods of time. Watch your cat VERY CAREFULLY after applying this collar and remove it if you see any signs of odd behavior - lethargy, decreased appetite, etc. It may take her days to recover after removal, so watch CAREFULLY.",

We purchased 3 more after seeing how well the first one worked, but not a single one deterred the flea\u2019s this time. After visiting the vet I discovered that there were counterfeit Seresto collars being sold through the internet. Based on the performance of all three of the new collars I\u2019m pretty sure counterfeit collars were sent to us via Amazon. I spent more than $170 believing I was purchasing a great product, which did absolutely nothing to help and the flea problem got worse before figuring out they were defective. Buyer beware..",

I made sure to purchase from Amazon itself, not a third party seller, so they wouldn't be some sketchy Chinese counterfeit (or so I thought). Maybe they were old, or maybe the price is lower because they are a less effective/cheap version. Whatever the reason, I'm extremely unhappy that the collars didn't last anyways near the full 8 months like the ones I purchased from my vet. I'm biting the bullet and forking over the higher priceor to my vet. Feels like money wasted, no matter how cheap they are.",

I have noticed a big reduction of them and fleas, as well as they do not get worms from the fleas anymore. I also love them because the Mosquitoes seem to stay out of my house too.

Seresto flea and tick prevention is also available for dogs. Seresto Flea and tick collars for cats contain two active ingredients: Imidacloprid to control flea infestations and flumethrin to repel and kill ticks. These active ingredients are slowly and continuously released in low concentrations, spreading from head to toes, even the tail, over your cat\u2019s coat and skin. Seresto 8-month flea and tick collar for cats can be used alongside other identification collars.
