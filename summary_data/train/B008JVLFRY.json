I used pfister courant faucets in the sink bc they look similar to the Delta porter line but were about fifty bucks cheaper per faucet. This tub faucet swivels which is really nice.",

The online pictures do not give the actual product justice. The bronze finish matches our other bronze products very well. I cannot say the ease of installing because we had a plumber install the fixtures but we are very impressed with the end product.
