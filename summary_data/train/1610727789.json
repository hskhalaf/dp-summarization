There is a disc you can get as well; but you have to order it. Total waste of your time. You get the book to study it; not to buy and wait a few weeks for the extras. CD should have been included.

      "text": "I never got this book and was not charge for it. I received the Life and Health Exam. I wrote a review before I attempted to schedule for the exam. I can't imagine anyone passing the exam without studying some other materials. This book has about 20% of the needed material. There is also a part of the exam that includes State rules and regulations. DON'T waste your money. I was fortunate to have talked to someone who has taken the test. I am still studying.",
