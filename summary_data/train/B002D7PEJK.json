With the curve built into the karts sidebars, the padding works fine. The padding is similar to the original in thickness, and may even be a bit thicker. The velcro (hook/loop) closure is the same as the original and appears to be stitched on very well. These would have come in handy during my teen years when lifting weights was a part of my daily routine, but they now serve me in other ways.",
