I use this camera in the field and also for family functions, for the price I paid for it the pictures are wonderful, and the zoom lens is very nice for long distance shots. I have not had the opportunity to use these new cameras with all the functions they now have, but in a short amount of time I was able to learn how to operate every function this camera has. I love it!!!",

This allows me to shoot in manual mode, the flash won't ruin your photos as it doesn't use flash unless you raise the flash up. Has video mode, which is nice to be able to get short clips of videos of my kiddos. I also love that the battery unit is rechargeable. Some complain about this, but I love it. If you need to buy a back up battery, it's not expensive to do so.",

And on that point it does everything as expected. I will be keeping it for quite some time.",
