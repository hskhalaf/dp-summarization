One of my brightest students exclaimed, \"Now I feel like I am actually wiring something!\" It has held up to daily use by 3 classes so far. If nothing gets broken in the first few uses and kids can work it out of the box without asking me 20 questions or just giving up, I consider it a success. This product and the seller were problem free for me. Thanks!!",

They love creating things and I love that they are using thier brains and hands to make something of thier very own. Total win!",

We tried pushing them in tighter and wiggling them in every direction but there was no consistent way to make a connection, particularly to the positive terminal of the battery module. We're unfortunately returning it as it would be beyond aggravating to try and build a larger circuit with these conditions. Maybe we received a defective model but I'm not interested in taking another chance and would rather try another company with hopefully a higher quality product.",

The booklet lays out each activity (I think there's 45 total) with easy to follow instructions and explanations and diagrams that explain how circuits work, in language a 6-year old (or anti-science minded parent) can understand! The activity book flows in a logical manner so each activity/lesson builds upon what you learned previously. I'm looking forward to more \"playtime\" with our new toy! :)",

Not a huge issue and for the price I can't complain too much, but if your kid is as rough as mine, supervision might be a good idea until they are mature enough to not break things.",

      "text": "Absolutely loved it. I got it for my 8 year old sister and her face lit up when doing these experiments. It was such quality bonding time and I feel like this was a great way to get her interested in STEM because she's always saying how she thinks this is so cool. Some of the ideas in the book are absolutely amazing and great teaching tools. I was able to teach her how remote controls work and at the same time have fun playing spy and trying to sneak past the motion sensor. You should definitely get this for your kid(s), they won't be disappointed!",

It\u2019s simple enough for someone young to follow along with, but still had some cool capabilities. The only thing wrong, is some of the pieces are hard to snap in and out, and the wire holes need to be used a few times before they loosen up.",
