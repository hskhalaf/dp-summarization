No more frustrations and having to get into yoga poses to try to retrieve it. The leather is nice and I didn't even need to is the Velcro strips to keep them in place. What's also nice is you can slip more important items in these without worrying about someone seeing them easily from outside. Super convenient and affordable. Wish I bought this sooner.",
