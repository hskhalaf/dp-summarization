Straps are long enough to fit on my shoulder, so one hand is free for maneuvering through doors, etc. Much handier than hard case. Padding is pretty good for use around home, in car, or storage. Would not ship in it, or use for air travel.",

I would prefer two smaller cases, one for the 'scope and one for the mount and tripod, because by the time you reach a 5\" telescope they are getting sort of heavy. But this one is fitted with well-placed, padded separators so the telescope is protected pretty well. Handles are located well and are easy to grasp. I have been looking for something like this for some time and I am surprised that Celestron and Meade don't offer something like it. That's okay, because this one is great.",

Is built very sturdy and durable, it mentions its waterproof but I haven't tested and hope not too anytime soon. Straps are long enough that you can carry on your shoulder. Only downside is it starts to hurt your shoulder if you carry it around too long. Other than that great product.",

This size fit perfectly for this scope, with room for the OTA, mount, tripod, 4 eyepieces with individual boxes, a night red light and a Telrad. The case also has provision to carry the counterweights but I recommend to carry then separately since them make the case too heavy and unbalanced. Before this case I kept the OTA and accessories in a big plastic box from Home depot and the tripod in the original cardboard box. That makes the scope too bulky and difficult to transport. Whereas this case is great for transportation and the thick padded design keep the stuff safe. Highly recommended.",
