      "text": "I've tried to use several stainless steel cleaners on my expensive fridge. It kept getting worse. After buying this product, which did absolutely nothing, I realized, based on another reviewer, that indeed it was just polishing without cleaning it. It would just spread the dirt and oil all around! I went the old fashion way and used a paste of baking soda with water. I was scared at first but desperate! Using that solution, my fridge looks brand new! No scratches and it actually cleaned and shined it! Make sure you use a soft wet cloth to apply, soft wet cloth to rinse, and a dry soft cloth to dry. You'll be amazed and your welcome!",

I'm sure if I had kids it'd be a little different, but this stuff is where it's at.

The trick I think is to work in sections so you can work quickly, and like others said go with the grain. I started with the top of the fridge door, and when I was done I sprayed the rest of the door. It worked great. Every now and then I wipe fingerprints off with the cloth that's included. Will probably use once a month to on the fridge and my other stainless steel stuff to keep the shine. Bonus is that is smells really nice. Not like other household cleaners. I would definitely recommend this product.",

Easy to use, a nice cloth is included and smells good. Now, even my dishwasher is fingerprint free. I liked it so much I gave the bottle to my daughter to try and now I need to buy again.",

I even tried rubbing it with a small amount of olive oil, which is often recommended as a way to make stainless look good again. It works, but I figured that over time, I'd end up with baked-on gunk as subsequent layers of oil fused with the hot oven surface. This product, while pricey, did a beautiful job of cleaning the stainless. I'm happy with it.",

Highly recommend this for your valuable appliances!",

This is more like washing windows or a counter. Wipe a couple of times with moderate pressure and done! The smell is pleasant too. The rag it comes with is great.
