      "text": "Great shoes, good grip on muddy trail, not too \"knobbly\" on the road. Not quite as much protection as e.g. the spyridon when you hit a patch of sizable, pointy gravel or super gnarly roots, but a great all-round shoe for lighter trails. I have owned these for several weeks, used them for some road and some trail running, and the occasional walk. Only thing I didn't like about them is that they give off their dye - my feet are blue after use, and take a lot of scrubbing to get clean. :/",

Of course my feet were sore/tired, but not from the shoes! My feet felt relatively great compared to similar trail runs in expensive custom trail runners. As far as this style of shoe goes, they\u2019re comfortable: no little things poking your ankle or the back rubbing tendon on the back of your ankle. Please note: no one is exaggerating when you read it will take some time to transition.",

The V Trail Runner fits pretty much exactly the same as the old Spyridon, though it has more padding around the ankle. For activity I use them mostly to play ultimate frisbee. So lots of sudden starts, stops, changing direction, etc. I've been using this shoe for a few months now and am quite satisfied with it. They're holding up well so far, and is a worthy replacement for the old Spyridon.",

I have bunions on both feet and often struggle with finding shoes that I can wear comfortably for long periods of time. Typical athletic shoes make my feet feel cramped and weighty. These give me enough of that \"free foot\" feel and are so light. I love running and hiking in them. They do let water in if it\u2019s deep, but the material helps keep the shoes from getting soggy and squishy, unlike normal athletic shoes. I recommend wearing toe socks with them, as the back part of the shoe does rub slightly on the ankle.",

The only complaint I do have is that I quickly noticed that the outer material looks to have been tearing slightly when I was using the heel loop to pull them on.

The shoes are great but one of the tongues seems to just be glued in place - it came lose very easily. I couldn't tell is it wasn't stitched at all or if the stitches tore out. It is an annoyance but I can live with it given the discounted price I paid. I won't stop buying five fingers but I probably won't get this style again.",
