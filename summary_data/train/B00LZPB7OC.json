You can adjust the intensity/brightness of the light, as well as the temperature of the LED lit to suit your needs.The arms and hinges of the stand allow for much alignment; however, they do not ave 360 degree rotation at their articulation points so the movement is somewhat limited. Overall these are excellent lights, particularly since the more flexible versions are considerably more expensive. I'm pleased with my purchases.",

With this lamp you have a lot more freedom since the diffuser makes it much easier on the eyes. I am very picky when it comes to setting up my work desk just right and this lamp exceeded my expectations by far.",

Dimmers on LED lamps are pretty standard, but this is the only LED lamp I have ever seen that also lets you adjust the color temperature, and that works just fine also - from a tungsten-like 2700K to a brighter 6500K. The lamp is of solid construction, and a fashion statement in its own right. Some other reviews have noted this lamp is not as bright as a fluorescent would be. I believe that's correct, but I don't like bright lights anyway so I have no complaints.",

I would have preferred a mode that slowly turned itself off...no biggy, I still ordered another one.. First review I have ever wrote for a product. Peace",

I do like the fact you can change the color temperature - it makes switching from cold reading to warm ambient easy. Plus, it's fully articulated - it's not evident from the product photos, but this lamp can move and rotate every which way across several articulation points. A+!",

      "text": "This light is fantastic! It puts out a great deal of light, but with soft shadows due to its defused light panel. The functions are great as well, and easy to use by simply placing your fingertip on the selected button, and watching the light change to your liking. It's also very easy to put the light where you need it with its four positioning points. I use my Saicoo for building and painting very small objects, and its bright soft light, and easy of positioning makes it a perfect choice for me!",

The only issue I have had with it is the base seems to be a tad bit light weight and can tip if you put the lamp in an awkward angle facing backwards.",

Example being the base unit vibrates when the minimum and maximum dimming settings are achieved. For the price, I'm not sure there's a better desk lamp available?",
