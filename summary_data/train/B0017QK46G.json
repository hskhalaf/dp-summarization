I did a test of washing my brushes with my old cleanser and letting them dry...and then did it again with this and so much more crap came out of the brushes that i was grossed out!

You can pour a little in a jar and dip your brushes, then blot on a paper towel when you really have to break down some of the long-wearing product formulations that just wash/shampooing alone cannot handle. I like to put my solvent based cleaners (MAC is one of a few I have had) in a small spray bottle. This way I can spray the head of the brush over a clean white wash cloth, and buff the bristles clean. It is a nice way to maintain my brushes in-between wash/shampooing. For solvent type brush cleaner, this is a more gentle cleaner (compared with Parian Spirits for instance).",

However, I give it only 3 stars because it is way too expensive. You can get a similar product much cheaper at your local convenience store. I don't think it's necessary to spend $15 extra dollars on a product just because it is made by MAC even if it does exactly what it is supposed to do.",
