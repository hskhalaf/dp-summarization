The first time I did vegetables stir fry so I couldn\u2019t really tell if it\u2019s stainless or not. Second time, I did scrambled eggs and it turned out very sticky!!!

So I ordered the Saute Pan and I love it!! It is a good all-purpose pan and a great starter piece. I use it to brown chicken breasts in a mixture of butter and oil before adding wine and other goodies!! The price on Amazon is much less than in my local stores, so I'm quite pleased all around!!",

Otherwise it recovers nicely heat-wise when you throw food in there. We experimented with cooking eggs in it and the resulting stuck on bits (we aren't the best cooks) came up quite easily with a few minutes of hot, soapy water and a baking powder paste rub. A stir fry cooked up really well in it though and recovered cooking temperature nicely.",

      "text": "Really all you need. Even cooking, lids fitment spot on. The cleanup isn't like non-stick but it's not far off. A good thing to remember is about every few years they discover that the non-stick leaves bad stuff in your food. You also have to worry about metal utensils and scratching the surface then you end up throwing it away. This stuff won't poison you, you can clean it, use metal spatulas and not worry. If you want shiny scrub it with steel wool and soap. Be sure to scrub in the direction of steel. You'll have shiny in a few laps. This is forever cookware worth passing on to the kids.",

      "text": "I needed a new skillet since mine died... I have other All Clad pans and just love them but really had a hard time with the price. This happened to go on sale and I snapped it up. This type of pan is something that everyone who likes to cook OR needs to cook should have in their kitchen. You can use it for a variety of things - and once you understand how All Clad works - it is SO EASY to clean. Best of all, none of that non-stick toxic crap that peels off other pans. Well worth the price of admission. I use mine at least 3x per week.",

      "text": "this is my first experience with All-clad and I love it. I have been using my old revere ware with copper bottoms and I am learey of residue on my glass top. I always put hot water in the pan while the pan is still hot and let it soak. I can cook just about anything with this size pan. Its expensive but worth every penny. The handle takes getting used to and without the helper handle, I would not have bought it. Its a very heavy pan and I am elderly. If you want quality, this is it!",
