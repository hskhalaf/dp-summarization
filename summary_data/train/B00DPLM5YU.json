The others that just wrap the shrouds are fine. Seem to stand up well to a season of exposure to the elements. Inexpensive, makes life easier, functional and durable.",

They also give you a loop anywhere you have a hole, which makes them perfect for tying up tarps. The Kotap ball bungees are strong and flexible. I use them for organizing electric cords and ratchet straps in my garage. They're much less expensive than velcro or wire wraps. When in doubt, order longer bungee straps. The 6-inch straps will work fine for securing tarps or boards, but it's hard to wrap them around cords or cables.",

I tried other brands that offer a 100 pack for less than $20 but they were poor quality and either the bungee snapped or had little stretch and just wouldn't work. These Kotap brands bungee balls are better quality and cheaper than the ones I got from that Harbor store.",

I suppose a handier person could put a clamp on the extended end and then cut off the excess, but I'm leaving the extra length in place so I can always adjust for longer if I want to. Nice product.

      "text": "You can use these things in a million ways. My boat trailer is made of round steel tube, so I wrap these around the tube and a bit of line tied to the tarp. The bungee cord keeps the tarp held down tight and allows for slight variances each time I put the tarp back on. On some areas, I just push the bungee cord through the grommet holes to tie the tarp together.",
