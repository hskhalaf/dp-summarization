Cons: Signal is very poor for wireless. Materials are very cheap i felt that the router was going to brake apart when taking one of the RJ45 off from the back. Pros: Easy Install Basic configuration allows you to have your wifi ready. Gigabit ports Good transfer speed",

      "text": "I bought this router to replace my non-working access point. I was going to use this as an access point s well. I was able to setup the configuration easy enough, as I have had a bit of experience with networking. The problem I had was that once plugged into the network, my other router (which is a TRENDnet as well) would assign it a new IP address. I could not get into the router administration to add or delete any other devices without reset all settings to their default values. The biggest issue for me was that it would constantly drop the connection with my wireless printer. Sent it back.",

But when you go into other rooms in the house, the signal gets weak and spotty. And don't even think about getting signal upstairs. I ended up using an old Linksys upstairs...which outperforms this thing. The features are great, but if you need it for WiFi, forget it. It just isn't worth the family's frustration.",

      "text": "This router has ok speed, though not as fast as I expected, and to be honest I didn't care for the speed after I saw the atrocious admin interface and the lack of functionality. I needed a good QoS engine, that at least allow me to setup priorities, this router simply doesn't have a QoS engine at all, plus it's missing a plethora of advanced options. I returned this product and bought the D-Link DIR-655 instead, I've been happy with the DIR-655. If you never use the admin interface of a router and like to pay a premium for supposedly faster speed, then this router maybe a good match for you. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend this router.",

My setup was as follows: Comcast --> RCA Cable Modem --> TRENDnet Router. This was apaprently a problem with the comcast cable modem having to be reset by simply calling comcast. This apparently releases the MAC and allows you to connect a new wifi router. Trendnet customer support was somewhat helpful but wanted me to do a \"MAC Clone\" which was leading nowhere. Hope this helps anyone else with this problem. Great product. Setup was fairly easy.",
