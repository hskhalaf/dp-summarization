Sure it does, about 10 of them. So can't play the games I want to play. It's also slow, the instructions that came with it are pretty much useless once you turn it on. I gave it 2 stars because it's big enough to read easily for books which is about the only thing it does well. NOT a real tablet.",

      "text": "I wanted a more portable tablet for streaming videos and playing music and the Scrabble-like game as well as to replace my very old Kindle. It works well for all those things. However, the battery life is fairly short (maybe 4 hours), and the sound is too low for comfortable listening at even its highest setting. I have to cup my hand around the speaker on the BACK (why is it THERE??) so the sound bounces off and increases in loudness. I also wish it had a way to hold it securely; the case looks great but is very slippery to hold. Presumably more recent iterations have improved on these problems.",
