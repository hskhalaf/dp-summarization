      "text": "I call this the perfect \"teen\" camera. I bought this for my teenage daughter, and she loves it. It has all of the \"cute\" bells and whistles that would appeal to a creative high school student, such as the stylus that allows her to write graffiti on pictures or the frame tool that allows her to add stylish frames to the pics. And just when you started to think that this might be more of a toy than a camera, it will \"wow\" you with it's incredibly sharp and color-true photos. It's a thin, light-weight camera ... it can go anywhere. And even pros will be suprised by the photo quality. It's a winner.",

    "title": "Sony Cybershot DSC-T70 8.1MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom with Super Steady Shot Image Stabilization (Pink) (OLD MODEL)",
    "description": "The super-slim, 8.1 MP DSC-T70 makes a brilliant lifestyle statement in silver, black, white or pink - with a giant 3.0\" Widescreen LCD for simple touch screen operation and spectacular photo display. Face Detection and Smile Shutter mode help you catch people at their best, the Sony Double Anti-Blur Solution and Carl Zeiss 3X optical zoom lens design deliver sharp color images even in low light, and HD Output lets you share images in high definition on your Sony Bravia HDTV or other compatible HDTV screen.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe slim little camera with a big widescreen. In sleek silver, pure black, porcelain white, or pearly pink, the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-T70 fits your lifestyle to a T -- with a giant, 3-inch widescreen touch-panel LCD display for shooting and sharing, simple icon control and touch-and-zoom capability, Face Detection technology and Smile Shutter mode to help you capture more smiles. Carl Zeiss 3x optical and the Sony Double Anti-Blur Solution gives you great shots in low light -- and HD output lets you share memories in spectacular high definition on your Sony Bravia HDTV and other compatible HDTV models. \n\n\n\nCyber-shot DSC-T70 Highlights \n\nHigh Performance \n\nBreakthrough technology for instant brilliance! Take superb portraits, capture beautiful smiles, and zoom into action with Cyber-shot advances. \n\nProduce clear, crisp portraits every time with Face Detection Whenever you shoot portraits of family members and friends, you can count on clear reproduction of faces whether subjects are perfectly still or moving slightly. Sony\u2019s advanced Face Detection technology synergizes with Bionz to deliver highly precise, high-speed auto-focusing of up to 8 subjects\u2019 faces when shooting portraits. This synergy ensures quick camera tracking of subjects, even when faces are slightly in motion, and significantly improves the performance of various camera features. For example, it enhances Sony\u2019s original auto white balance and skin color control to prevent mistaken estimates of the luminous source (resulting in a reddish image) and mistaken correction of face color. It also improves exposure (including AE) and flash adjustment to prevent under/over exposure of your subject\u2019s face and ensure suitable brightness. These improvements in turn help prevent blackout and whiteout in the subject\u2019s face caused by exposure and flash settings optimised for the background. Moreover, red-eye reduction automatically activates when Face Detection is ON. Together, these advances enable instant analysis of image data and optimization of exposure and tone according to the scene. All Face Detection features work together to deliver ideal portraits every time. \n\nMeet Smile Shutter -- the first photo feature that knows how to capture smiles For the first time in digital still camera history, you can capture joyous moments that used to get away! Whenever Face Detection finds a face, the unique new Smile Shutter mode spots a smile. Simply activate Smile Shutter, and the camera takes a picture -- automatically! Using Sony\u2019s proprietary algorithm, this innovative intelligent auto shutter system responds actively to smiling faces. To start, just choose Smile Shutter from Scene Selection, then press the shutter fully on the subject to be taken; the camera automatically detects the smiling face and closes the shutter. To detect the different degrees of smiles by your subject, you can set Smile Level sensitivity to \"high\" (to detect a faint smile), \"medium\" (for a normal smile), or \"low\" (for a hearty laugh). If there are several subjects in the frame, you can use the Touch Screen to specify the smiling face you want to take as the main subject -- or let the Smile Shutter choose the main subject and take the picture. Moreover, the Smile Shutter is great for taking horizontal as well as vertical pictures -- including group pictures where everybody is smiling, and self-portrait shots that automatically catch spontaneous smiles at the right moment. Think of the countless smiles you never want to miss -- a child\u2019s innocent grin, joyful faces of family and friends, your own happy face in travel photos -- and use Smile Shutter to turn good times and good feelings into treasured shots. Time after time, you\u2019ll smile at the results! \n\nEnjoy 8.1 megapixels of exquisite detail Sony's acclaimed 8.1 megapixel Super HAD CCD offers high-resolution performance in compact dimensions, as well as numerous advances available only from the world\u2019s leading CCD manufacturer. For example, an advanced sensor configuration reduces the gaps between microlenses so that each sensor captures more light for brighter, more accurate images with less noise. Clear, faithful image reproduction is now yours to enjoy. \n\nSharpen your edge with the Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar lens The DSC-T70 gives your images the startling accuracy and extra emotional impact of a highly renowned Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar lens. Originally designed in Germany, this high-contrast lens delivers natural clarity without distortion or noise. It\u2019s just the right complement to Sony\u2019s high-resolution CCD and 3x optical zoom. \n\nThe DSC-T70\u2019s 3x optical zoom, together with smooth, seamless zooming from 1x to 15x, expands your photographic possibilities. You can capture magnificent scenes at the 1x setting, zoom closer with perfect clarity using 3x optical zoom, attain 5.1x zooming at high-definition quality with HD Smart Zoom (16:9), or focus on minute details like faraway flowers with 15x Smart Zoom (VGA). Whether you\u2019re photographing natural scenes or capturing the facial expressions of distant loved ones, the DSC-T70\u2019s powerful zooming capabilities let you make the most of memorable shutter opportunities. \n\nYou can even zoom faraway subjects up close when recording movies with the new T series. The maximum 3x optical zooming power is equivalent to that of many DV camcorders and captures movies that are just as impressive. \n\nSony boosts your photographic potential with Bionz The cutting-edge Bionz imaging processor, first introduced on the Sony a digital single-lens reflex camera, is now available on a Cyber-shot. Bionz takes advantage of Sony\u2019s accumulated imaging technology to digitally process the high-resolution image data from the 8.1-megapixel CCD at high speeds and deliver dynamically clear, high-resolution images with natural color reproduction and minimal noise. It\u2019s a level of precision unheard of in small cameras. \n\nOptimize the dynamic range of your images automatically D-Range optimization employs a sophisticated image analysis algorithm originally developed by Sony to automatically determine the best exposure and contrast settings for optimal dynamic range in almost any shooting environment. In this way, the DRO gives your images a natural look with clearer details that match what you see with your naked eye. This is especially effective when shooting backlit portraits or any scene with dramatic contrast between background and foreground lighting. For example, the details of stained glass in a high-rise cathedral can be captured along with the deep blue sky. \n\nA clearly better solution: Double \"Anti-blur\" Sony\u2019s Double \"Anti-blur\" Solution reduces blur in your images -- both subject shake blur and camera shake blur -- through an intelligent combination of Sony\u2019s original Super SteadyShot optical image stabilizer and high sensitivity shooting up to ISO3200. These features are highly effective at reducing blur even when shooting fast-moving subjects and portraits in dimly lit rooms. The gratifying results are extremely clear images every time you shoot. \n\nHigh Sensitivity suppresses subject shake blur When environmental lighting is dim, such as inside a room or outdoors at twilight, the high-sensitivity ISO3200 setting lets you achieve natural results without using a flash -- even if the subject moves. Blur is reduced and details are clear in the subject and background, so you can take full advantage of the camera\u2019s 8.1-megapixel resolution. \n\nSuper SteadyShot minimizes camera shake blur Camera shake blur, a common byproduct of handheld shooting, is effectively reduced by the Super SteadyShot optical image stabilizer. This feature employs a built-in gyro sensor that detects camera shake and a shift lens unit that compensates to help prevent blur. As a result, images are clearer in various circumstances, such as when shooting photos in dimly lit rooms. \n\nTouch Ease \n\nPhoto flair at your fingertips! Just touch the wide LCD screen for stunning pictures with unequalled Cyber-shot ease. \n\nObserve every detail on the large, 3-inch LCD The slim, compact DSC-T70 is the first Cyber-shot to feature a 16:9 aspect ratio 3.0-inch wide LCD, turning the entire back surface of the camera into a dramatic photo frame. This not only provides a comfortably wide viewing angle, even when shooting in 4:3 aspect ratio, but also serves as an elegant gallery for brilliant vertical and horizontal images. Furthermore, the easy to see 3-inch Clear Photo LCD Plus is designed for superb accuracy in color reproduction. The 230,000-dot high-resolution screen delivers superior clarity and color reproduction for exceptionally precise images, so you can easily check camera settings and capture beautiful, true-to-life pictures in vivid, natural color tones. A multi-layered AR coating reduces reflections, increases display contrast, and ensures excellent visibility even in bright sunlight. And, thanks to use of an analogue interface and miniaturised components, this large-sized LCD is big enough for shared viewing, enabling you to enjoy photos with your friends and family. And, thanks to component miniturization and downsizing, the DSC-T70 has ample space for a large-sized LCD, so you can enjoy shared viewing of photos with your friends and family. The result is unmatched pleasure in shooting, seeing, and showing your images. \n\nExceptional ease of use with the unique touchscreen The greatly-enhanced Touch Screen integrates Touch Icons and on-screen buttons for easier, faster, more intuitive operation, while the 16:9 aspect ratio wide screen ensures easy visibility of all controls. Moreover, the DSC-T70 streamlines operation with a simple, uncluttered on-screen menu -- showing just what\u2019s needed for convenient operation without confusion. Only icons and buttons needed for the shooting situation are displayed, allowing fast, stress-free operation without any hesitation. You can see all information at a glance, then just touch the screen to instantly choose from a wide range of camera and movie shooting modes, change settings and displays, or select from three display modes. In fact, it\u2019s never been simpler to capture and enjoy beautiful photos. Beginners and experts, youngsters and adults -- anybody can take great shots with the DSC-T70. Effortlessly! \n\n\"Touch it\" shooting function What\u2019s the fast, easy way to ensure accurate focusing? Simply touch your subject on the LCD screen. If you want to focus on a person, just touch that face to capture a clear portrait; if your subject is not a person, simply touch the desired object to activate the AF frame. Whatever you want to capture, just \"Touch it\" on screen for advanced shots made easy. Because focus adjustment is quick and precise, it lets you show your own shooting style. \n\n\"Touch it\" viewing function Do you want to playback with ease? Just zoom into the images you want with the \"Touch it\" viewing function. Then, adjust viewing with right/left and up/down keys for picture replay or viewing on a full screen. \n\nArea key function Switch off the icon display to allow picture replay or viewing on a full screen. Even with the display icon OFF, you can forward/rewind screen images smoothly by simply touching the right/left part of the LCD screen. \n\nThree selectable display modes for Camera Mode and Playback Mode Three display modes can be selected simply by pressing the DISP button for both Camera Mode and Playback Mode. In all of the three display modes, the histogram display On/Off can be selected and the LCD brightness can be adjusted to either Normal or Bright. \n\nEnjoyment \n\nPhoto and slide show enjoyment for all! Delight friends and family with your Cyber-shot experiences in dazzling high-definition TV. \n\nPlay your images and slide shows on high-definition TVs Now the images you shoot can easily be displayed in full HD quality on a high-definition TV such as Sony\u2019s popular BRAVIA. Simply connect your Cyber-shot via the optional HD output adapter cable and enjoy individual images or personalized HD Slide Show with Music. The DSC-T70 makes it easy to share the excitement with everyone in your living room at a stunning 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution. \n\nIndulge in the pleasure of HD Slide Show with Music Now the images you shoot can easily be displayed in full HD quality on a high-definition TV such as Sony\u2019s popular BRAVIA. Simply connect your Cyber-shot via the optional HD output adapter cable and enjoy individual images or personalized HD Slide Show with Music.

You can use new direct playback with a single tap on the Touch Icon, start from HOME or the middle of the show, touch the screen to pause, or easily change settings. That means new freedom to show and share your slide show as you choose! \n\nPaint creative arrangements This function enables you to add a stamp, draw or write on your images using a supplied Paint Pen. For example, it\u2019s simple to add a message to a photo -- write \"Happy Birthday\" on a gift photograph or add a favorite message to a picture. Painted pictures are saved in the camera as copies, apart from the original pictures. Now, the DSC-T70 brings you more ways to enjoy the Paint function by decorating screen images with pictures or text.

Paint is a special way to make photo memories even more precious, and bring a personal touch to very special images.\n*Notes: Painted images are saved separately from the original images. Resolution of the stamps, frames, and painted letters has no difference between 3MP size and VGA. \n\nEdit your images with in-camera retouching Fun, convenient editing functions let you easily touch up photos right in the camera, even immediately after you shoot.

You\u2019ll see why the stylish DSC-T70 has an irresistible appeal for fashion sophisticates as well as photo enthusiasts. \n\nDiscover the new must-have Cyber-shot DSC-T70 -- a delight to see, and a joy to possess and use in infinitely creative ways. Strikingly slimmer than the previous model DSC-T20, this compact, contoured new model exemplifies the high technology of Sony\u2019s packaging and battery innovation. Just glance at three different aspects of DSC-T70 design and texture -- the simple yet memorable front face with its slender lens cover, graceful streamlined body, and shining metal sides -- as well as the wide LCD \"gallery\" display on the reverse, and you\u2019ll covet this distinctive little beauty as an accessory. Touch, hold, try, and make it your very own. \n\nEnhanced user-friendliness The convenient interface greatly simplifies operation.

For example, an icon guide on the control button describes the selected shooting mode. Additionally, explanations are provided for the Scene Selection mode, so users can easily understand the optimal shooting mode depending on the situation. The easy-to-use Function Guide not only displays icons but also provides clear instructions, making camera operation easier and more worry-free than ever before. Of course, the Function Guide can be turned On/Off according to your needs. With the Function Guide on, even beginners won\u2019t need a users\u2019 guide. As you get used to the camera operation, turn the Function Guide off to speed up the operation. \n\nGrid lines When framing your scene, the new Grid lines feature puts a grid on the images so you can analyze the overall balance at a glance and determine the most pleasing composition. \n\nMatch every scene with the right Scene Selection mode Convenient Shooting modes in the new DSC-T70 include Scene Selection modes that let you easily create beautiful images in almost any type of setting. Whether capturing friends at twilight with illuminated skyscrapers in the background, natural beauty at beach resorts, or fireworks in the night sky, the results are as spectacular as the scene you are shooting. Also included is High Sensitivity mode, which automatically selects the best ISO setting to allow a high shutter speed in any situation. Without using a flash, you can shoot outdoors at twilight or inside dimly lit restaurants and achieve clear, natural results. Moreover, unique new Smile Shutter mode can detect smiling faces, sense expressions, and automatically take pictures. This intelligent function handles all details -- focus, exposure, white balance, skin tone, flash, and even selection of the main subject in a group. It\u2019s easy for anybody to use -- so you\u2019ll never again miss a winning smile. In fact, you may not need to \"Say cheese!\" any more -- unless you want to continue the tradition! \n\nStamina and quick response The DSC-T70 extends your shooting pleasure with enough battery power for approx. 270 shots per charge. Sony\u2019s highly-efficient Bionz imaging processor accelerates start-up time and reduces power consumption. Thanks to the convenient combination of quick start up time, improved shutter time lag, and long-lasting battery power, users miss fewer photo opportunities when travelling, at sporting events and everywhere they go. The camera can also be adapted to continuous shooting and start-up time is approximately 1.4 seconds. \n\nWhen the memory stick reaches full capacity, or even if there is no Memory Stick in your camera, you can still store images in approx. 31MB of internal memory. You\u2019ll appreciate this feature when you forget to bring your optional Memory Stick Duo or simply take more photos than you were expecting to shoot. Photos in internal memory can easily be copied to Memory Stick Duo. \n\nPrint your photos directly from the camera You can easily print directly from the camera without using a PC. Just insert the memory card in a Sony DPP-FP70 or DPP-FP90 digital photo printer, select images on the high quality color LCD, and print away! Or when using any PictBridge compatible printer, just connect it to Cyber-shot via USB cable, select images on Cyber-shot\u2019s LCD, and print! As for DPP-FP90/70 print quality, with Sony\u2019s unique new function, Auto Touch-Up, memorable shots marred by such problems as red eye, backlight, or focus are saved from the trash simply by pressing the pink Auto Touch-Up button. Automatically correcting these problems is one way the DPP-FP90/FP70 printers give you the strikingly beautiful prints you expect. \n\nPC organization with Motion Picture Browser Sony\u2019s advanced image management software, Picture Motion Browser, comes bundled with your Cyber-shot DSC-T70. Once installed in your PC, this software automatically organizes the images you upload from your Cyber-shot by date in a calendar format for easy searching. Basic features such as photo CD/DVD burning, adding dates to JPEG snapshots, and resizing images for transfer to Memory Stick have been improved for easier operation. And if you add an optional Sony GPS unit, the software\u2019s advanced Map View function can even automatically organize your holiday photos according to where they were shot and display them where they belong on a world map that indicates the latitude and longitude.",
