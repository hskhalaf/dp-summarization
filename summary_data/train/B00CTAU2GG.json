I do hate the lime green rubbery grips so I got new ones. I only had to assemble the pedals, handle bars, front wheel, and seat. After that you adjust the breaks and double check everything. It came with 2 reflectors but no tools so have your screw driver, wrench, and Allen wrench set ready. So far so good I'll update this if I have any trouble.",
