Again, nice product. It needs work to make it last. If it had only cost $5, then it would be worth the cost to time ratio. But that's also wasteful.

Upon buying a 4wheel pop camper, we wanted something that could be lightweight, easy to move around (in and out of the camper) and something that wouldn\u2019t wake the other up if one of us needed to get up in the middle of the night. These are exactly that. They have several different brightness settings and are so easy to use and recharge. We\u2019ll definitely be buying more in the future!",

However, as time went on the light grew dimmer and held absolutely no charge once in sunlight. I don't even use it everyday and it's not lasting long. Now, I plug it into the wall and turn it own. There's no rustic charm of camping and what not. I guess I should have bought a plug in lamp? Don't make these choices lightly, my fellows. Choose your light wisely.",

It wasn't so bright that it felt blinding in the pitch black of the evening and early am, yet it was more than enough light to find things in the tent. It didn't feel like anything extra to carry so would highly recommend.",

We'll be purchasing another very soon!",
