The thong part that goes between your big toe and the next toe is too far down the shoe, making it for my toes to nearly go off the top of the shoe and consequently way too much room left after the heel. Even the straps are too loose. Hard to walk and still keep the shoes on. I CANNOT RECOMMEND THESE SHOES.",
