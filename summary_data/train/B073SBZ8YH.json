It might not last as a Samsung 8xx but I am not expecting to use the full lifespan of the unit. I recommend it if you want to save some money. Quite honestly, any ssd from a reputable brand is OK nowdays. I might look for something better if you were doing rendering or you need and Extreme workstation performance.

WD support in India was more than pathetic and gave useless solutions which did not work. I felt I was dealing with a Mickey Mouse company. After spending about 5 hours on this I returned and got a Samsung SSD. The Samsung erased successful and the operating system was installed in a jiffy. Shame on you WD a once great company now makes a awful product.",
