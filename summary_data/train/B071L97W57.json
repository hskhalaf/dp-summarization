If what you need it for is very lightweight photos for your fridge, then this will probably work for you.",

I bought an a separate box of small magnets in an attempt to strengthen the fridge magnets. It did not help. I returned these sheets to go another route. For a fridge the magnet would need to be 3 times stronger. The adhesive, however, is exceptionally strong. Removing it was laborious. If you are looking for something to remove this with (from a metal surface) use windex, a hard plastic scraper, and a lot of elbow grease. I tried to heat the adhesive with a blow dryer, olive oil, no use. Windex!",

Before starting the cut I peeled the glue sticker off, and applied a vinyl sticker ( from sticky to sticky part, and then fed it into the cricut.
