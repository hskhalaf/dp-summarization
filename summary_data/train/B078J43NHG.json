This new/used Rogue SZ driver is exactly what the Dr. ordered; It came in excellent condition and looked as good as new. Callaway even followed with an email w/ a nice cert., how cool is that. After several rounds, I have put my old driver aside and have gone totally Rogue!",

There are chips/marks all over the club head like it never lived in a cover and the previous owner made no attempts to protect/maintain the club; and it's less than two years old (2018 club). All that being said, I used the club (one round) because I didn't feel like any of that would affect it's performance. The club seemed to work fine and I'm going to keep using it for now. I just wanted to temper other buys expectations.",
