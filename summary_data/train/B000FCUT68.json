But even they were not able to get the thing to download any music. I even tried it with an older laptop that I had almost discarded. I finally dropped it in the waste basket and headed to Toys-R-Us for an MP3 player for little kids that actually worked. I suggest that you discontinue even offering this product as it is out of date and no longer worth the packaging.",

This player is easy for him to manipulate and the buttons make sense to him. The interface to add your own songs off of CDs is a bit time consuming, but I didn't have any trouble making it work. The only thing that I haven't been able to get to function is the screen to draw your own icons for various songs. I can't see what I have drawn, but it is not a big enough problem to give a negative rating to this product. We love it!",
