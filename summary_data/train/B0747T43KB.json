Unfortunately, it's the flashlight that was the flaw. The beam is super narrow, so you have to point right at something if you want to see it. Not the best when you're using the cane it's attached to to keep you upright. Also the flashlight flickers in and out, sometimes necessitating a good hard whomp to turn back on. The flashlight ultimately stopped working altogether. Otherwise, this is a great cane.",

It was priced about the same and looked just like the Vive cane but it wasn't stable, wouldn't stand on it's own on carpet and was difficult to fold.",

Unfortunately, the button on the flashlight stopped working less than three months after I purchased it and 4 days after the window to return it ended. The reason I purchased thiz cane was for the flashlight feature. Now it's just another cane. I would love to have given it a five star rating but cannot due to the flashlight feature breaking after so little time.",
