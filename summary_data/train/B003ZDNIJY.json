Sadly this model doesn't do as well as I hoped. I constantly have to stop blending and manually stir which gets annoying. Also the smell of the motor running makes me think it's burning up from running too long. I would not recommend this to anybody who wants to blend fruit , ice cream, or ice cubes",

This classic Oster does anything I want it to do. Crushes ice with ease and blends batters and fruit smoothies in seconds. Glass container and other parts (except rubber ring) go in the dishwasher with ease. I bought it half price because it was a return. When it came I saw it was brand new in the box. Perfect",

The part that failed is not where the blender jar locks into the base, but the square peg that sits on the motor. This peg has a small screw hole in the bottom that was stripped extremely easily. A new piece may fix the blender, unless the screw on the motor is stripped. Hard to tell as of now. TLDR; worked well until the screw stripped. disappointing",

Easily comparable to or better than higher priced alternatives. Well worth the money. Definitely recommend.",

In addition to malts we make taco sauce and run the blender on high for a minute or two to puree the ingredients with no problems at all. This is one of the best blenders I've ever owned.",

I love that it is simple there is a toggle switch up is pulse and down is on and wow baby this things blends. Took only about 2 seconds and every piece of Ice was completely blended, no chunks at the bottom. I would pay $100 bucks for this easy and yet it was less than $30 this is a no brainer people",

From time to time I can smell the engine \"burning\", but in a way that says \"I'm working\" not \"I'm about to burst into flames\". Overall, solid purchase.
