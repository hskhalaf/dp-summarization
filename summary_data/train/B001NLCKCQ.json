I\u2019m not bringing back to that spot again. I give it 3 stars because it looks great and should work.",

To make it easier, I drilled a few holes and added paracord to keep track of the pieces. I love this thing!!!",

My only complaint is the neck area isn't a perfect fit, everything else is. Highly recommend",

As I looked out the window in the back yard there were 3 doe's checking out my decoy. They stayed about 3 to 4 feet away from the decoy. Then walked away.",

Was well worth the money spent.",

I can't believe these decoys have been around as long as they have and that's the best they can do. VERY DISAPPOINTED and for the amount of money, they are not worth it! I would not recommend this decoy until they come up with a better design for the legs on!!!!",
