There were no marks, smears, nor anything else on the ball to indicate it had been used, though, so not sure why it didn't have a product box.",

My only issue is that they came not all the way inflated and I didn't have a needle or the time to get one to fix that issue so I ended up having to give them semi flat balls and their dad aired them up after. They don't come in any particular packaging either just plain brown boxes which is nice for wrapping but not the best presentation. Just some things to be aware of.

The rubber makes it easier to bounce on concrete and on dirt. They already came inflated so there is no need for a pump. The little bumps on the ball make it easier to grasp and lay it in. They also came in a variety of colors and sizes so they can work for anyone. I greatly recommend these for anyone who wants to play outside. The balls don't become deformed from the heat so they are very worth it.",

      "text": "Granted the pic looks like leather but it clearly says in the description that it's rubber, and if you look closely on the ball it says 'durable outdoor cover'. This is for my 12 year old who has lost more basketballs than you can shake a stick at so I'm thrilled with it. I don't know what the bit is with the zoom turning the pic into another ball entirely, but the pic of this ball w/out zoom is pretty dead on except for it looking like leather. (I took the one star off because of that, though.)",
