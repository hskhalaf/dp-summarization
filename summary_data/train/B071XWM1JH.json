I bought the pods for my boxing gloves and had to take them out of the gloves and put them in a plastic bag after about 30 minutes. Smelled up the entire room and 24 hours later I could still smell it. (2) as noted by another reviewer, the writing on the pods is not permanent and quickly and easily rubs off and gets on everything. I can tell you that my gloves don't smell like sweat anymore but the replacement smell is just as obnoxious. I don't know if the water absorption part works because I didn't use them long enough.",

Only complaint is that the company logo is like screen printed onto them and somehow the printing is not completely dry, what ever the \u201cink\u201d is made out of is still like \u201ctacky\u201d to touch and has gotten on everything it has touched (mostly black equipment with the silver/ grey ink). So now I have the logo smeared and imprinted on my equipment bag, my gloves, my helmet, etc. So if they could fix whatever is causing that I would update to a five star review.",

I will say the fragrance is rather strong (has kind of a fresh laundry smell) and takes some getting used to, but it's much better than having stinky shoes. If I leave my gym bag in the car the fragrance is noticeable when I get in, so maybe if you're super sensitive to smells this could give you a headache, but for me they're great and I'm very happy with my purchase.",

The pods can also be placed inside of shoes, gloves, skates etc., to absorb awful odors.
