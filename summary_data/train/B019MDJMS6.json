      "text": "Great kit! Already came in handy fixing a 4wheeler while out camping. Only downside is that there are too many tools to keep any sort of order in there, just a big pile of mixed tools, but I'm not going to complain about too many tools :)",

The bag is very sturdy and there is room to add additional tools, supplies or accessories. I mean, this isn\u2019t a set of tools that\u2019s going to last a lifetime or is made to survive the NASCAR circuit, (and I don\u2019t think they claim such) but it\u2019s a really great basic set and can cover most do-it-yourselfer needs.",
