I have no idea how they get away with using the Metabo registered trade mark other than by adding the 'HST' to the name. Deceptive marketing and a scam.

We used to own a cordless B&D drill but it always ran out of power and eventually stopped charging after not much use. After being scarred by that experience we decided to get a corded drill instead. I love using this drill and have already done several projects using it. It is very easy to use even for a relative beginner like myself and the power is excellent. The trigger is responsive and easy to control speed with, and the reverse feature is useful. The build of the drill feels very solid while being relatively compact. Highly recommended!",

This lasted three screws before it started smoking. It made the crunchy noise my old skill drill made when it started to go- almost immediately. It is quite heavy and doesn't have the same smooth function as my much lighter skill drill. Aside from the weight, it runs very hot on the outside after only a few screws. I do follow the recommended use, so it is not from not knowing how to use a drill.",
