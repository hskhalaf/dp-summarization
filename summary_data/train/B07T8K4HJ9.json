A lot of the users also lauded the fashionable exterior of the shoe. The shoe was also very versatile as it can be used for both casual and long-distance running. However, one of the identified downsides of the shoe is its tightness and that it caused pain when running.",

I have covered 220 miles in the last 4 weeks and the black bit of the sole is nearly down to the white foam layer already! I just wish adidas would make there soles more durable, but somehow retain the light-weight nature of these shoes. Despite this, the shoes and I do get on so I just have to take the durabilityissue and high cost on the chin!",

However, I bought these on the basis that they are the latest adidas Ultra Boost and THEY ARE NOT. If you look on other sites the SS16 versions don't come in this colour, and the box I got these in specifically says SS15. They're last year's version, so fine if you want to buy them on that basis, there isn't THAT much of a difference I don't think. But don't buy them thinking you've found a good deal for the latest version of the shoes as I did.",
