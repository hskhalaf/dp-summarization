I don't like the open design. After all, it sits in a bathroom with all types of bacteria floating around. 2. It's compact size is what draw me to this since I have limited counter space. However, the plug sticks straight out in the back. This requires that it sit almost 2 inches from the wall. That's all most the depth of the item. It would be great if the plug was on the side. The whole point is to save space.",

It is slightly less small then a normal unit, and considerably less powerful. I suppose it is better then the other travel options, but I found it to be too cumbersome for daily use and too weak to match up against a full size unit. Completely unacceptable that you can\u2019t change the tip.",

On the down side there is only one tip and so far you can\u2019t even purchase an extra one from Water Pik. I highly recommend based on the water pressure alone.",

You can't just turn it upside down either because the wand hooks onto the rim. Also, as others have mentioned, the charging cord sticks out the back instead of the side or, better yet, the bottom.

      "text": "Pros: -Smaller, portable size (w/ travel case) so not unsightly & easy to clean -Powerful enough, gets teeth clean -Works better than flossing -Not overly noisy -Rotating head -Easy to operate Cons: -Only allows 1 user -Can't change head so hope it doesn't break, a design flaw -Plug sticks out 2\" from side so can't place in corner, a design flaw -Have to lean really low to sink so water doesn't run down arm & onto sleeve, countertop Other: -Smaller tank which I need to fill twice for thorough job, but it's easy to do...no big deal -Close mouth while using & turn off before take out of mouth...easy technique to learn",

      "text": "The power of this is vastly superior to the other travel Waterpik products, and it is noticeable more quiet than any previous model. The head is fixed in position, and based on reviews I was worried about it, but I honestly don\u2019t miss the versatility. My only complaint is the power cable: it\u2019s still proprietary (versus USB-C), totally different from all the other Waterpik models I\u2019ve had, and juts almost a full two inches out the back instead of being angled (so it doesn\u2019t sit flush against the bathroom counter wall).",

That's 50% more run time! Still, no regrets in the purchase, looks high-end and modern. Kudos to your ID team.",

      "text": "At five months pregnant my gum started to bleed. My dental hygienist friend diagnosed me over the phone as having pregnancy related gingivitis, she said I needed a deep cleaning but since I can\u2019t make it to the dentist because of COVID-19, at least get a WaterPik . Since using this thing my mouth haven\u2019t bled, and my gums feel better. It\u2019s portability makes it a little awkward to use until you get the hang of it, but I\u2019m pleased with this product as it will be easy to travel with ( when the world opens up again ).",
