      "text": "If you're looking for a basic, inexpensive tablet, then this will work for you. I've had this for approximately 1 month and so far so good. My uses are pretty standard (internet browsing, gaming, apps, etc.) Speed and interface seem to be pretty good, with a pretty good response rate. The battery life is pretty good, probably about 2-3 days with light to moderate use (about 2-4 hrs per day). I was considering some of the cheaper off brand tablets, but for a few dollars more I decided to go with the HP and am glad I did! So far this was a very nice little purchase with no regrets!",

The size is smaller than my last and no instructions or material in box. So it is used and you get just what you see. If you need help with setting up, have to go on internet and figure out.",
