Cord is long enough to reach my bed, which is perfect because I listen to music everynight as I go to bed. The way I look at it? It's a lower end Mercedes in the Mercedes showroom. It's a low end Sennheiser, but it still beats the crap you can buy in most stores. Recommended? Absolutely a great, inexpensive pair for the average Joe's ears.",

As I said pretty amazing. Mainly I'm listening to Radiohead's new album with these and so far they sound GREAT. & as far as Sennheiser goes I think these are one of their more inexpensive models but for inexpensive they're pretty awesome.

Sound is great. Not flat, so don't use for mixing your next big hit, but great for monitoring in a studio. The wire is thin, which is good and bad. Good because it makes for a lighter and more comfortable wearing experience. Bad because I worry a less-smart musician might step on a wire or pull away too hard and damage the wire.

I can wear them all day or just hang them high for everyone to see the large Sennheiser logo on the side, to advertise I have good taste in headphones.",

But the sound quality during the time they worked was so good, that I insisted on replacing them with the exact same model. I have some slight hearing difficulties, and these allow me to enjoy the full range of whatever sound I'm listening to. The bass is solid but not overwhelming, and there's no \"tin can\" effect like some cheaper-quality headphones or speakers. Not only that, but they are comfortable! So even if these new ones only last a couple of years, I will almost certainly replace them with the same ones again!",

I'm really glad I got this and my mom was very happy as well.",

So I guess I'll be using these until I find a pair that cover my ears like my previous headphones for studio use and when that happens, these will be my backups.",
