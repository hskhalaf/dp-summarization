My cat does not like spray noises but a realitivly easy solution is to dampen a cloth and spray the product directly on the cloth, then as your cat is sleeping try to gently wipe the fur.

They didn\u2019t like being sprayed with anything water-like...so I had to hold them down and start brushing. As I continued to brush, it dried quickly and they started to relax. It does make their fur soft though, so I guess it works. The cats now smell....like cat, just refreshed & soft!! Wish it smelled a little like Apple or Honey...or something.

Well on my end it was basically just like spraying my cat with water. My cat was not too fond of the spray so if you have a skittish cat like mine I would not recommend. So, if anything to make this better I would suggest a stronger or at least somewhat distinct fragrance and a foam version would be better.",

      "text": "Followed directions, sprayed from a bit of distance, even after running through with a brush, it made the cats fur look very clumped together. The scent is almost like apple scented marker with more plastic, so it wasn\u2019t atrocious, and it did work to clean the cat, but it wasn\u2019t the most pleasant scent.",
