Very pretty set for a patio or balcony - looks better in person than in the photos. Could be heavier weight, but for the price it doesn't feel cheap like expected. The pieces take up very little space when the chairs are pushed under the table, while the table is just sturdy enough to be used as a functioning table not merely decoration. Not quite as heavy duty as expected yet would definitely buy again!",

The open work design keeps the wind from getting enough lift to toss it around, and the cast aluminum is heavy enough to keep it staying put, without so much weight that it is hard to move when you want to. Highly recommend!",
