Handle with care. Seams or valve leak with little use . No detectable holes or damage, but the pads begin to not hold air after a few uses and seemingly careful use. Customer service rather unresponsive, except to encourage me to leave a great review. Here it is. Not buying a third, that would be $270 in camp pads in three years. I'm stopping with $175 and two defunct pads. Otherwise, great pad, right? Look elsewhere.",

I'm now testing out other camp mattresses. For someone who only occasionally goes camping or the like, then this might be fine, but for boondockers who are looking for something to give them a bit of padding at night, look elsewhere.

It's nice to not touch the ground, and as a side sleeper that is a big deal for me. I'll use it for a night or two but for any longer I'll put the pad on top of cushions or something to raise it. It isn't small so probably best for car camping, not backpacking.",

If I was really concerned with the size, I would probably go with the Thermarest. I bought this pad for overlanding, and space was not as much of a concern compared to backpacking.",

I didn't even think about this pad, which I consider the best praise one can give it. I felt comfortable, and I felt warm. I'm 6'1\" and 265 lbs, and I like to sleep sprawled out so the increased size was helpful also.",

I'll never get it back to the original packaging tightness but this sleeping pad stores away pretty compact already with all our other camping gear. Great buy!",
