      "text": "The shirt is as pictured and quite comfortable/warm. However, it fits big for the size. I wear medium in most everything and nothing super slim. This fits very much like a large and is quite boxy. For a sweatshirt, it'd be great, but as a shirt, I might have been okay with a small. Ultimately, I returned the shirt and got something different.",

      "text": "The Wrangler Authentics Men's Long Sleeve Heavyweight Plaid Fleece Shirts make a nice addition to my winter attire. The colors are nice and bright. I usually go for flannel over fleece, but the price was right on these shirts. Fleece tends to hold in the heat a little better than flannel, so I am looking forward to wearing them this winter in the outdoors. These ran a little large, so I will be wearing them as an outer garment over thermals and sweatshirts.",

Just to be clear I wear a medium in many other styles of shirts. I will be purchasing more of these wrangler shirts.",
