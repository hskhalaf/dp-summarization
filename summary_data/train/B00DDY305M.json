If you can figure out how to upgrade it to KitKat (I couldn't) it would be much better, as KitKat seems better designed for inferior phones. Android phone makers: please keep making phones this size!",

Only compliant is that the glass seems to scratch easily. Barely after a couple of weeks I have a few visible scratches - not sure if it is due to keys in the pocket or sand. Never had this issue with my older HTC G2 phone which I had for several years.",

I like its size, power, battery, almost everything. Just disable Facebook Home right from the beginning and you'll get almost pure Android for the fraction of the price of big rivals.
