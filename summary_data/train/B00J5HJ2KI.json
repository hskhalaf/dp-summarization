Who would box 2 small plastic containers that if one looks at the top cap flies off with two 10 lb bottles of liquid sealant? No padding - so guess what? The two 10 lb bottles of sealant crashed on top of the small containers and popped the lid on one. When I opened the plastic bag surrounding the Cameo cleaner containers, one of them popped its lid completely off and cleaner went everywhere. I am now down 1/2 Cameo cleaner as I could not salvage any that spilled. Jeez.",

Main reason I really like Cameo...and I realize that this is a bit silly...it's the container. It's actually got a lid that snaps closed. Most of the others that are available come in these paperboard containers with no lid...they kind of remind me of something I would have found under grandma's kitchen sink. So seeing how they're all pretty similar in formula anyway...the container puts this one over the top for me.",
