BIG difference. So while I love the product, buyer be aware of what you're getting in volume for your money.",

Suddenly, she refused to eat it so I had to trick her (put her favorite treats on top) to eat the food. Then she would puke everything after an hour or so. So i switched the food and now she has never puked since. Will not buy this anymore.!!!",
