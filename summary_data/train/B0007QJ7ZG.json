They will most likely last a long time, but I will purchase again when the time comes.

      "text": "These beeswax color blocks are great for older kids or adults who want to create sweeping lines of color. They are probably less appropriate for little toddler and pre-schooler's hands, and they are NOT safe for them because they are NOT 100% BEESWAX. All the Stockmar Beeswax art crayons are really excellent for laying down color on paper. But be advised, they are only 10% beeswax. I think that Stockmar should be required to be much more clear on their lables that their crayons are only a small percentage of beeswax",

After a quick taste she realized they were much better for drawing than eating. Her little hands have no problem controlling the bricks and she loves to create masterpieces with these highly pigmented beauties. Mommy has fun coloring with them too. Great crayons if you are trying to avoid toxins found in the more mainstream brands found in the big box stores.",

My kids adore these crayons, and they draw well with beautiful colors. Very easy for small hands to hold the big chunky shape, although they also come in a stick form for kids who have mastered their pencil grip. These are fantastic, and I would buy them again. Only downside, tin is not well made and the hinges broke within days. There are small metal tabs that hold the lid and bottom together, and they loosen quickly so the top and bottom will come apart and must be put back together.",

Its been awhile since I had a box of normal stick crayons, but I'd gander the box is about the size of a normal 12 count box. The colors are good and easy to lay down.
