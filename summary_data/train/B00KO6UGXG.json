After I used the string provided to run up and down (warp) I immediately put the yarn aside and started weaving with strips torn from fabric. This worked wonderfully. I went to a thrift store and bought extra large (4XL) skirts in fabric I loved and started ripping into strips. Great tool to learn with.",

When weaving, you need to pull the entire strand of yarn through the rungs you create with the yarn. It gets tangled and takes a long, long time to make a single row. It's sadly very obnoxious to use and I wish I hadn't waited too long to return it.",
