It has 5 favorite buttons for FM favorites and 5 for AM favs. The reception is much better than any other portable radio that I have used. The screen lights up when turning off, but only for some amount of seconds. The batteries have yet to be recharged or replaced, but then I do not use it every day and never for any longer than 30 minutes. It seems very well made and looks like it, too. I would definitely recommend it. Sangean's name in this product is as good as Samsung, maybe even better.",

I've seen this with all 3 radios and several different NiMH battery vendors, including Amazon basics. [edit to add] In one case the radio wouldn't charge the batteries at all. Batteries would still recharge in an external charger. I'd give it 5 stars, but the recharge ability is essentially useless.",

I contacted the distributor in California and they are willing to repair the radio under warranty, but I have to pay postage both ways. This represents more than a quarter the price of the radio.

I don't like to have it plugged in so running on batteries is great for me. There is a battery life indicator so when it needs charging I will just plug it in. It was easy to set up with the great instructions and the sound is static free and easy to understand.",

I wish the volume control had a numeric scale (like on a TV), but this is a minor issue.",

    "title": "Sangean PR-D7 BK AM/FM Digital Rechargeable Portable Radio - Black",
    "description": "Color:Black| Style:SingleIf you're short on space, this Sangean AM/FM Digital Rechargeable Compact Portable Radio fits in small spaces without sacrificing functionality. Conveniently located controls make it easy to use even if you're just waking up and your eyes are still blurry. The radio can be set to automatically turn off after 120, 90, 60, 45, 30, or 15 minutes, so you can fall asleep to the sound of music, talk, or news.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nThe PR-D7 BK is a true ultra-compact portable AM/FM digital radio that's a mere 8\" long and stands 4-1/2\" tall, and weighs 1.3 lbs. All controls are conveniently located and you can see the frequency and time on the display. The tone is well balanced and excellent for both talk and music.\n\nUltra-compact portable radio that's excellent for both talk and music. View larger The PR-D7 BK has excellent sensitivity and selectivity and will surprise you at its ability to pull in those distant stations. Five presets are available on each band and the auto seek will automatically seek the active stations across the entire band rather than to the next frequency. The radio can be set to automatically turn off after 120, 90, 60, 45, 30, or 15 minutes, so you can fall asleep to the sound of music, talk, or news. A sleep alarm allows you to wake up to music or a beeper with HWS (Humane Wake System). You can power it with the included AC adapter, or six regular or rechargeable \"AA\" size batteries (not included).\n\nLCD DISPLAY\nAn easy-to-read LCD display shows you station and time. The segment-style LCD screen measures 3.2\" x 0.9\", and is backlit to be easy to see even across the room.\n\nA backlit LCD display is easy-to-read and shows your station and time CONVENIENT RADIO FUNCTIONS\nPLL synthesized tuning provides exact, fade-free reception. Ten Memory Presets for 5 AM or 5 FM station selection are available and easily visible in the large LCD display. Fill your presets with Auto Seek, which finds your active stations automatically.\n\nHUMANE WAKE SYSTEM\nThe PR-D5 features a sleep timer with a radio alarm to turn on your favorite station at a predetermined time. There's also a Humane Wake System (HWS) buzzer alarm, which wakes you up gradually with an incrementally increasing alarm instead of a harsh, instant noise. You can set the radio to turn itself off automatically after 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, or 120 minutes.\n\nRECHARGEABLE BATTERIES\nIn addition the PR-D7 BK can be powered with six rechargeable AA batteries which you can charge right in the radio. When the radio is plugged in via AC power, it will charge your rechargeable AA batteries, so you'll always be ready to take the PR-D7 BK on the road with you.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\n * Display: LCD\n * Display Size: 3.2\" x 0.9\"\n * Memory Presets: 10 (5 AM, 5 FM)\n * Tuner Type: PLL synthesized AM/FM\n * Dial Type: Button up/down\n * Alarm: Radio and HWS (Humane Wake System)\n * Speakers: 1 x 3\" full-range\n * Input Power: AC, Batteries (AA)\n * Dimensions: 8.5\" x 4.6\" x 1.6\"\n * Weight: 1lb 4.3oz",
