We tried to put them together with the frosting provided, but to no avail. I had to run to the closest Walmart to purchase FOUR MORE GINGERBREAD HOUSE KITS! I had to give them one star in order to post this, but they don\u2019t deserve one star!!! I want my money back!",

Considering that\u2019s technically what you\u2019re paying for. Decided to weigh the measly 4 mini bags and it came to .26 total in their wrapped packages! Big let down. Was worried I would receive the kit with broken gingerbread (as most previous reviews claimed) But luckily to my surprise they were all intact (That is the only reason this gets 2 stars)",

If the candy isn't flat, it's hard to get it to stick to the house without falling out. At least the Icing was decent. I feel like this was a great idea, but then you out it together and it's not.",

They baked the gingerbread pieces with the interlocking knobs on each piece. No trying to hold walls and roof to get it to stick together. The person working at Wonka who thought of this is a genius and deserves a raise. I will be getting these from now on.",

I got this at a discount store for $10; don't pay more than that.",
