      "text": "I wanted to like this so badly. Lightweight, soft, stretchy, collapsible water bottles. I tried two different sizes. Small was fine until you filled water bottles and then the weight in the front just pulled down and stretched and bounced. So I figured I need smaller size. XS everything held together better, but was actually too tight through my shoulders and was causing chafing especially because (even though the entire vest is made from that stretchy soft amazing fabric) the actual back of it that is against your back is lined with scratchy black mesh. So the mesh was chafing the edges of my shoulders that my running tank didn\u2019t cover. Amazon was amazing as always about accepting my returns.",
