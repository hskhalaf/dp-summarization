The TV doesn't ship with the silly frame interpolation that many do, making 24 fps movies look like soap operas, and it doesn't default to super color saturation, either. Least amount of adjustment I've had to do on a new TV. I honestly bought this as a cheap secondary TV for the playroom, but it's good enough that I'd consider a larger model elsewhere in the house.",

      "text": "The hardware portion of this devices is build with cost in mind, there are understandable trade offs for it's price. If the software was just built cheap I would give this 5/5 for price/quality (I accept cost limitations in inexpensive devices). It's the software that I don't find understandable here. The machine uses a 4core 1.7Ghz processor... it should be able to do more. Streaming from a mobile device to a TV is something I can do easily with a huge host of other devices but with the Fire TV it's not just broken but appears to be intentionally hamstrung. Amazon, FireOS needs more work, it's looking more and more crippled next to vanilla Android installs.",

One issue with my TV, not sure if its all around is it \"forgets\" the wifi network it was connected too and sometimes wont reconnect even if you manually choose it and put in the password. I found just pulling the power cord for a couple seconds fixes it. It reconnects automatically. Its only happened a couple times only when I dont use the tv for a while (couple days).",

My only gripe is that occasionally when using the Hulu app, I get these green glitchy lines that run up and down the screen. It only happens with the Hulu app, which makes me believe it's a software issue with the app and not the TV. I reqlly doubt the TV has anything to do with that. I havent used the Alexa features at all and may never use them, so I can't really comment on that. Overall this was an excellent buy for the money.",

Wish it would just stay on last input you used, if you weren't streaming. Also, i find it difficult to change the video settings for streaming mode. Not easy to watch and adjust. The variety of streaming apps available through FireTv will get you one step closer to cutting the cord.",
