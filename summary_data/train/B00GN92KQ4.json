But I couldn't even prove that to him as it wouldn't connect no matter how hard I tried and I have great wifi and new equipment. And don't hold your breath trying to get a refund back it's a no, not going to happen this is most definitely a hands down suck product I would have given it 3 for at least an effort for trying but even though its only 10.00 it pissed me off lol",

    "title": "Quirky Egg Minder Wink App Enabled Smart Egg Tray, PEGGM-WH01",
    "description": "Quirky and GE comes the Wink Egg Minder Smart Egg Tray that adds a new level of intelligence to your everyday lives and the kitchen. The Egg Minder features a built-in Wi-Fi chip to allow it to sync up to your smart device via the Wink app. Once paired with your smartphone or tablet you can now open the app from anywhere to view how many eggs you have which can be incredibly handy on impromptu grocery shopping trips or if you simply just don't think to check on your egg count before heading out the door. This alone is very convenient but the Egg Minder can still do more. In the actual egg crate next to each egg is an LED light that will alert you to which egg of the bunch is the oldest and should be used next and when that egg is removed from the Egg Minder the next oldest will be indicated and so on. The Egg Minder will also communicate with you through various push-notifications to alert you to when an egg has gone bad, an egg is close to going bad, and even set the Egg Minder to notify you when you are running low on eggs. The Wink app will allow you to choose at what amount of eggs left you want to be notified since a family of five is more likely to run out of eggs quicker than someone living on their own. Up to 14 eggs can be stored in the Egg Minder at one time and to keep the eggs safe while in your refrigerator it also comes with a protective covering. It is powered by two AA batteries (included) and is compatible iOS 6 and above, iPhone 4 and above, and Android OS 2.2 and higher",
