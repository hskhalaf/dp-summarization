I back my motorhome up my driveway and connect the hoes to the sewer trap I installed. The clear fitting that connects to the sewer gives a wonderful show of things going down the drain. Takes some of the boredom out of the work. Also lets you know when things are truly clean. Guess I am easily entertained. The included hose caps seal the empty hose \"emissions\" during storage which is a big plus.",

I had learned with all sewer hoses never to extend it more to than 80% of the advertised length if you want the hose to last very long. This hose is no exception.",
