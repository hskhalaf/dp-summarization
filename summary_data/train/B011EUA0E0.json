My heart was set on black but the white looks so beautiful I want to convince my fiance\u0301 to let me buy one for our room!

I added some felt chair leg protectors to keep the headboard from damaging the wall, as it sits up tight against the baseboard, but would flop against the wall if someone leaned on it. This is partly because of the frame attachment flexing, and the headboard flexing. Works great tho.",
