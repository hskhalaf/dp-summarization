      "text": "Should not have waited so long to purchase one of these to aid in bulb planting. Works well but two cautions: 1. If you have the drill on a high speed and the auger encounters a tough root the drill will jerk out of your hand the spin around so you have to be careful in this regard. 2nd Caution: The drill will get dirty so don't use your husbands most loved and expensive cordless drill. It will get filthy. I have now been instructed to use the older (i.e., hubby doesn't care about that drill) drill......lesson learned.",

      "text": "Works well for digging holes in flower beds and for mixing in potting oil. My only suggestion: Could use a longer reach on the drill bit end. Minor issue as I really like this mini post hole digger. As my Dad taught me on the farm, always clean up your tools at the end of the job. As a result, I am still using a spade I bought 45 years ago, by taking care of it at the end of the job.",

      "text": "I received the augur earlier this week. I tried it \"briefly\" today. Maybe 5 minutes of use. I live in Reno, Nevada and the area I am trying to plant flowers in is very dry and rocky. The dried up \"clay\" is like concrete. In the few minutes I used the augur it was able to make a small hole. My DeWalt 14.4 V hand drill was really rocking in that hard dried clay but the augur did make a dent. I will do more next week and maybe post another review after a more rigorous workout.",

      "text": "I ordered about 100 bulbs to plant in my flowerbeds without really thinking about digging 100 holes. This tool looked like it would be the perfect solution to my planting problem. I haven't received my bulbs yet, but I went out with the drill to test my new \"toy\". I can't wait to get my bulbs, as I will have 100 perfect little holes in my yard in no time! Just be careful around bigger plants with established root systems. I will undoubtedly recommend this tool to any gardener who will listen.",

      "text": "You can plant a lot of bulbs in a short time. A good drill to drive the auger is a must; I use an 18 volt battery drill. The auger smooth round shaft so it will show wear when working in stoney and/or rooty soil; drill chuck also loosens due to auger impacts with buried obstructions. Patience is needed when boring bulb holes because of soil conditions because you have to drill/withdraw/drill some holes. Also found wearing a glove on the drill hand helps to keep from getting a blister on your drill hand when putting in over 50 at a session due to drill movement.",

Mine has a lot of clay and it did not penetrate. It was nigh impossible to drill a 6\" hole except in soft soil. Next time I'm going for a longer augur, perhaps from the same company.",
