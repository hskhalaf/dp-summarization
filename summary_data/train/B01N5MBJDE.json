(8 & 12 years old) These hoverboards are built rugged, will go over all kinds of terrain, take a beating and retain good battery life. The older of the two boards is approximately 6 months old and hasn't had any issues. (Other than the 8 year old turning it on while it was upside down, which just took resetting to clear up.) Definitely worth the price difference of the standard board.",

It will not charge and nothing will start on the board, it was fully charged when she took it out. Now it isn't available for an exchange, you'd think a board that costs over $400 should last longer than 7 days.",
