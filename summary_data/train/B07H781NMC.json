Do not buy this toilet unless you want to use the toilet brush to clean it everyday as you need to flush it 2x or 3x to clear the contents of the toilet bowl. Pretty design, but pathetic that it flushes so weakly. Was charged $58 to return it too! In between the waiting to ship, the cost to install/uninstall, and the insult of charging me to return it...this was a $350 mistake.",

THIS DOES NOT PASS MASSACHUSETTS inspection! When I called the company back multiple times- they didn't answer, messages not returned. Finally got someone and they said \"not sure about product code\" will look into it and call back. No call back. Called again- same response. Talked to plumbing inspector(s) and general building inspector-- doesn't pass in MASS. Sadly! Plumber now going to have to come back out to un-install, and amazon would like it \"returned.\" The used toilet, eeeee- that would be fun to re-sell :-(",

Installed toilet came within .25'' from wall, someone obviously done the math.Flush is all about water conservation ;short but effective.And yes the 2 holdown screws were the most difficult task.Small space with sharp angles. Special socket wrench included helps a lot.You will tighten using your fingertips but can be done and the rest is a breeze.The flush mechanism looks complex;hope it never breaks!

I ordered the T-0019 but the toilet that I received was shorter than the 17\" high toilet that I have now. Deceptive advertising. The clean-ability looks good from the photos supplied by the manufacturer. What they don't show is that their engineer neglected to think of a way to cover the hidden \"nest\" in the back of the toilet that would make a great home for bugs or even small animals. This could have been a good product if it were engineered to match the advertising claims.",

Luckily I had done the walls in cedar an just had to cut the slots into the walls and put a frame around then to make it look decent. After all the hassle I love the unit.

I used painters tape to mark the floor where the flange bolts were set and marked the sides of the toilet where the corresponding holes aligned. Took a few attempts, but ended uo being alot easier than I expected. Hooking up the water inlet to the toilet first is a good idea. Lowering on 2x4\u2019s seems like a good option also. Fit and finish are excellent. Flush is strong, have experienced no clogs and no residual material in bowl. I don\u2019t find the seat the most comfortable, but only a minor issue for me. Extremely satisfied.",
