      "text": "I got this for my 8 year old who is just starting intermediate (little league) baseball. I'm extremely happy with the purchase! The main compartment is super spacious. We put his batting helmet, baseball glove and batting gloves in there. There's a separate zipper compartment for cleats but we use it for his dad's glove so we have it there for warm ups. So there's plenty of storage and utility use. What sold it for me was the versatility of the exterior options on the bag. The drawstring storage and Velcro is nice because it allows easy access and visibility for your frequently used items while still having them secured to your possessions. Nice that the straps are padded too.",

The straps are well padded so they don't dig into his shoulders. And the other kids on his team and at school have been asking him about the bag and where he got it. The extra compartment for the shoes is brilliant! His shoes don't dump dirt all over the inside of his bag now.",

This puts a real strain (weight pulling down) on the small pocket located at the top of the bag resulting in seam/stitching failure as happened with my bag after a just few weeks of use. On the positive side, J&B Trading who actually sold me the bag were awesome. A quick note about the seam failure and 2 days later a new bag was at my door. Now that is great customer service!!",

It holds her helmet, cleats, batting gloves, glove, ball, 2 bats and water bottle. There is even a place for phone and keys! Its wonderful. Its very roomy. She could even put a change of clothes in it as well. It has a handy fence hook to hang it up with the rest of the bags. It has ventilation holes for the sweatiness of after a game lol. Its perfect. She is very happy with it. A nice book bag style. Awesome!",

The bag arrived a few days before the estimated date, which was much appreciated, b/c the plea for a new bag was made only a few days before the season began.",
