This version makes you feel like you are actually Batman nos only bc you get a good use of the Wii U Tab but also the graphics are HD and they did also improve Batman's armor suit and also Catwoman's suit. I highly recommend this game to all Batman and non Batman fans, it's a must buy. Product came in a somewhat dirty condition but not scratched. I cleaned it and it looks new now.",

Maybe its because im playing it years later, but it dosent have that element that the first game had for me. Or the fun factor that most other wii u games had for me. Hell Blops 2 and Assassins creed 4 both felt like different games to me with gamepad support, but this one is just not sucking me in. However, there is nothing wrong with it at all, and I can see how some comic book fans hold this as the holy grail of comic book games",

At times the remote control batarang motion control was annoying, but you have the option of course of using the joysticks as well. If you are a fan of challenges, collectively, side quest type stuff, and the like this is certainly the game for you!
