The fabric is thinner. It doesn\u2019t hold it shape as well. The fabric is flimsy, doesn\u2019t feel durable like the old, overlapping fabric of zipper got caught in zipper when testing out. This doesn\u2019t happen with the old. The zipping area is smaller (see photos). It\u2019s here now I will keep. I will update review when it fails. I will not buy Burton again!",

As for the seams, they appear solidly sewn. As a light-duty backpack, it can sustain some basic abuse. However, I would not consider it for heavier loads or a prolonged exposure to the elements.",

The back straps also secure at the bottom around the waste for added support in case you have a heavy load. It's definitely cool.
