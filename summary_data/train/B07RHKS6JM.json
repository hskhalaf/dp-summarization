      "text": "So this hose is amazing. It's not just a bit different from the hoses you have used for decades (depending on your age). It is really revolutionary. The result is a hose that is dramatically easier to handle, to hang up, to store and to move about as you're using it. It shrinks to a relatively short very flexible length when water is not flowing through it. When water is flowing through it it expands in length while still being extremely flexible and light. The nozzle that comes with it with varying sprays works efficiently and well and seems solidly made, though we've had it for only about a month or so of use. Can't recommend the product highly enough.",

They don't last at all. I have one other hose of this type which has lasted for quite a few years, but this one looks like it will last a long time. It's much better quality than others I've seen.",

All the flexibility lessens greatly when the water is turned on so in that aspect it isn't as easy or light weight as it is when you start out.

That may be so but it is a trade off for me as an older person who can't lift a heavy hose to water my garden and flowers.

It's light weight, it contracts for ease of storage when you're finished using it, it's REAL easy to use, and it's durable. I will never go back to the clunky, heavy hoses of days gone by. I liked it so well last year, that I ordered another one this year. (each is 50 ft.) They fit together perfectly, and STILL very easy to use. I don't dread \"getting the hose out\" anymore.",

This is my third retractable hose so I am not new to this. The other 2 lasted barely a season. One exploded and the other one leaked through its seam. This one is amazing. It is so light weight and easy to maneuver. And clean up is so easy as it folds up to nothing! Despite this it feels sturdy and not cheap. I am very pleased with this purchase and the fact that it comes with a lifetime warranty if you register it.",
