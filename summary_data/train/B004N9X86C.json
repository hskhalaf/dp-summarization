It came with a rip on the bottom seam and all over the inside package. This is the very first tome I have ever had an issue with Amazon. Oh well. I will make due. Try it. You\u2019ll love it and I\u2019m not getting anything free for writing this",

However, I am allergic to self-tanners and instead of testing a small patch, I completely covered my legs. Within 24hrs of color development I had an incredibly itchy rash/bumps covering my legs entirely. If you are not allergic to self-tanners, this will be a great product.",

Unacceptable product. I would like a refund. I would not waste money again. I wonder if there are two different types of Tantasia? The one I used previously did not wipe off and lasted a good week.
