I thought I was the only one to have one at the pool until I found one other vacationer in the pool who also had one. A must have for a big guy and I'm 6'5 270lbs. and it holds me just fine. Update: It is holding up well. I need to buy a few more.",

      "text": "We have used fluid pool noodles for five years now, usually replace them every 1.5 years. We use them year round - outdoors during summer and in a heated pool during winter, 3-5 times per week. They are worth the investment, provide great buoyancy for weight above 100 lbs. Best to lay flat for storage, keep unweighted while drying out. If the outer plastic gets even a small hole, the foam underneath will take on water. Love the two tone!",

So much so that I will not let my nieces and nephews use for fear they will damage it. It is for me and my hubby only! Selfish you say? No way. Get one and you will see you won't want anyone to touch it! Not sure if it is fragile, but it does stick together to the other when stored. I started bringing them into the house, storing in A/C, not in the garage. I'll be upset the day it tears.",
