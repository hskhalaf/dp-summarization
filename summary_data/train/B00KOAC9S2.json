The largest pellets were too big for my three guineas to eat and they wouldn't try, the smallest yellow pellets disgusted them on a deep level, and the medium (regular) sized pellets they would pick out of the food and eat. As a result, the cage was a mess of uneaten large and tiny pellets and my pigs were always begging for more food because they'd only eat a third of what I gave them. These aren't picky animals, so Hartz is doing something really wrong here if this is what they think makes good guinea pig food.",

My pigs get super excited about this even more so than when I fed them Oxbow, which one of my pigs actually seemed to dislike.
