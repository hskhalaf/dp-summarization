I took him to the vet yesterday and they said his ears look wonderful and smell great. He still has minor bacteria on one ear but she told me to continue using this product. I will continue using this product to help prevent any future infections. Definitely worth the money.",

This one is natural, gentle, and most importantly, effective. A bit pricey, but this is the product we will be using for preventing and treating ear infections from now on.",
