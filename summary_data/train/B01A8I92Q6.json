Unfortunately, I can not find a way to backup (or copy) just the game data files to the device which was why I bought the 64gig version, but since it works with other devices I will be keeping it. To backup your PS3 you will need the 512GB version. Quite expensive and I hate spending so much money for a gaming console, but there was no other choice. Have ordered that one and expect it to work just as well with my PS3 as the first one.",

But by the other side the test Seq Q32T1: Read[MB/s] 314.1 and Write[MB/s] 244.5, this means that the PenDrive will work good for large files of 1GB or more.",

I am no novice to storage and flash devices. This one was an expensive dud for me. I would love to send it back in, but am not even sure I could securely erase my data from it first, so I'm stuck.
