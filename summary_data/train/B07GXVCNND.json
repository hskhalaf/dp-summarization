Reviewers love its good looks, perfect fit, and high-quality construction.On the other hand, the shoe only has one color option. It also feels heavier compared to other kicks from the brand. Additionally, a couple of testers find the sole to be stiff and inflexible. Overall, at its price, quality, and style, this model can be worth considering for fashionistas out there.",

They feel so cheaply made, theres no insole support, and the laces are tiny and thin. Unfortunately these will be returned. They are painful to walk in- the tongue is super stiff and presses into your foot with each step when you flex it. Other reviews said they don't soften up nor am I willing to risk being out $40 to try. Save your $ and try a different pair.",

I feel like these run just a little bit large, which is not a bad thing. Hopefully they loosen up a bit with wear but besides that they\u2019re perfect. Update: once I broke these in they\u2019re awesome. Very easy to keep clean, I clean them every few wears and they look brand new still after more than 6 months of almost daily wear. I love them so much, I wear them with everything from sports leggings to dresses. Highly recommend, updating to 5 stars.",
