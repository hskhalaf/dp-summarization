The problem continued and I was only able to get a flash out of the light when I whacked it on the side but couldn't get a constant on. I played with the connection and thought I fixed the problem until the light failed completely on a call out. I have emailed Streamlight twice with no response.",

The tail switch quality looks great, the on/off button works great and has a noticeable sound and feel when pressing during use, the momentary pressure pad is consistent throughout its entire lenght. Overall a great light at a reasonable price. Cons: Not 18650 compatible, only CR123A batteries fit. (Only reasoni did not give it 5 stars.)",

The light is bright, enough to light up across my field at night. It comes with what you need to mount it to most weapons, a plain button AND a wired remote pressure pad button, as well as what you need to mount the pressure pad and zip ties. CR123 batteries drain fairly quickly, (1-2 hours of light ish) but are very bright. I recommend rechargeable 18650 batteries... they are rechargeable and good cr123 are expensive.",

If you are looking for a rail light, get this. It includes an accessory kit as well to give you more mounting options. I ordered Cloud Defensive\u2019s Pad Mount for this Too.",

I haven't had any problems with the ProTac 1L or any of my ProTac lights.

It is more of a flood, but travels a good distance. In comparison, the Streamlight Stinger LED HPL DS Rechargeable Flashlight (FL893) casts a brighter bean that perceptibly outdistances the ProTac , but the HPL beam is not as wide.

If you're in an environment where you'll use a single mode, you can use the ten-tap programming to make that mode stick.

This light has a super cone of focus, it's great for near and far. I removed the picatinny mount and affixed it to a direct attach keymod mount intended for a Scout. The pressure pad can easily be directly mounted to keymod or mlok with some short low profile nuts and common hardware store screws. Or you can use the padded tape and zip ties that come with it. I'll most likely be buying more of this smae light for my other platforms.",

I like that i can use two different power sources because sometime all I have is a AA, granted the AA battery will run on the low setting of 150 lumens. The CR123 will run at at either 150 or 350.
