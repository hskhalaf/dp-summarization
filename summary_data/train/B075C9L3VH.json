Using this dip belt and a yoga strap, I was able to use this as an inversion belt and it works great. :) I just took a yoga strap and wrapped in around the foot pad at the right height. Then I took the strap that was included with this belt and put it through the yoga strap. I leave my feet in the normal place in case something bad would happen I could catch myself with my feet. Inversion belts are 200, this much cheaper and I and my back our happy.",

Of course it's going to fray if you use it with weights that constantly move. 2. If this had a chain with it, it would be more. When I bought this Inalready had straps and chains. Yeah it is a bit short. I adapted. It has pulled some good weight though. 400-600lbs But again, it wasn't constantly rubbing on heavy weights. When I got this I was looking for a good affordable way to pull a sled without the feeling of the front of my body being caved in.",

The small is a lot smaller than they describe. I returned the small one because it stated that it was for 31\" waist and it turned out to be too small. The medium fits perfectly.",

I find the width of the belt on your lower back to be a bit small and less supportive then I had hoped for heavy dead lifts and squats. That being said still a good deal. But if you intend to lift heavy, and use this bet to support that, buy elsewhere. If you plan to use this to ad wight to your pull ups and dips then its excellent!",
