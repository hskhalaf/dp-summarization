Another great feature is that the camera bump no longer rest on the surface when laying down! If you want something minimal that doesn\u2019t obstruct the look of the phone and provides everyday scratch protection, then look no further.",

I have a black model however so it's not noticable. Would not recommend for other colors. The side button is hard to press when put on.

For those wondering, yes this has a lip that protrudes above the screen, so placing it face down on a surface won't have the surface contacting the screen. I don't know how well it'd do in a face down drop though; probably depend a lot on the surface and texture of the ground. Oh, but you'll need a very thin screen protector, like the films rather than the tempered glass. I found a good film and prefer it over the tempered glass anyway: \"Supershieldz\" also on amazon",
