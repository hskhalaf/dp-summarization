      "text": "My complaint with this watering can is that it is unbalanced and not very ergonomic. When full, if you pick it up with one hand by the handle it will tip forward and water spills out of the spout. You must use both hands to support the watering can level to prevent this, or have a very strong wrist to keep the spout cocked up so that it doesn't spill. If you don't already have carpal tunnel syndrome, this will likely give it to you. Not happy with it, but inexpensive enough that I don't feel the need to return it.",

I like that this doesn't have the sprinkler on the end because some plants do better if not watered directly on the foliage. You can fill this almost to the brim and it won't spill out when walking. One thing I don't like is the handle kind of gets in the way of the kitchen faucet when filling it up.",
