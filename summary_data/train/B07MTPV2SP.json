UPDATE: two days after using for the first time I have a giant triple-headed cyst the size of a dime on my cheek. I never get cysts. This is not strong enough to pull blackheads but is strong enough to rupture pore walls! AVOID!",

You see the dead skin, white heads, etc. but I think white will really allow you to see what you\u2019re getting out. Lastly, sometimes what\u2019s coming off your skin stays at the top or side of the suction and doesn\u2019t go down to the filter. Even with those minor flaws, it\u2019s a great device to use and has helped so far in my skin journey during quarantine.",
