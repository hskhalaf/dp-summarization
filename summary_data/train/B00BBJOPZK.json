The blade profiles are more like a tomahawk with their width and weight. Excellent balance and they throw really well. I was skeptical about the nylon cord wrapped around them but it doesn't seem to impact my throw. If you want to throw something heavy with a lot of impact and penetration, these are a good value for the money. Solid, sturdy enough to withstand the newbie mistakes, and with more heft than many blades being sold....I enjoy tossing these a lot.",

Most ways require the knife to be able to slide out of your hand and the paracord crates drag and makes it way more difficult. Second is they\u2019re extremely wide, if your new to throwing, it\u2019s really hard to practice technique because it\u2019s so much harder to stick these unless your using 50% or more throwing power. Other than that they are pretty good. I like the heft they have, they feel solid and you can really put some power behind them when you throw.",
