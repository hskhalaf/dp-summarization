      "text": "Love it! I was unsure whether to go amd or intel 8400. Although the intel is currently better for most games. I run at 4K so the difference is much smaller. In the end, i chose the amd platform for upgradability. One clear improvement was with VR. I was running a GTX 1080ti with an overclocked i5 2500 @4.4. 24000 MHz memory. The CPU usuals was always about 80% which when oculus home was open. This caused juddering - especially with steam VR games. CPU usage has now dropped to about 20% and I get mo juddering at all. Even with significant supersampling. Lastly, i didn\u2019t have to re-install Windows. It booted and installed all necessary drivers automatically. Thoroughly recommend!",

However, I got my 2700 from Amazon when it was \u00a3161 which was over \u00a3120 cheaper than the X version and an absolute bargain for a fast octa core processor. Comes with the cooler, easy to install, although the cooler required a frightening amount of pressure to screw down, and is working well. Did need to re-install the graphics drivers for some reason and the Ryzen Master software, but no real problems if you are careful (I am not an IT specialist and have never built a PC, but do know the basics).

In more depth, if you are gaming at 144Hz then I\u2019d avoid unless overclocking and have fast RAM. Some games will be fine but others require more CPU power to keep the high frames. Overclocking to over 4Ghz and over 3000Mhz RAM makes a good difference. You can tell since frames increase and GPU load also increases when the 2600 is overclocked.

Definitely one of the best value for money processors on the market 5/5 recommended",

Gets noisy when it goes over 50\u00b0C but that depends on your case and fans.",
