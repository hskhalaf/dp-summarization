      "title": "Good chalk bag",
      "text": "It's a great chalk bag, but the zippered pocket for phones and such is too small to fit modern smart phones, especially if they're in a protective case. My Galaxy S8 is too tall with or without the case. My girlfriend's Iphone (8 or 9) won't fit either. Since I wanted the pocket for my wallet, not my cell, it's perfect. Closure cinches tight so you won't dump chalk all over yourself or your bag. It's a little bulky, but I don't mind. Can easily fit my big dumb hands in it.",

Definitely would not recommend, I wish I could return and get a better product, in the process of getting rid of it.",
