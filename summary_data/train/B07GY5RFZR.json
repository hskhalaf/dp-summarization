I tested it on myself before putting on my dog to make sure that I wasn't going to hurt him with the shock setting or set the vibration more than needed. My pit responds very well to the vibration. I had a problem with the display on the controller. The company stood behind the product and replaced it free of charge. The lifetime warranty is invaluable. The only negative I would have is that there are not seperate buttons for the functions, just a single mode button to change modes. I recommend this product.",
