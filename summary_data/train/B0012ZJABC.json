This makes it very easy to remove the hair caught in the bristles, and is the perfect accompaniment to Kent and other natural bristle brushes. Thank you very much for reading my review.

It does take some effort, though. The Kent rake is not delicate at all and you can use it vigorously on your brush (mine is boar). My brush is round. I'm thinking about buying a flat boar brush which I suspect it would be even easier to clean with this rake.",

The bristles on this cleaning brush seem to be packed a little too densely to really get in and clean out a hairbrush quickly and thoroughly. It does however do the job with just a little bit of attention and extra effort. It does the job better than using a comb or another brush. So definitely a worthwhile product if you have a good hairbrush that you want to maintain and keep clean. I just wish it was as over the top fantastic as the Kent hairbrushes are!",
