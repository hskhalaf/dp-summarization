Well.. the picture is pretty clear -- the protective layer on my knuckles just came off, though in other places the gloves are like new. Wish I could return them.",

While I would not tape for areas like yosemite or tahoe that has smooth granite, I find myself taking them out of the bag and using them without hesitation.",
