It happened to all the cushions, all different sizes, I ordered from this company. Super expensive so I am not happy about having to find someone to stitch them for me, especially since they are outdoor cushions, it requires more expensive thread. UPDATE: After 3 years the colour faded noticeably and now after 5 years they are garbage. So sad they didn't last longer.",
