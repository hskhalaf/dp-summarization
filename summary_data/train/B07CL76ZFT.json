Silica based litter causes me issues, which is why I switched from it more than a decade ago.",

The clumps stay wet and fall apart when I scoop them, contaminating the rest of the litter with that nasty ammonia smell. It's now worse than clay litter and the cost is ridiculous, where it used to save me money because it lasted so long. There used to be no smell and it lasted for weeks. Now it lasts 3 days and I have to toss all of it and wash the litter boxes. There was MOLD covering the surface of one of them. I have to wonder if this is why Blue Buffalo removed their name from it.",

    "description": "Flavor Name:Multi-Cat Unscented| Size:26 lbNEW! Improved Multi-Cat Litter Now Neutralizes ALL Odors Naturally Fresh has always outshined both the clay and natural litter competition in neutralizing ammonia odors, but it just made its premium walnut shell blend even better. That\u2019s thanks to a counteractant that tackles both urine and fecal smells, an ideal feature for households with multiple cat kids. Naturally Fresh improved Multi-Cat formula: \u2022 Neutralizes both urine and fecal odors \u2022 Is fragrance-free \u2022 Creates tight clumps fast, making scooping easier \u2022 Includes softer granules [Instructions for Use] \u2022 Fill a clean litter box to the recommended level of three inches of Naturally Fresh Multi-Cat Litter. This quick-clumping formula forms an easily removable clump of waste when wet. Remove with a scoop and discard according to your local regulations. \u2022 Maintain cleanliness by removing clumps and solid waste daily. Add more litter, as needed, to stay at the recommended level of three inches. \u2022 It is recommended that you clean and sanitize your litter box every 30 days to keep a fresh and healthy litter box for your cat kid. Based on a single-cat household, Naturally Fresh Multi-Cat Litter should last at least 30 days between changes, or as needed, for odor control. [Transitioning Your Litter to Naturally Fresh] \u2022 Start by placing one to two inches of Naturally Fresh Multi-Cat Litter in a clean litter box. \u2022 Top dress with enough of your current cat litter to cover Naturally Fresh Multi-Cat Litter. \u2022 Each time you change the litter, reduce the amount of your current litter. \u2022 It typically takes one or two changes for most cats to be comfortable with a new litter. [Precautions] Note: Wash hands thoroughly after handling used cat litter. Cat feces may carry parasites that can cause toxoplasmosis. Pregnant women and people with suppressed immune systems should avoid contact with used cat litter.",
