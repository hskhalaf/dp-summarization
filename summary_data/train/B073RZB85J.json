Over time the hole in the dry wall got bigger and it fell, luckily nothing was damaged. It may have been my old dry wall. Just be sure your mount is secured and check again every so often.",

Mounting cables to the wall would secure the dock better but all in all, I am pleased with this as I feel it protects the dock and console better than having the dock sliding around on the media center surface.",
