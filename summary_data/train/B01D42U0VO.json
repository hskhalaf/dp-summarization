Worked like a charm and the charger still showed 100% charged. My experience has been that modern car batteries do NOT get the 7 or 8 years of use they did a decade ago and most importantly, modern batteries DON'T give a warning before they die . Years past, a weak battery would struggle to start the engine but would get it going. Now it seems there's no warning, just a car that won't start. Having a car jumper battery handy is more important than ever.",

Starts vehicles on the first try, when I first used it I thought I had wasted my money. Now I've purchased six of these one for each vehicle in my family.",

Must say, knowing humans, adding the disconnect from battery step IMHO is good engineering. Highly recommend this product along with all of the extra stuff with it that enables restarting a range of products.",

The accessory case is too thick to fit in my spare tire area, unlike a smaller one I used to have, but I'll accept the minor convenience hit for how reliable this one has been.

      "text": "I bought this unit because I had been using the old \"plug into wall\" type units, that really didn't do a good job and required the battery to be hooked up for tens or minutes to h ours and it was not portable. After doing research on Amazon and reading reviews, I settled on this unit. Right from the box I liked it, it was all-in-one, and very compact. I can leave it in one of the storage compartments of my car so it can be used on my car or anyone else's. If you're in the market for a compact well designed jump starter, you should buy one of these!",
