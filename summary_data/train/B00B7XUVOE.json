I was worried it would be too bulky but it\u2019s not, it\u2019s perfectly sized. And I especially love how there is a zippered section where you can remove the extra storage part- which I didn\u2019t realize was detachable when I bought and I LOVE that because I know sometimes I\u2019ll just want the changing pad alone without the extra part. My only regret is not buying this for baby #1 because I would have LOVED it. I know it\u2019ll get a lot of good use for #2.",

You can lay it out in the back seat of a vehicle to change a diaper, and know that it will protect your car seat from getting soiled. You can get a lot of use out of this, and I would recommend it to anyone who is expecting a baby.",

But not a big deal. Well made, has lots of storage for wipes and other stuff as needed. The included wipe container is not that great, we purchased a different wipe container to use with this.",

I'm not a germaphobe, but public changing tables can be pretty gross and I don't really want to be touching that all the time. I think that if I had realized that before purchasing, I would have thought twice.",
