      "text": "Printer failed 1 year and 2 months after purchase. After a recent loss of power the printer the printer reports an error ZC. Evidently this is a failure of the power circuitry that requires a hardware fix. The cost of this exceeds the current value of the printer. The printer was otherwise a reliable machine. The printer was intended to replace inkjet printers which required ever increasing amounts of ink. Now I may have to return to inkjet. Ultimately this was a failed experiment in cost savings and reliability. Search results suggest this is not an uncommon error but it has no common fix. Buyer beware.",

Brother will not even let you buy parts directly from them to fix the printer if you have an issue and instead you must pay for the marked up parts via one of their repair vendors, the cost of which is more than it would be to buy a completely refurbished printer!!",

The printers we had in the past lasted a minimum of 1 year for $80-90/cartridge. With this printer you get about 2200 pager (not 3000 as advertised) for $80. That comes to about 4 cents per page, which is ridiculously expensive for a quality laser printer. After all, for double that money you can print at Staples or Kinko's. I will never again buy a brother laser printer. Printer is decent, but cartridges have an extremely low value when compared to price.",
