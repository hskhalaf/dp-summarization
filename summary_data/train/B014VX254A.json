The sticker on the frame I received does say it caters to up to 400lbs unlike other reviews have stated. The bike is very simple to put together, I assembled it by myself in less than 30 minutes; no special tools required, everything comes in the box. It rides very smoothly and very quietly. It is also very sturdy. The seat is nice and big and well cushioned for support. As a heavier person I am pleased with this product and it's made working out at home comfortable and easy!",

Once you put it back together, you'll notice that the hardest setting is like doing a squat workout. Thank you very much come again.",

The bike was quiet, easy to move and does not take a lot of space. Even though she weighs a little over a hundred pounds I bought her the Heavy Duty. Five months later a loud noise developed. I checked the pedals and pedal arms for tightness without any luck. According to the Amazon Website it is supposed to have a one year warranty though when looking, the companies website has no contact information. Very Disappointing!!",

If you\u2019re a casual user, this should be a great option.

There are sensors on the handles and some basic program modes to monitor your progress.

      "text": "It is big and it is heavy. However it is also excellent for smooth, quiet and stable biking. We own two bikes, the other is WIRK bike with a desk on it. I love the desk and think that it is as good a low end bike as the two SUNNY brand bikes we rode into the ground. There were 6 girls riding it back then. We bought this bike for my 6ft 185lb husband to use as a rehab bike, but it has become the favorite one for my teenage daughters too. I ride the WIRK one more often but IMO this is definitely the better of the two for a smooth comfortable ride.",

The label on the leg of the bike I received says 400lbs capacity. This thing is stable. I wouldn't try to over do it by riding it standing up or like I'm trying to fly. This is a good way to break up other options. I ride mornings while watching videos, sports, news or movies right in front of my big screen TV. Affordable! Will update in a few months. Might use washers to space the pedals a bit until I lose weight.",

It weighs about 55-60 lbs, and I can lift that without too much trouble. I rode it about 10 miles per day until the 6th day when it started making a loud clicking/grinding noise coming from the wheel assembly. It was fairly comfortable and stable and I enjoyed using it until the noise started. I am following up with Amazon and Exerpeutic to resolve the situation. I hate that it has a major problem within just one week!",

This bike doesn\u2019t feel cheap when I\u2019m riding it and it doesn\u2019t wiggle like some other equipment I\u2019ve used. CONS: I would give this a 4.5 stars if I could because the heart rate monitor doesn\u2019t work which is okay because I have a fitbit but after the first day it never worked again. The seat is a little uncomfortable so it you plan on riding longer than 20 minutes I recommend a padded seat cover.",
