If anything gets a little messier than usual like these tomatoes I just grabbed a dollar store toothbrush to help me clean hard to reach corners. It really has been very easy and rewarding to use!",

What's interesting is it is essentially identical to what the PrintDry Filament Drying System v1 uses. It does not have the lazy susan inside or holes in the side to print from it, and you have to cut the trays to get the spools to fit, but it also does not cost the $125 the PrintDry costs. So, for around than the cost of 2 spools you can get something that does the same job as something costing 3 times as much.",
