LED lights clearly causing cones of light and dark shadows. Color gradient from left to right. My third unit is decent but not perfect. I don't understand why $300 for an e-ink reader can't buy perfection.",

Love that the cover charges and helps keep the Oasis charged longer, but the part that covers the screen of the Oasis is significantly less sturdy than the origami cover for the Voyage. I also miss the cover having a stand to hold the kindle upright on a desk, table, lapdesk, etc. When reading for a long time, holding the Oasis gets a bit tough on the hands.",

I especially like the buttons that allow you to turn the page without moving your fingers to the screen. As for how to configure the buttons, the analog in me much prefers the \"reverse\" option where the bottom button moves to the next page. The screen is remarkably clear and appears to lack much of that \"bluish\" color that plagued my first generation Kindle Paperwhite and hurt my eyes during nighttime reading. I like the Oasis-Voyage-only Bookerly font too. Yes, the Oasis is expensive but I think it is a great product for serious readers.",

My only complaint is related to the touchscreen, which doesn't always respond as expected, although I suspect it might be mostly a matter of calibration. I touch a particular word, or a specific place on the screen, and the Kindle seems to think I'm touching a slightly different spot. This is most notable when I press the upper right corner to create a bookmark. Touching the extreme corner (which always worked perfectly on previous Kindles) results in nothing at all happening, but I have learned that carefully aiming for a spot about a quarter inch below the corner usually produces the desired result.",

I have trouble reading the pages; there needs to be more selections regarding brightness. I'm just disappointed in general. This is my 3rd Kindle and I am unhappy. The price is WAY too much for such an unfriendly little device. I cannot recommend.",

Do the math on your own reading habits to figure out how long you will actually read between charges. It's more days rather than months for my wife.

Amazon support will simply tell you \"buy a new kindle!\". Yeah, no. Never again. If you must, get a Kobo, or a cheap model kindle. The oasis is never worth it.",

Excellent screen resolution, very lightweight, buttons to turn page much less cumbersome than swipe, features rotating screen so changing hands is seamless, and battery life with case battery seems like it will be as good as promised. Would give it five stars, but absurdly abusive pricing prevents top rating. If you can hold out until sanity returns to Amazon price structure, you will be very happy with this newest version.",
