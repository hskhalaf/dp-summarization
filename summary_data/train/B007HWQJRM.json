I wear a 44 coat size an fairly I have broad shoulders so getting a solid aero tuck has always been really difficult for me. This bar allows me more elbow drop and an easier curl in of the shoulders. Who does not love cheating the wind? Traditional bar sizing for me would be a 440 mm wide bar and this bar dropped down to 400 mm wide bar. I am surprised how much I like the compact configuration and the drop is quite comfortable. Bravo again FSA.",

I am a casual rider (commuting & adventuring), have largish hands (glove size L or XL) and broad shoulders (using the 44cm). I often ride on the hoods and tops for casual riding and commuting but like the drops and hooks for more aggressive riding. This is the first bar that I find equally comfortable in those 4 hand positions and as a result I am spending more time in the drops. At least for my preferences and my riding style, this has become my go-to handlebar.",

Really good handlebars, and I would definitely recommend these. My future upgrade for the handlebars will still be fsa compact for sure!",
