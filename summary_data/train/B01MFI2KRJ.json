The little stitch markers are not the highest quality, but most of them work well. Some of the molding is still present, so I don't use some of them as they would snag the yarn with their rough unfinished-ness. The scissors are not good, and I'm not sure why there are some knitting tools included. But overall, the case is a great way to store items, and the handles make long sessions comfortable. The stitch counters, measuring tape, and durable case make this a worth while purchase.",

In the back compartment I added my aluminum hooks. The set of ergonomic hook alone are worth the price alone.",

I don't like that the little pouches for each crochet hook are different sizes, but don't decrease incrementally. It's just sort of random. The hooks that are included are a little rough, and the sizes are just sort of stamped into the rubber handles. I have to hold it right up to a light bulb, and keep turning it to see the size. They definitely aren't an asset in this set.",

I use the stitch markers, measuring tape, darning needles, and scissors all the time, and my Susan Bates hooks fit nicely when bunched together. (If I place them in the pouches individually, they are too loose and they fall out.) This pouch also fits a couple of my chunky yarn hooks (size L-N, not pictured.)
