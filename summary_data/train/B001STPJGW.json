To much of it will I wish this Company would get a clue and make the Florentine with carrots or pumpkin bits in it instead of spinach. I also noticed the meat part is like cut up pieces of rubber bands that's probably why the don't eat it. They always lick the gravy and leave the meat part behind. They won't eat pate type of cat food either. Purina please ditch the spinach for some of the Florentine flavors!!",

      "text": "After reading about the need for more water in our cats' diet on catinfo.org, and using their Goggle sheet, this was our first product tried as we move from dry to wet food. It met our criteria of <15% carbs, >50% protein, and the price is less than other brands. Our cats weren't quite sure at first but have decided they like this. Product has nice small chunks/flakes of tuna with a slight odor but as you'd expect from canned tuna. So far, I'd say this is a \"winner\" for our furry friends. Will be ordering more.",

      "text": "We buy our cat food exclusively through Amazon because it's much easier for us to have a box show up every month. We figured out the cost difference of buying it through here versus driving to the store, picking out the cans, and paying their price - no surprise that this is cheaper. Plus it allows us to continually provide Gimpy with a variety of food. We have our Subscribe & Save setup so that we rotate 24 packs of Elegant Medleys Florentine Collection, Primavera Collection, and Shredded Fare Collection using this Yellowfin Tuna and Shimp mixed in. My husband even goes so far as to sort and number the cans to ensure Gimpy gets a different flavor every day!",
