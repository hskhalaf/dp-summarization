Level 3 speed maybe when he hit 6 or 7. My only complaint is the tires, they are just like the big wheel plastic tires I grew up with so I am wary of when/how/price to replace them.",

I love the fact you have three speed modes and are able to screw a clip to keep your child from putting it in level 3, which is max power. It\u2019s top speed is 8 mph, but my five year old handles it pretty well. This cart is highly recommended as it assists with awareness and reaction time. Awesome cart.",

Get one and watch how much fun your child will have. I have been running a mile around the neighborhood with him riding next to me at 8mph. We have only had it for less than two months.
