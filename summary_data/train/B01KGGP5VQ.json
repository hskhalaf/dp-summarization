The light is bright enough to make sure you don't stumble on anything going to the bathroom. I gave it 4 stars because I noticed the sensor isn't too strong at times. It will go off if you open the door, but if you walk towards the toilet ( door open was already open), you have to get pretty close to activate it. A few times even with opening the door it didn't go off until I was at the toilet.I love how it shuts off automatically. I might buy another one for my other toilet.",

There was always something that didn\u2019t live up to expectations with the other ones I\u2019ve had. With this one, it met and exceeded my expectations. Why? The light sequence transitions smoothly, the actual product looks much more refined than its competitors, the motion sensor is perfectly sensitive, and it turns back off within a reasonable time frame. Many seemed to fail in one or more. So if you decide to get a toilet night light, this is the nicest and most intelligently designed one to get.",
