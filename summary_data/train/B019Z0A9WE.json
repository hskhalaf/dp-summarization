The holes are growing by the day so I won't be able to wear them soon. 2. The bottoms are slick. I work at a grooming shop and the floors are wet often, these are the first shoes I've owned that I'm constantly trying not to fall. I have slipped and fallen more than once; no one else in the shop seems to have the same problem. I'm finding that pink doesn't fix problems. Bummer.",

They are light weight (running shoes), which I need due to a foot injury that will not tolerate heavy shoes. This is a nice looking pair of sneakers that I can wear all day.",

They look great on the road and also for casual wear with both athletic and every day apparel.\n\nFila began in 1911, in the small alpine town of Biella, Italy, a place renowned for manufacturing the world's finest textiles, and weaving fabrics with impeccable quality, true innovation and extraordinary beauty. Born of the city and its traditions, Fila is inexorably derived from Biella's dedication to artistry, luxury and elegance. This is our birthright, it's in our soul, and it defines our future. We continue to enrich the athletic experience by improving comfort and performance with Italian design, quality craftsmanship and refined materials. There is no feeling quite as luxurious as that of playing in Fila, and that is the reason for our existence. We create what is desired, not what is necessary. Not just enough, but more than you need.
