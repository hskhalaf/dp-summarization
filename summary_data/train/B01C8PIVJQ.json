No shift. No creek. Put together super fast. Is well made. Also able to connect \"stuff\" if your so inclined. Plus has ability to add headboard. Hope they are around for awhile!",

Judging by the other reviews, i may have been delivered a lemon. EDIT great customer service--called me, apologized, and are sending a new one! Will edit again once i recieve the next bed. UPDATE they sent me an excellent replacement--a little nicer than the last because it has extra support on the middle bar. Wonderful customer service.",

With the recessed legs on this I was able to use my same bed frame, minus the slats (most of which were broken or would not stay in). I threw away my box springs that had become past repair. I actually could have skipped ordering a mattress that was ordered the same day; but, has not arrived yet. I just hope to be pleased with that too. Also, the bonus travel pillow you get with this purchase is nice.",

The look and overall quality is great however on both the top and bottom end of the frame, the mattress tends to tuck in between the edge of the frame and the last slat. This makes the mattress slope at the top and bottom of the bed. It can easily be pulled out but after a nights sleep, it slides right back under and the bottom edge of the 13 inch mattress is trapped again. Wouldn\u2019t recommend.",

I thought I'd be able to attach my existing headboard or foot board, but it doesn't line up right (Hemnes bed). I leaned the headboard against the wall and was able to use some zip ties to hold the foot board on. Once covid crisis is over I will head to hardware store for a better solution. The bed is sturdy and doesn't make any noise when there's movement. Very happy with this purchase.",

The more heavily used areas of mattress are pushing through the frame. I am going to try to fix it by tying several lengths of wire across the frame. I could probably use plywood as well.",
