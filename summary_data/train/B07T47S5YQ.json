I really wanted to like this locker but the product has been faulty and support won't allow me to return it but instead they will send me a new electronic assembly that I need to install myself. I have waited almost 3 months for this piece and will fall well outside of the return window if the replacement fails. Support wouldn't even do a full unit replacement for me..",
