      "text": "This is a very late review, but I'd be awful in not sharing my thoughts on this phone after being, due to total blindness, forced into a 'Smart Phone'. The ENV2 had easy-to-feel buttons on it both on the outside and on the inside, too. It also had a wonderful voice-over feature that was extra helpful in navigating the phone with extremely low vision. I ended up going through four of these until I had no choice but to get an iPhone. The iPhone offers a lot more accessibility for a totally blind individual but going from physical keys you can 'feel' to 'chicken-pecking' a flat keyboard has been very annoying. May you rest in peace, ENV2.",
