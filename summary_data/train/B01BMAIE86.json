Silent shutter makes the banding lines thin and often, silent off makes the banding lines wide and fewer. Unacceptable. I see others have a similar issues. I wanted a camera for general purpose not daylight only. This is true of RAW files in Lightroom and Jpegs. Back it goes. Note my a5100 does not have this issue...",
