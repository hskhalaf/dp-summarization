      "verdict": "The Vibram FiveFingers EL-X is an Entry Level Crosstrainer which has the lightest and the thinnest sole in Vibram\u2019s line-up of \u201ctoe shoes.\u201d The shoe takes a little getting used to because it is designed for barefoot runners. However, reviews show that once the right fit and familiarity are met, the shoe is easily one of the most comfortable and versatile on the market. Runners who can get past the weird style should have a truly barefoot running experience with just enough protection on paved roads in this shoe.",
      "pros": [
        "A large number of runners concluded that this is the closest thing they have to barefoot running without literally going barefoot",

        "The shoe dries quickly, based on the comments of several reviewers",
        "Several consumers appreciated the breathable upper unit",
        "Many runners consider the price as affordable and worthy of the Vibram EL-X\u2019s quality",
        "Traction is fairly good, as reported by a moderate number of runners",

        "Several runners felt that the uniqueness of this shoe\u2019s fa\u00e7ade didn\u2019t appeal positively to the people around them",
        "Putting on the shoe was a challenge for some testers"

I found them tight across the forefoot in all sizes I tried (EU 42-44, UK 8-10, I'm usually EU 43/UK 9 in other styles) which I assume is designed that way due to the lack of adjust-ability that laces provide. If you have a slightly wider than average foot, I doubt these will be comfortable.",
