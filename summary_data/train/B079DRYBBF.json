      "text": "08/03/20 UPDATE - a small amount of rust inside the can remains but so far has not affected its function. Using it daily for watering my houseplants and it\u2019s holding up. Just the perfect size to water indoor plants. Not heavy with full capacity. The spout welding is situated lower in the reservoir and is quite narrow - perfect to deliver water with a gentle flow directly at root level. Very stylish looking. Only concern is the visible rusting on the inside with a couple of months use. I do empty out after each use, still there\u2019s rust forming ... hope it\u2019ll not affect the durability in the long run.",
