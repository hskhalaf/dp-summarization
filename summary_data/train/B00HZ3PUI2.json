I am so burnt and I even reapplied TWICE at the beach \ud83d\ude23 I'm so disappointed that this didn't work the way I thought it would. I was so happy to try it in the sun too. If you want to use it for a regular moisturizer, I guess it isn't bad, but if you want this for the beach and everything- try at your own risk.",

I'd pass on this if you're prone to breakouts or have sensitive skin. Also, I apparently didn't read the details well enough before purchasing because this is the tiniest bottle ever and in my opinion, not worth the price.",
