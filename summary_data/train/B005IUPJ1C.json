The only reason for 4 versus 5 stars is that they are large and a bit heavy to move around. While this would typically be a good thing, their size and weight make them a little less likely to drag along each time you go fishing. Don't let this deter you from these if not a concern, because the quality/value is excellent.",

But if you a bite on a large aggressive fish, this thing acts like the fulcrum on a teeter totter and your rod may go for a swim! I recommend figuring out a simple way to further secure your rod and reel when using this holder. Otherwise, it\u2019s a great buy!",
