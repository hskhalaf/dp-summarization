I changed the combination on the locks on all three pieces. This was easy and simply involved reading and following the included instructions. I will be using the luggage for the first time this weekend. This luggage is somewhat heavier than typical nylon fabric type luggage, but the extra weight means your belongings will be protected.",

      "text": "Folks - I have a fundamental issue with the way this suitcase locks. I have owned dozens of numeric lock devices and have been able to lock the device even when the combination is not correct. These suitcases WILL NOT lock if the combination is not set correctly. This brings me to another point - we would all set the combination to be something different after locking the suitcase so no one should be able to open it. If TSA opens the suitcase with their key - then would the latches snap to open the suitcase ? if so - how would TSA rep close the suitcase ? This may be a fundamental flaw.",

I received the silver set today and the absolutely LOVE them! They are lightweight but made with an aluminum frame. I will use them in June on an intl. trip. and will place the large one that I will check in the lightweight bag they sent with it, to hopefully avoid scratches.",

And the best test of quality is even when it's packed full, the wheels are still easy maneuver - they don't catch or feel flimsy. I found this luggage at Macy's but it was twice the cost as amazon.
