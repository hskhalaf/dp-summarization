I cut 5/8\" steel, (rusty). it was slow to cut but it was smooth. It pretty much Zipped through the 3/8\" . I rarely cut 5/8\". but 3/8 is average more often. I was shocked at show smooth and consistent it was. it uses \"L con\" consumables. For what I paid, I could burn one of these up every year and it would still be worth buy another. it would be 4 years before I spent \"Miller\" money I am so happy that these things are coming down in price. Thanks LOTOS.....Nice work.",

My first one did just stop working but that is not without working for countless hours in a dusty environment basically all the way up while cutting and paying no attention to duty cycle. My first LT5000 made me a ton of money and with little to no problems. I bought another one (this one) without hesitation because I was so happy with the first. I only hope this one lasts me another 6+ years!!",

Only minor issue would be the manufacturer\u2019s choice of a non-standard plug. Finding a 3prong locking plug to fit was expensive ($20.00). Finding one that was rated (40amp as per manufacturer\u2019s recommendation) for the load is impossible. After the initial setup, the plasma cutter works far beyond my expectations and will be a fun go tool in my hobby shop hopefully for years to come. Even though it is rated to operate on both 110/220 I would recommend using the plasma on 220 as the cutting depth isn\u2019t hindered by a lack of voltage.",

It is easy to mistake because the 'running pressure' is different from the static line pressure. When you hit the button, and the air flows, you'll notice a significant drop in pressure while the air is flowing. To accommodate, you may need to \"overpressure\" your air. Experiment around with it before you burn through a ton of electrodes. Also, you can find consumable parts for cheap if you shop around.",

Once an arc is started it will keep cutting though about any surface. With this in mind, the Pilot Arc model didn't seem that necessary to us.

I am a rookie at this and could not maintain the right distance; too close, it screwed up the tip; too far, it would not cut well.

Also ordered grade 5 safety glasses, welding mask too dark to see lines or marks. Order extra plasma tips, not that they're fragile...but the aggravation of not being able to use the machine when you really need it! Definitely recommend this machine!!!",

Fearful of the prices of most larger known brands, I found the LOTOS plasma cutter and after reading the reviews - placed the order. Amazon's always been great about returns for unsatisfied purchases, so I saw it as a zero risk purchase. Opened it up, got everything hooked up, and was cutting an inch piece of metal with relative ease shortly thereafter. For small jobs, this is a gem.",

After reading the reviews I bought the LOTOS and WOW- it does everything it's advertised to do.It cuts aluminum, steel, and stainless steel with no problems whatsoever. I'm very pleased with this unit and will be a very happy welder if it lasts me 15 years. Highly recommended, big bang for the buck.",

    "title": "LOTOS LT5000D 50A Air Inverter Plasma Cutter Dual Voltage 110/220VAC 1/2\" Clean Cut",
    "description": "As one of the largest manufacturers of plasma cutting, tig/stick, arc (MMA) welding equipment in the world, Lotos Technology is proud to offer an extensive selection of industrial plasma cutting machine, LT5000D. Lotos LT5000D is designed and constructed to withstand extensive use in rugged industrial and construction environments. It is perfect for any home project too. Lotos LT5000D is a 50A dual voltage 110/220vac Digital Inverter Plasma Cutter (50A). Using this portable plasma cutter is cheaper than Oxyacetylene after just a few cuts. Less cleaning, less maintenance, less noxious gases, less fire hazard, simply less overall work and a better, cleaner cut. The torch trigger can be moved for a custom fit. It can be used in finger or thumb positions. Torch head is low profile for tight spaces. High Frequency DC Plasma cuts thicker materials than standard DC plasma cutters. High Frequency Plasma cuts faster with less distortion in the work piece. The LOTOS LT5000D Plasma Cutter delivers strong cutting performance in a compact package. An optimized design based on state-of-the-art MOSFET transistors provides high power output for thick metal cutting, as well as steady output for thin metal cutting. Using Pulse-Width-Modulation (PWM) technology, the inverter power supply generates powerful DC welding currents. By employing switch power inverter technology, the dimensions and weight of the main transformer is significantly reduced; while efficiency is increased by 30%. The LT5000D is an excellent choice for home DIY jobs and light duty small business projects.\n\n\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nInput Voltages\n\n110-220V, 1-PH, 50/60 Hz\n\nInput Current\n\n110-220V, 1-PH, 20 A\n\nOutput Current\n\n10-50 A\n\nDuty Cycle @ 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F)\n\n60% @ 50A, 110V\n\n60% @ 50A, 220V\n\nDimensions with Handle\n\n15\u201d (381mm) L\n\n\n\n6\u201d (152.4mm) W\n\n\n\n12\u201d (304.8mm) H\n\nWeight\n\n22.5 lbs (10.2 kg)\n\nGas Supply\n\nClean, dry, oil-free air\n\nRecommended Gas Inlet Flow Rate / Pressure\n\n3.6 scfm @ 65 psi\n\nInput Power Cable Length\n\n6\u2019 (1.8 m)\n\nMaximum Severance Cut Thickness*\n\n3/4\u201d\n\nMATERIALS CUTTING THICKNESS*\n\nMild Steel\n\nMax. 5/8\u201d(16mm) @ 50A\n\nStainless Steel\n\nMax. 1/2\u201d(12mm) @ 50A\n\nAluminum\n\nMax. 1/2\u201d(12mm) @ 50A\n\nWHAT'S INCLUDED\n\nPlasma cutting torch (1)\n\n9'9\" long, 3 prong\n\nGround clamp & cable (1)\n\n6'8\" long\n\nAir filter & regulator (1)\n\nregulates 0~150psi\n\nAir hose connections (6) \n\n4 clamps, 2 couplers\n\nAir hose (1)\n\n-\n\nWARRANTY\n\n1-Year Warranty\n\n\n* Production cutting thickness are the results of LOTOS's laboratory testing.
