      "text": "Needed some cheap bibs to get us through the teething phase. My baby's clothes were getting soaked from all the drool - we had to change him multiple times a day because he was drooling straight through the other bibs he had. I chose these because there were 10 for a low price. My expectation was low considering the price, even more so when they arrived and I saw how thin they were. They sat around for a couple of days before I got around to washing them... but then I used them... what a lifesaver!! They really are drool resistant. Kept his clothes dry even when the bib itself was completely saturated. Highly recommend!!",

I worried it would be too tight and cut into her neck. I added an image for comparison. The left side is a standard size everyday bib, the right one is this product. Why did they make the hole so small?? I threw these away, it wasn't worth my time to return it, given that I'm busy with a newborn.",

They are not as absorbant as the jersey ones but the plastic lining is a life saver. It's not only good for teething but also for feeding puree and cereal. The color does not bleed - I washed them in cold cycle and line dried. Hope they will last.",

However, the price on these is right and at this point we would be willing to invest in another set since they have done their job for a while. Just beware that they aren't great for long term use (as with a lot of baby items!).",

      "text": "I have a six month old son who is a messy eater and drools a lot (teething is SUCH a pain). I needed some bibs that would keep the moisture off of his clothes so I don't have to change him a thousand times a day and these are certainly doing the trick so far. The plastic-y size on the back keeps it from getting his clothes wet and clean up in the washer well. I haven't had any issues with them in the dryer, as it says to lay them out to dry. I may update if I have issues. Otherwise a REALLY great buy and great quality bibs!",

The velcro does soften a bit over time, so the hold isn't as strong, but they still stay on. The plastic backing prevents them from going in the dryer, but they don't take long to air dry.

However, if you have a younger baby, or older baby who drools or spits up a lot, I believe that these bibs would protect clothing very well from wetness.",
