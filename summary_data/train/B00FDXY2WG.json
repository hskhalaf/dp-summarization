They also like choosing what the alarm sounds like. There are quite a few choices, and it is loud enough that they can't miss it. It brings wonderful peace of mind. Great for family member who needs a little independence but might need to call for help quickly too. This will also get a signal through when phone lines and cell towers are down.",

Have been using this button perhaps 10 times per day for almost two months and the batteries are still good...with both units on constantly, 24/7. Another nice thing about this product, it uses easily obtainable batteries. Many similar caregiver devices use strange battery sizes. Why?!! Do engineers and designers not know that caregivers do not have time to find and chase down obscure battery types for replacement! Anyway this product works and is reasonably priced.

Make sure you have the two types of not-included batteries (3x AAA batteries, 1x CR2032 battery) so you have them when you sit down to assemble it. If I were you, I'd assume this review was done by the company. I promise that it isn't.",

I keep the unit at the head of the stairs on the second floor so wherever I am in the house I can hear it go off. I do take it in the bathroom when I shower just in case the water is too loud to hear the button. Using for about 9 months now with no problem. And it was pretty cheap.",
