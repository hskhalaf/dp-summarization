      "text": "I needed a decorative yet functional table for my bedroom. This table was \"sturdy enough\", had a low price and looks a lot more expensive than it is. I have some books and art on it which works fine but I would not use it for anything heavy like a TV. It was easy to put together by myself and took me about 1 hour. I gave it 5 stars for the cost, material quality and ease of putting it together.",

      "text": "I did not do much research on this product before I purchased it....shame on me. I will say it did arrive well packaged. However, the quality of the table is sub-par. The screws did not tighten all the way, the legs were out of line with the holes and once it was all together, it wobbled. My husband was able to make some tweaks on his own to make it more sturdy. I would return it but I like the way it looks and out of pure laziness, I don't want to go through the hassle of repackaging the item and shipping such a large box back. Just wanted to post for other consumers to beware!!!!!",

After 1.5 hours of trying a million ways, holes would not match up. From a distance it looks nice the way I had to screw it in to place but up close looks like CRAP. Not worth the effort to send back. Spend a $100 or two more on a decent product and save yourself the frustration.",
