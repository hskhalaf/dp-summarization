I also have a couple of these around the house for when I need to keep something metal in place (currently holding my small pieces of steel stock in the workshop). I would give these 5 stars if they had a permanent marking for the poles, the red line was great for about 5 minutes but wiped off too easily. These are not a toy. These will explode if you let 2 of them slam together - they shatter and can send off shrapnel. These are powerful magnets and when used safely and carefully are great for many purposes.",

Although I only ordered one for now, if anyone reading this intends to order two or more, try to have them separately shipped. There's no telling what could happen during FBA and shipping with strong magnets like these in the same package. Try not to rate it poorly because of your own mishaps with it. It is dangerous how strongly it will stick to ferromagnetic surfaces and similarly strong magnets. Rate products for what they truly are, not because you broke it or can't peel it off the washing machine.",

      "text": "Neodymium Iron Boron magnets are very strong. I had two of these, and you need a vice and pliers to pull them apart. they grab things about a foot+ away and with amazing force. I actually lost one this way, as I set it down and it grabbed it's counterpart and it shattered the other magnet and sent sparks in all directions from the force! wear gloves and be extra careful with this sucker. and definitely wrap it in padding to protect it. Rare earth magnets of this size and bigger can give nasty pinches, and even crush bones in hands, fingers, etc. not a play thing!",
