This was stored inside, totally dry, yet still tore, and once it starts on this fabric, throw it in the trash, it's done. On the upside, I filled out their warranty form online, they got back to me in 2 business days with a tracking number for the replacement they\u2019re sending. I\u2019m impressed. Excellent service. I still give them four stars, it is a great design, hope this one lasts longer.",

It fits our 2018 RPOD 179 perfectly over the A/C and TV antenna - snug once you tighten the straps, but not TOO tight. We even had enough room to pull it over the spare tire in back.",

This cover is made out of the same thing pop tents are made out of water goes right through this cover anywhere it is touching your camper... I will say it fit nice and looks good but the first night a train I could see the cover sticking to my camper.... I knew right then water was going right through the material.... Luckily for me I store my camper in underground storage where it doesn't get rained on but if you're buying this to store your camper outside please don't do it.... This is absolutely poor quality",
