The price for this Leesa mattress is fair for what it is performs just as well so far and I sleep just as well as I did before.",

I know everyone sleeps differently, so take it as you will, but I have had chronic lower back pain every morning for the past ten years. It didn't matter where I slept, and standard foam mattresses didn't help; I would always wake up, barely able to move, and have to literally roll out of bed. After only 3-4 nights sleeping on this mattress, I woke up with zero pain. Literally none. It was a stunning and life-altering change. I don't like to dramatize, but seriously, it changed how I live my day.",
