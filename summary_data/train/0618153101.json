It also has a nice little section for other invertebrates which are not insects. For its amount of descriptive information and photos, it is a great size. I can fit it into my satchel along with my specimen jars and gear when I go on a trek. 5/5 would recommend.",

The species featured are also good representatives of their taxon. This guide is honest about advice on getting from family-level to genera and species and indicates the number of species within a general to help users understand how large and diverse some taxon are.",
