We also have a couple of sets of magnetic tiles and i have to say that i prefer those. Somehow tiles support unrestricted creativity and imagination while these magnets, because there is only one magnet per side and the way they connect, are more restrictive as far as what can be built and how. My 9 year old enjoys this set although she mostly has to follow instructions whereas she never uses any instructions with tiles. Paid $76 for our set.",

The use a lot of unnecessary space to make it seem like you\u2019re getting more than you really are. The numbers are accurate but it was just a lot of extra plastic packaging for no reason. Otherwise a great toy and highly recommend!",

She already had a small set that she loved to play all the time but this set will allow her to get creative and make more elaborate designs. She is very happy with her gift and spends hours playing with it. Her younger brother also enjoys playing and stacking magformers. My only complaint is the that the square and triangular pieces of the XL cruiser set had grey spots and splotches on the orange side. The pieces for the XL cruiser are also lighter and of poorer quality than the regular Magformers. Since my daughter is already playing with her Challenger set I won't bother to return them.",

One year old little sister did get her tiny fingers stuck in between the strong magnets and complained, so not recommending for babies ;) This set has a good amount of pieces to be creative. This is the first set we got and I'm looking forward to expanding our collection. I expect the excitement to last quite a long time.",
