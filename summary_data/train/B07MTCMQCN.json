Ideally you should leave it out in the sun to dry. Only design change I would make would be to add another drainage plug in the pool part. I\u2019d highly recommend this product.

You will see some bubbles through the seams when the blower is on, which is completely normal, to avoid bursting out of the seams. I bought some rings to play ring toss with the shark fin.

There's a blue tarp/sheet over the slide for some reason, maybe to increase the slipperyness but the edges aren't sealed down at all so every time my kids go down the edges give them paper cuts. 2. The curve of the slide is severe enough that it flings my kids against the slide. Normally not a problem but the sides aren't high enough so my kids fly right over the edge and end up in the grass. For $500 I'd expect better.",
