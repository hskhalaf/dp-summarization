Good speakers, but we only tested them. We use a receiver. Also use the ps4 for streaming services. The t.v. has them in the smart feature and it does pop a couple of ads, but they're not too intrusive. Usually just asking you to sign up for Hulu or recommending a tv show to watch. I'll update soon. Prime free delivery. Got it at $509 right from Amazon. Great price!",

You might be able to get a price adjustment from your credit card company if you paid over the current price. This tv claims hdr capabilities but I was told by somebody that it's not full hdr. Anyway still shows good picture. I like the voice remote. Be sure to check your tv screen with a flash light before the delivery guy leaves. I noticed a small chip on my screen.",
