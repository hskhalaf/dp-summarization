It's great in terms of water and wind resistance, but it just isn't that warm. Also, the zipper falls in a weird place when the jacket is fully zipped, making it scratch against my chin and neck. I returned it because I needed something warmer for Michigan winters.",

It's warm, it's adjustable in all the right places, it's the correct size, it's not made with crappy materials or cheaply made, it has plenty of pockets but isn't bulky or overly heavy, plus it's just a nice looking coat. Maybe someone can find one comparable in quality for a better price, but for me, I got what I paid for and I'm happy with it: )",
