      "text": "I was really looking forward to having a cabinet to put all of my families shoes, but when I received the product it had a P65 cancer warning label on one of the panels. The seller failed to include that fact in the product information. The reason for the warning is the use of formaldehyde in the production process of this product, which over time can seep out of the wood eventually leading to some form of cancer. For more information on the results of this process, look up Lumber Liquidators and California compliant flooring. They used formaldehyde in their flooring and the consumers were getting cancer. This item is going to be returned.",

Looks great, shelves are a bit short but if you put in high-top sneakers or boots on their sides (like in a shoebox) they fit fine. Giving 4 stars instead of 5 because after I was done I noticed that I was missing 1 of the 2 center legs and no pre-drilled hole, no extra screws either. Not sure if it'll make a difference with time. Quality is decent, for the price. Otherwise, very happy, nice functional piece.",
