The zombies really did benefit from these. They look and smell much better now. That was a problem before. Hordes of the walking dead can destroy your property values. Unless they are perfumed and moisturized. Making the zombies presentable is very important if you're selling your house. Not how I intended to use them, but they still did a great job! Nice moist smelly boulders and zombies for me!",
