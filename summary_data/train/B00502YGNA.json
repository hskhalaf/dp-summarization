      "text": "A good equipment for stringing that is easy to use and quick to learn for new users as well. Have to initially remember to position the racket and the 4 side holders well secured else might cause issues. Stable and strong in its structure. Would recommend to only use it when mounted on a proper stand. The lock knob for the turn table is in an odd position and have to bend to properly see or hold it to turn and lock the table when needed. You only need it intermittently so not a show-stopper. Have successfully now done 5+ rackets in 4 weeks time since I bought. Love it!!",

This Gamma stringer is very similar to the old green one I had of some other brand, and it's much, much better. The string grip mechanism is a major step forward. The clamps are better and less likely to damage the string than the old metal ones I used. Overall, for the price range, I think it's an awesome deal.",

Gamma told me there is no difference between this and the x models, they only wanted to change the looks and add small drawers on the bigger models, so they came out with the X line, build and functionality its the same. Stringing learning curve is not too bad, the first one will take you some time, after that is just a simple process. It comes with tools and 3 Gamma Strings included (mine did). Quick to setup, small footprint. This one is totally worth it even if you are a club player. Stop reading reviews, get it and go out and play!!",
