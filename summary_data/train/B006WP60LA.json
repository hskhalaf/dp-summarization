It looks exactly as pictured. Shipping for my order was 1 day and it came on time. Packed good and came in perfect condition! Im definitely ordering another one just to lounge around in.

      "text": "I bought this for my mom for Christmas - it came in a package that was so small, I thought that can't possibly be the bathrobe and if it is, it's got to be a very small cheap bathrobe. I was pleasantly surprised. The bathrobe was in the box, however, I took it out and took it out of the plastic bag and it fluffed right up and no fuzz balls dropping all over the floor. My mom was so excited to wear it, and it is soft, she wears it almost every day. She felt like she was enveloped in love. Was pretty cool. Great robe and a great price. I especially liked the pink.",

Whomever said \"I'm average sized but needed a Large\" is correct - the robe is sized a little smaller than it realistically is, so bear that in mind when ordering. Either way - just get one and enjoy those brownie points <3",
