Even got a confirmation of my request via email. But nothing but silence. 2 times now. So even if they praise their 15 year warranty. You better do not rely on this. It's a total disappointment.",

The juicing is very easy to do and cutting the veggies takes very little time and insures the unit won\u2019t stop\\jam. I was really worried about the cleanup taking too much time and discouraging us from using it but it is so easy and fast. I would recommend this unit over and over.",
