My rashes subsided after switching back to a normal detergent. That ends my foray into \"plant-based\" detergents - I'll just stick with the old-fashioned detergents that don't leave my body covered in rashes. Maybe this product will work for some people. Other folks on here seem to have no issue with it, but I felt like leaving this review in case anyone else had a similar reaction.",

It seemed to clean our clothes ok - for those items containing little to no soil. However, for teenage boys that get dirty and smell even dirtier, I had to use at least 2 full cups and even then it struggled. I like the product but reserving it for delicates and other articles of clothing that require only a mild cleaning.",
