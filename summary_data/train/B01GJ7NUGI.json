They are examining the photos with QC team to investigate if this is an isolated incident or not. So FAR, so GOOD as they seem to be standing behind the warranty - I will UPDATE on final resolution. I have used it only 2-3 times a month in a home workshop and the internal hose guide bracket (plastic) has broken into several pieces. Just contacted seller for warranty replacement....until it is resolved, I CAN NOT recommend. Was highly satisfied until this happened. Will UPDATE later on resolutions",

      "text": "After having the hose reel for 12 months and 18 days, the ratcheting system broke. So now the hose wont stay extended which renders this basically useless. I've probably used the hose 12 times since I purchased it as it was just to fill up car and bike tires and that only happened infrequently. When I reached out to GreatCircles, they determined that the 1 year warranty had expired less than a month ago so there was nothing they could do. I can't recommend anyone buy this as it should not have failed and for it to fail days after the warranty ended just adds frustration to the whole situation.",

Today, while retracting the hose, I heard a piece of metal hit my shop floor. Upon further inspection, I determined that the plastic hose guide had broken, as seen in the photo. The product is less than 2 years old and has had very little use. In my opinion, the guide is a very poor design. Up until now, I was very pleased with the product.",

The brake mechanism to allow the hose to stop retracting has broken -- it is in constant retraction mode which makes it difficult to use as you are fighting it the whole time.
