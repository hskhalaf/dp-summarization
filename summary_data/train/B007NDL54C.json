Every time I took a video, it was slow to allow me to take pics (15-30 seconds), and deleted all the pictures that were taken immediately after the videos. It was slow to process anything. Thanks to amazon, they refunded me the money for this garbage.",

      "text": "The Sandisk 64GB SD card worked fine for 13 months and then developed an i/o error resulting in total loss of ability to transfer files to or from the card. I have contacted Sandisk for replacement by terms of their warranty. They require purchase records (thanks Amazon), card serial number (infinitely small on card back side) and photos showing the legible serial number. After submission of initial requirements they ask a series of additional questions. If Sandisk upholds their warranty with a replacement SD card, I will update this review. It took a few weeks to work through the Sandisk warranty replacement process, but they did replace my failed 64GB Sandisk SD card free of charge. Thank you Sandisk.",

For better organization and to separate data from programs, create an \"SD Programs\" folder for these installations. Tips: 1) For every program installation, save the installation file, etc., in another folder such as \"SD ProgramsBU\" (BU = backup). This facilitates easier re-installation later if necessary (and program removal does not delete these files). 2) If backup software does not include this drive (SD card) during backup, just copy & paste it to the backup drive (and avoid proprietary format created by some backup software). ;-)",

I'm running anti-virus and had many applications open, so your mileage may vary. The short video I took was smooth, with no dropouts or other problems that I could see.

But I do know that your high speed camera with 100 shots before going into buffer, needs a high writing card. This goes for and camera or other device that would need a high write speed. This is much more expensive but it's worth the price.",
