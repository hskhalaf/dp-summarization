I cannot turn my computer off or I have to powercycle the monitor. If my computer bluescreens (happens frequently now when the computer is on for 10 days or so since this weird power issue) I again have to powercycle the monitor.",

      "text": "Previously had a TN 4K monitor. Was waiting on a 4K IPS monitor. The Acer S277HK fit the bill. As expected, color reproduction is much better than the TN display and of course viewing angles are superior. Nice looking with all metal stand. Easy angle adjustment, but no height adjustment. I knew that going in. Excellent Picture. Another advantage is HDMI 2.0. I plan on using the HDMI 2.0 port when the 390x becomes available. Response time is 4ms when set to extreme mode, which is excellent for an IPS monitor. No pixel issues at all. Perfect Pixel Display for me. :)",

      "text": "As soon as I hooked it up, the screen flashed every few seconds. I tried using different connections, cables etc but the flashing still persisted. After about an hour of futzing with it, and getting increasingly frustrated, I decided to return it. I noticed other reviews say the same thing. My advice is to save yourself the frustration and headache of having to re-box it and look for something else.",

I bought it back in March and have it connected to a new 27\" iMac and I've been having the same issues as most with the screen going in and out / flickering. Now it's simply not coming on and Acer is of course blaming the iMac even though it's clearly not. This was the worst purchase I think I've made over $500.00. and the worst thing is, I have no clue how to fix it. I'd love to be able to return it but I don't think Amazon would take it back. Amazon should remove this item off their online shelves, it's causing more bad then good.",

The sharp 4k Ultra HD display is 16:9 in 3840 X 2160 extremely high resolution which is four times higher than Full HD displays. The result is a premium visual experience with stunning, lifelike images with an amazing level of detail \u2014 making games more exciting and movies truly cinematic. \n\nBuilt-in 100% sRGB color correction technology delivers accurate and consistent color thats essential to design professionals and visual enthusiasts while IPS Technology, supporting 178 wide viewing angles, presents everything crisp and clear from any angle.\n\nThe rapid 4ms response time delivers high-quality, moving images while Super Sharpness technology lets you fix details from lower resolution and and adjust the image quality to always ensure you are viewing it at its best. \n\nFor users who need to view their monitors for extended periods, the S7 monitor was equipped with Acer EyeProtect technology that reduces eye strain and provides a comfortable viewing experience. Flicker-less technology helps to eliminate screen flicker and a Blue Light Filter reduces exposure to blue light that can potentially cause long-term eye damage. The S7 also offers Low Dimming, which allows users to adjust down to 15 percent brightness in low light environments, and ComfyView technology to lessen reflections from external light sources. \n\n\nPOWERFUL SOUND\n\n\n\nAcer TrueHarmony presents a harmony of sound with enhanced bass, less distortion and dimensional sound.

Acer EcoDisplay technologies deliver up to 68% power savings, further conserving energy and costs. \n\n\n FRAMELESS ELEGANT DESIGN \n\n\n\nA zero-frame design maximizes the viewing area and allows the screen to tilt back from 5\u00b0\u201415\u00b0 for maximum comfort. When placed side by side, two Acer S7 monitors present an ideal multi-monitor setup, offering a nearly seamless viewing experience with their frameless screens. \n\nThe Acer S7 display was designed with beauty in mind. The elegant highly glossed white finish complements any home decor while the sleek hair-line aluminum front bezel with silver matt-painting middle frame are as sophisticated as the quality of the sharp 4k Ultra HD display presents. \n\nA slim magnalium stand ensures the display is stable and properly supported while its asymmetryical design makes it stand out and keeps the stand stable and balanced while offering some extra space to rest your phone or pen. \n\nThe semi-circle power button allows the users to interact more intuitively, and brightness buttons, OSD menu, and exit are perfect line up and invisible on the bottom of screen for keeping the clean image. The I/O accessions are well-organized on the rear side, and look consistency.",
