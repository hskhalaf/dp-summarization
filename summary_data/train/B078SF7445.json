However, they do not have the 12 hour battery life as advertised, they have died about every other day mid workout, and today won\u2019t even turn on despite being charged. The second issue, while the new charging connection is cool and probably more water resistant, why is the cord like 6 inches??? If I now need a new charger option that unique to these headphones please make it a usable length. Over all wish I just bought the jlab 2s again.",
