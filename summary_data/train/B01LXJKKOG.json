These were great for getting me into climbing but after 2 months of climbing 4-5 days a week I was ready / needed to upgrade (I chose the Tenaya Iati size 14... see my review there). Looking at the shoes now, the toe box is turned up when laying flat and the rubber is pretty worn and rounded. I just don\u2019t think the Trex rubber is as good other brand\u2019s rubber. Good starter pair for big footed beginners though.",
