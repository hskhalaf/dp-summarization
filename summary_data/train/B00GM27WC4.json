She was able to walk and play normally. Sometimes she would try to pull it off with a little scratch but wasn\u2019t able to remove it and she was quickly on to her next adventure. After a long walk it sometimes became un-centered over her back but was still doing its job and did not hinder her in any way.",

The distinctive reflective paw prints also allows me to identified that is my dog or another person's.

We go hiking a lot and with hunting season around the corner, I wanted to get something that will make her stand out and not look like a baby deer. I haven't tested it out yet in the woods but we will soon this weekend. Definitely serves the purpose of making your dog visible from a distance.",

It\u2019s light weight and my dog doesn\u2019t mind having it on. My one complaint, and it\u2019s a big one, is that after a couple months the reflective trim start separating from the vest. I don\u2019t sew, so I tried using silver duct tape to reattach it, but the tape wouldn\u2019t stick to the underside of the vest. So I left the duct tape in place and drove staples through the detached part. It seems okay now, however, this seems to be a common problem judging by the reviews.",

I solved that with a knife, but it would be nice to have it already cutout. When my other one wears out, I will be purchasing a second one of these for my black & white Husky. 100% recommended!",

It seems to be made durable, and the bright orange color with silver reflective strips should do the trick for visibility in low light or rainy days. The photos attached do not capture the color depth of the Vest. I suspect this is due to the reflective nature of the Vest. The lower strap shows the color more accurately in the picture. The Vest feels like it is water repellent, but it is not insulated and so is for warmer fall weather, like about now (end of September in southern New England.) Otherwise you can put it over another coat if your dog needs it! I recommend.",

      "text": "I have bought this vest over and over again for my dogs, as well as for gifts for other dogs. My dogs are very active and these vests last much longer than others I have purchased. I love how many reflective areas there are, including the paw prints, as well as the comfortable wide straps. The vest is easy to put on and comes out great in the wash (line dry). I use this almost all year round - hunting season, fog, rain, snow, night, you name it. It is easy to spot your dog from far away and in my opinion, is a fantastic product.",

I have had some bad experiences hunting on public land where other hunters are shooting in my direction at an animal that is right between us. There should be no excuses for such idiotic behavior. ALWAYS BE SURE OF YOUR TARGET AND WHAT IS BEYOND IT BEFORE YOU SHOOT! Anyway. This vest is extremely bright and there should be no issues being seen, or having anyone mistake her for a coyote or a wolf. She is a husky, husky. Weighing in at 80lbs and the large fits her by about 2-3inches. Thanks for helping to keep my dog safe!!!",
