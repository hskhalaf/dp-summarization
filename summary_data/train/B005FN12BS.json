The face of the watch is absolutely gorgeous. It's very durable too, I've dropped it on the ground, smaked thing's, bumped things and done so much that most watches would nick or scratch and it still looks new.

PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER.\nAmazin Customer5.0 out of 5 stars A big, bold attention-getter! Great watch!Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2018Verified Purchase The watch looks really good in the pictures. In the flesh, even BETTER. I just got the watch 2 days ago and the compliments haven't stopped. Everyone thinks this watch is worth WAY more than I paid for it. <$90 shipped! It's heavy and a nice size for a man. I have an almost 8\" wrist, had to remove 2 links to get a perfect fit. Buy that little tool for adjusting watchbands, you can get one for less than $5 shipped and it will save you a headache and scratches on the watch. Very cool to see the stopwatch work and then click the reset button so the hands go back to 12:00. Honestly, I was wary of buying an Invicta watch. YouTube videos talking smack. After buying this one, I'm definitely going to look for something similar in silver for variety. The only thing that is slightly irksome is that you have to unscrew the heads to activate the buttons. That's to be expected with a watch that is water resistant. Since I don't plan on doing any diving, I think the next one I buy will not be one that requires unscrewing of the crowns, just for ease of use. Not that I think I'll be using that stopwatch that much anyway, but if I do, it will be easier. Buy this watch with total confidence!Read more 28 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Amazon Customer5.0 out of 5 stars I really love this watchReviewed in the United States on December 3, 2015Verified Purchase I really love this watch. it's shiny and durable. I have huge wrists and this is a men's watch but it's perfect for me. Invicta makes the best watches ever.Read more 55 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Patricio Esposito1.0 out of 5 stars Unfortunately the clock brings the bottom button out of its ...Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2017Verified Purchase Unfortunately the clock brings the bottom button out of its position. It came sealed, I guess manufacturing failure. Unfortunately I live outside of the USA and the return cost is too high to request reimbursement.Read more 14 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Amazon Customer5.0 out of 5 stars Great value for moneyReviewed in the United States on December 5, 2015Verified Purchase Nice watch, although I wasn't a fan of the gold band so I swapped in a leather nato strap, which was done using a watch tool and took maybe 2 minutes. I have 8 inch wrists, and when it was delivered was way to big to fit me even, so you will have to remove some links to make it fit if you don't swap out the strap.Read more 71 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Allekkah3.0 out of 5 stars UPDATED - Band is Complete Garbage, but the Watch Itself is GoodReviewed in the United States on July 23, 2019Verified Purchase UPDATE - 26 July 2019 - Wow. The band is so loose and wonky now that it came undone by itself while I was just wearing it normally. I can't believe Invicta is trying to pass this crap off as a \"luxury brand\". The watch itself is still passable though. Just can't wait for my replacement leather one. I'm taking my review down to 3 stars.\n\nUPDATE - 25 July 2019 - This watch is starting to show wear on the banding after just TWO DAYS of normal use. I work a normal desk job and this band is already starting to show signs of wear where my wrist rests on my desk. The clasp is also MUCH looser and easier to disengage than it was out of the box 3 days ago, which is concerning. I can only imagine how quickly this thing is going to deteriorate in a month's time. I've ordered a nice leather band for it as a replacement. Not a huge deal considering it is a cheap watch, but I wasn't expecting it to be SO BAD. The watch itself is still fine and worth wearing though. I'm knocking a star off for the poor band though.\n\nThis review is more just first impressions than a long-time run review. I got this watch because I wanted something a little more dressy to wear to work/when I go out. The watch is presented well in a nice box so it would make an excellent gift.\n\nPros:\n\n- The first thing you notice about this watch is that it is nice and heavy. The metal is solid and shiny. It doesn't have that cheapy light feel that a lot of bargain bin watches have. I showed my parents and they thought it looked like a $1000+ watch.\n- The price. You really can't ask for something much better that looks like this at $70. No, its no SEIKO or Orient, but it doesn't have to be. Some people aren't enthusiasts and just want something that looks cool and doesn't break the bank.\n- It was easy to de-link and resize myself with a basic watch repair kit.\n- The chronograph function is very cool to look at/use. Very smooth.\n\nCons:\n\n- The second hand is NOT exactly centered on the minute marks. It wiggles between them depending on how gravity is angled on it. My guess is that the nut/whatever that holds it on center is loose. I'm not sure if I just got a defective one or if all of them are like this.\n- Kinda hard to read sometimes, but that's inherent to the design of an all gold watch\n- The \"warranty\" is AWFUl. It's more just like a repair service. You have to pay Invicta $28 if you want them to fix your busted watch I guess. In my opinion, you'd be better off just pitching it in the trash and saving that money for a nicer and more expensive brand lol\n- 26 July 2019 UPDATE - The band is essentially unusable after a few days. You HAVE to buy a replacement with this watch.\n\nOverall, I think this watch is a solid choice for the price point. I will probably update some point in the future with how it has held up to daily use.Read more 2 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse DOMINIC G.5.0 out of 5 stars Always with Invicta Watch. itReviewed in the United States on November 5, 2015Verified Purchase A masterpiece watch.I love everything about the watch.

It shines and hasn't scratches or faded one bit since I got it a couple months ago and if hit it plenty of times on hard surfaces. I can tell the quality will last. This watch looks even better on your wrist than the picture makes it seem it doesn't do it justice. Keeps time perfect and the clasp is strong. Amazing quality and you can't beat the price, I feel like I'm wearing a watch that costs many times more than I paid and I couldn't be happier, my expectations were high after reading the reviews and it still exceeded them. Buy this watch and don't even think twice!!! A must have for any watch enthusiast or anyone looking to upgrade their look :)Read more 31 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse See all reviews from the United States TOP INTERNATIONAL REVIEWS \nAiM5.0 out of 5 stars Looks like a much more expensive watchReviewed in the United Kingdom on April 13, 2020Verified Purchase This is the second Invictus watch I have bought, in truth I have more watches than I need already but I didn't have a nice yellow gold watch. When this came up on a lightning deal I couldn't resist the bargain that this represented.\nIt came in a lovely presentation box with warranty and papers just the same as a watch costing 30 times the price.\nI have worn it about a dozen times in the last year and it always looks good, the battery is still going strong (almost all my other watches are automatic) and it has kept excellent time. I have had some positive comments when wearing it and everyone that has seen it has assumed it cost many times what I paid for it. The colour is still great and I will continue to wear it whenever it goes with the occasion warrants it. I would happily buy another Invictus watch if one comes up in a colour I don't already have in my collection.\nAs always with amazon it was well packed and swiftly sent.Read more Helpful Sending feedback...Thank you for your feedback.Sorry, we failed to record your vote.

I know it takes a while after you first put it on after it has been in the box before being sold, but it is almost a week now - anyone else had this experience, I guess I need to go back to the supplier / manufacturer.Read more 6 people found this helpful Helpful Sending feedback...Thank you for your feedback.Sorry, we failed to record your vote.
