The fabric was smooth and the design is cute and if it hadn't been moldy I'd have kept it, because I think that my son would like the fun shark style, and the small size is good for a preschooler to use for practicing swimming, kicking his legs. We were planning to use it while he was also wearing a float vest for swimming. Think about that it got moldy just from being new and dry prior to shipping, and this kick board is meant for use in water. Amazon has deleted my more detailed review twice so I am keeping it very simple.",

My complaint is that after using in a chlorine pool and leaving it out standing in the sun to dry, the kickboard began to have brown mildew streaks all over it. I don't think it should stain so quickly. The design is not nearly as cute with the gross brown marks running down the board.",
