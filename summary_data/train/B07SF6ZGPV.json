Too much for a lint roller so I spent about 20 minutes picking the lint off by hand. It was still shedding lint all over everything. Washed it again. Same thing, but a little bit less lint. After the second wash/hand lint picking I decided to take a picture of all the lint I picked off, as you can see, it was quite a bit. My wife says it is warm and comfortable, however I won't be buying another.",

      "text": "Score for daughter!!! Thanks Amazon, it\u2019s great to be able to send my momma something to cheer her up when she is feeling down with the yucky weather. The color is beautiful and bright, I think the zipper makes it easier for her to get in and out of it. The Queen mother\u2019s words are I love the color, it feels amazing, she doesn\u2019t agree with me about the zipper, and it does run big so I would have definitely gone down in size. But all in all she is happy and I love seeing her smile with the bright color on her. #1 daughter scores again! Love my momma so much!!! Alyson Robichaux",

I went with what others had said and ordered the L/1X, instead of my first inclination to go up a size. I wish I had ordered up one size.

AND...the zipper didn't zip past 2 inches. I had to clip some threads and trim some fabric to release the zipper before I could try it on. Not impressed much. I bought it for the style and color. I considered seriously returning it but didn't want the bother. It is warm and I live in Oregon. Why can't this robe come in standard sizes SMALL, MEDIUM AND LARGE? 3 STARS.",

One of my favorite features is the double zipper. The whole reason I needed a new robe was because my previous robe tore on the bottom from getting twisted when lounging. Being able to unzip from the bottom up or top down give me the freedom to get comfy on the couch without worrying about tearing the fabric when it tangles.",
