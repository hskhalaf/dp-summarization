      "text": "The device arrived on time and was heavier than I thought. The instructions in the beginning were a little confusing as it had all APC devices to set up. Once I realized I had to find my model then it was easy with no issues. The APC came with a QA report which was dated back in August 2019 and was very faded, made me think this was a refurbished machine. The machine is running perfectly as the house I am in has power outages a few time a week ranging from seconds to hours. This will prevent my router to be shorted out again like the last one I had.",

Since they can't be convinced to knock it off they are frequently blowing the circuit breakers creating spikes in the line that hit my computer not to mention power drop with no orderly shut down of the OS. So... this UPS was purchased to buffer my computer from all this and shut it down in an orderly manner when the power drops. It shuts the computer down via USB to the software bought separately in a controlled manner. It works great I only wish I had bought it WITH my computer. Recommend highly.",
