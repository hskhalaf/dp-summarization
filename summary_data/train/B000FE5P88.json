I now have my own pool so we tried using the Intex one we got for flowing the river and unfortunately, the space for drinks/ice does not close so the ice melted within an hour (80 deg weather). That night, I ordered this one. I love the fact that the cooler zips closed. I also love that you don't have to use the cooler part at all. Just today I used the base only to hold my phone some snacks and a drink I had. Totally worth the money.",

It did fit lunchables and some drinks in the center cooler which was helpful. I will use it again just because of what I paid for it but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth that price.

The random slot between 1 and 6 is perfect for a waterproof camera or whatever else you'd like there. It's also rugged which is great after a few drinks. I wouldn't hesitant to take this down the Sugar River in Wisconsin.",

The cup holders are the perfect size for our feed cups (we use a variety of blender bottles) so mostly put the empties there for safekeeping, or the current bottle being consumed if not fully emptied on the first pass. The center cooler keeps them from getting warm (and spoiled, over the longer sessions on hot days).",

I fit so much ice, snacks, and drinks in the cooler, I was worried the base wouldn't keep it afloat! But there was no problems with that, and it kept everything cool for the entire trip! The best part is that you can take the cooler off the inflable ring. It makes packing the cooler, as well as transportation so much easier! I would definately recommend! :)",

      "text": "Bought this to take on short float trips, as we float on individual raft and innertubes. Simply tied it onto my tube with a short rope so it stayed connected to me while floating down the river. Works pretty decent. Doesn't hold ice real great, but then it's not really advertised as an \"extreme\" cooler, so cannot ding it for that. For the short 1-2 hr floats or relaxing in the pool, it holds ice well enough to keep everything cold and food chilled. Very fun little floating cooler that blows up quickly, and when done with it, you can simply deflate the floating ring and pack it inside the cooler bag!",
