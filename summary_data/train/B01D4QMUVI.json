I was able to effectively see everything--- for those who left reviews saying the light restricts what you can see... I didn't experience that. Just tilting the mirror more corrected that issue. The light was perfect and really helped when a regular large handheld mirror and overhead lights just didn't do the trick. This mirror has a great ability to reach all kinds of angles by tilting it or extending the arm to increase the length. I love the versatility of this and would highly recommend it!",
