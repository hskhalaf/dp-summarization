It fits perfectly so I thought that I should write a review and give some dimensions to other people that might be looking for a cooler for the same or similar applications.

My litmus test is how long the ice will stay frozen before completely turning to water. In my cheap Styrofoam cooler, that test is over 24 hours, in this product, it's more like 5-6 hours before the ice melts entirely to water. But Styrofoam is non-durable and I needed something I can bang around. Overall I would say it's OK in the durability department but pretty lacking in the insulation department.

I still have room for a pill bottle for my medicine, and few small things I tote back and forth to work everyday, ie e-cig, e-juice, batteries, etc. The insulation isn't that great the outside feels noticeably cold to the touch, so the cool is escaping. That being said, it is still sufficiently cold when I eat my lunch, typically about 7 hours after I leave the house, so I'm not complaining.",

The Flip Lids allow just that....the top fits snuggly but is easy to flip up. It also slides back, if you prefer to use that option. For my friend, these features make all the difference. He carries his lunch and snacks to work every day and can manage this personal cooler without having to ask for assistance. It allows him greater personal independence!",
