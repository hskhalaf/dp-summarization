      "text": "This is a great product that we use for camping. It is a bit heavier than many others, but, will withstand more wind than others. I really like the fact that you can leave the canopy on the frame when packing it up. We added a Velcro strap to wrap around the canopy and hold it to the frame when packing it up. This keeps the canopy from flopping when packing it into the transport case. We also added  rope cinches to the ropes provided to make snugging the ropes up easier. I would recommend this canopy to anyone wanting a solid canopy.",

I would just make sure you using a tent with D-ring type attachment points as the stakes are quite thick. They stay in the ground so well that you will most likely need a hook of some sort to pull them out again. Buy these.",
