Right now I gave it to my mother, built her a computer from left over parts and even like 3 years after buying this CPU and overclocking it, IT STILL WORKS LIKE BRAND NEW. I absolutely recommend this CPU, its the fastest FM2+ CPU in the market, the only way you gonna get faster is by doing what I did and upgrading your socket and buying a whooole different Motherboard. This still gets the job done and unless you plan to try streaming or doing more than 1080p youll never need an upgrade.",

This CPU is actually an APU, therefore, it has an Integrated Graphics card. The integrated graphics are absolutely phenomenal. Usually, I got around 35-45 fps on intensive games, and around 500 on Minecraft. As its part of a CPU, it also works phenomenally! 4.4 Ghz could not be better! Great job AMD on this one.",

The CPU has no trouble running the regular office and browsing tasks, and the GPU is good enough for the occasional game as well. If you need an entry level gaming machine or a very nice media PC, I would definitely recommend an A10, but I wouldn't recommend it for those building mid to high end gaming machines. It just doesn't have enough power, and the graphics don't Crossfire with higher end AMD cards either.",

      "text": "AMD's premier flag ship (and last) fm2 processor. Fast, sharp. Plays most games in 1080p on medium and high settings. Pair it with fast ram for best results. Easily overclocked, though it does get VERY HOT (I overlocked mine only to 4.3GHZ and it runs around 115'F). Definitely CANNOT use the stock fan that comes in the box. I have it paired with a sapphire radeon HD 7750 gpu. Notice a little 'hanging' when there's a lot going on on the screen. Not sure if its due to bottleneck. But its neglible. Can play SC2 on ultra. Warcraft on High all while on 1080p resolution. Have not tested the integrated graphics, but I hear it's 'okay'.",

It runs very cool and seems to be a solid performer for what I do (Star Craft II and some photo editing).

The benchmarks do show some advantage to a Kaveri, but not a huge one, and the A10-6800K, even with stock cooling, is performing impressively well as a full-time desktop, sometime gaming system, keeping up with 1080p graphics on the admittedly not super-intensive games I've tried with it.",

      "text": "I keep trying to find reasons to like an AMD CPU. The Intel LGA 1366 920 this build replaced TBH was as fast as this one IMO. I guess its good for a budget chip, but these APU's are not my first choice. It certainly needed a good cooler on it, these do get hot, so I put a Noctua air cooler on it as my wife didn't want water cooling in her rig - but it could use it. These APU's get hotter than I like a CPU to get.",

Stays cooler but it is still a hot processor Usually runs right under 80C while gaming on high. Liquid cooling would probably be the best alternative for this chip but for the price it is the real deal.",
