The tail-stock was not tightened however, and had caused the damage to the Styrofoam. As other reviews on here, the drive center and tail stock center were slightly out of alignment which was fixed by loosening the adjustment screws underneath and shimming it over. The digital variable speed control is amazing and makes working with the lathe incredibly easy. There is no guess work on the speed as the read out tells you exactly what it is. Great product.",

I'm not having an issue with the rest guard turning or sliding on me like other reviews said but maybe it will in time? I also don't have an issue with the tail stock moving, the lock works great.",

The electronic speed control seems to be a little quirky and sometimes speeds up suddenly. It is a good lathe but truthfully I wish I had spent another $2000 and bought a full size lathe. But you get what you pay for and this is a good midi lathe for $700.",

Three speed ranges and continuous digital speed control makes for quick convenient speed control for all turning needs. Smooth operation, quiet, this lathe is quickly becoming my main workhorse. One minor drawback is that you cannot listen to AM radio while using this lathe. The digital speed control interferes with the AM signal. Finally, while it is suitable for bench top operation, at 160 lbs you will likely want to mount it on a custom stand or purchase the factory stand.",
