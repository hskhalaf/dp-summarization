It holds more than eight knives, though, because each pocket can safely hold two small knives. I keep a 4-inch paring and 4-inch utility knife in one pocket.",

Also a bit on the bulky side once you fill it with knives - that's not a bad thing either. All in all, great value for a no-frills knife bag which comes with a reasonable number of pockets.",
