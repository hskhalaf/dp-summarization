The screen is a smooth nylon, cannot see the wrinkles when playing a movie. This thing comes with ties to keep from swaying but truly the base is such a good design you don\u2019t really need the ties. We love how the screen snaps on and off for storage. Inflated in about a minute or less. Super easy to use and a lot of fun. recommend this to everyone!!!!!!",

It is tough to fold it up into the small bag. So I just use a bigger bag I already had for storage/travel. I would recommend this screen.",

Tip: When setting up make sure the zipper near the blower is completely zipped or you\u2019ll think it\u2019s not inflating. Tip 2: Inflate the black frame and then lay it on its back. Then clip the screen on. Then just stand it back up and then stake it down. Totally love it!!!",

I agree the bag that comes with it is ok for the black part but if you dont want your screen to be wrinkled you wont be putting it in there. But it goes up fast maybey 2 minutes. Thr screen snaps on very easy and is easily adjusted. You seriously cant beat the price for this. Hige hit every time i use it!! Definitely would recommend and in fact i have freinds and family who purchased it after me. Do it!!",

Also, it would be nice if you could blow it up and plug the air, so the air compressor doesn't run. When it stays up and sound is loud enough, it works well.",
