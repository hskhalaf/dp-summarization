Other backpacks have ripped and otherwise fell apart due to the weight. This backpack is still like new 6 months into the school year. Also there are lots of pockets to store anything you need, there is a cool/insulated area that is large enough to store a small lunch in the front pocket, however things do get smooshed in there if theyre not in hard plastic.",

Wish i spent the money to fix the zipper on my old mission bag than order a new one. Materials feels really cheap compared to the older cloth, no sunglasses pocket, no lined inside little pockets, top of shoulder straps not bridged together, cheap feeling handle on top of the bag compared to the old handle being the bridged together shoulder straps, smaller waist buckles and padding. Don\u2019t compare it to an older mission bag or you\u2019ll be disappointed.",
