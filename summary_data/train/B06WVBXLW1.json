I use it to make chaffle bowls to fill with chicken salad (pictured), taco meat w/trimmings, and keto-low carb sloppy joes. Mix 1 egg, 1/2 cup of shredded cheese (I prefer swiss), 1 tsp coconut flour, and spices (onion, garlic powder this time, everything but the bagel seasoning usually) - put half of the mixture in each bowl after you've coated it with butter or high temp oil like coconut oil, and go! They were wonderful, just fold as you eat in a pita-like way. Great item, love it!",

I wiped the cups with a paper towel with vegetable oil before each set of waffles-no sticking. Just wiped off with damp cloth when finished. I am looking forward to doing corn muffin mix bowls with chile & hash brown bowls with eggs. Really fun & easy & so good!",
