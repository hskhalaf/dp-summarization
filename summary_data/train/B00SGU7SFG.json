      "text": "I bought this sippy cup for my son to start getting used to drinking water. I figured that the spout was similar to a bottle and the rubbery texture would help ease the transition. However, he wouldn't drink much out of it and quickly pushed it away. I didn't figure out for weeks that it was because of the cup. I tried to drink out of it myself and it was virtually impossible. Either the hole was too small or the suction didn't allow for air to go in, but even sucking as hard as I could, I could only get a few drops out. No wonder he got frustrated with it!",

On the one hand it's light and easy to handle for the transition of bottle to cup and it's pretty good when it's placed upside down with very little spills BUT on the other hand... the spout area collapses when the my child drinks from it. It happens every time... unscrewing the top to relieve the suction works until he begins drinking from it again. Lastly, the spout cover that came with it didn't quite fit again after I sterilized the product for the first use. I give it 2 out of 5 stars because the collapsible nipple/ spout is very frustrating!",

I wish I had the ability to grant 4 1/2 stars, just because getting the handle back on seems next to impossible. However, I could have been doing it wrong, but I don't think so...I mean, there are only 4 pieces total and I have a college degree. In my own defense, my husband took it apart to wash in my absence so I have no idea how much force or technique it took to remove it in the first place. I might just be a sissy-la-la.",

Still working on learning to completely hold them up. My only wish is that they also made available a hard spout replacement for the nipple. I will probably move on to the Avent sippies when my boys want a faster flow or hard spout but still need the handles and smaller size.",

It\u2019s also the best flow sippy cup and doesn\u2019t overwhelm my daughter with too much liquid at one time either. This is perfect for the first and second stage of sippy cup needs before they transition to a cup. We literally own 5 of these. Do yourself a favor and just buy these and don\u2019t waste your money on all the others.",

They are durable, easy to clean, the silicone mouthpiece is replaceable if need be, and they're easy for little hands to hold onto. My kid's only complaint is that it won't fit in the cup holder of his carseat haha.",

I also almost exclusively breastfed up until the point of cow's milk and cups so was anticipating some trouble, but she took to these right away.

We do baby-led weaning and went straight from breastfeeding to drinking from this cup, no bottle at any point because she just wouldn't take one.
