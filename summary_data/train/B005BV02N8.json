They all are built with some weaknesses, and I've use three or four brands, so far this one is best. Just ordered another. Failure on this one ultimately was the springs breaking. I probably could have found some replacement springs and installed them, but honestly who wants to do repairs on a poop crusted scooper so I'll splurge for the $15 for a new one. Be aware if you use these in the winter, the combination of the plastic getting brittle with the cold and being more aggressive trying to dislodge frozen poops will break them as well.",

But I just spray some cleaner on it and shake it and its clean as new. I am literally going to stop buying GRABBERS for objects *(I'm recently in wheelchair) and just purchase these.

The manufacturer asked me to contact them (as you can see), which I did, and they sent me a replacement immediately at no charge. This one arrived in tact, and it works very well. It scoops nicely, its got a powerful spring, and it's been durable. Good product and great customer service. Four stars!",

I have to rip the grass out of the ground with the poo to get any of it up and even then, there's still a large pile that you have to dig up. I hope I can return this or get my money back because right now it's just a glaring display of buyer's remorse.",
