I am 30 years old and would drink 1 shaker cup 20oz with 3 scoops of amino energy once a day. I liked the taste of amino energy flavors and felt it gave me a good amount of energy for the day. I recently went to the dentist whom I havent seen in the past 1.5 years and found out I had severe acid erosion to my teeth due to drinking amino energy. I just want to make others aware of the dental erosion they could get from drinking this.",

There are A LOT of other ingredients in this that are most likely designed to mask the horrible smell and taste of true naked amino's. So they did manage to make it smell and taste great. But if your not fond of all those other chemicals and ingredients, like Soy Lecithin, then pass this one by. If you cannot stomach real, natural amino's, then this is a great product.

If you are sensitive to caffeine I suggest starting off with the lowest (or half the lowest amount) and working up to what you can handle. I also suggest that you consume this before 12pm (is sensitive to caffeine) as this can keep you awake late into the night if you drink it for a night or afternoon workout.",

This made me suspicious of the product. However, I went I ahead and tried the product. With the very first sip I realized this was not the original product and it made me sick. So, I ended up returning the product. I will never ever buy this product online hence forth.",
