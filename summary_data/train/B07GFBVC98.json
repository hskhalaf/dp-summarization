Before covid we would walk 5 to 13 miles a day on pavement. Since covid, I'm lucky to hit 3000 steps. With those numbers I never had to trim her nails until this year. Took her to the groomers and she turned into kujo. A vet recommended this grinder. Now I'm able to trim her nails. 12 pound chihuahua mix, age 7-9, not used to getting nails trimmed.",

      "text": "I have 2 dogs: pit bull and a shepherd/husky/mutt. Both dogs have incredibly thick fast growing nails and this trimmer is quite, lightweight and very easy to use. My shepherd has serious anxiety as he was a rescue and is still not thrilled about the trimmer but we are getting there. Let your dog sniff the trimmer and let them feel the very minimal vibration of the trimmer, use as directed and you are good to go. The only thing that would make this trimmer better is if it came with the wall outlet attachment for easy charging.",

He didn't seem to mind the feeling or sound, but he was bored and didn't want to sit still for it after about ten minutes.",

They would stall out on first contact with the nail. But with these, you really have to try to stall them out.",

That being said, I knew to introduce it, give a treat, turn it on, give a treat, etc. I tried to use it every day for a whole week, and my dog just would not stay calm enough to actually grind the nail. So I returned it and will continue clipping my dogs nails.",

He did not care about the sound, nor the fact that I was grinding his nails. He was calm, almost nonchalant about what I was doing. Life is much easier now. Thank you!",

Doing it at home would be a way to trim them frequently to encourage the quicks tk recede, but he is really fussy about having his feet touched at all, and will scream with the clipper. This tool has been a game changer. While he doesn\u2019t LIKE it per se, he will calmly tolerate me holding him and working on his nails.

Naturally it takes a lot longer to get the same amount of trimming done, but well worth it for not having to have the stress and potential concern around cutting that we had previously. I would just suggest to follow the instructions and definitely let the dog get acclimated to it for some time before actually trying to use it.
