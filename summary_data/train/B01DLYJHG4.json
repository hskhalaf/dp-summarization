The locking mechanism is smooth, but you could snag thinner documents. Basically if your document(s) rolled up are bigger than 2.75 inches, this tube will not work. I have a work mat that is 3 inches. It will not go into the tube. Just sits on the rim. The tube will give if squeezed. If weight is put the tube, it may damage sensitive drawings, or documents. I can still us this tube, just not for what I really wanted it for.",

The short strap is the reason for knocking off a star - if you have the tube in a semi-lengthened position the strap does expand long enough to use over your shoulder and definitely not long enough to use over back. Definitely a drawback when having to carry this through several airports. Still it did get my poster to the conference unscathed!",
