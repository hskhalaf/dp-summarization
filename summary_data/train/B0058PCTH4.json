I was able to get 3 eyeshadow pallets, a masscara, 4 lipsticks 4 lip glosses, pressed powder compact and about 5 eyeliners in this case. Brushes, foundation, ect will not fit.

I don't have the issue others have with it tipping over - I keep heavier items in the bottom. The quality is really nice. I see it lasting for a long time so I think its well worth the money.

      "text": "It's just ok. I will not put 5 stars because it's not so confortable, if you open the box it will fall because the top compartments are split in two, in one side you have internal boxes with a mirror and from other side non, when you open the box the mirror side has a kind of plegable slots, if you open that (you have to, it's the only way to open it) all the heavy goes for the mirror side and it falls. Even putting all cosmetics it happens, if you want to use it you HAVE to put near a wall or a vertical surface, or using something to balance.",
