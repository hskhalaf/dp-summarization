The four brands I named are brands that I have seen the batteries and chargers. Same model numbers, same battery approvals You should also know the same company is making the socks and gloves. They are designed slightly different, but they are being made by the same company. My advice is get the best deal in the design that you want at the cheapest price possible.",
