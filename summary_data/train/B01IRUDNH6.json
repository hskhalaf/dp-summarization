Short enough he can climb into it easily but wide enough for him to enjoy without taking up half a room. In the summer he can take it outside and use it as a kiddie pool. I chose this over all the other options because of the Fisher Price brand and the bright colors. It is nice because it came with a patch kit. Even though product is durable, kids will be kids.",

If you do fill it with plastic balls it's easy to clean i just put the couch attachment on my vacuum cleaner and swirl it around. I have 3 golden retrievers and doing this keeps it spotless and hair free.",
