Not that having a decorative, pretty neti pot is something everyone requires, but it is rather nice to have something that is appealing; especially if you are under the weather when you're using it. There is an indented spot on each side to make handling this neti pot a trouble-free experience. It is not only easy to use, but also easy to clean. The ceramic is also durable. So, unless you have an unfortunately clumsy moment, it will definitely outlast other neti pots.",

I get having to turn my head to do a gravity-neti wash, but the downturned spout forces me to have to turn even more, otherwise the nozzle presses against the septum and stops the flow. It's completely ridiculous. It's a serious shame, because the quality of the finish is superb, it's a pleasure to hold, etc.. It's a polished turd, though.",

It is well made and works as well as everyone describes in the reviews. I am some that said I would NEVER try a Neti Pot. Now I'm a believer. I use it for when I have a cold and need to move things through quickly and clear my head. I also believe it speeds up your recovery time. I highly recommend this product!",

The shape of the spout is unique (oval) and fits the nostril whole with a way better fit than the round spout ends. In a general plus over plastic models, the spout is smooth (no place where the ends of plastic come together), so if you're nose is irritated it doesn't get scratched by that place on plastic models. I like the color, and the weight, and would strongly recommend this netti pot!",

      "text": "Beautiful design and material, feels great to hold with the indents on the sides. Lifetime guarantee is a great security. Overall the product is amazing, slight learning curve on how to mix the solution (MAKE SURE YOU ONLY USED DISTILLED WATER OR BOILED WATER, NEVER TAP DUE TO BACTERIA). There are a couple different techniques to use a netty pot but I can finally breathe again! Gets all of the gunk out of your sinuses! So cool =]",
