They're slip ons, so they should have put a couple more stitches in that area to prevent this.

I recently moved to a restaurant with less grease and they have been outstanding. Haven\u2019t worn up, just buying another pair for the sake of them being cleaner.

The padding feels slightly thin but not terribly so, they're still conformable. - Heat can be a slight issue. It's not bad, but it does get noticeable after a while. - Fit is perfect. Plenty of space, but not too much. - Pictures are accurate. Probably not a top priority but still a nice to have.",

I'll get right to the point; they are comfortable and the style is fine. The problem is the shoe back folds inward when I put them on. Other Skechers have a sturdier back that doesn't collapse into the shoe. Now to be fair, it is possible I purchased them a half size too small, but I don't think so because once on, they are comfortable. They now sit in the back of my closet, rarely used. When I do wear them, I need to use a shoehorn. My feeling is this is a design flaw.",
