I even had surgery to fix a deviated septum in hopes that I could breath better. The surgery was successful for a short time due to my extreme allergies. After one use of this neti pot, salt and serum I could actually breath. The sinus pain and pressure was gone. I am a true believer! I have posted on Facebook and voiced to family and friends how much I love this product!!",

Just a huge inconvenience. The small size also means you get less pressure, so it takes longer for the water to go through, and if you are really congested it sometimes doesn't run at all. It's nice looking, but just not functional.",

Can't tell if that's doing much for me, but one major difference I've noticed is that in the past, when I'm done using my neti pot, I usually experience a period where inflammation in my nasal passage makes it so I can't breathe through my nose for a while.... not with this!!!",

I feel that it helped me avoid sinusitis from that virus and helped me feel better right away. I now use it about every other day; the winter dryness bothers me and using this product really helps. Buy one, you won't regret it!",
