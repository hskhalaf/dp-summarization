      "text": "I had a point and shoot Canon elf something or other, and this camera is MILES above it. It's quick, the battery life lasts forever, and for a point and shoot it has more options than I could imagine. It takes sharp pictures, and doesn't lag a lot between shots. The flash works well (well enough for a P&S), and the autofocus is fantastic. I could rave forever about the other features, but honestly, it's just a great little camera, that's mostly intuitive, with tons of features and takes great pictures. If you need something tiny and quick, this is a fantastic bet.",

Like that you can take video, zoom and take photos (I think 10 per recording time) all at the same time. Bought for my husband and he really likes it as well and he does have larger hands and can use it but wanted to let others know to be aware as camera is pocket sized.",

For the price, this camera is fantastic for video and pictures (most especially ones outside in natural light). The portability if simply amazing!",

Have not found any cons yet, except it's a little hard to see the screen in bright sunlight, But I just pointed and shot and the pics came out great. And sound is a little scratchy",

Not sure how long this will last, but given the fate cameras suffered in my hands and the low cost of WX50, I'd say this fits perfectly now.",

Another downside it that the cmos sensor will sometimes do a rolling shutter on rapidly changing brightness. The pictures are clear and crisp.",

But, I think this may be more a problem with the settings I changed than with the actual camera because it doesn't happen all the time.

Sent it off to be repaired (had to pay for shipping to service center). Was very excited for this camera until it stopped working. Hopefully it was just a problem with the camera I purchased and will have no further problems. Will update once I receive the camera back.",

After about 1.5 years (when they're no longer in warranty) the mode selector dial becomes hyper-sensitive so that it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to set the actual mode that you want... When you do happen to set the mode you want and lightly brush the dial while trying to take a picture it changes mode on you, more likely than not, messing up the photo. I can only assume that this is a common fault with Sony Cyber-shot cameras since it's happened to 2 out of 2 of mine.",

Other things I like: *excellent zoom *photos in poor lighting come out amazingly well *camera is really small Only one little comment, sometimes in darker environments, the auto focus unfocuses while video taping. It did this at my daughter's band concert. The sound is still good but the video comes in and out. It was dark in the audience and I think that confuses the auto focus.",

The ratings on this camera were found to be excellent on more than one site for it's review, which for us, means it's worthy. Cost was a factor too, and the Cyber Shot is well within our budget limits. When comparing this to other small camera's at Best Buy & Costso, the value is evident as competitor camera's range to be about 30-50% higher in price. Am not very tech savvy so ease of use was important, and this camera fits this need.",
