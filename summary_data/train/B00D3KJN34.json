I was able to blow off the front driveway, front sidewalks, 2 side door porches, the back sidewalks, and the back patio in 10 minutes... Used to take an hour because of the extension cords with my old blower. I have more control with the GreenWorks blower over where the debris is blown/ easier clean up.>> Using a speed setting of 1. My old 210 MPH corded blower blew away the leaves, my gravel. and punched a holes in the dirt. The Greenworks lasted about 25 minutes on full speed or 45 minutes varying the speed while I was testing the battery capacity.",

I have 4 giant oak trees on my property and spend about 3 months a year constantly raking and bagging, raking and bagging, raking and bagging. This blower has a ton of power and can blow wet leaves, lasts for about 30 minutes at full power, which is pretty good for an electric blower. Plus, by that time my hands need a little break anyway. It recharges in like 15 minutes. So I go blow a bunch of leaves into a pile, pop the battery on the charger, bag up those leaves, and by the time I'm done the battery is totally charged again.",

Very disappointing. I have attached photos of our findings. We took the machine apart to see why it wasn\u2019t working.

I've had 90 MPH blowers that were much stronger. Really sad I wanted to get away from gas...Can someone recommend a strong Battery yard blower to me? This was not it at all. Kinda Sucks.

The only notice that the battery is about to give out is the motor slows down a little. 2. Use at the lowest speed setting. Battery life is almost triple and the output is virtually the same as on the highest setting. And it's a lot quieter. 3. Keep the extender nozzle switch on high (or don't use it at all). No real difference between low and high position. Highly recommended.",

If no battery, the $100+ for complete unit is not worth it. Regardless, you will still need an electric or gas blower for complete cleanup. The light weight Is a big plus. Update: 3 stars to 4 stars. My wife loves this thing. It is light weight and easy for her to use, and she uses it more often than our corded versions. It is good for what it is intended.",

I also have a works GT blower, and this green works blower does have a stronger wind to it, plus the variable speed control is a nice addition to have as well. I would Highly recommend.",

Tapered nozzle so blowing is more concentrated, not sure it would be useful for wetter objects, piles of leaves, etc. but moves stuff off flat surfaces. Generally easy to wield, but larger battery makes it heavier than some B&D and other models with 20L batteries. Good value at under $100. Casing is not hi-grade plastic, so do not plan on throwing this around on hard surfaces.",

Pine needles, leaves and dust outside are blown away with this little workhorse...literally. Use a sweeping motion on a 30 minute charge. Dirt outside needs to stay outside, keep it out of your house. Super easy to set up, charge, use and store.",

I was impressed how long it lasted on one charge. I haven't timed how long it takes to recharge but it seems very quick. If you buy this blower be sure not to leave the battery in the charger regardless if it is plugged in or not and don't leave the battery connected to the blower when not in use. If you do this the battery will serve you for years.",
