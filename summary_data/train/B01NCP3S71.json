The tradeoff is that the door can't be closed with the chin-up bar in place, and it is rather bulky when assembled. We leave ours in place, but it is easy mount and unmount (2 seconds?) if you want to store it between uses.",

The thing that impressed me the most is that this thing holds me up even when I'm trying to do \"Ninja Warrior\" tricks on it. It's not just good for pull ups, it holds up like a champ no matter what you throw at it. I am definitely very happy that I upgraded.",

If not for this issue I would rate the bars 5-stars: they are near-perfect in every other way and I still use.",
