I was prepared to write a great review, but after 45 days (too late to return it) it stopped charging. I tried another USB cord to see if the problem was the cord, but that didn't work either. I am very disappointed, the seller earns 5 stars. They responded quickly to my concern, and offered a full refund without having to send the item back. Seller is highly recommended!",

It charges fast and is easy and safe to operate. Only downside is being flameless, you have to get what you're lighting right up in there. 95% of the time that's perfectly fine, but sometimes a short candle wick can be a pain and I have to light a second thing to spread the flame. But overall, adore this little lighter.",

It lights pretty well, the only downside is the gap between the two points is very narrow, so not a lot of objects fit through it. A standard cigarette or cigarilli is too thick. I've found that if you hold your cigar or cigarette close to the electricity and just puff puff, it will kind of suck in the electricity, and light it that way. Its pretty cool to show off also.",
