Pros: Great quality video, supports 2, 4, 8 and 16GB SDHC cards (so far) Cons: need lots of batteries, camera functionality is just OK, 2GB file size limit (translates to recording time limit) I use the camera primarily to video stuff for the kids (sporting events, performances, etc.). Thankfully, most recordings don't need to be more than 15 minutes at a time -- otherwise, the 2GB file size limit would hit and/or it'd run out of batteries.",

Its main plus is its small size (about the size of 70-80 stacked playing cards), which is also its primary disadvantage. The buttons are tiny, the viewfinder is tiny, but the camera is tiny and the video looks great. It's too heavy to be a shirt pocket camera but it feels solid except for its plastic battery cover door. For a case, consider a Pelican 1010. The camera and strap just fit in the case which is waterproof and crushproof. I carry it hiking as a video camera and emergency still camera. Start off with at least two batteries.",

      "text": "This camera seemed to work well for about an hour before it lost the ability to focus. It now shows blurry images. It is worthless. After transferring the few 'in focus' videos and pictures that I was able to take before it failed, I now see that they are all VERY NOISY. Really bad. I own a Sony DV Camcorder, a Canon ZR DV camcorder, a Nikon Coolpix 8800, and a Sony DSC-T30. They are all superior to the TX1. I'm not a happy camper.",
