If you can buy a more modern device go for it instead of this because it seems as if SONY already discontinued supporting this player about a year after they came out with it which is sort of pathetic. There have been no network updates since 2012 and if you try to do it manually you get an error message. Who knows, someday SONY may pull the plug completely. All of the little changes Netflix made to their service over the last year are missing here, no multiple accounts, no subtitles.",

Searches on the internet reveal this problem is peculiar to Sony streamers, including their BlueRay and DVD players, TVs and gaming consoles. Sony apparently reroutes all streams through their routers, slowing down everything. So, on second thought, avoid at all costs!",

It does Netflix and Amazon Prime Instant Video and has few issues with those other than the somewhat difficult to use interface. It is usable though so I don't have much issue with that. One problem I have is that I have a DLNA media server with some movies on it in XVid format with ac3 audio. This box doesn't seem to handle these files which is disappointing. Especially because these files work on my PS3 in another room. I expected similar compatibility with this box as the PS3 because they are both Sony products.",

I did find that by using my Samsung Galaxy S3 as a remote for it, the keyboard feature on the phone works much easier, but again, I never really have any need for it. I did use it once for Pandora, and then later when I went to sign in again, the Pandora code was gone, and now I can't get it back. Have tried everything I can think of, but no use. The main thing I view on it is Amazon Prime, so no big loss there.",
