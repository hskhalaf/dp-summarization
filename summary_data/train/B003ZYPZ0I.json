We bought a third one thinking the second was a fluke but no...this one failed after 2 months. The motor is apparently defective and begins smoking and making bad sounds. The design is good. We like the lightweight and easy handling/cleaning but the quality is abysmal to say the least. Do not buy this product. Your wasting your money.",

And super lightweight so I can haul it from room to room with ease. Not a huge production to vacuum a small area like getting out my Windtunnel. Did I mention easy to clean/empty too? One of my best purchases of the year!",

      "text": "My wife complained that our model SH20030 Hoover vac wasn't picking up anything even though the cyclone cylinder was empty. Upon close examination I discover that the duct from the power head to the cyclone cylinder entrance was packed with cat hair ( see attached photo). It was a major job to clean this duct passage because of the curves and angles built into it. Finally, using a wire hook and my air compressor, I was able to remove all of the hair. This vac is, obviously, not engineered to handle animal hair. This probably explains why I see so many being picked up by our neighborhood trash hauler.",

The power switch selects whether the floor beater-brush is on or not depending on carpet vs. hardwood or tile. The head swivels left/right to help with maneuvering. It has no \"tools\" or hose but that is OK with me - I can use my old vac or shop vac as needed.",

      "text": "After much research on corded and cordless stick vacs, settled on this one though it was not listed as the most popular seller. Best purchase! Love this little vacuum!! Easy to assemble from the box and not flimsy or fragile. Lite and easy to pull out of the closet and use. Has good suction for all the little things hanging out on my floor that need to go bye-bye. Was surprised at how well it suctioned the carpet too. It does not replace my reg vacuum cleaner but def replaces my broom! Use it all the time. Yes, the cord is short but just attached a longer extension cord to it and solved that problem. Highly recommend!",

I wish I could just return it. Don't buy it unless you need a device for <12 months.",
