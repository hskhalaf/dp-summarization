If the controller overheats, the sting will fail at the least and melt at the worst. Their customer service is very responsive and attentive. They made it right for me.",

The idea of plugging the lights in was appealing, plus being able to power the lights on and off with the remote was another nice addition to this unit. I also liked that you could dim the lights with the remote as well. I added the lights to the center of my dinning room table. Photos included. Just what I needed!",

We set these up using zip ties already, and by the time we tested it, it was already installed. It would be a hassle to take down so I don't think we will return them, but we are very dissapointed that the bulbs aren't the same!",

The remote control was a little difficult to figure out at first until I read in other reviews that it needs to be pointed directly at the receiver. A lot of different \"twinkly\" options, but after playing with it for a bit I decided I like the solid lights the best so I probably won't be using the remote. They are very pretty though and I highly recommend them!",

Other than that, though, these are perfect. We've strung a couple of these up over some windows in an organic, haphazard way (not outlining the windows in a rectangle of light). The lights are delicate, they make the space look charming and cozy, and the wires do not look unsightly at all.",
