This was my THIRD TP LINK product and I seriously loved them but after the LACK of support I got, and the uncaring attitude of TP LINK in general, I will NEVER EVER buy another one!! I WILL AVOID TP LINK AND TO AVOID ANY ISSUES from loss of connection, PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!",

I tried connecting via ethernet but the router doesn't stay on long enough for my computer to access it.

Worked with tech support 3 times and got no results for fixing the issue.

I'm not going to bore you with a bunch of technical info, but will tell you how may devices are most times on at the same time: 1 or 2 laptops 2 Kindle Fires 2 or 3 T.V.'s streaming (Netflix, Hulu, etc.) I sometimes livestream video, and do not get buffering even when up to 6 other devices are being used. The range is excellent. I live on the 1st floor of a 2 flat with a full basement, approximately in the middle of a 90 long home, and signal strength is very good. Easy to use interface as well.",
