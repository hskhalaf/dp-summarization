It gets all over your hands and, subsequently, when you're trying to apply the makeup, you are putting it all over your face. It is a complete mess. My breaking point came when I got some of this silver substance in my eye and had to have my eye flushed out by my doctor. Terribly cheap packaging and dangerous to be putting anywhere near your face. I tried to ask for a refund, but that option is no longer available. Never again.",
