Otherwise, the gray color is fine for my baby's nursery, it was easy to assemble and stays fairly in place. Fabric is ok after the first wash but I put it in a laundry bag since it feels a little cheap. Overall, good enough for the price!",

My little dude was waking up with little flakes all over his face, lookin like he gnawed on a bloody steak. So I went in search of something to cover these now horrific rails. God bless Amazon. I bought covers for the front and side rails because, duh. The crib now looks like a baby crib again, not a demon crate. Hallelujah!",

It definitely protects the railing from getting those bite marks but it does not provide any cushion so my son still hits his mouth on the railing and cries. He will just have to learn to not do that I guess! It was easy to install and did not fall apart after the wash.",

It\u2019s thick enough to keep my daughter from doing any damage to her railing but not too thick that it would be bulky. Thus far my daughter hasn\u2019t been able to get it off the railing and she\u2019s pretty good with that kind of thing. It\u2019s also quite soft. Not micro fleece soft but not just plain cottony texture. Overall I\u2019m satisfied and would buy again!",
