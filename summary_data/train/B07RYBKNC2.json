      "text": "To date. I have owned 4 BP cuff monitors, recently returning two other brands due to inaccurate measurements and difficulty of use. Omron Silver is a genius BP monitor! The cuff is pre- formed and adjusts easily-- a breeze compared to all previous brands! I am able to store all BP readings via Bluetooth, with the option to manually enter readings done at doctor's visits. Another plus is that I can print out, or forward, a chart of the readings, or a simple file. No more hand logging on paper! Have already recommended Omron Silver to a couple of friends! Thank you for such a great product at a very affordable price!",

I don't love the cuff because there is a more rigid part and a softer part. For me, it makes it just a tiny bit harder to adjust in your arm . It's not a big deal though.

Fortunately she had a medical professional with her that took her blood pressure manually and confirmed it was normal. I thought that being able to measure her own blood pressure at any time would be reassuring for her, but I had to return it. It is possible that this inaccuracy varies from unit to unit, but I didn't want to put her through the trial and error process.",
