It looks good, but it makes a continuous humming sound even when I have my computer on mute. When I turn it upside down, the humming is less, but it is always there. When I am using the speaker the sound is good. The humming drives me crazy! I'm looking for a replacement, and will use this on a home computer that's more convenient to unplug when not in use. The price is great, obviously, and since I buy many of my own supplies I need to be frugal.",

I wanted it to be small, and decent sound, but didn't care about stereo sound, loudness, controls. This met all my needs and then some. The quality of sound for voice (news, audiobook) is surprisingly good; there's enough bass to make the voices sound full. My only gripe is that I wish the phono cord was a bit longer, but that's easy to fix.",

Here's the negatives: it has to be plugged into the headphone jack on the computer which sucks because whenever you touch the cord, it makes a loud static noise. Another negative is that it has a quiet buzzing sound always present when music isn't playing. Overall, its a good speaker though,",

      "text": "Purchased this speaker for my 90-something Father-in-law to solve an issue between his flip-phone and hearing aids. He cannot use a cellphone with a flat screen due to vision issues--must be able to feel the buttons to make a call. When the flip-phone is put up to his ear, there was a buzzing noise due to his hearing aids. There is not a speaker phone option on this older flip-phone. He could not hear the caller due to the buzzing. This speaker solves the issue since he uses the flip-phone primarily at home. The sound from this little speaker is very good--no extraneous humming at all. Very happy with this purchase!",

The only reason for four out of five stars is that there is a lot of buzzing and snapping when we first plug the speaker into the laptop and it continues until we connect our sound system. I would purchase this again.",

Mitigation is to keep that line as far away from any A/C power lines as possible. 2) no power switch, or volume control.",
