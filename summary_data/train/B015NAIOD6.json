You flip your burger patties like a pro, cut a cooked Bratt in half with the edge of your spatula and pop the cap off a couple of beers. With this quality tool, you can stand with confidence as commander of your BBQ party while soaking up the envy of your neighbors. It is weighted well - balanced, not cheap. The cutting edge is sharp and works well. Honestly, it's a shockingly useful tool. After acquiring this I threw out my 3 old spatulas because they just don't compare to the quality and usefulness of this quality tool. I was not paid in any way for this endorsement.",

The sharp edge is nice for loosening meats from the grill, or slicing to check on cooking status. Not sure if I'll use the bottle opener feature, but some might. Don't nessasarily like the idea of opening a bottle of brew with a spatula? Maybe useful in a pinch. Stainless cleans easily. I've not net used it for the spatula killing burger press, but it seems like it won't get the \"bends\" when put under pressure. Good length for grilling.",

My only critical comment is having the bottle opener on the spatula may prevent me from using it after It touches the grill/meat. Could it be moved to end of handle?",
