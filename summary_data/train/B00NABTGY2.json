If we do not buy cheap shtty bags like these, then bio-degradable ones will become cheaper. Market forces! So i say why buy these cheap bags that will hold your dog's poop for 200 years?

And if you have to carry these for a few minutes on your walk with Rover, while they are \"loaded\" they can reek. Besides that, towards the end of the first roll, some of the bags have slices in them, your fingers can go right through. Unfortunately I waited a few days too long to return them, if I even could since I already got through one roll. But I won't use them, I switched to some other green bags that are scented.",

There clearly seems to have been a manufacturing problem with this shipment. I will work my way through this shipment. I'm still a fan of AmazonBasics products but not sure if I will be buying the AmazonBasics brand of dog waste bags again.",

The previous ones we bought I could just hold the roll and pull the unrolled end bag to break the perforation. For those environmentally conscious, there is a cardboard core in the center. As for the clip, there is no hook for used bags, so we recycled this clip and kept the one from ~5 bag orders ago that does.",

The bags have an arrow printed on the bag to let you know which end opens, which is nice. The box also came with a bag dispenser that you can clip on the leash. All in all this is a great deal.",

I HAVE ALWAYS cleaned up after my pets. The dispenser is hooked to hes retractable leash handle. So it makes grabbing a bag very convenient. I am certain these bags may last me as long as six months or more. I know from purchasing 8-12 rolls from the store could cost as much 8-12 dollars.
