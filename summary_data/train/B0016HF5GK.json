Make sure to vacuum up pet hair, chunks of anything before using this or it will get stuck in the attachment head and stink later on if you don't clean it after every use!

Why would they not make that part snap off so you could clean the disgusting dog matter and carpet fibers from the tool? The rubber piece in the bottom of the receiving tank falls off easily and allows all the filthy water to spill......so be very careful when you lift it out.

See the video for an idea of how much dirt it removed from her car seats. It\u2019s a great little machine. We don\u2019t use it to much anymore since we replaced the majority of the carpet in our home with laminate flooring. But we used it a lot for the first few years we had the machine.",

Requires a lot of strength pushing it deep into the carpet to suck out as much fluid as you can. That way it dries faster. This is definitely a spot cleaner. Get a real big vacumm cleanse for larger spots. Really want to clean my white sofa too but will wait bevause wrist...hurts now",

    "description": "Color:Green| Style Name:Portable Carpet and Upholstery Cleaner\n\nBissell Little Green Multi-Purpose Compact Deep Cleaner\n\nStrong spray and suction contains at least 50% recycled plastic. 3 inch stain tool helps you scrub stains away.\n\n\n\nDimensions: 13.8 pounds Check for suction at the back of the unit after removing the hose where it attaches to the back of the unit. If there IS suction at the back of the machine with the hose removed, follow these steps: Unplug the unit from the outlet. Check the Pre- and Post-Motor filters for debris. Dirty filters can restrict airflow. The Pre-Motor Foam Filter is square. You can find it in a pull-out tray under the Dirt Tank. The Foam Filter may be hand washed in cold water with mild detergent. Reinstall the filter when it\u2019s completely dry. The Multi-Layer Post-Motor Filter is rectangular. It can be found on the side of the machine. *Note: The white Multi-Layer Post Motor Filter isn\u2019t washable. Make sure the dirt tank is empty. Check the upper tank for build-up or clogs. If it needs to be cleaned, use a short, Phillips-head screwdriver and take off the separator plate with a cloth (can be dampened with water or mild detergent). Replace dirt tank. Check for good suction at the end of the upholstery hose. If there\u2019s good suction, make sure the hose is connected firmly to the lower hose on the back of the vacuum. If there\u2019s no suction, check the hose for splits, cracks, or clogs. Make sure the Brush Roll is rotating. If it isn\u2019t, take the access plate off and examine the brush and belt for damage. The access panel can be taken off by lifting the four tabs on the bottom of your machine. Clearing clogs detach the Upper Hose from the machine. Insert a broomstick into the hose to push any obstruction through. Remove the screw from the left side of the lower hose on the back of the unit. Straighten this section of hose by pulling it down or laying the unit on its side with the lower hose towards the top side. Look through the hose for any obstruction. Use a broomstick to unclog the hose. Power source - corded. Power rating: 3 amps.",
