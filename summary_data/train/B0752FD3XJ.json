Firmware, channels, legacy, n, 3x wifi adapters, different computers, factory resets and none of it fixed it. Customer service was useless. Slowly offered me nothing past what I'd already tried and then on a 6 month old unit they expect me to ship it to them and they'll \"look\" at it and the return window to me is a month lol. What a joke, borderline legal scamming. No person in their right mind will go a month without a router especially with slim chance of getting a real fix.",

      "text": "There are some great features that come with this router. I'm not a big WiFi fan, but you have great security on your internal WiFi bands and can allow guest access with restrictions very easily. There are too many features to list. But I like the ability to set user MAC address as a requirement for access. The router works with Spectrum. It supports at least 25 Mb/s down, and 12.5 Mb/s up. That's my limit, and there are claims of 40x faster speeds. It will support Mesh router networking. If you have to cover a broad area, deal with security issues, or just need to proved solid WiFi everywhere, you will want this feature.",

      "text": "Bought this router in July 2018 and it was a great AC router while it lasted. Great coverage and speedy. After a year and a half the 2.4ghz band started sporadically dropping connections and then completely died. A couple month's later the same think happened with the 5ghz band. Had to upgrade to an AX router sooner then planned due to the short life of this router. Had hoped to use this router as an AiMesh node when I did upgrade but that plan is out the window now. Don't know what the typical life span of a router is but I would think it should be longer then 18 months, am I wrong?",

Don't laugh but they even ha a phone app, which at first might sound silly, but is well designed and extremely useful allowing you to monitor connectivity, connected devices, etc. all from your phone.

If you are looking for a good home router and don't know networking, this router is a great option. If you are a nerd like me and want to do some more advanced networking stuff, there are better, but much more expensive options.",

From what I've heard about Asus support, I don't imagine I'll get anything from them, but I'll try to make a warranty claim. Either way, I wouldn't want to use this router ever again. When it was working, the 5Ghz speeds were great, but the other features and interface this router offered were mediocre at best. DO NOT BUY.",
