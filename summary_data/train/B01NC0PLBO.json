It does have small like scratches between the buttons. It's weird, looks like small cat hairs but it's small thin lines/scratches.

The only issue I had was that there were multiple scratches (or slight cracks??) on it despite it just coming out of packaging, and it said RAM cleared when I first opened it with batteries nearly dead. I paid full price for a new one, and I'd obviously expect an entirely new calculator. Honestly kind of disappointed.",

Don't forget to put you name in it. The only improvement I would recommend to Texas Instruments is to put a password feature in the programming, so when you turn it on, only the owner can open it to use. This could prevent others from stealing it, since it would stay locked if you didn't know the password.",

The package came with two user manuals, and I recommend this calculator for anyone in a math or science-based high school class.",

I would definitely recommend buying the TI-84 Plus CE before a TI-83 Plus. I used to have a TI-83 Plus and recently upgraded to this, and I find that the display on the TI-84 Plus CE not only looks better, but actually helps when calculating various things.",

The TI Nspire is more capable and possibly future proof and the Casio is more economical, but if your student can't follow along with the class they are worthless. Although this works very well and is a defiinite upgrade from the the TI 84. So for high schoolers, go with the teacher recommendation.",

Another additional tip is to include a manual of all the functions and keys as it is hard to learn all of them easily. This calculator can also download games!! :) Overall I think it's an amazing calculator.",
