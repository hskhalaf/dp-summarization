It is sewn very poorly. Also when I received the coat, the zipper on the side of the jacket is completely stuck and will not move up or down in either direction. Can't believe i received it this way. It's getting returned.",

The zips at the hip are perfect to open when sitting down and gives that extra room which doesn\u2019t put a booty bump in your coat. It can be zipped up again to stop the wind on a walk.

But the larger size gives me the oversize look I was looking for with plenty of room for jackets or sweaters - as if i would ever need it! This jacket is seriously warm. First night I wore it I got compliments galore. I would say that the 4XL is probably a size 20 American.",

There are also only 4 small pockets. The lower ones are uncomfortable to use when you just want to warm your hands because they are too small, in front and not on the side & the zipper always scratches the back of your hand when using. Plus there isn\u2019t an interior pocket which I think is good for protecting valuables such as my phone, ID\u2019s, cash & credit cards etc. I should\u2019ve paid more attention to when I ordered.",

Overall, I would say I like it but it's not a jacket to wear year after year due to the seams.",

      "text": "I love this coat! The fit is perfect! (I\u2019m 5\u20193 and weigh 100lbs) After reading other reviews I ordered the XS and I\u2019m glad I did. It fits perfectly even with a sweatshirt on. Plenty of room to move with zippers that allow the coat to be expanded a couple inches. It\u2019s super warm and cozy which is great considering winter has arrived very early in Michigan this year. Very happy with this purchase!",

Let me tell you, you will not need extra layers under this coat! It is SUPER warm, almost too warm, lol. I get compliments on it all the time. I live in Washington State, so it's not super cold here, so I would think if you are looking for something to keep you warm, this jacket is for you!",

I got 4 compliments on it the first week I wore it. I usually wear an XL so I bought an XL and it is plenty roomy. Yes, the bottom around the hips is a bit tight, but that's adjustable, and once I get the thing zipped I think it looks good tight on the bottom (not in the least bit uncomfortable, just slightly constraining). Quality has been great so far, no issues there. I would certainly recommend this coat to anyone facing a ~40N winter.",
