The reviews looked great and it is described as a \u201cresin/stone\u201d blend. I received it today - if there is any stone in this resin, it must just be a bit of dust. There is not much weight to this for the size and description (22 oz.); it really feels like it\u2019s a plastic cast. The paint job is very splotchy as well, odd dark areas, especially on the tail.",

The statue is easy to paint, however there was parts of the wings that were chipped off either due to shipping or just from the piece being fragile. I was able to repair chipped pieces with clay. Also, you can tell where the wings are connected as a separate piece, so I added clay to the back side and textured it to look like fur so it blended more with the wings. Statue does hold up at the same temperature as Fimo clay, just keep an eye on it if you use this method; or use air dry clay.",

She was healthy and lived 5 1/2 years until she got sick, far surpassing the predicted 6 months; a precious and unique cat who deserved a special stone as a grave marker. Design Toscano created the perfect marker for a small cat. We attached it to a decorative stone base and coated it with a protectant against the harsh Minnesota winters. Highly recommended!",
