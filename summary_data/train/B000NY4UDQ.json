First shipment, missing fixed jaw. First replacement, a 12\" clamp with a 24\" paper wrapper on it. A small tear on the paper wrapper so I wonder if was somebody's return that they didn't put back together right. Third time was the charm, it appears.

These clamps are next to impossible to release when they are clamped tightly. The release button is about half the size of a dime and partially recessed into the handle. I'm 6'4 and 230 pounds and the only way I can release them is to hit they sharply with a hammer. They work OK for a weekend wood warrior but keep your hammer handy when you need to release them.",

As such mine failed at the pin joint after a week. After I reassembled the clamp and constrained the two halves with a 1\", 1/4-20 bolt and nut it has been able to hold much higher loads for a month now. If Tekton spent the extra 10 cents to do this themselves or just added a couple more screw connections at this failure point they'd have a much stronger product that'd be worth five stars, but alas.",
