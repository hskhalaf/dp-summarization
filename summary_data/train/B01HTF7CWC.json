The pot and pan work great and its nice how the whole kit can be condensed down into a very small and portable package. The product is easy to clean as long as you dont let the food sit, rinse it while its hot or food sticks a lot. The extra things it comes with is nice as is the carrying case. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive all in one mess kit for one or two people.",

Good purchase for the price though.",

I toasted a couple of buttered Bagels, which turned out great, then I fried a couple of eggs afterwards. The eggs turned out great also. I did use low heat, but nothing burned and there was very little sticking of the eggs to the skillet. What did stick came off very easily. One more thing, with this cookware set, you can remove the lid from the skillet or pot without burning your fingers. A plus in my book! I'm very satisfied with this cookware set and I would recommend it to a friend. Happy Camping! :)",

Check the dimensions - maybe they'd be good for backpacking? But for car camping I'd get a more useable set with larger pots.",
