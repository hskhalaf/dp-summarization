They said the warranty only covers the motor and its the blade that is jammed and not working. I can't believe we spend this much money to use it twice (well one and a half times since it broke during the second use).",

All comments about problematic location of oil fill are accurate, i used a rubber extension attached to a funnel. I bought the chipper primarily to get rid of leaves- it reduced several tarp loads to small piles- surpassed my expectations. It easily took care of small branches in the yard. Another reviewer discussed the safety strips at the top of the hopper as being an impediment. Removal is difficult due to location of nuts/bolts- i used a bungycord attached to the handle to lift the strips- took 2 minutes and the shield is still attached.",
