Now the clumps don't crumble like that and taste like globs of toothpaste. Please return the formula to how it was one or two years ago.

The shakes come out rather thick with milk and a bit thinner with water. If you're looking for something with good strawberry flavor this will work. Note that this is a good healthy replacement for the flavor it copies. If you go in expecting this to taste exactly like a milkshake you're going to have a bad time. Overall, a great flavor but could use some improvements. Want a more strawberry flavor rather than milk flavor in this.",

After changing my bottle and my water in hopes they were the causes, I still cannot get this shake down without gagging. I have decided to shift to a different brand to try and find one that tastes as good as Syntha 6 used to taste.",

I have enjoyed this product for years and have really seen the benefits when it comes to recovery. Back to back to back hard group rides were becoming a grind until one of my buddies clued me in on SYNTHA-6. After about three weeks of taking the product I could really feel the difference by enjoying a fast bounce back between workout sessions. I now get the full benefit of being able to come into a workout feeling energetic and ready for a challenge. Plus the stuff tastes great.",

If you are trying to cut weight I would look elsewhere, for something that\u2019s cleaner protein (but won\u2019t taste as good).",

The bottom line is, this is a great tasting and high performance protein shake. It'll definitely give you the muscle gains and fat burn you want, which happens to be a lot, but I notice my muscles don't feel as fully recovered and are a bit more sore the next day when compared to Myotein. On the up side, I do think it helps burn more fat than other powders which focus solely on muscle gains. Basically, this is a great value protein shake with very high performance results. You can't go wrong.",
