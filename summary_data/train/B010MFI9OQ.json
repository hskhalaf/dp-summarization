My PT recommended icing the area frequently as we're trying to do PT to avoid invasive surgical repair. PT cupped his hand and put it over my shoulder saying, \"THIS is the area you want to ice, not the sides or the back where the pain is radiating to. Ice HERE where the pain is originating. I'm still trying to customize this rig but it seems that, for some reason, there is a HOLE directly OVER the spot that requires ice/cold the most! It helps overall but WHY the aperture. It's missing the mark!",

Fits great on both arms, but can only put on by yourself if going on the left arm, as the straps wrap behind the arm. My husband's injury is on his right shoulder, so I'm going to spend months helping him in and out of it. But it immediately gave relief, so it's worth it.",

If you had surgery you will need help putting this on, probably any other item as well for your I shoulder. I like that it reaches my shoulder blade and the front part of my shoulder, is comfortable and well made. The only thing I dislike is the opening that it has, that opening wherever you place it, usually the top part of your shoulder will not get that area cold. I like the pump because you can put pressure against your shoulder at your own comfort.",
