Wasn't expecting it to be such a nice weight so it won't tip over. The brightness levels are perfect, covers all the levels one would need. And it has a 60 minute timer should you fall asleep before turning it off. Highly recommend. I use these at work because I can't stand the fluorescent lights, which I have the maintenance folks remove the bulbs. Then I just use these LED desk lamps. I will definitely purchase this particular brand from this particular seller in the future. No issues at all.",

It really is easy to adjust positions/angles and brightness level but most importantly, I appreciate the individual buttons for 1hr sleep timer and on/off.

It is perfect for reading/studying, watching movies on my PC, or even just a night light. I use it every single day. I like that it is touch-sensitive. I also love how well it moves. I would say the only negative thing, it that I wasn't expecting was the base to be as big as it is. But I have plenty of space on my desk so it works out fine. Just look at the dimensions before you buy it to make sure it works for you. I would buy again!",

The different modes work well. The on/off button even stays on while the lamp is off so that you can find it easily in the dark. There's only one thing that was worrisome: I don't remember which mode it was but after a long time the lamp where the lightbulbs are got warm, which is odd because it's an L.E.D. lamp. It's still pretty good and I've already recommended it to my friends",

The lamp looks exactly as advertised and is exactly what I wanted. The motion in the lamp is awesome for switching between different things on your desk (if needed). The only thing I don't like is that the plastic doesn't feel very sturdy while swiveling. You need to rotate the lamp at the base or it warps and feels like it might break. If you rotate it at the base, you also inevitably push buttons which is just a bit annoying.",

      "text": "We bought this desk lamp for our son who is a freshman in college. He loved that there were different lighting options for reading, studying, relaxing, & sleep. Each option ranges from a more blue to subtle yellow shade of lighting. There is a slide bar to change the brightness level within each option. We found that the lamp will automatically remember what setting you used last within each level so you can find your favorite and not have to adjust it each time you turn it on. The range of motion is slightly limited but nothing that is a problem or annoying.",

Plus you can set it to turn off if you nod off. All this in a sleek, efficient LED light. Highly recommend!",

The color temperature setting is very nice as well you can make it softer to help with eye strain if you are not a pure white light person. The only issue I have is the light height is not very tall. You can put the light vertical but then it can get a little bright for your eyes. The Usb port on the side is not very powerful. It can power a phone but probably not enough to charge it fully while being used.",

It has a stable base that keeps the lamp firmly upright while two adjustable arms ensure the light you need is always aimed just where you want it.
