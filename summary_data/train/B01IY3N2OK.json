Then it worked great, just as expected. Until today. I went to remove the lid, and the base detached inside the lid. Now I need to figure out how to repair it or buy a new base. I just ordered the larger one and hope this doesn't happen again.",

This one is the same size as my \"original\" one and works ALMOST as well. I think pieces take just slightly longer in here but it's not bad. And it's much less expensive than a full-priced Fuseworks. I've even been able to cinter a small silver Art Clay piece in it!!",

Not one piece of paper saying how to use it based on wattage of microwave or that you might need kiln cleaner, kiln shelf liners, or heat proof gloves, or that you might need to remove it immediately from the microwave once the microwave stops or where you might find instructions. So this could be a waste of your money",

Mine developed cracks in the metallic lining and one spot where the lining has curled up a bit - maybe from reaching a higher temp than it was designed for. It now gets incandescent after about two minutes in microwave although I generally zap it for about 4 minutes to get sufficient glass melting. The cracks don't seem to affect its heating properties.",
