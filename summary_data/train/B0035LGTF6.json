      "text": "These are great fins at an economical price compared to similar Jet Fins with similar performance. The problem with them is that the rubber compound is substantially lower quality, and the foot pockets inevitably start to tear after a year or two of use, or sooner if you really push them. I've had this happen on several pairs now, so it is not an isolated occurrence, it's a design issue. They do have a year's warranty, so keep an eye out for this problem and you may be able to get them replaced under warranty rather than having to buy new. I would still recommend them, but with this issue disclosed.",

The portion that sits on top of the foot could be more durable as I have noticed it starts to tear in that location before any other.

I got a size XL fin and they fit over the boots snugly.
