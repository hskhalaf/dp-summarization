We also use the oven for a lot more than just pizzas, super fun to use. I really like the look of it as well, sharp design and extremely portable, very lightweight. A great buy - I would HIGHLY recommend! We enjoy cooking pizzas with the entire family - And the kids love the pizza!",

The key is balancing out flame size/soot production and make sure you get the stone hot enough to get it right. BUY AN INFRARED THERMOMETER!!! You absolutely want to know temps throughout the stone and there is no alternative to an infrared thermometer so it\u2019s a must have. Plus their customer service is top notch. I had one small issue and they got back to me and handled immediately. Great oven, better company.",

It is not hard to use if you read the reviews and watch a youtube how to video. I made 4 pizzas so far with all tasting amazing. Get a good peel. I found that getting it up past 650 degrees requires a small fan in the back (any type of fan) to feed air into the fire box. After that, things were easy and manageable. The pizza tasted amazing, kids really enjoyed it. Really cheap packaging, maybe that's why it came broken to me",

Live in a condo and room on the deck is a premium which makes the Napoli that much better an option for us.",

Once it\u2019s fired up though, the pizza cooking was up to snuff after working through minor but unavoidable technical issues.",

Really a disappointment.",
