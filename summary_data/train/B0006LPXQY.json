However, I was very disappointed when the center bolt and nut began to rust on this item. While the quality of this cutter is otherwise very good, the rust in the center ruins this for me. I am not sure if this is a one off problem or a common problem to the design but in any event, definetly is a deal breaker for me.",

It simply cuts smoothly and cleanly as if it knows what it is supposed to be doing. I don\u2019t dread cutting pizza anymore and I love the blade protector on it. Others complain that it rusts. I mean really. . . DON\u2019T PUT IT IN THE DISHWASHER! Simply wash it and dry it (as recommended). If that is too much work for you to buy this fabulous pizza cutter, I don\u2019t even want to taste your pizza.",

      "text": "This is a heavy, solidly made unit and the cutting wheel is sharp and securely mounted. The grip is large and comfortable. The snap on blade guard is a nice feature as well. There is one major flaw in this product - the diameter of the cutting wheel is too small. This unit works extremely well on thin crust pizza, but on any thick crust pizza, especially one that you have added toppings to, the spindle of the cutting wheel will drag through the pizza toppings and make an awful mess.",

I am 70 years old and my hands are small, but this pizza cutter fits beautifully in my hand and it\u2019s not too heavy. As with all pizza cutters, it is easy to clean. The trick is: Clean the pizza cutter immediately after you use it with hot soapy water. Don\u2019t let the cheese get cold on the cutter...this takes less than 2 minutes! I\u2019m buying more for my family members... I like this one that much.",

I would say the guard the cutter comes with is a waste as you never know where you put the darn thing. They should have colored it rather than make it clear. But your not really buying this for the guard. I was tired of handles breaking off on other cutters so I decided to spend a little more and get a quality product. I don't plan on returning this anytime soon.",

      "text": "I just love this pizza cutter. Very well know brand that I have other applinances from. It is very sturdy and washes up well. The wheel doesn't wobble when you use it. I dont just use it as a pizza cutter. If I'm making home made noodles, I use it to cut the noodles, I use it to cut fudge, and I'm sure there are many more uses that I have not come across yet. Buy this pizza cutter and you will not go wrong!! I love mine!!!!",
