      "text": "Assembly was a little tricky. Just the screwing in was a bit fiddley in parts and the rattan material was in the way of one of the screw holes so we had to snip it. Other than that it's a neat little set and I'm happy with the overall look of it on my decking. One of the chairs was slightly wobbley but it's fine once you're sat on it. For the money I can't complain. Bought some jazzy scatter cushions for it! Overall I'm happy with my purchase and would recommend this to anyone who wanted a slightly more compact set (perfect for a balcony or small patio/decking area)",

All in one box, everything was labeled and easy to locate for assembly, even a few extra screws and washers in case. Assembly took about an hour on my own, although I used an electric screwdriver for final tightening up of screws, this was a godsend. Looks great in the garden, as classy as some sets costing almost three times the price. Just waiting on better weather so we can enjoy it lol",
