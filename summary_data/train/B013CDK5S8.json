I wish the funnel portion of the water filler was much bigger, because it's small size only allows you to add about 0.3 oz at a time to the boiler. The thermometer requires two silicone gaskets because the fitting isn't very good. None of these issues prevent me from using it. In general, it's a fine still at a low cost. I use it as a small test distiller instead of my large commercial 35 gallon distiller.",
