I got an \"animals\" set, but I'd really like to have a set that's all cats. I expect that dog lovers would like set of all dogs as well.

Yes, they are flimsy but otherwise they wouldn't be so easily compacted - you can carry all of the bags and take up barely any space.

      "text": "Go Green! NY is going \"plastic bag free\" and so my mother purchased these bags. I had the chance to try them on a big grocery shop. They are wonderful! Wide handles (for over shoulder even), lits of storage, heavy-duty material. They fold up into a little pouch, which I then put into one large carry bag and keep in my trunk. What a great environmental friendly way to go. Definitely well worth the purchase! (I've ordered more in prints!)",

I didn't catch on anything, nor did it have excessive weight. So that would be my only complaint. The other features are nice! It's easy to fold, and they are sturdy. With plastic bags I feel like my cans/groceries would rip right through, but these don't worry me nearly the same. I felt good not contributing to any more plastic use. I would just change that one minor issue.",
