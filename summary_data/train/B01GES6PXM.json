Having about as flat as feet as you can have I was a little worried about changing shoes, no more! Just logged my 100th mile yesterday for the month of March.. No pain in my heels or legs from the comfort and support of these shoes. I was also a little concerned from going from a 12mm to 8mm heel drop, but after my first run knew I should have made the change a long time ago. Gearing up to run a Half Marathon in these this weekend!!",
