I picked up a new convertible and was looking for a 10\" that could get a lot done in a small sealed box w/o breaking the bank. Picked up two of these and gave them about .93 cu ft each with a Rockford Fosgate R500X1D Prime 1-Channel Class D Amplifier running them. There was a break-in period and they definitely stepped up their game after a few weeks. Its been about 2 years now and no complaints. Actually, I'm considering adding a second amp to push these even harder. Stop shopping and get that system started.",
