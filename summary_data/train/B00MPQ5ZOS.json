I put two tablespoons in my oatmeal with a tablespoon of cacao or cocoa powder and it\u2019s delicious. I also use this to make chia seed ham that\u2019s the greatest stuff ever on pancakes: 1 cup frozen fruit (blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, etc), 2 TB orange juice, and 2 TB chia seeds. Mom need to heat it. Just put it in a container and the liquid from the defrosted fruit interacts with the chia seeds which makes a delicious vegan fruit gel. Good way to get those good healthy omega 3 fats!",

This not only satisfies my craving for sweets but actually is a treat with real satiety and no rebound sugar effect. All positives for me. This is a product I will always have in my cupboard.",

Use them as a pre- or post-workout boost with protein powders that you are already using. You can also sprinkle the seeds as a topping on yogurt, salads, or cereal for a satisfying snack! Our Organic Chia Seeds also make a great egg replacement. Just mix 1 tbs. of chia seeds with 3 tbs. of water and let it sit for 5 minutes. Then use as an egg substitute in your favorite recipes.
