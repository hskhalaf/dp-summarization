I was a big fan of the series 3000 version, but unfortunately they don't seem to sell that model anymore. Regardless, 0/10 wouldn't recommend this!!",

I left it plugged in while trimming and was able to finish with it stopping only a few times. My previous trimmer worked for about 3 years without issues and this one barely made it 3 months.

The turbo mode seems to be the same speed the old one always ran at so that's not a valuable addition.",
