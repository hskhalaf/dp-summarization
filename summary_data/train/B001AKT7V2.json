      "text": "I bought my last Libman Precision Angle broom from Amazon in September 2013 and have just designated it as a porch broom, August 2017! Am buying a new identical one, I like the 11-inch sweep of bristles for my small home, particularly on the bamboo flooring. (They now have large and extra large sizes of this style.) Libman has excellent cleaning products. It would be helpful if illustration showed the top of the handle which would immediately answer people's questions about whether it can be hung on a nail. It has roomy rectangular opening and the top 2 1/2-3 inches is textured in such a way that it stays perfectly in my round broom holder. Please see pictures.",

I was very disappointed since the one I had first is very sturdy and pretty big but this one feels very flimsy and so much smaller. Plus the other broom I bought it for like $10. But I was willing to pay double since I thought it was going to be the same quality. Regret spending those $25. I don't recommend AT ALL!",

Hoping to replace it. It is so stinking small my 4yr old daughter can use it as a toy. Ill keep it just to sweep behind toilets or to retrieve things under the stove or next to the refrigerator but it will take hours to sweep my floors with this tiny thing. I will however look for a bigger one in this brand because they make amazing products.",

UPS, FEDEX, USPS, and the shippers have all been more than careless. I cannot count the problems that I've had. Maybe this problem would make a good \"I'm mad as hell\" letter to Bill O' Reilly.

    "title": "Libman 201 Precision Angle Broom with Recycled Broom Fibers",
    "description": "Make a clean sweep with Libman Precision Angle Broom. This extra wide broom makes maintaining hard floor surfaces simple, from wood and concrete floors to tile and linoleum. The Libman angle broom has a steel handle connected to a one-piece resin block with strong polymer fibers that grip dirt and dust for effortless cleaning. The rugged bristles are crafted from a special, fiber made from recycled PET bottles. A wide 11\" sweeping surface facilitates faster cleaning. The angled bristles can reach places that dust and dirt collects much easier than traditional straight edges, making easy work of sweeping up under cabinets, furniture and even in tight corners. Pair the cleaning broom with the Libman 10\" White Wide Scoop Dust Pan to tackle even your toughest tasks. Additional Libman products are sold separately.",
