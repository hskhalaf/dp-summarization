But tbh because it doesnt produce an open flame it can actually be more difficult to light things cause it only makes a string of electricity basically. So cigarettes are hard, also the top part of it, the cap, makes it hard to light candles that are getting low. Other than that it's cool. I really like how even though it's been dead and uncharged for forever now, it still produces a spark even when its lifeless which still makes fire. Handy.",

Instructions that come with it are clear and easy to understand. Recharging is pretty quick also. Less then 40 min after heavy use day. Another advantage is if lightning a cigg while driving in the dark, your not blinded by it. Nice!",

A cigarette does not fit between them and you have to \"zap\" about 3 different portions of the cigarette for it to light well enough for you to start smoking. It of course removes the need for a typical Zippo or Bic which relies on liquid fuel, but at a price. For me the trade-off wasn't worth it and I am back to my Zippo.",

The lighter itself is very slim and feels great to hold, but I am having a slight issue with it. The button only works when you press the top down, and the bottom of the button just goes in without a click. It's just more of a mild annoyance. I don't know if this is a common issue, or if it's just something the one I got is having issues with, but other than that I like the lighter.",

It should've told me that earlier so I can go charge it before it runs out.",

For all you reviewers that complain about a cigarette not fitting between the electrodes, you are wrong, because you don't have to put the cigarette between the electrodes. You just get the cigarette close to the arc and the arc jumps up and lights the cigarette.",
