He tends to push his food around with his nose and the stand hasn't shook at all. I'd say the quality is great for the price!!",

Also, the feeder leaves that weird white stain that your dish rack gets. I couldn't clean it off, so it looked really gross.

It's just currently a little awkward for my tiny 3 month old pup to navigate food around a large bowl, but since she's being free-fed, i just fill up her bowl with all the food she'd need for the day, and let her take her time eating.

But it\u2019s pretty wobbly. Also, the bowls are HUGE! The amount of food that I put in barely fills the bottom of the bowl! I have a 40lb mid size dog. I can\u2019t imagine what size dog you would have to even fill half that bowl. With that said, I am still happy with the product and I think it is much better for my older dog to eat without bending over so much. I think for the price it was a good buy!",

They\u2019re easy to travel with you, the plastic means they\u2019re easy to clean, you can spray them off and go or wipe them down. If you were to damage or lose the inner bowls you could replace them with the dollar store brand and they\u2019ll fit perfectly. I customized mine with each dog\u2019s name on it and gave them a little more personal touch but these are great. They have rubber stoppers at the end so that your dog doesn\u2019t slide them across the room. This is a great product. Highly recommend.",

The bowls are probably fine for small dogs, but for my 100 lb lab, I\u2019m constantly filling her water with this. Plus, she\u2019s a sloppy drinker, so the water pools in the bowl tray and all over the floor and wall since it splashes now that it\u2019s higher. Trying to clean the water out of the tray is just a mess. Upset that this was almost $30.",

It hasn\u2019t moved an inch, and the only water spilled has come from his dribbly lips. It\u2019s also great for future enormous pups that are still growing. With the height being adjustable, it grows along with them. The bowls come out easily for cleaning, and the holder is easy to wipe down. We\u2019ve been really happy with it so far!",

Yes it\u2019s made of plastic and may seem a tad bit wobbly at first but once I set it down against the wall with the water bowl filled and food dish in it, it is fine. It was also easy to assemble which is a plus. Water does gather at the top when your dog laps out of it but isn\u2019t that what it\u2019s supposed to do? Overall I think the stand is nice and my dog looked kind of surprised when he didn\u2019t have to bend over to eat the first evening. It\u2019s worth purchasing.",
