Problem is , the seller just seems to pass around the same shoe that\u2019s been returned. I ended up with the same yellowish, un-matching , discolored shoe that another reviewer had written about. Instead of the seller taking it out of circulation to fix the problem, they just keep selling it to somebody who eventually doesn\u2019t want to go through the hassle of returning it and buying a new pair . Not cool! .. it\u2019s yellow, pic doesn\u2019t do it justice.",

Next there are some reviews about the shoe being, \"The most comfortable shoe they've ever worn.\" That has to be lies because my foot hurt for the 20 minutes I could handle. Also this shoe is a mix of the huarache and air max and they had a baby. Not going to lie they don't look super cool to me more like older men shoes. Only reason I might keep them is because of the price. Wouldn't recommend to people with wide foot unless you get a size bigger.",
