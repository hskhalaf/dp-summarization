      "verdict": "Set to start a legacy of its own, the Keds Champion is a pioneer sneaker emblazoned with simplicity and sophistication while expanding its horizons of function and style. Its prim appeal ironically enlists itself as an all-around sneaker from basic tasks like running errands to casual leisure activities. The minimalist design blends in with almost any clothing which also brings back the classic vibe.",
      "pros": [
        "More than 60% of the reviewers gave the Keds Champion favorable comments revolving around its durability, comfort, size, and quality",
        "The sneaker boasts a simple yet fashionable image that can either be dressed up or down expanding different scenarios",
        "Many buyers find the sneaker to be inexpensive which was a feat kept fairly by Keds throughout the years",
        "It is available in varying widths from narrow (S) to extra wide (XW)",
        "The Keds Champion superbly blends in with almost any article of clothing from pants to dresses and many more",
        "Many users have worn them since they were kids and had stayed loyal to the shoe",
        "The canvas material quickly dries when moistened or soaked",
        "The sneaker is adorably cute and feminine",
        "Many utilize the Champion as an everyday foot apparel",
        "The sneaker is advised by someone who does not need an extra pair of shoes for every kind of activity",
        "It is praised to be functional and can be worn in many situations than running shoes",
        "It is lightweight",
        "Very few users were astonished that it very well accommodates bunions"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "Some users experience blisters on the heel due to the stiff material of the back collar",
        "This component requires serious breaking-in",
        "Many customers disgustingly proclaimed that the recent releases of the Keds Champion had either decreased its quality or revamped its construction which became unsuitable for their preference",
        "Most of them requested Keds to revert their production to the previous formula of the sneaker",
        "The laces found on recent iterations of the Champion became thinner and weaker as compared before",
        "The dye of the insole on the white colorway of the sneaker would bleed through the canvas upper and leave blue stain marks when machine washed",
        "The color also tends to spread to socks when the colored footbed becomes wet",
        "Few users noted that the side pieces of rubber along the panels are pulling out from the canvas after some time",
        "The form of the sneaker changed from round toe to long and narrow, according to some reviewers"
