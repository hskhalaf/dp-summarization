      "text": "I'm a professional videographer and photographer; one of the hazards of my career is a perpetual need for more and more hard drive space. I have around 10TB worth of hard drives, and this is the best of them. It's survived many a trip on set (including several occasions when it's been dropped), which is not an easy environment. This is easily the best hard drive I've ever purchased. You will need a USB 3.0 Male to Female Extension Cable to make things feasible, but once you've made that purchase, you'll never look back (and you'll still have saved money over other rugged drives).",

Provided they live by their 3-year warranty, I may opt to send this in for replacement. In the meantime, I picked up an external USB3.1 case and a Crucial 500GB SSD to replace it for now.

I emailed Silicon Power with photos of the cracks to obtain warranty repairs but got no replies. Now the case has holes where the plastic has cracked. Not sure if it is waterproof anymore.

Very pleased with my purchase, and no sign yet that it's wearing out. I thought the little blue USB 3.0 cord would've started coming loose from its holster by now, but it still fits in just fine. I don't use it every day, so it may not see as much wear and tear as some users, but it's still a very solid product (made in Taiwan!)",

On the random read/write tests, the differences were more pronounced. Very impressive! There were several low reviews mentioning the high pitched whine. If I put my ear directly against the drive, I can hear a whine, similar in pitch to a CRT (which I can still hear too, even if it's rare that I encounter one), but from further than a foot away, it's not noticeable in a quiet room.",

It comes with a super short cord, and a long one, bout 2 1/2 feet, I could use a longer one, but I have heard its special, because of the ends, so I don't know if that is possible.
