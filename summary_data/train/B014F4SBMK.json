Even with two fans running, it is extremely quiet. I like the fact that it uses a USB cord and switch to power the unit from the back and not the bottom, so that the cord and switch will not get damaged. The additional USB port is a nice bonus. Works well with my 13\" Macbook Pro, keeps everything cool.",

I work in the IT field and though I don't repair laptops anymore, I know how bad it gets when the fans are sucking in air from the bottom, which most laptops still do so today and most of the laptop cooling pads are doing as well. Not this guy, I really like the functional design of this cooling pad. It sucks the air from the sides, the bottom is solid and has an air gap that leaves your lap, or whatever you set this on, cool and comfortable. It doesn't try to suck up hot pillow air if you set it on a pillow. This thing really works great.",

This fan is garbage and you are putting your laptop at risk by using it. It is quiet because it barely pushes any air. It is lightweight because it is cheap plastic. The grip strip at the front does absolutely nothing. The surface is so slick you are putting your laptop at risk by using it. Find a better option that will actually hold your laptop in place and cool it by you know... pushing air. I equate the air this moves to one of those tiny battery powered hand held fans you hold up to your face. Terrible!",

Running games on the i7 Gen 8 can bring the CPU temp up to 82-83, and this cooler only drops the temp about 2-3 degrees. Sure the fans are quiet but that's due to the low RPM - They just don't move enough air to be effective. When you put your hand to them you can barely feel anything. Also, the non slip pad doesn't seem to have any impact, as the laptop slides forward even with a slight angle. Bottom line, for gaming i would definitely seek another solution.",

The price is good and it keeps my laptop cool and functioning great, it's good that when I forget to cut it off it turns off when my computer shuts down. It's easy to use in bed and my laptop doesn't slide off thanks to the grips at the bottom of the pad. My only problem is the rubber feet at the underside of the pad are coming off so I took away stars because of that. It's still a good buy.",

I am extremely pleased with the low rumble of the fans and the fact that I can feel the cool air. The downside is, with this cool spring and our Iowa temperatures still in the 30's to 50's, my fingers gets a little chilly when I am not typing put have my hands on my desk top. Not a big deal but the fans are proving to me that they are cooling. This item was delivered on time and in great shape. I would certainly purchase another unit if needed.",

On the positive side, the fans do blow well and will help to cool your laptop.",
