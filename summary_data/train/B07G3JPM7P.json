The foam is really breathable. the strap feels durable. Looking forward to having a few other lenses, but this murder black lens is so cool! You will not find a better goggle in this price range.

Not a deal breaker, just an annoyance. The best quality of these goggle is the magnetic lens. Theyre extremely easy to remove and replace. Because of this and the FOV I'll primarily be using these googgles as a backup or when I need to switch to a lower light lens.",

The blue mirror performed well in sunny all the way to slightly overcast conditions and purchased the yellow mirror lenses separately for low light. Lenses are very easy to swap out on the fly, and the lenses come with a soft wipe cover. Skied 5 days with these a few weeks back and very happy with the purchase.",

      "text": "These googles are very good overall. The lens system is really easy and makes them feel premium to me. However the biggest downside is that peripheral vision with the goggles on isn't that wide and I still find myself wanting something with more visibility. If you're like me and want to see 180 I wouldn't recommend these and to just pay more for some that will offer that vision. That said these googles look great and I'd recommend these for about 85% of the population.",

Super easy to replace lenses in 15 seconds. These have never fogged up, and have not scratched at all. I love these and would recommend them to anyone. You CANNOT see your eyes with the blue, and also you can't see your eyes with the amber. Both are extremely mirrored and looks amazing. Do yourself a favor and get a pair!!",

I cannot blame the product as it was extremely cold. A second pair would be advisable then tuck frozen pair in jacket to thaw and wear new set until frozen, repeat until at destination. For the price it is a viable option if you don\u2019t wear a heated helmet",

Compared to other lens change outs with previous goggles I have owned this is as simple as it gets and with how the magnets are spaced, it make it impossible to not line up.",

After giving these a shot for a couple of outings I ended up buying Anon Helix 2.0s which are better in every way - for about 30$ more. If you don\u2019t need an OTG fit or have a large face - I recommend spending a few more bucks on a better goggle, or way less money on an entry level pair.",

This new system will no longer be a drag, when I need to make a quick adjustment for viewing options! Overall, I think Wild Horn Outfitters hit a home run for a new product...
