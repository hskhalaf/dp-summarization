The one inside has been great while our oldest daughter babysits and we can see what they are up to while we're away.

It stopped working so I reinstalled the app on my phone and reset the camera back to factory settings. It will no longer recognize the Internet and I am unable to get it to work again. Also the app that is used for this, called Happy See, shows up on my antiviral software as containing spyware. I can't return it because it worked for the first 30 days and I am now five days past the time that I can get a refund.",

      "text": "I had to return this, but not because it was bad in a general way. I wanted something with which to observe chickens in a coop at night. Unfortunately, chickens can see in the infrared spectrum, and this (probably the same as other similar devices) uses a infrared \"light\" to illuminate night scenes. That keeps the chickens awake, so, not good for me. However, in general, and the basis of giving five stars, it seemed good. Easy to configure (in multiple ways) easy to control with the free app, and with decent enough picture quality. The night picture was great, unfortunately just not obtained in a way that worked for me. Very grateful for Amazon return policies!",

This is a great middle of the road camera if you're not needing anything super high-tech, although I have been pleasantly surprised by it. The motion detection is great and you can opt to have your phone alert you when there's any motion. You can also change the level of motion detection. It's also extremely useful when you're away from your house and want to check-in on things. Again, it does the job for the price you pay for it!",

Because it doesn't work. I was completely unable to get the camera set up with wifi. It wouldn't recognize that I had connected to the cameras wifi and it would not allow me to select a different wifi network. Look at the newer reviews on this camera. It doesn't work.",

The microphone only works sometimes on mine too so it\u2019s useless in that respect. Helped me keep an eye on the pups while at work though to see who was pooing in the kennel.",
