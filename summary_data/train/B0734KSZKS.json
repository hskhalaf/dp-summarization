I suspect if it's good enough for my medical use, it will work great in the garden.",

This would obviously be perfect for anyone who is doing a lot of gardening, or anyone who has to kneel on the the ground for any purpose. It could also be used to sit on, when one has to sit on a hard bench. Since it's lightweight, it would be easy to take with you. I'm very pleased with this purchase.",
