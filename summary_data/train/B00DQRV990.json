      "text": "Bought this for my nephew for Christmas last year. He absolutely adores it and plays with it all the time. When he was younger, he enjoyed pushing the snail around and making the tail wag, and rolling the shell on the floor (with the blocks inside, it makes a very loud, satisfying 'clack-clack-clack' as it rolls). Now he is fully engaged in the matching game aspect. I suspect the next stage is using it as a pull toy on his toddler adventures around the house. I was also very impressed with the build quality of this toy. The fit and finish are excellent and the wood is high-quality with no rough edges. The colors are bright and attractive.",

We thought we had gotten a nice toy all of our children could play with, but it did not even make it past the first child.",

Once she was over a year old, she came to terms with the eyes and started to pull the base around the house. She still loved putting the shapes in place. She also likes to attempt to say the colors and shapes. This is a great toy for teaching fine motor skills, colors, and shapes.",
