I know packing your cooler too full is not efficient, but the latch pops open if the cooler gets tipped over or bumped hard enough. I was really disappointed only in the latch.

I bought two thick big paks to freeze (about 1 1/2 inches thick and almost 8x11 in size) I place them in the bottom and put our beverages on that and then our sandwiches/snacks and they stay cold for the two day trip back and forth. (Michigan to Florida) This is a quality product and it can take abuse until the last two I went through and accidentally dropped out of the vehicle.",

The metal handles are sturdy, it has a great retro look, and most importantly kept our brews and food cold for a minimum of 4 days! Not having to buy ice everyday was so awesome and it sat in a hot car the whole time and kept things nice a chill! So, skip the fancy over priced coolers if you want to spend less for a great product! We roll with a '67 Shasta retro trailer so, this cooler fit right in!",
