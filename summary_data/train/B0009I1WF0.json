I'd return them but it's not worth the effort. I'll just replace them in a few years. UPDATED: The company noticed my review and sent me the next size up. They fit perfectly. The lesson here is, it can be hard to measure tires, and if you're at the upper limit of a size's range, get the next size up.",

The tight fit ensures they will not blow off in the wind. They are a little tricky to put on because I don't have very much space under the wheel well. But it's really not that hard. It just takes 30 seconds to jiggle them into place and get them straightened out. They don't reach all the way to the ground. But since I park my trailer in a lower spot that will help keep water off of them.",

Since I have put these on we haven't had one blow out. The fit and construction are great. Need to buy 2 more sets for my toy hauler to keep the tire from rotting.
