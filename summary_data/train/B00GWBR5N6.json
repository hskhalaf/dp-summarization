Once I figured it out I was very pleased! So happy I found and bought this product. Also, it\u2019s been almost 2 hours since using and my lips are still pretty plump \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc",

Cut a drink stirrer or straw in half and place in between your lips, than put the plumper over the straw and suck. It will create a small opening in your lips so that you can hold constant pressure when using the product. once I did that I had no problem, and my lips come out beautiful and plump.",

I have done lip injections once before and loved the look but the needle pain was awful and the bruising was so bad I looked like I had been In a fight and the bruises lasted for weeks. The first time I used this product I was amazed at The results. My kids noticed the difference right away lol. It doesn\u2019t last very long but I am assuming like other people have said the more You use it the longer it will Last.",

It does the job for a quick fix but def. wouldn't last longer than like 30 minutes. If you pull too hard, you WILL get blue lips and it looks scary.",

It takes a little practice to apply the enhancer properly (the videos at fullips.com were helpful), but once you achieve the results you want it is very easy to repeat the process. I had too reapply the enhancer a just a few times a day to maintain the look I wanted. Thank you for offering a very inexpensive option to lip injections.",
