Twice it was covered with warranty and twice I've done it myself (Search: LG 4681EA2001T Drain Pump Washing Machine). It's difficult and annoying to continue to replace these every 3 to 6 months. We are _avid_ about cleaning the lint trap and ensuring pockets are empty in clothing. I'm so frustrated with this thing. Save yourself. I'm literally about to tear it down again to replace the 4th one, and thought I might save you some trouble as well.",

So you will need to make sure the washing machines drain tube is as LOW as possible. It will not be able to push water out to a drain higher two feet which most drains are over that high. So you can do what I did and buy a grey water pump to push water to where it needs to go.",

I had a small version lg washer dryer combo and never had this issue. Did the seller sell me a defected unit or what? We made cabinet next to the washer and also add granite on top so it looks like build in! Now what should I do? Such hassle for $1700!",
