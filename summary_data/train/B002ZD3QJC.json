It actually makes great coffee and you don't get all of the coffee build up that you get in regular coffee makers. No grounds in your coffee, easy clean etc. I think it takes extra time to make the coffee, but as he makes the coffee, what do I care. He's happy with it and I get a great cup of coffee. Great for camping too. No messy pots to clean. Lightweight and comes with it's own carry bag. Nice for people who only want that 1 cup of coffee a day.",

I thought they were just needless plastic packing materials to keep the shape of the package. It turns out that the one funnel shaped piece actually is a funnel for pouring freshly ground beans into the main chamber without spilling. Unfortunately the other piece I threw away which I read elsewhere is to be used to store the circular filters. Oops.",

I add water to the concentrated coffee this makes for my morning cup. It's important to grind the beans extra fine. I've tried tossing in my housemates' normal-grind beans when I'm out of coffee and the result is just not the same. For iced coffee. I brew the coffee concentrate pour it over ice, without adding extra water. Mmmm, coffee... I think I'm going to go make myself a cup right now.",

You just push the grounds through it and out the bottom then rinse the plunger.

I've tried all sorts of things, like putting milk directly into the chamber, or sugar, or Kahlua, or anything else. There are many possibilities here beyond just simple coffee making that people have yet to discover, I think.",

The hotter water produced a much better product with the same grounds. Best brewing method I've found is from Black Rifle Coffee's YouTube video about the Aeropress. Great product!!!",
