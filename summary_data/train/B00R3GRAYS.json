The stain did not come out all of the way and now I am too nervous to use any other colors. The marker is filled with liquid that you can see moving around inside, these are not like the usual felt type. I might have just been shipped a bad batch however I will be throwing these away.",

If you're questioning which brand of dry erase markers to get, I highly recommend these. They definitely blow Expo out of the water.",

Later in the day I tried the green one, which didn't leak on me, but it definitely wasn't as bold and bright as it should have been, being that I just made the purchase. Needless to say, I don't plan to purchase more. :-(",
