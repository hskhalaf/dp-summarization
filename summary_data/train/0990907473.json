I failed by a few questions as you can see above. I purchased this book, read it cover to cover twice. I read roughly 1-2 chapters a night and completed the quizzes. I took a week break inbetween and then did the 200question read. I memorized the IPECC ISSCQRCRPS chart and formulas. After that I scored much higher and as you can see. Listen to the books tips, read it, and take the PMp with confidence. Thanks guys!",

There is also a video that goes along with each section giving it a bit of an instructor led feel. If you are planning on sitting for your PMP I would highly recommend this book.",
