I thought I would try this to begin with, I went with this product because of the reviews and saw some PTTD sufferers liked this. Unfortunately this does not work well for me. The fit is fine just it doesn\u2019t stay put. It falls down over time making the white strap loose so it\u2019s no longer mimicking the tendon. It\u2019s unfortunate that this was kind of pricey and didn\u2019t do a thing for me. I\u2019m sure if you sprained an ankle or something this would be perfect. But for a person who suffers from PTTD don\u2019t waste your time or money on this.",

      "text": "This brace does not adjust around the metatarsal area since it is a solid piece of elastic fabric. I had an avulsion fracture (sprained ankle with torn ligaments, broken ankle, and fractured 5th metatarsal) and I could not get the solid fabric part of the brace over my foot without screaming pain. I actually could not even use the brace and had to return it for that reason. If you just have a sprain, it looks like a good brace. But if your injury includes a broken foot, get a brace with lacing over the foot.",

I can wear it all day. It is a little hot during the hot summer heat, but not more than a sweat sock would be and well worth the relief provided. I don't know about other foot/ankle issues, but for PTTD it is wonderful.",

And then I can never get it as smooth as the picture, so it's too bulky to fit inside most of my shoes. I'm going to keep trying, though, because it does support my ankle well, and I can wrap it where I need it most.",

It is a bit of a learning curve with all the Velcro straps, but if that helps to avoid wearing a hard plastic device, well worth the time. It does seem to run just a bit small.",

The Trilok is made from three main components that mimic your body\u2019s natural tendons to secure your ankle and allow a safe range of motion. These straps encourage healthy arch posture, and prevent inversion and eversion.",
      "CALCULATED COMPRESSION: The micro-fleece lined compression sleeve is a comfortable way to reduce swelling in the foot and ankle after an injury. Compression also improves recovery time, increasing blood flow to bring nutrients to the site of the injury.",
