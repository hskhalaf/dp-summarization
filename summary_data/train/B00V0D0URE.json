Tech support says the only way to fix this is to manually reboot the router, and then improve the reception of the single. Of course, without a way to tell whether Piper is receiving a strong enough wifi signal there's no way to tell whether it will randomly disconnect. Tech support assures me this is normal and the unit is functioning as designed. If that's the case then it's just not suitable as a security system. Maybe as a nanny cam.",

      "text": "We purchased Piper because our old alarm system stopped working. The only downside I have found thus far is Piper always recognizes our small dog and sets off the motion alarm. Other than that it seems to be a great system. We have had no false alarms that we have not caused. I really like the feature that records any activity that causes an alarm activation and stores it in the cloud. We have our Piper set so that it beeps, my thought is if someone does break in and hears the beeping they may walk toward it and in doing so give us a perfect shot of their face.",

Could be just a 1-off bad experience (I will be testing another pair of Pipers in a different house/location shortly), so the 3 stars here are a little generous and giving the product the benefit of the doubt.",
