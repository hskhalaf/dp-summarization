      "text": "This CPU provides a very good compromise between processing speed and power consumption. It is fast enough to handle some serious gaming, and demanding applications such as video editors. The lower power consumption also means it generates less heat than the non \"e\" version, however I would recommend buying a better CPU cooler. The stock cooler works fine, but will spend a lot of time spinning at full speed, and so makes a fair bit of noise. I'm using a Zalman CNPS7X LED CPU Cooler.",

      "text": "In order to resurrect a 5 year old system, this was the best CPU supported by the motherboard. Compared to the FX 6100 it replaced, it was a big improvement. I set all cores to turbo speed (4.3ghz) and it handles everything I use it for without issues. It will become dated (if not already) with new upcoming AMD cpu releases in March, however it is the best available AM3+ socket chip and was the cheaper option to keep it going for another year without replacing the motherboard.",
