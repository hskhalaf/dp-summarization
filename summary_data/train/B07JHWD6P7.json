Both models looking down at them compared to my old hikers that I'm trying to replace looked like dress shoes,long & narrow,with my hikers wider with blunt toe box & real comfortable. I don't need serious hikers here in Fl but do need something that fits so will have to upgrade. Bottom line,don't buy Columbia shoes w/o free return shipping.",

The body of the shoe doesn't feel any wider than the 9 regular but there is much better room in the toe. I'm pretty hard on shoes, so only time will tell about durability.",

I've taken these out to Rock Springs Run State Preserve and was quite pleased with their performance. The label says \"breathable\", and while it breathes better than a pair of solid upper Levi shoes I wear, it's not as good as regular sneakers. Still, if it keeps my feet dry through the mud or rain, I'll be content.",
