They need better monitoring of their product when filling the bags and make sure there are not empty shells to so many kinds of nuts. At first I thought it was just an innocent slight not noticing this, but every other hand full has an empty shell or half shell of the nuts included. Will not purchase again.",

I had barely enough food for the Macaw after separating out the things that didn\u2019t belong",
