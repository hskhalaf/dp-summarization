The base is not washable because of the electronics. It's called white vinegar people.

I bought it hoping it would be a little more energy efficient than the stove and plus needed to come up with something I could call a gift. When she does them on the stove, she often forgets about them and lets them go for 5 to 10 or maybe even 15 minutes longer than needed. This is so easy to use. She loves it. Plus maybe it will pay for itself in a year or 2 in savings from not having the stove on for 5 to 15 minutes longer than needed.",
