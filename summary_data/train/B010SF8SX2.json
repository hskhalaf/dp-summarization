I grabbed onto it and it kept me afloat through the rest of the rapids till I reached the bank. When I looked inside everything was perfectly dry.

Product looked great out of the package and appeared to hold up the first two weeks...

I would have given 5 stars, but the included phone case is too small for my Samsung Galaxy, so it's not really 'universal'.",

With the iPhone 7 Plus you can NOT physically press the home button through the bag so make sure to enable the soft home button before you use the bag. Otherwise the bags was super helpful on the lake when we got lost on a canoe and had to use google maps. Love it!",

The waterproof phone bag, however, I can 100% guarantee works. I lost my phone while swimming at the beach and because visibility was so poor, I couldn't find it. A week later, another snorkeler spotted my phone, on the ocean floor 8 feet deep, and rescued it. My phone was completely dry and in perfect condition after 7 days underwater, all because of this bag. I highly recommend it!!",

Since the top folds over to make it waterproof, it was unlikely that someone would be able to get in/undo and steal something while we were wearing it over our shoulder/back. We will defiantly be using this for boating, jet skiing, and beaching this summer! Would highly recommend and would defiantly purchase again.",
