She\u2019s 48 inches tall & 46 pounds. I bought these in January but she\u2019s just now using them for swim lessons. After swim class we both immediately noticed that her hair was a lot drier than previous swim caps she\u2019s used. She said it was too tight & she likes that she has 2 color options. I also love the zipper pouch it comes with. The pouch can hold both swim caps & her goggles (with a case ask) at the same time. I would definitely recommend these.",

The caps (except the one that ripper, of course) are really good, stretch well to fit my 8 year olds head and seem to be working great for her.",
