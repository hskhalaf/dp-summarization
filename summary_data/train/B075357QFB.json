UPDATE: The day after I wrote the original review, the lid cracked, under gentle pressure to snap it shut. It hasn't even been in use a month. Reducing to 1 star.",

This product is an amazing value. It snaps together and comes apart easily for litter changing, but is very sturdy enough to carefully relocate using the handle. I attached the door and swung it around vigorously, seemed very well attached but I ended up taking it off since it confused my cat. I recommend the large size, since cats are generally happier with a litter box more than twice their size. It fits well in my small Seattle apartment. The inside is stick-proof and very easy to clean. Super satisfied.",

I just sprinkle baking soda back there and have never had any issues (and certainly no need to use chopsticks to break it up like other reviews...). The issue that some people have with the back is because they use cheap/ineffective cat litter. Use this cat box with Dr. Elsey's cat litter, a sprinkle of baking soda and you'll never smell your cat box. Cleaning is a breeze if you use the right stuff.",

And my fat, little demon who wants to dig her way back to hell can no longer flip kitty litter outside of the box. So far the box has been fantastic... No smells, no mess.",

There are also 2 thin recesses in the back of it that you cannot get to with a regular sized scooper so if any wet litter gets in that area, it is very hard to clean it.",
