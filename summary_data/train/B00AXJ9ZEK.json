While most makeup will work for little imperfections, this is the concealer I reach for when dealing with a blemish. It doesn't dry it out causing it to get flaky, buy it isn't oily either causing it to wipe off easily. It covers blemishes with without making them even worse. And it works really well when used with Revlon's color-stay foundation. Been using the two for years and they work awesome!",
