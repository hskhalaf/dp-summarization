No problems with the smell after washing them. The case seems a little plastic/weak - so I would haul with caution, but no other complaints (never had a problem swapping weights, seem to stay on tight enough not to wiggle).

      "text": "This is your basic pair of dumbbells and weights. The weights seem to be very good quality. Would have given 5 stars but the design for the carrying case for the weights is defective. The case itself is very sturdy plastic but the clips to hold it closed are as cheap as they come and both were cracked upon arrival. For an extra 10 cents toward production costs, they could have an overall great product. If I needed the carrying case I would have returned the set. Fortunately I don't so recycled the case and kept the weights.",

When FedEx (used for the Free Super Saver Shipping btw) brought the package to my door I was just shocked at the condition the box was in, it looked like it has been to war and back. Aside from the very poor packaging this set is excellent. I was tempted to splurge and buy thebut I couldn't bring myself to paying that much just on dumbbells, the money is just not there for those at the moment. The Cap Dumbbell set is good for the money.",
