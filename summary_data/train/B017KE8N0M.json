No regrets so far.",

In addition the plastic on the side arms cracked in several places and eventually broke in half on one side. Then the other side cracked in half at around 9 months. So, they are a mess of tape and bare ear cushions only suitable for using at the house if I have no other options. Would not buy again.",

It's too bad because I really like the product, but I am going to have to go with something else in the near future. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone......",

Born August 2018 - RIP April 2019. You can see the other side starting to form small cracks too. Samsung will not warranty these, they only offer to repair at customer cost.
