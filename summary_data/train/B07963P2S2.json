These neoprene toe warmers have done exactly what the costly (and wasteful) Little Hotties do - keep my toes nice and warm! It's nice that the set includes 2 pairs to alternate back & forth between washing/drying. So nice to find something more economical and ecologically correct to help me get through these winter months. Also, had a slight problem with one of the booties and the seller (21Centurysolutions) responded quickly with an acceptable resolution to the problem. Thanks!",

    "description": "Don't let cold toes stop you from enjoying the outdoors! When you go outside on a cold day, your body restricts blood flow to the extremities to preserve heat (temperature) for the vital organs, and your toes, fingers, ears, and nose get cold first.\n\nOur 21C Toe Warmers are the ultimate socks for your toes, and are designed to provide both comfort and insulation. A must have if you suffer from Raynaud's disease, neuropathy, or if your feet are always cold.\n\nYou get 2 Pairs and they come in 2 Sizes, because one size fits all doesn't work with feet! To pick the perfect fit, please make sure you measure the width of your foot and use the guide below. (Since they are just for the toes and ball of foot, how wide are your feet is more important than your shoe size.)\n\nSIZE GUIDE:\n\nSIZE 1: Women 6-8 Men 8-10\n\nSIZE 2: Women 8.5-12 Men 10.5-14\n\nMEASUREMENTS:\n\nSIZE 1: Length 5 inches - Opening Width 4 inches\n\nSIZE 2: Length 5.7 inches - Opening Width 4.7 inches\n\n Backed by 21 Century Solutions 100% satisfaction guarantee or your money back! If you have any issues with your toe warmers please contact us and we will get the problem solved ASAP!",
