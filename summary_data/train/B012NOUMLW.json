      "text": "I bought this scooter for my 15 year old son. He wanted something with a strong frame, that would hold up well. It seems like a very strong, sturdy scooter, but after only riding it a couple of times (on the street, nothing rough), something is wrong with the front wheel. It's loose, and he can't ride it. I'm not finding a way to get replacement parts, or a number to call. He had an old worn out scooter, of a different brand, and he switched the wheels. The wheel from the other brand is working fine.",

      "text": "There were two significant issues with this scooter, so I returned it. 1) The brake on the back wheel did not work. The brake consisted of a very thin piece of metal that the rider pushes against the tire to slow down. However, the brake on this scooter model was so thin and flimsy that it didn't \"bounce back\". Instead it stayed depressed against the tire. My impression is that this is a design flaw rather than a one-off issue. 2) Another design issue is that the tires are nearly impossible to inflate because of the location of the stem. My strong recommendation is that you save yourself some hassle and choose a different scooter.",
