The problem is that the bed does not indent, it just becomes incredibly soft, so when you get in, you sink into where there is no support.

I've always had some issues with my back which is why I bought this bed. Now I get to deal with achy hips and shoulders as well. I'm not sure which bed is the right one to get but I do know this is not the one.",

      "text": "I really wanted to make this mattress work...loved the concept of affordable mattresses without the cheesy mattress salesmen. Unfortunately, the bed was too firm for me. I tried adding a memory foam topper but it still was too uncomfortable for me. My husband liked it initially, but it became too firm for him as well. If you need a firm mattress, this is the one for you. Fast, simple delivery and setup. A fair return program is really important when buying mattresses online. Will follow-up and report how it goes for me.",

      "text": "Had mine for about two years now and I hate it. It started breaking down about 6 months after I got it and it can be extremely difficult to sleep on. Kicker? Because foam's degradation mode is in its stiffness, not it's shape, the magical guarantees based off of how much the surface sinks are useless. I would not buy this mattress again nor would I suggest anyone else buy it. The ONLY acceptable use for this mattress is in a guest room where it is used only a handful of times a year. Otherwise, you are stuck with a poor mattress that you have to replace yearly.",

      "text": "Should have done this sooner, have been sleeping on an older inner-spring mattress that had developed a sag due to repeated use. Many back issues that often worsened from sleeping on that mattress. Since switching over to the T&N mattress my back has felt better daily, I think I'm sleeping a lot better as well. No regrets except that I didn't try it sooner. Also, VERY reasonable price. Haven't owned it long enough yet to comment on longevity, expect from reading about it that I'll get at least ten years of use. At my age that's practically half the rest of MY life expectancy! ;)",

Yet this mattress has no contouring. It doesn't shape to your form to reduce joint pressure. We had an extra firm mattress for years that was perfectly supportive yet memory molded to your form, so that pressure was taken off the lower back, hips, and knees. Sadly, that manufacturer doesn't exist anymore, and the jury is still out on whether a plush mattress topper will remedy the concerns with this mattress.",

      "text": "I waited a few weeks after delivery before writing this because I thought the mattress would soften or expand more but the it's still giving me shoulder pain because of it's firmness. I sleep on my side so this mattress might not be right for side sleepers. They used to solve this issue by giving customers a free topper to soften the mattress. Now they give a 50% discount, which still comes out to around $80 for a full sized mattress. This is an annoying additional cost for a problem that should, in my opinion, be fixed without any additional cost.",

      "text": "I couldn't be happier with this mattress. It arrived well packed and compressed, and only took a few hours to open up enough to sleep on. Once aired out, there is no discernible smell to the foam. It has a padded cover and is firm enough for good support, but no so firm as to be uncomfortably stiff. I purchased a full size and wasn't sure 10 inches would be thick enough, but it is plenty big enough for one person, very comfortable and fits perfectly on the Zinus wood slat platform bed. I don't know about durability yet, but everything else so far is 5 stars.",

I slept on it too at the edge and felt it was too soft for me. The delivery was quick and packaging was good and there was very little smell to it so we are happy so far!",

So we got the classic version of T&N. It took about a week for our bodies to get fully used to it. There were some cricks and pains the first week, but I've changed my mattress enough in my life to know that's normal. I must note that we also changed our pillows to cervical pillows and now our nights are comfy and dreamy.",

This is actually our second one; we purchased a queen size a few years ago and recently upgraded to the king.

I generally, in my dark mattress past, went for the softest available \u2014 oh, what a fool I was. This is perfect. We invite everyone who comes to our door to lay down on it, even rogue ding-dong-ditching teenagers, and everyone loves it. It. Is. Perfect. And cheap!",
