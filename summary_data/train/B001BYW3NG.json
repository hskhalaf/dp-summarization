There is nothing good about this cleaner. The access to the water tank is frankly just stupid. Every action is difficult and not at all user friendly. The on/off button is in a very strange place which is not at all handy. I have now had it less than six months and it is on its way to the repair shop. Glad I kept my old one.

I left it on the carpet for a short time while the carpet dried and I empty the bucket- what a mess to clean that single line of now dried dirty water that dripped on the carpet. WARNING",

The biggest limitation is the tank size which is a bit small, but keeps the unit light and easy to maneuver. The unit I bought did not have the hand brush unit which I didn't need with my furniture. Suction with this unit is a bit low, so going back over cleaned areas several times for dry pick up is recommended. This unit should last 3-4 years with nominal use. This makes it a great and economic alternative to renting a rug cleaner or a professional cleaner. Rated 4 stars because of the small tank size and low suction.",

Seems cheap, but I will update my review once I use it. Do not add scolding hot water, you may melt the bag or crack the tank. -Feels cheap and thin (but again this may contribute to the lightweight)",

I sure miss the old Made in USA days when things lasted for than one or two uses.",

I have seen some reviews of parts melting for other people, but that hasn't been an issue for us. We have cleaned the carpets completely in 2 of our bedrooms twice now with no issue. We were cautious and allowed the device to rest for 5 minutes or so while we changed the water. My only complaint is that the reservoir doesn't hold a lot of water, so water changes are frequent for an average sized bedroom.",

You may think your carpet is clean until you use this thing and see all the hidden dirt is takes out.

I see no reason to pay extra for a machine that heats the water unless you are going to use it more frequently in cold weather.

Portable, lightweight, and easy to use, the Bissell PowerLifter PowerBrush Upright Deep Cleaner protects and extends carpet life by removing deep-down grit and stains, using just hot tap water, deep-cleaning detergent, and its four-row rotating DirtLifter PowerBrush. Carpets are left clean, odor-free, even gently groomed for a polished look. The PowerLifter's user-friendly design includes thoughtful touches like a comfortable handle, quick-release cord hooks, a lint screen, and easy-to-maneuver wheels, as well as a built-in measuring cup and a removable nozzle for quick clean up. \n\n In addition, the unit's two-in-one water-tank system features a heavy-duty bladder inside for clean water, which empties and mixes with the cleaning formula during operation. The dirty water that gets pulled out of the carpets collects around the outside of the bladder, which means the clean and dirty water never mix. The unit's wide cleaning path covers more ground in less time, while the 20-foot power cord spares users from unplugging and re-plugging when cleaning larger rooms. The PowerLifter is not a steam-cleaning machine, so don't expect the same results that steam can deliver. It is, however, an inexpensive alternative to professional cleaning, without the hassle and expense of carting a rental machine back and forth. The unit comes with a 8-ounce bottle of Fiber Cleansing Formula and a dual-purpose Scotchgard-enhanced detergent that both deep-cleans carpet and protects it from future dirt and stains. The 12 amp full-size upright deep cleaner measures 19 by 11 by 44 inches and carries a one-year limited warranty. --Mary Park",
