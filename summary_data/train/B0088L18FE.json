      "text": "I have had this computer for about 2 years now, till working great with occasional issues that most windows computers have gotten in my experience. I love how thin the computer is although its not particularly light (not that its particularly heavy either). the only complaints I have are the keyboard and mouse are not the greatest. the keyboard often double types letters or misses a letter I typed and I have to constantly correct it the mouse isn't bad but it isn't great either. i just attached a wireless one to make my life easier. for its value its a pretty good computer overall",

Pros: Speed Build Quality Trend Setter Durability Screen Display Cons: Used to be Track Pad. I use this laptop with a mouse and like it very much. Initially there were problems with track pad but as of now I do not have any issues with it. Update 04/27/2014: After light use the screen on this laptop is getting lines and needs repair. The cost of repair for this $264(Parts - $130, Labor - $69,Fedex Shipping - $65).",

We will try to return this and get one that really works well.",

And the display is perfect with a full HD resolution. But there are still some disadvantages. The frequency of RAM is only 1333MHz and total memory capacity is 4GB. The occupancy usually goes to 80% when I am surfing the internet. There are only two USB3.0. More is better. And it dosn't have a card reader. The battary life is not so long as the official announcement. I think it can only stand 4 hours if I surf the internet and don't view videos.",
