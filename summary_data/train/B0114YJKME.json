They are not exposed to any greater water or humidity than what would be expected in a typical bathroom (which has a fan used at every shower). Looking at options to rebuild them with actual wood instead of particle wood. Contacted the seller twice and received no response. Amazon said it was outside the 90 days for the A to Z guarantee to reply, so we\u2019re stuck with this $1,000+ vanity that is falling apart in less than a year of purchase.",

The offset of the sink gives nice (not a LOT) but nice room on the right to have toothbrushes. and other electronic things that need to be plugged in and I want accessible. The quality is exactly what I wanted... high quality. Boxed extremely well for delivery. Soft close drawers with plenty of room for everything. I was concerned that the side drawers would be too small.They are not. The marble is very high end and beautiful. I would definitely by this again. I love it and am very happy with this purchase.",

We added brushed nickel faucets and vanity light and it is now the best room in the house. We are looking forward to updating the master bath too with products that are as close to this as possible.
