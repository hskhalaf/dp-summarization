      "text": "I\u2019ve had several plastic Cake stands that spin and they were pretty good, but I love this cake stand! It spins with ease and is very sturdy. The cakes I make usually have a cheesecake center, which makes them very heavy, and this stand withstood the test. Plus I didn\u2019t have any difficulty decorating due to the ease of the spin, albeit I\u2019m not much of a decorator. I was able to finish my cake with no problem. If spinning while decorating is an issue for you, I\u2019ve found that by placing a hair tie around the base of the stand, where the spinning occurs (see pic), it slowed the spin almost to complete stop. Hope that helps! \ud83d\ude0a",

Then I researched cake turntables on how to elevate the baking game. I chose this particular turntable more the base (heavy, rubber mat to grip counter tops) and the spin (quiet and smooth). The bonus is the plastic and dishwasher-safe tools to use for decorating. Nice! And yes, the first time using it met my expectations. I'm glad I found this.",
