My cookware consists of a lot of cast iron, a few carbon steel and a little more than a few quality copper pieces. I followed the included seasoning instructions to a T instead of my typical cast iron seasoning routine. First use I made a bacon egg and cheese croissant sandwich using this pan. Lightly toasted the croissant over medium heat in the pan. Then cooked bacon in the pan and finally made an omelette in the bacon grease + a dab of butter. No sticking whatsoever! Zero. Beauty and function perfection is so rare these days. Very pleased.",
