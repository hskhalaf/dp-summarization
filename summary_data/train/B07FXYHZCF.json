      "text": "I had the old 6009 for years before the fan motor began making noise, so I got this one. Uses the same filter. Air blows out top instead of sides. It didn't have wheels, but has holes on bottom for standard casters: 2\" Replacement office task chair caster wheels w/ 7/16\" x 7/8\" grip ring mounting stem. 2\" is the diameter of the wheel. 7/16\" is the width of the shaft fitting into the hole, 7/8\" is the length of the shaft. The unit can take well over an inch for the length of the shaft if necessary.",

      "text": "I have very hard water and keeping the humidity up for my piano has been a challenge. This type of humidifier does not have the white dust that other types do which is a definite plus. I have to change the filters often (3 weeks), but that's not a problem. The best thing is that you can fill up the tanks from the top of the tanks. The only negative I have is sometimes a full tank doesn't empty because the float doesn't activitate properly; I end up having to reseat the tank after I notice the humidity dive much sooner than anticipated. Overall I'm happy with the purchase.",

Water jugs are easy to fill but sometimes hard to place back on unit. looks like you have them in place when returning after filling but sometimes they don't just drop into place. Even though this is new, it does not always empty all the water. Unit will shut down with one side still half full. Yes its clean, floats are free etc. Not a lack of care on my part. Must say when it operates properly, it does a great job and is quiet.",

While the ultrasonics worked, the white dust is ridiculous and even invades the inside contents of cabinets. I can only imagine what they do to electronics. I use Essick Air Humidifier treatment in the tanks and haven\u2019t had any mold on the filter and virtually no mineral buildup in the bottom of the unit. This is my second winter season with the humidifier and I haven\u2019t had any issues. I highly recommend this Honeywell.",

We no longer have to be concerned with bacteria build-up in the machine or white powder over everything. The tanks are easy to fill. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that it is noisy if you run it on any other setting than \u2018Low\u2019. However, once the room reaches the humidity level you need, it can be left on Low which is quiet.",

If you choose instead to fill them while they are on the humidifier, their narrow tops make a refill difficult and you get water all over the floor. Their size means you need a large container to carry to the humidifier, preferably a large container with a spout. Badly designed. The previous version which is no longer available had tanks with screw tops which meant they did not overflow when carried. I am considering returning this humidifier though that won't be an easy thing to do.",
