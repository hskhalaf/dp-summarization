It is straight forward and easy to navigate and if you tweak the brightness, the contrast and the sharpness you can really fine tune the picture to your liking.

      "text": "Good monitor with a nice picture. One major annoyance is how slow it is to turn on. It takes a full 10 to 20 seconds from when I press the button to when I can see an image. It's particularly bad when I have to switch between inputs, the long status time combined with the short time it stays on when not getting an input means if I don't sit and wait the whole warm-up time it will turn off before I can hit the button to change inputs.",

The size is great, 24inches is A LOT bigger than I expected. If you want to run dual monitor setup you should probably buy one of these first, and see how it works, then buy the second monitor if necessary. After buying only one I'm VERY satisfied with my single purchase, no need for two.",
