The orange tiger can be had at Wal * mart for a significant discount over any other retailer. They purr, roar, meow, sneeze and toot with the help of 4 C batteries. Senors on the back and the head help her or him respond to pets and noises.",

I got this one at an extremely discounted rate, thankfully, but if I'd actually seen it in action, I never would've bought it. Granddaughter never uses it. The most disappointing thing is that it's just a hard piece of plastic covered in soft, THIN furr. It's not really something a kid wants to hug on. They should've given it some padding or something, not make it a moving rock in a pretty pillow case.",

Really glad I bought it for less than half price too because full price is way overpriced. Yes, it is hard as others have mentioned, but it is an electronic toy not a stuffed animal and I didn't expect anything different. All in all it is a fun toy for grandma...",

    "description": "The furReal Roarin\u2019 Ivory, the Playful Tiger Interactive Plush Toy is ready to play, and her favorite way to have fun is to ROAR! Roar at her or make a noise, she responds by roaring back! Incredibly realistic pet responds to sounds and touch with 100+ sound-&-motion combinations. Talk to her (or roar!) and she roars back. Pet her forehead, muzzle, or back and she responds with sounds and movement -- she can move her eyes, ears, head, mouth, and tail! Pet this cuddly cub and watch her eyes close as she purrs. She crouches down when she\u2019s feeling playful and moves her tail when she\u2019s ready for fun. It\u2019s fun to watch her lean down and pose playfully as she lets out a big ol\u2019 roar! She even has a cute little chicken toy that she reacts to -- just place it in her mouth and press down, and watch her respond! And with poseable back legs, she can be hugged and cuddled. (Clicking sounds when her legs are moved are just fine.) This is one fun-lovin\u2019 -- and loveable -- jungle pet for kids ages 4 and up. furReal and all related characters are trademarks of Hasbro.",
