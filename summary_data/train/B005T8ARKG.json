My legs are shaking and I'm used to the arc trainer at my gym. If you put the tension up, this is a really good leg workout while also giving you cardio. At max tension it feels like I'm slogging through very heavy, thick mud. For the price this is an excellent purchase.",

After about 15 minutes of medium intensity work, the shocks (or whatever they're called) are almost to hot to touch. Also, the hotter the shocks get the faster you're going to be working (they lose some resistance as they heat up). If you're heavier and/or want to use this machine for long high intensity workouts the shocks would be extremely hot and the reliability may suffer.",

Good value for money though and suits my needs at the moment! I\u2019d buy it again.",

But it's quite hard to push even on 1 and the pedals/steps are both sitting at almost kneecap height when resting, making it difficult to get on and start stepping. I had another stepper and when one step was up the other was down. And the treads on the steps caught the treads on my sneakers and I almost fell sideways. I will try to figure a way to make it more user-friendly but if I can't it will be returned.",

When my legs get fatigued on the stepper I move on over to the ride and row and then back again. Great leg and cardio workout. Eventually I will get to at least 15 minutes on each. You can\u2019t go wrong as this machine. It is well built and is affordable.",

      "title": "Digital Counter does not work",
      "text": "I was pleasantly surprised by how smooth the stepping motion is, but the digital counter does not work. Even if it did, I'm not sure how long it would last, because it seems cheaply made. To be clear, the counter turns on, but it does not start counting or timing as the instruction manual says it will. I can't be sure, but I think the problem is with the internal wiring that connects the counter to the steps. It doesn't keep me from using it, but it is annoying that I paid for a feature that does not work.",
