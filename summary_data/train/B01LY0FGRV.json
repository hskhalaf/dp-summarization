Disadvantages include days of the week are written smaller than the times (e.g., \"morn\"). This design feature can be confusing if working with many medications/supplements, especially with frequent medication changes. A second disadvantage involves the difficulty properly locking the individual \"daily\" containers into place. The third disadvantage is the lack of room to maneuver the individual \"daily\" containers out from the clear protective cover. For reference, I'm male, mid-40s, and manage several chronic health issues.",

Each section is 1.5\" square and will hold every possible number of pills, medications, supplements I can imagine anyone taking. It is extremely easy to fill as the tops will stay open for you to open all of them and add the pills. The tops may break off eventually as they are plastic. IF you are careful with things, they will be fine. If you are not careful, you will break them.",

These pill boxes got you covered, my wife and I have several medications we take daily, I like to fill these up once a week and don't have to remind myself or her to take our pills. The compartments are big enough for them all and still have room to close and snap the sturdy lids shut without having to worry about them remaining closed or popping open due to over filling. We both love these pill boxes.",
