I tried returning it or replaced but \"item is not eligible for return\". I wish item would've made it defective free to me to see how long this lasts. I hope it's a fluke and I got a bad batch because this bag has potential. Pictures included, bananas for scale.",

Maybe this should have been intuitive, but with advertisements as an optional drink cooler I assumed it would hold ice well.",

Consider this bag for it's size not it's build quality or function and be aware even the zippers are really low end. If I had to do it over again I would purchase something else",

The exterior pocket i use and sometimes forget about because all my items fit inside well. I do not use the exterior bottle holder. I find I can do without it. As you sintch the string it also minimizes the interior capacity. My advise. If you use the exterior bottle holder, add it last after packing the inside of the bag. Easy to clean. With regular soap and water- wiping up anything sticky is a breeze. I should have bought two. My wife hijacks it whenever she can.",
