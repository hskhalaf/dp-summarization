It stays up perfectly while I'm on FaceTime because the 3 different setting spots for holding it up are thick and raised, not little grooves like my old case had. It also has the sleep/wake feature, so the screen shuts off when you close the case. The design is sharp and true to the picture. I love it.

I know there are ways to mitigate that but I just want the case to handle it for me. Secondly, it messes with the compass. I have an app I use frequently that requires compass functionality and I have to take it out of the case to get the compass to work properly. So I'm shopping now for something else.",

This is like the \"otter box\" for the iPad. Very thick and durable and an excellent fit. The only negative aspect is that this same thickness sometimes makes it difficult to get your fingers to the upper corners. Doesn't block it, but you have to take a little more care to go a little under the outer rim of the cover. It doesn't change my opinion, I would recommend this product if it fits your iPad.",

      "text": "This item is flawless but for one detail - the Velcro mechanism that is intended to hold the iPad securely in place inside the case itself doesn't grab on to the fabric they chose for the interior - the Velcro closure doesn't work. This results in the iPad device scooting out of position or entirely out of the case at times. It is our hope the case will adjust slightly over time (\"break it in\" like shoes?), and we may be able to edit the Velcro area without adding too much width to the case - not sure. This item was gifted and was well received by recipient, overall we are pleased w/the purchase.",

As mentioned this is my 1st case for an iPad so I wanted to get something cheap to discover what I liked/wanted in a case before dropping big money on something leather.

The model I received did well in triggering sleep and wake mode, the seams were well molded with no visible weakness or gaping.

      "text": "Finite makes cases at great prices. I\u2019ve had 2 of their different model cases for my iPad and I bought this one for my daughter and she loves it. The case protects from normal bumps and slight drops when closed. We always use glass screen protectors and haven\u2019t broken one yet while using this case, so I think it\u2019s doing it\u2019s job. The corners where the case fold to open and close do show some wear after 5 months, but I think that\u2019s to be expected with daily use so I give a full 5 stars.",

I could see the imprint of a tire on the screen so it had clearly been run over, and there was some road rash on the corners, but it was otherwise totally unharmed. Amazing case!",
