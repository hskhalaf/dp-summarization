No playgrounds with sandboxes in the neighborhood, so this one is a lifesaver. I bought an extra tarp to keep it clean and dry when not in use. The only challenge is filling all that volume. 900 pounds of sand!!! This is what you see in my photo. This sandbox builds your stamina! As for the assembly, it was very straightforward. I've read a few reviews back here, so I made sure I copied the numbers on the box just in case.",

Maybe a 6ft x 4ft option would have been better (but not square :s)",
