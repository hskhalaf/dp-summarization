It has plenty of room for everything you\u2019d need to carry around plus some. Seems to be quite durable and well made. Hopefully this one will last another 20 years.",

Once he put it on were pleasantly surprised that the chain isn't very long which makes it less noticeable, you can hardly tell he's wearing it. We're pleased with the quality too - the chain is thick but not too heavy, and the wallet is pretty sturdy.",

This is not the wallet for you if you carry around 5 credit cards, ID, misc cards ect. Great wallet for most people. Chain is good quality too. So impressed I bought another for my dad",

This wallet is half the thickness with the same amount of stuff. Also, the cheaper wallet had a ridiculously long heavy chain that you could tow a car with; this Dickies wallet has a chain that is half the size but very secure. Well worth the price.",

      "text": "This wallet is ideal if if you want a wallet that does not take up a lot of space in your pocket. The chain adds style and security. Dickies is a brand I have always trusted. It is soft and has lots of room for credit cards and such. Slim, stylish and functional. I would consider it to be a casual style wallet. I bought it for myself as a gift from someone. Don't regret buying it. Con: It is delicate due to the slim size and type of leather. Don't know how long it will hold up over the years.",
