I don't use any functions besides the radio, clock, and iPHone playback. It's got a new alarm thing but I haven't really tried to use it",

The ported speaker design really delivers a throaty bass response. I had a piece of paper behind the unit when I first cranked it up and it literally blew the paper away! It manages to deliver the bass while maintaining a fairly natural balanced sound. I would definitely recommend this unit over the comparable Bose product.",

Yes, the display is very bright even at the dimmest setting. I cover mine at night. Thought of applying a layer of dark tint. The favorable features are: dual alarm clock, very easy time and settings changes with smooth tactile feel on the knobs, great sound, snooze by touching any part of the metal trim, remote control with magnet, composite video output and an attractive unit.",

Now in another area the noise is not noticeable and the everybody likes it and comment on how good and full the sound is.

It seems to be a failure of the \"mother board\" or the radio equivalent. When I called Boston Acoustics, they would not offer any help since it is out of warrantee. For a product of this price, I think the manufacturer should back up their products better....not hide behind a specific warrantee period. Basically, I have to throw it out even though it is a $300 clock radio, much costlier than others on the market.",

I hate companies that once they have your money don't give a damn about you. Boston Acoustics is the definition of this type of company. I have a soundbar, a clock radio, and this from Boston--and won't be buying more if they won't stand behind their products better.",
