The only problem we had was installing the 3\" stainless screws, they got bent installing them so I just went to hardware store and bought my own and finished putting together, but I still gave a 4 star and would recommend for anyone to purchase this item.",

They sent UPS to pick it up the next day and gave me excellent customer service along the way. I ended up ordering the Polywood swing in the end and never looked back. The Polywood swing is made to much higher standards and has been a welcome addition to our patio.",

Instead of hanging it with chains or cords through the small holes on the arm rests, we bypassed the hole and went directly to the hooks that are built in. The reason is that we use marine grade anchor chain and it was much larger than the hole. We already had the chain installed, and liked the heavy duty feel it provides. The chain that comes with the swing is quite substantial, too. Hard to believe we could purchase and have something of this quality delivered in two days!",
