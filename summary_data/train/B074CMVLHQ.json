The seat kept coming loose and it was clogged three times over the course of three months..... We had enough. We took it out and got a different brand. Now we don't know what do with an almost new toilet that has seat issue and clogs... next years flower pot?",

It doesn't have those carved out areas that collect debris ... there is JUST the right amount of space between the wall trim and the back of the toilet to get the swiffer in there. The 2-choice flush is great! We are country folks with our own well and septic systems, so water conservation is important to us. The amount of water used with each of the flush choices is just right to remove the contents of the bowl without being wasteful. And it's a very nice looking piece, as well.",

I will probably give this purchase to the recycle center and get a new better-designed toilet.",

So, when we did renovation for our second bathroom, we decided to get the same toilet. We purchased from Amazon since it would take longer to ship from Homedepot and our contractor was in hurry. The toilet we got from Amazon functions well, looks almost the same as the one we got from Homedepot, except minor difference in appearance, and the quality of the seat cover is not as good as the other ( thinner and looks cheaper). I don't know if I got the authentic toilet from Swiss Madison.",

The front is too steep so when sitting down I've noticed you get a decent amount of splash to the underside of the seat. Constantly having to clean the seat is a pain. I'm not sure if it's just the finish or what but I developed a hard water ring withing just a couple weeks of installation. The installation requires two people. You absolutely cannot see the bolt holes used to secure it to the floor while lifting it into place. Knowing all this I would have picked a different standard height toilet.",

It\u2019s rather hard to get in place and tightened to the floor since the opening to get your tools and hands in, is not nearly big enough. Also, I have to constantly tighten the seat/lid- which is a project in itself. Otherwise, the flush mechanism and water saver features are great.",
