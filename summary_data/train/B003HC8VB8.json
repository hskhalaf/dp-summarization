It was delivered in record time on a Wednesday and utilized on a Thursday night football game. 2.8 and 250 shutter speed produced a great image for a low light stadium. I was not on the field...

However, the 200mm with F2.8 has also increased how many moments I was able to capture so it is a bit of a wash.",

      "text": "This Sigma was way out of focus at 200mm f/2.8 and the optical stabilization seemed to make no difference. I immediately returned this and ordered the Nikon 70-200 f/2.8 VR lens. I took the exact same test shots with both cameras at 200 mm zoom and a wide open aperture of f/2.8. The Nikon shots were clear and crisp whereas the Sigma shots had significant blur. You can see the difference in the attached photos. The blur with the Sigma was the same with No OS, OS1 and OS2 (it has two optical stabilization settings) and it was the same even with the camera mounted on a tripod. Needless to say, I was very disappointed.",

Once again, as far as the lens go, it has an amazing range and the luminosity is what you'd expect on a lens that range and that size.",

It didn't have OS (aka VR), which really makes a difference with a lens this long and heavy. Actually, OS is all I expected to gain from this upgrade, so I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was a major improvement in almost every way. It is sharper, focuses better in low light, has better bokeh, and the OS is worth about 3 stops. The result of all this is noticably better looking photos, and a higher percent of keepers from every shoot.",

I really like it so far. We will see how it goes",

    "title": "Sigma 70-200mm f/2.8 APO EX DG HSM OS FLD Large Aperture Telephoto Zoom Lens for Sony Digital DSLR Camera",
    "description": "Style:Sony Digital DSLR CameraFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\nLARGE APERTURE TELEPHOTO ZOOM LENS INCORPORATING SIGMA'S ORIGINAL OPTICAL STABILIZER FUNCTION\nThis large aperture telephoto zoom lens, incorporating Sigma's original Optical Stabilizer function, covers focal lengths from 70mm to 200mm and offers a constant aperture of F2.8 over the entire zoom range. The OS function offers the use of shutter speeds approximately 4 stops slower than would otherwise be possible. It makes shooting easy for many types of photography such as portraits and sports. Two FLD (\"F\" Low Dispersion) glass elements, which have performance equal to fluorite glass, and three SLD (Special Low Dispersion) glass elements provide excellent correction of color aberration. Super Multi-Layer Coating reduces flare and ghosting. The lens incorporates HSM (Hyper Sonic Motor), ensuring a quiet and high speed AF as well as full-time manual focus capability. It is also possible to attach Sigma's optional APO Tele Converters.\n\nNo Optical Stabilizer (top). With Optical Stabilizer (bottom). SUPER MULTI-LAYER COATING\nThe lens is equipped with Sigma's own unique OS (Optical Stabilizer) function. This system offers the use of shutter speeds approximately 4 stops slower than would otherwise be possible, making telephoto shooting easy. Mode 1 is ideal for general photography and Mode 2 is designed for panning subjects such as racing cars. For Sony and Pentax mount, the built-in OS function of this lens can be used even if the camera body is equipped with an anti-shake function. As compensation for camera shake is visible in the view finder, the photographer can easily check for accurate focus and ensure there is no subject movement.\n\n* For Pentax and Sony mounts, it is not possible to use the AF and the built-in OS function of this lens when attaching it to film SLR cameras as well as Pentax ist series and K100D.\n\n* When using the OS function of a lens with a camera which incorporates a stabilizer unit, please turn the camera's stabilizer unit off.\n\n* This lens cannot be used with film SLR cameras with the exception of the Nikon F6 and Canon EOS-1v.\n\nCOMPACT CONSTRUCTION\nThis lens has a compact construction with a diameter of 3.4in, overall length of 7.8in. and weight of 50.4oz. This compact and lightweight construction makes it ideal for many types of photography such as portraits, landscapes and sports.\n\nNo Super Multi-Layer Coating (left). With Super Multi-Layer Coating (right). EXCELLENT OPTICAL PERFORMANCE\nThis lens features two FLD (\"F\" Low Dispersion) glass elements, which have the performance equal to fluorite glass, and three SLD (Special Low Dispersion) glass elements providing excellent correction of color aberration. The Super Multi-Layer Coating reduces flare and ghosting and ensures high contrast images. High image quality is assured throughout the entire zoom range.\n\n* FLD glass is the highest level low dispersion glass available with extremely high light transmission. This optical glass has a performance equal to fluorite glass which has a low refractive index and low dispersion compared to current optical glass. It also benefits from high anomalous dispersion.\n\nThese characteristics give excellent correction for residual chromatic aberration (secondary spectrum) which cannot be corrected by ordinary optical glass and ensures high definition and high contrast images.\n\nHyper Sonic Motor HIGH SPEED AND QUIET AF\nHSM indicates lenses equipped with a Hyper Sonic Motor, driven by ultrasonic waves. Incorporation of HSM (Hyper Sonic Motor) ensures quiet and high speed autofocus, while allowing full-time manual focus override.\n\n* For Sony and Pentax mount, AF will not function with DSLR cameras that do not support HSM.\n\nROUNDED DIAPHRAGM\nThis lens has a rounded 9 blade diaphragm which creates an attractive bokeh to the out of focus area.\n\nLENS CONSTRUCTION\nIn a conventional lens, focusing requires an extension of the entire lens or the front lens group. However, to better accommodate autofocusing mechanisms and closeup photography, a need has arisen for lenses that do not change their length during focusing or suffer from focus-dependent variation in aberration. Therefore, Sigma has developed focusing systems that only move elements within the lens barrel. These incorporate smaller and lighter moving lens elements which help improve auto-focus speed. With their unchanging barrel length and small variation in the center of gravity, these lenses also enhance balance and stability for the photographer. Furthermore, since the front of the lens does not rotate, polarizing filters can be used with extra convenience.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\nLens Construction 22 Elements in 17 Groups Angle of View 34.3 - 12.3 degrees Number of Diaphragm Blades 9 Blades (Rounded diaphragm) Minimum Aperture F22 Minimum Focusing Distance 140cm / 55.1in. Maximum Magnification 1:8 Dimensions Diameter 86.4mm x Length 197.6mm /3.4in. x 7.8in. Weight 1430g / 50.4oz. MTF CHART\nView Larger Image MTF (Modular Transfer Function) is one of the measurements that evaluates a lens' performance, and it contrasts sensitivity at different spacial frequencies. The horizontal axis is in millimeters and shows the distance from the center of the image toward the edges, and contrast value (highest value is 1) is shown in the vertical axis.\n\nThe readings at 10 lines per millimeter measure the lens' contrast ability (red lines), repeating fine parallel lines spaced at 30 lines per millimeter measure the lens' sharpness ability (green lines), when the aperture is wide open. Fine repeating line sets are created parallel to a diagonal line running from corner to corner of the frame, are called Sagittal lines (S) and sets of repeating lines vertical to these lines are drawn, called Meridional (M) line sets.\n\nDISTORTION\nView Larger Image effective distortion: When you take a picture of a lattice pattern, it will appear as the blue dotted line shows. the red line illustrates how the lattice pattern will appear in the actual picture when any lens distortion is taken into account.\n\nrelative distortion: In this chart, the horizontal axis shows the ideal image height (the distance from the center to the edge of the image [mm]). The vertical axis shows the extent of distortion. The extent of the distortion is represented by how much Y, which is the actual image height, grows (or shrinks) against Y0 which is the ideal image height.\n\nExtent of distortion: D[%]=(Y-Y0/Y0)x100\n\nWhen you take the picture of a square object, if the distortion amount show a minus value, the image will be seen as expanded (Barrel distortion). If the distortion amount is a plus value, it will be seen as a recessed (pincushi on distortion). When the distortion value is close to 0, the appearance of distortion is very minimal.\n\nVIGNETTING\nView Larger Image The horizontal axis shows the image height (the distance from the center to the edge of the image [mm]). The vertical axis shows the amount of light in the image (based on the amount of light in the image center being 100%). If the peripheral amount of light is lower than the center, the four corners of the image will be darker (vignetting).",
