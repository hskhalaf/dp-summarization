How did I not know about foot rockers before? This thing is amazing -- quicker than rolling a towel, easier than sitting on the floor, and really fun to use. Just be sure to wear shoes (the box has a picture of someone using it barefoot, which is almost as silly as wearing 99-cent flip-flops.) Having never used one before, let me say that it feels immensely sturdy, and would probably hold a wide range of sizes of sneakered/tennis-shoed feet. If you have PF, you NEED THIS in your life.",

All I can say is: This one is easy to use, is also good for hamstrings and other potentially troublesome muscles that need stretching in order to avoid problems (especially as one ages...). I used it daily and my plantar troubles were gone within a couple of weeks. I don't know if other such devices work better, but this one gets a 100% rating from this aging being.",

It\u2019s also great for a hamstring and glut stretch! Mix this deep stretch a couple times a day with yoga and medical massage and hopefully you will start to feel better!

What I love about the rocker is you control the level of stretch and the timing. We have both had plantar fasciiitis, this rocker helps, immensely. It is well built, it has control strips underneath which helps it grip and keeps it from sliding, there's no size foot it can't handle, you just bring your heel to the end of the heel cup and rock and stretch.

      "text": "The Vive Foot Rocker seems pretty sturdy and works fine with my size 9 bedroom slippers, sticking over about 1/2 inch, and size 9.5 hiking shoes, sticking over about 1-1/2 inches. The foot massage ball that comes with the rocker, in my opinion, is too large at 2.8 inches. I much prefer the 1.8 inch ball from Fleet Feet, though a bit pricy at $10. Interestingly, the carton that the rocker ships with shows the rocker being used barefoot, but the user guide warns to use a flat, rubber soled shoe.",

Tight calves contribute heavily to sore feet. The ball it comes with is basically one of those balls you throw in the dryer with your clothes to cut drying time. I never would have thought to roll one of those under my feet but if they help with sore fascia sure I'll give it a go!",

Normally, I was feeling it an hour into my day (on my feet all day at work), but after 5 days with this device, I'm going almost to the end of my shift before the pain gets too bad. Hoping to be completely rid of PF in a few weeks. Definitely worth the money.",
