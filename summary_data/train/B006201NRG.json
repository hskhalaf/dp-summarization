Really happy with these Life Extension products. Especially the Pytoceramides. They are erasing my wrinkles and plumping my skin. I look younger and more radiant!",

I take a prescription natural thyroid hormone replacement for hypothyroidism, so I have my thyroid levels checked at least annually and, while taking 7-keto DHEA, my TSH came back low (meaning my thyroid gland was working overtime and possibly overproducing thyroid hormones). You would expect, then, great weight loss, but this has not been the case. I haven't lost any weight in the over 2 months I've been taking this despite maintaining a consistent diet and exercise program. Maybe it's just me, I don't know, but I figured I should for sure have lost at least a couple of lbs.",
