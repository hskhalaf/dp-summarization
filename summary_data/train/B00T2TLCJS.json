It has that slight BO-ish scent that I've noticed from a few snail products but it goes away immediately. Given the price, this is a solid buy.",

You do not need a whole lot either, just a tiny little dollop about the size of a peanut is more than enough for your entire face. One tube lasts well more than 3 months.",

Virtually every lotion I try on my face makes me burn as though I looked into the Ark of the Covenant but this has been the best thing for m face ever! I used to use Cereve and though it didn't burn my face, it did make my face break out a little. So far the steam cream has kept redness down to the point any flare up is more pink than red. It's made my facial skin (which was somewhat rough, medium pores and blotchy) pretty darn soft and smooth. I have been using this with the Mizon snail serum and my face is being transformed.
