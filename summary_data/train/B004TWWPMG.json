The best thing about it is the ice core inside. The picture I included doesn't really capture the size of this item.

I have used dish soap, super hot water, blench, vinegar, and over counter sprays, and nothing works. Other than that the item works really well. We used it for lemonade, tea, and juice.",

No scratches or discolorations and the valve at the bottom seems to be holding firm. When completely full, it is stable and does not tip over. One time used it was even on a slanted table. Additional: While it doesnt leak or tip, for peace of mind, i wish it locked into the base better. I also wish it had handles on the side for transport because you cant really move it when its full.",

The dispenser can either be used alone, or placed on the stand. I leave it on the stand, because it raises up the dispenser high enough that I can slide a large water glass under the spigot to fill it. This is a well-designed product.",

      "text": "Used this at my daughters wedding reception and it was PERFECT! My sister loaned us her 5 gallon, beautiful glass container for the lemonade and we bought this one for the iced tea. I was concerned it would look tacky next to my sisters but it was just as elegant and a whole lot easier to move (no where near as heavy as the glass one), fill & clean up was a breeze! My husband was impressed and that's saying something! I'm excited to use it for entertaining. It's a great product!",

We just ordered some more, and they just came in plain brown boxes, which do not look like original packaging. That is why the product gets 4 stars and not 5. The packaging helps us store and identify the items. The brown boxes are not identifiable.",

We purchase these for a golf course and they really take a beating. They are not indestructible, the lids get chipped after a time, but they are the most durable container that I have found at a reasonable price. Since infused water is a big hit, especially for our ladies, I took the ice holder and drilled holes in it it create a defuser that will hold blueberries and not plug up the dispenser spicket.",
