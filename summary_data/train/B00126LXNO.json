I was using another brand of medicated powder with no talc, that the hospital here uses, which I loved, but it was pricey. This baby powder was the only other one, medicated and without talc, that I could find on Amazon (or anywhere for that matter). It is the same number of ounces as the other brand, but seems to last longer, costs less and works every bit as well. I highly recommend it.",

Our first option was a household baking option:corn starch. Corn starch is not medicated, and only helped to dry our baby's bottom. I noticed that this diaper powder has zinc, which is a must have ingredient for skin care. I purchased this bottle not long ago, and I have already used most of it up. The price is great, and my daughter's diaper rash is gone. I will definitely purchase this powder again.",
