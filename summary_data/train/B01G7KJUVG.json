As fasteners suction cups are notoriously weak unless you know the secret of a permanent seal: a dab of petroleum jelly around the rim to make it air tight. If you truly use this only in the shower it may matter little BUT the device blinks non-stop while it is on and rather brightly at that. This gets annoying pretty quick. The listing fails to show the incredible compactness of this speaker. It's smaller than a box of baking soda even with the suction cup.",

We all use this speaker every day and after all this time, it still works perfectly, unlike the 3 other speakers I purchased before this.

Haven't needed to charge it yet. And the indicator on the phone is awesome Cons (sort of): -Mic is great when shower is off, not so great when on...but I think they all would be -No led screen, but I didn't find a screen necessary",

The sound is very good. The only thing I don't know about this unit is battery life. The other similar units have had excellent battery life.",

      "text": "The reason I bought this was the fact that it has a separate volume control from the forward/back buttons. This is important to me in a shower speaker. Most have the volume integrated into the forward/back buttons with a long hold signaling volume control. The problem is that once you hold it long enough to prevent advancing beyond the song or audio book track you are listening to, others tend to either put the volume wide open or at about half volume. In the enclosed space of a shower, being able to micro-adjust the volume is important and this speaker handles that beautifully.",

Loud power on sound, loud power off sound, loud volume-changed sounds. It doesn\u2019t support AVRCP absolute volume, which is a feature most phones have had for 8 years. Connecting 2 phones is near impossible if the other paired phone is in range with Bluetooth on; you have to turn Bluetooth off on phone 1. I\u2019d probably give it to 2 stars because it does work ok, but I think the other reviews are fake and that\u2019s not fair, so neither is my rating.",

Bathrooms are somewhat soundproof because of insulation for water protection. As a result, you have a somewhat sealed environment in the bathroom.

Example you ask Siri to play Pandora and it can\u2019t understand the name you said so it just plays a generic pandora station. Not sure why that happens but the sound is good and enjoyable.

I listen to rock and heavy metal, and it is hard to hear the lyrics even when I have it turned all the way up in my shower, because the sound quality is not clear. Other than that, it seems to be durable. But its definetly not worth the amount of money it is selling for, unfortunatly.",

Then you have a loud voice about powering on and connecting (totally unnecessary and most bluetooth speakers have this issue). Connect automatically, which is wonderful. Turning it off is quick and only has a low volume chime (which is how it should be for turning it on!).",

The rubber cover for the charging port has a tether that pulled out on the first day when I was charging the speaker. It's really not an issue, though because it stays in place and sealed without it. More often that with any other speaker, I have to re-pair it with my tablet. Lastly, the website in instructions for customer assistance does not exist.",
