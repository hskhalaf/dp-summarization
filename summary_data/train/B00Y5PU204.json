Our daycare has trouble figuring out how to fold them after it was unrolled, and I wish it has a velcro on its top middle to keep them together better once rolled, but other than that, excellent product!",

This mat is too long to securely fit over the red & blue mat so I ended up attaching a sheet to the back of the Urban Infant mat, so we could insert the red & blue mat. It made it easier to keep everything together.",
