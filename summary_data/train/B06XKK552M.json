I assembled the smoker with the help of numerous YouTube videos on assembling and maintaining a Traeger smoker. It was easy to Assemble once I reviewed these videos.

It is a very heavy package when it arrives but it is well packed. It arrived in mint condition. I was able to assemble it myself with basic tools. I recommend buying the grill cover to protect your investment. I have been eating / cooking BBQ my entire life. On this grill the brisket has the right amount of charring, good smoke ring, is tender, and has great smoke flavor.",

With charcoal and propane you do everything off feel and look, but with a smoker everything is time and temperature. Meat must be completely thawed in order to get the cook time right, where charcoal and propane are much more flexible. Grilling with a Traeger takes a lot less effort, epically on chicken wings. The only gripe is the build sturdiness could be better considering what you are paying.",

Check the auger The gravity feed is pretty good but did leave the auger bare and I had to use a spoon handle to get the pellets to drop into the auger a vibrator motor would be wonderful to fix the problem listed above. All in all through the meat I have cooked turned out very good. Hope this helps you buying and building this grill.",
