My only option was to ship the notebook to hp and have it back in 4 - 6 weeks or return it. I returned mine. Touch screen 1 star - this model didnt have touch for gaming it was great* keyboard was AWEFUL - the rgb lighting,, 3 zones, not per key. it has sharp corners and edges, not very nice to the touch at all. the sharp edges on the palm rest dig into your wrists,arm.",

I've done absolutely nothing that requires any intense processing. I will append to the review and revise depending on how support for this goes. Obviously this is a manufacturer's problem. Edit: It is worth noting that Amazon is taking the return and paying for the shipping, since the laptop was defective. I won't raise the rating because the product was junk, but Amazon has been excellent in handling it.",

Yes the screen is 1080p but it works and looks wonderful. The fans are not super load and I have not had any issues of overheating. The omen center is so user friendly and easy to play around with the lights on the keyboard. The only downside that I have found is the keyboard seem a little cramped. But not something that would really hurt most. And having small hands it really isn't that bad. I have had this laptop for about 2 weeks now and I could not be happier with it.",
