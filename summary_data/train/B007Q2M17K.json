Now I have to plug it in, it runs for 180 seconds, I unplug it and plug it in again, it runs for 180 seconds and so on and so forth. I figure it won\u2019t be long until it stops working altogether.

This removes any air that is in the water which hampers the cleaning action.",

      "text": "I know there are already 11,945 reviews at the time of writing this, but I just had to add mine. This is the first time that I have ever reviewed a product - 58 yrs old - and I am absolutely obsessed with this jewelry cleaner. I added the Blitz Gem & Jewelry Cleaner Concentrate to the water. My jewelry looks like it has been professionally cleaned. The unit is small and lightweight. I am keeping it on the counter in my bathroom and just toss my jewelry in before going to bed and turn it on in the morning. I can't recommend this jewelry cleaner enough. You will not be disappointed.",

I dumped out the water after each cycle to see how dirty it was. The last 2 times I added shampoo. My rings are cleaner than any jeweler has clean for me. I can promise you will be very happy with this machine. I stared at my jewelry sparkling in the light for the rest of that day.",

For my jewelry that needed a little more work, I pre-cleaned with my usual solution and then dropped it in. Then the jewelry came out great! So, if you are buying this to maintain jewelry in between a few wears, then this is the one for you. But, if you are expecting to drop in very dirty pieces and expecting to pull your jewelry out looking brand new, this is not going to do it unless you put in a little work. For $40, it is convenient, but not a professional unit.",
