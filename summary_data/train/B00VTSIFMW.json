This footwear also keeps the feet in comfort with its well-padded construction.",

They keep my footing stable when I walk, feel like I am walking on air. A truly awesome shoe for getting around town, running errands, visiting friends, whatever. They look good, pretty standard look, nothing glitzy, only marginally fashionable. I highly recommend these shoes.",

I ordered 10 wide which is what I always get, but these are both too wide and too long. That is only part of the reason I returned them. Reebok has always had very soft cushioning and soft rubber soles. These shoes have neither. The only cushioning effect comes from the insoles which are ok, but still left me feeling like I was walking on concrete. The simulated leather uppers are also harder than before. It is clear that something has changed in the manufacturing. I can only hope that they change it back to the way it was.",
