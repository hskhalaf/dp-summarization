I stumbled across this at a local yard sale and it has to be the BEST stainless steel cleaner and polish I have ever used. This product WORKS. It gets off any and all fingerprints & dust/dirt. I suggest using a microfiber cloth with the product. Also, when cleaning go with the grain of the stainless. Great price for the results! The can lasts a long time. The only downfall is the awful smell. It\u2019s really strong and painful to inhale. I recommend this product if you want a clean streak free stainless appliance but be prepared for the smell.",

It repels fingerprints, and those that do appear are easily wiped off. I'm planning to try the wax form of Sheila Shine next to form a protected base since I've heard that it's even better. Then a simple swipe with the spray will keep it clean and shiny.",

None prevented further prints. Then I tried Sheila Shine. It was easy to use, wiped off readily with no streaking and actually seems to help prevent further finger prints.
