Also, in some reviews I saw at least one review mentioning swimming or diving with one of these, and being disappointed when the contents got wet. I, for one, received the item inside packaging specifically advising in print against swimming/diving use. Just sayin'.",

For the money you will need to fold it in order to place it into the wallet, and this can limit how much money you can carry since the folding makes the money thicker to place in the wallet. So the higher the bills the more money you can carry. Overall I am pleased with the wallet. I normally carry the wallet in my front pocket, or in a side cargo pocket. Hope this review helps.

      "text": "First of all, my biggest disappointment is that Pelican products are now made in China. Now the case is tough and durable.....BUT with the webbing inside sewn into a piece of kydex really limits what it will hold. I was VERY bummed that all I could get to fit in it were six cards, some cash and one key, anymore and you couldn't close it. I carried it two days and decided the hard shape and low storage capacity weren't worth it. Ill use it when I'm in a rough and tumble environment. Save your money and just get a zip lock bag.",
