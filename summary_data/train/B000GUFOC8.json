Mind you, I have invested significantly in this scope since I first purchased it 2014 but even in its stock form it still amazing. The price is basically the same since 2014 and this scope is by far the best bang-to-buck in amateur astronomy. It has some shortcomings rest assured but if you have the money and patience do not look elsewhere.",

C'mon, we're not standing in the dome at Palomar measuring parallaxes nor are we tracking satellites! It is just \"We have loved the stars too fondly to be fearful of the night.\" NexStar 8 implements that sentiment very well. The AC adapter is a must, however, because any battery set-up drains too fast for sustained viewing.",

I replaced the eyepiece with one with a wider FOV and was able to align much easier. A Telrad will likely help the alignment, too.

The legendary performance of Celestron's orange tube C8 telescope has been updated with high performance Starbright XLT coatings, and the single arm Nexstar mount now includes Celestron's easy to use \"SkyAlign\" technology. \n\n \n\n The Nexstar 8 SE upholds Celestron's reputation for quality optics. When I use an 11mm Plossl eyepiece (almost 200x magnification) for example, I can easily see the Cassini Division in Saturn's rings. When I look at Jupiter, the pale orange color of Jupiter's famous Great Red Spot is visible, and I've even been able to identify the polar caps and spot dust storms on the planet Mars. A 20mm Plossl eyepiece (about 100x magnification) is a good choice for viewing galaxies and star clusters. When I look at globular cluster M13 in the constellation Hercules the high contrast XLT optics show me a glowing snowflake made of hundreds of tiny pin-point stars! And a low power 32mm Plossl eyepiece is a good choice for views of larger deep space highlights like the Andromeda Galaxy and the Orion Nebula. \n\n \n\n Celestron's patented \"SkyAlign\" system makes the Nexstar 8 SE very easy to use. I just pick the nearest town from the built-in list, enter the date and time, and point the telescope at three bright stars. I don't need a star chart because \"SkyAlign\" identifies the stars for me. When I just want a quick look at the moon or a planet, I like to use the \"Solar System Align\" option. After entering the date and time, I just point the telescope at the moon and press the \"Align\" key. That's all it takes, the computer takes over and the telescope begins tracking quietly and accurately. At star parties I often have my Nexstar up and running while older computerized telescopes are still waiting for their alignment stars to appear in the twilight. \n\n The Nexstar 8 SE comes with a simple red-dot finder scope and a basic 25mm eyepiece. You'll want to add a few good eyepieces to take full advantage of the Nexstar 8 SE's excellent optics. At the very least get Celestron's bargain priced Accessory Kit which includes high and low power plossl eyepieces, or treat yourself to some top rated Tele Vue eyepieces. At twenty-four pounds total weight, the Nexstar 8 SE is unusually light and portable for an eight-inch telescope. The drawback of course is that some people will find it too light. Like other Schmidt Cassegrain (SCT) telescopes there are plenty of optional accessories to upgrade this telescope with, such as heavy duty tripods and an optical finder scope. If you want to try astro-photography, however, check out Celestron's CPC 800 Telescope which features a heavy duty mount and tripod and an 8x50 optical finder scope right out of the box. --Jeff Phillips \n\n Pros: \n\n * Excellent optics \n * Easy computerized GoTo tracking \n * Light, portable and affordable \n\nCons:  * Plastic accessories \n * Short battery life \n * Too light for astro-photography \n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nManufacturer Description\nThe largest of the NexStar SE family with 78% more light gathering than a 6-inch model, the NexStar 8 SE will enable you to see deep into the Universe.
