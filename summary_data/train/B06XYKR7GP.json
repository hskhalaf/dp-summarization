The S8+ is by far the best phone I've used so far - very fast, nicely looking, and the iris recognition is awesome. Saves you a lot of time and frustration as you can use it for business and not have to enter long passwords, which are typically required by your enterprise administrators. Awesome handset!",

FAKE! I guess they are just used or refurbished. Do not buy from here. Rather buy with Samsung or get a phone on contract to have warranty as this seller doesn't cover any waranty. Check the 2 pictures that shows the fake phone labels against an original phone. You can see the fake seal too.",
