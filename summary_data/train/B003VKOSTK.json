Not a fan of the cluttered look tree mug holders have in general, but I have no complaints with this piece as it serves it\u2019s purpose. I can fit 6 good size mugs on it.",

It's more than adequately solid and well constructed, with enough heft that I'm not concerned it will topple over. All that said, despite knowing how large the other Spectrum products were in relation to what I expected, I was still surprised how large this was. I'm definitely keeping it abs expect the chrome finish to hold up well into the future. I've uploaded a photo along with this review to get a sense of scale next to a can of soda.",
