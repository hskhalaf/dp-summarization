That said, comparing this to regular pasta is like comparing real, whole-grain wheat bread with wonder bread! It\u2019s going to taste a little different. If you put tomato sauce on it, you\u2019ll never notice a difference. If you usually eat your pasta with just olive oil, there will be a little difference - but not in a bad way. Even if you don\u2019t like sauce, if you add Parmesan and herbs, it will be very hard to tell the difference. Try it!",

The pasta is very fresh, great flavor and takes well to any application where one would use this type/shape of pasta. I am not a fan of \"chewy\" pasta in salads so I cooked this longer than the recommended time and found that 12 to 15 minutes produces a tender result that works well in salads. Same with mac and cheese. The first batch, cooked for the recommended 7 minutes, was much too chewy and the pasta on the top of the casserole was hard and some was inedible. Definitely needs longer cooking but once it achieves that, it is perfect.",

It definitely tastes worse than nicer pasta made w/ egg and semolina or even just middling pasta made w/ non whole wheat, but with decent sauce the difference is not that noticeable. I do quite a bit of running/aim for ~3,500kcal/day of food without meat, so I consume this in quantities bordering on obscene, so the trade-offs inherent to whole wheat pasta wrt taste are quite worth it for me. It's also more convenient and less expensive (which seems ridiculous given the shipping overhead but it's true) to order this from Amazon than picking it or an equivalent up at the grocery store.",
