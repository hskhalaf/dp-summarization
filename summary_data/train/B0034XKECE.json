It has a rechargeable battery that can be charged right from the camera with the sync cord. This seller had great communication with me. The camera is in perfect shape. Like new. I highly recommend this seller and camera. It's perfectly priced. (Note: it comes with a rechargeable battery, but you will need to buy the sync/charger cord. Cheap enough to buy from Amazon. You should order both at the same time.)",

I bought it for our trip to Peru that I now on and it hardly worked during our hike of the Inca trail and now doesn\u2019t stay on at all. Unfortunately the 30-day return policy ended yesterday, the day I finished hiking the Inca trail. I bought a case and extra battery and feel like I wasted my money. R&R, can you hook me up with another used one that isnt defective?",

The video is superb and you can zoom in and out while recording, not sure why so many other reviews stated this is not possible, perhaps on the older models you couldn't. The only con I found is its difficult to use the menu in the dark since the button don't light up, (minor issue) and the location of the video button is cumbersome, once you are finished shooting your video its not super easy to stop with out having several seconds of you fumbling for the button at the end of your video.",

I find it easier to use than the camera on my cellphone (which produces photos of somewhat inferior quality to those I obtain with this camera). I rarely use the video (results in huge file sizes) or rapid-fire sequence, because the quality of each shot is somewhat inferior to single shots.",

Not scratches on the lens itself, but dust/matter inside on the sensor so that dots appear on every picture. It's my second Nikon camera that this has happened to. The first I sent away to repair (which took around 8 weeks, which is not great when you use every day), on this camera it happened after the 1 year warranty expired, so I bought a new camera instead.",

Recently bought this camera for a trip to Costa Rica and it performed great. Beautiful pictures, many different settings and very light and compact. I will now pass it along to my wife who finds an SLR too heavy and complicated and just wants a good camera to take photos of grandchildren.",

My impressions so far: Pro's: Great pics, small size, easy to use, great macro, automatic scene selection, good focal length Con's: Power button too small, takes WAY too long to zoom after turning on, zoom is in large jerky steps so it's hard to find that \"right\" framing, poor battery/SD cover design - have to latch the door all the time (not spring loaded), flash use not always predictable in certain light.

Its not that I didn't charge it either. It was fully charged and still shutting itself off constantly. 3 months into having it, I can no longer use it because I turn the power on and it shuts down immediately after turning on. Not satisfied at all. I paid way too much to only have a camera for 2 1/2 months.",
