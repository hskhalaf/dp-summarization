      "text": "These are very good barefoot style shoes but I knocked off a star because they are a bit over expensive at \u00a3120. I also listened to the reviews that said to get a size up; mistake. Although I am English I have European type slender feet while most English people have wide feet, hence lots of people, I suspect, say to size up. However I find with a size up I trip on my toes when running. Also barefoot shoes need to fit more like a sock less like a shoe for them to work properly. Great shoe and very well made. Just bear in mind the above. I suggest you start with the size you are.",

      "text": "This show does not have a tongue, as you might have expected - it is much more like a plimsoll in that it is elasticated, albeit with laces to adjust the fit. My issue was that the elastic area over the top of the foot was simply too tight across the top of my right foot and the elastic is a string, not an area, so it dug into my foot quite painfully. I had to do a return on the shoes and am awaiting my refund. Pity though - the soles are nice and it's a good-looking pump.",

I bought these over the others they sold because of the style and would jump at another pair the same but with slicker soles.",

Build quality of shoes is excellent with no signs of wear on these after 2 weeks of daily wear or my other pair after 6 months! Highly recommended!!!",
