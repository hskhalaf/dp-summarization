Using traditional sun-block that is for the body on my face every day is just YUK! This works very well. I also use it as my moisturizer because I don't seem to need more. I also use a serum at night that I got here on Amazon called Serum 21, I believe. Togther this works great for me!",

Product is in the trash. The first package I got, btw, had an open box and on safety seal, I returned that. The second, there was also no safety seal but the box was at least closed and didn't look to have been opened.",

It is really thick and moisturizing and leaves the skin smooth and soft even. It has no particular scent other than the common sunblock smell-- which is good, especially for those w/sensitivities. The only minus about purchasing the product is that if not rubbed in thoroughly, it can leave a white film of product on your face or body; so, make sure before you walk out, you check to make sure you're not going to be walking around w this film of sunblock.
