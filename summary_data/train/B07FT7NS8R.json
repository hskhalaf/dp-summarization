I have to admit I was a little skeptical about a weighted blanket being a stress reliever, but when I covered up with this blanket after a VERY stressful day at work I immediately began to relax. The fabric is soft and the blanket is great quality. The color - I purchased gray - is beautiful! The only negative I have about this blanket is that now my husband, son, and I fight over it! I think I will have to buy a couple more!",
