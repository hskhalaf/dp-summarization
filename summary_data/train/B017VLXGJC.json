      "text": "Pros: Excellent joysticks and very good buttons Very sturdy feeling, seems like a good quality product, no cheap made at all. Very easy to synchronize with Wii U Cons No built in vibration (just a detail to me, no dealbreaker) ZL and ZR buttons are very rigid, very little depth when pressed (again no dealbreaker, just an small detail). No built in battery, another detail, everyone has rechargeable batteries at home. In general I'm very pleased with this controller, I never used an original Nintendo one to compare, but this one to me is a great alternative at a very affordable price.",

Next day, we played again (battery meter said it was full) but kept disconnecting. After the frequency of the disconnecting increased, we checked and the battery meter drop a notch or 2. We swapped out for more fresh batteries and it worked like it did day 1. Then started to disconnect as the batteries got used a bit, again. We did have the light off, cause who really needs that? We were using brand new rechargable batteries. It's just too much to swap batteries every time we want to use it.",

Replacing AA batteries is much easier than trying to find a matching lithium-ion battery pack to solder in 5 years from now. The LEDs can be shut off and stay off after every boot up when you hit the button in the back. The joysticks feel good and the plastic quality while not OEM quality, is pretty close. All in all, these are not as good as the OEM, but the are also half the price. With that consideration, these are as good as a third-party Wii U controller will get.",
