This and the Craze T are very, very similar in style. I like them both, but..., the Craze II is just slightly heavier than the 9oz Craze T. Of course this is not TOO heavy. It's a good shoe. I just like the ultra-lightweight that Keds has been generating lately.",

They do fit and the shoe is very comfortable and I'm happy with these as it accommodates my mild bunion, insoles from the Dr. and my flat feet.",

I usually wear a 7.5 in sneakers and other closed-toe shoes, but in my experience Keds' size 7 sneakers are a better fit for me than their 7.5 size. Both pairs of my Craze sneakers initially felt a little tight, but after about three weeks of consistent use, I find that they become very comfortable. My first pair was brown, and I've had those for a year without any issues; I decided to order these so that I'd have a black pair as well.The build quality is the same between both pairs of shoes.",
