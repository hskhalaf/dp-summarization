The box is all beaten up, with lots of different shipping type labels and it was not sealed. The inside of the cover of the beverage cup has wear as does the manual. The entire blender has finger prints all over it. If I wanted refurbished, then I would have paid a lot less and chosen such a unit. You cannot charge me full price and tell me its brand new when it's not. I have pictures.",

I made absolutely sure I followed all the cleaning and care directions. I wish I could say it's burning out because I overloaded it or didn't try my hardest to take care of it. But I did and it's just not as high quality as I thought it was. Really really bummed!!",

I even made hot soup with it. It is so great I stored my perfectly working Cuisinart blender,...maybe for good.",

If your wanting a product based on name alone purchase a Vitamix, but if your looking to get value for your dollar the Harley will impress. Re-review, do not start with ice on the bottom.",

This machine blends EVERYTHING smooth. We do not use ice to make them we use about a cup of water and frozen fruit. There are no kale bits or tiny blueberry or other fruit seeds when using this blender.. The seeds were the worst. I have made coffee drinks with ice, no problem, they are smooth as well. I have started using this blender instead of my food processor for a lot of things. This blender is amazing. We use it daily.",
