Because it is located directly off the kitchen and we leave the door open so that the dogs can get to their food, it is important to me to have all of my products neatly displayed. The 96oz jars are the perfect size to store dryer sheets and scent crystals. The glass on the jars is fairly substantial, meaning they don't seem fragile if they get knocked or banged. The lids have a plastic gasket underneath that make them appear somewhat airtight. When I lift the lid there is definitely a suction sound. I would definitely buy these jars again!",

However, my sugar solidified in the container over a fairly short time, so they don't really keep the dampness in the air out of the jar.

It's a decent size and can hold just under two full 5 lb. bags of flour. It has a really wide opening, which is nice for reaching in and scooping out flour. The seal seems to be decent, and I think it'll be airtight enough for flour. Looks really nice on my counter! I bought a 0.5 gallon jar with a glass lid for my sugar instead. I'm following the reviews on there to make that jar airtight as well.",
