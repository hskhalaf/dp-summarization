This is an I7 and compared to 10 to 20 years ago, $2,000 for something like 10mb drives and old DOS software, this is a dream for the money. Back then, no TB drives existed, not even GB drives! GB was like a breakthrough back then, forget SSD drives and USB everything these days. I find it very sturdy as well.",

Some 3rd party programs that don't come with the laptop run at a weird resolution and I have yet to figure out why I've updated the drivers and I can figure it out. But other than that the laptop would be fine for light programming, Web browsing. AND MAYBE MINECRAFT, maybe. =) also I got rid of superfish instantly and this laptop did have the Trojan.",

It is massive and I believe that is what slows down the machine. You can't uninstall some of the bloatware (will not let you) like the McAFee garbage. I have spent 2 days trying to figure out how to get rid of it. Anyway, I would strongly recommend against this laptop. If I am ever able to get rid of the McAFee and other bloatware I may revisit.",

I will say the keyboard is nice to type on. Aside from the plastic that sticks up around the edge. And it boots quickly.
