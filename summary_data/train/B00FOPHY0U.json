The Pentax felt heavier at first, but after a few hours the weight was no problem, it is a very versatile, interesting and exciting camera, it is very easy to use, the kit lenses supplied are very good, I bought a t2 adapter for the mirror lens, great fun, just waiting for a 50mm prime lens. The Pentax K3 will enable you to improve your photo skills.",

I know because I bought one. What a fantastic deal! Oh and the camera is brilliant too! At the time I bought this camera plus 2 kit lenses it was priced below the listing for the camera body itself! Although it does appear to have gone up by nearly \u00a3100 recently it's still brilliant value. Comes factory sealed too in shrink wrap",
