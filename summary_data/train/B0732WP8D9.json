Further, the feet of the bar don't hit the retainer notches that are elevated on the base. I took this item to my local welder and had him weld retainer notches that actually engaged with the backward retainer bar. Works great now. A really stupid flaw but easily fixed it you have a local welder. There are other lifts that are similarly priced that may not have such a bonehead flaw.",

I decided not to return it because I can't keep on waiting to get another one. The difference, according to the description, is that this one supposedly has the capability to be lifted with air, but the jack is exactly the same as the other two items.Here are the links for the other two items.",
