For sizing: I am 6'1 and 205lbs and a large fit me perfectly. Great quality, great deal for the price. Looking forward to more colors being available (Navy, Red, Charcoal Gray).",

They seem to offer little to no warmth benefit when used outdoors in cold weather. 2.) The fit of the tights at the very top appears to be off a bit. Namely, it seems like the inseam is too long compared to the outseam, and as a result, these sit way lower on my waist than I'd like. I'm still able to get by as I always wear something on top of these, but may be worth noting, especially for those with larger posteriors.",

      "text": "Please be aware that these compression tights are kind of thin. On the product information page, they show a person wearing these without any clothing over it. These are a touch sheer and if you were wearing something white underneath, you will definitely be able to tell. Best worn as a base layer with shorts over. Was looking for something that could be worn by itself and would probably not purchase these again.",

(You'd almost think they should come with a can of Pam cooking spray, but the directions work well. Think 'sliding on pantyhose' and you'll do fine.) Once they're on, though, they stay on, and I like that. There's no sagging or drooping; they just plain ol' stay on. And after all, isn't that what you want from your compression pants?",

I'm 6'3, 250, waist size 38 and the large size was a perfect fit! High quality fabric. I am completely satisfied.
