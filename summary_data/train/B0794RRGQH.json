I was really looking for something that looked like a set or kit in a nice box. The quality and assortment might be good, but don't plan on this looking like a nice boxed set. That won't matter, of course, if you're buying for yourself.",

My nieces have just gotten to that age where she is learning what make up is, which makes this product all the better. Why go out to pay for a mani/pedi, when you can do it at home, all while spending quality time with family. This product also brings out an individuals creative/artsy side. Overall, great product, package comes with a lot of stuff.",
