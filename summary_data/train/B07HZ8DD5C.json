      "title": "Unbelievable",
      "text": "This is the most awesome computer I have ever owned. I keep my previous Dell All-in-One as a backup but after looking at the screen of this Microsoft Surface, the Dell looks dark and muddy - I can't even look at it anymore. The monitor resolution is absolutely brilliant! And the screen is huge but super wafer thin. Spending almost 5K is a pretty hefty price tag but it's worth every penny - trust me - you won't be disappointed. I've owned and built desktop computers for as long as I can remember and I've never seen anything like this. I've seen state-of-the-art Apple computers and they don't even come close. What else can I say? It's just astounding!",

      "text": "I did a lot of research before I bought this and only saw positive reviews. I'm a motion graphic designer and video editor and kept hearing how this was a great computer for creatives. It might be an okay computer for illustrators, but DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU NEED TO EDIT VIDEOS OR CREATE MOTION GRAPHICS. It is soooooo slow and takes forever to render. A project that would normally take me 3 hours on my 2015 MacBook ended up taking 7 hours because of how slow the computer was to preview/render everything. I will never go back to a PC again. I'm returning this computer and opting to just buy another Mac.",
