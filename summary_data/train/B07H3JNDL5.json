For me, 15C is so easy to use.I just need to fully charge the robot and press the start button, it will clean and vacuum the entire room by itself. 15C works quite well on the carpeted floor. It has powerful suction but really quiet that you won't even notice it is working. Eufyhome app is very user friendly, I can process it via my phone and choose different modes. I am amazed that 15C can climb high-pile carpet under Boost IQ mode. Overall, this is a very good WiFi vacuum for a good price.",

But if you turn her on and leave the house, or just ignore her, she gets the job done beautifully.",

      "text": "This vacuum worked great for the first few months, I couldn't be happier. However, after about five months it completely stopped working. All of the brush rollers kept saying they were stuck even though we had just cleaned them. It started making HORRIBLE noises every time it started. We then replaced the brush roller and then it wouldn't connect to wifi, would stop working within a few minutes of turning it on. It would stop in the middle of our concrete floors saying that it was \"stuck\" because the sensors stopped working. It was great while it lasted but it wasn't worth the $200 price tag.",
