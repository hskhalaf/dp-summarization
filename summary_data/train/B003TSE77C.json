      "text": "I have used these two years in a row now and they are perfect and make gardening super easy for beginner gardeners. A lot of the research I found said that bottom watering is ideal so that the different types of plants can just grab the water they need. It also helps reduce desease. Also the little soil pods are so easy to use and make transplanting so much easier. This year has been way more successful as I did some research and also bought some LED lights to help with my indoor seed starter growth. I got the ACKE LED Grow Light Board and they are working great together...check out my pics!!",

I add water to soften and slightly plump the pods, then add a few seeds per pod, then I pinch a little soil to cover seeds and add more water to completely moisten and keep lid on to keep moist till seeds sprout. Warm and light are very important and the tray works very well to use in green house, indoor under plant light or just put outdoors in warm weather. When seeds have germinated you can put pods directly in soil in garden bed or in pot.",

One of the big advantages over soil based starters is ease of transplanting. Take out the pellet, gently pull away the fabric cover, and plant. Root damage is less likely than when trying to get a soil capsule out of a plastic holder. As an aside, I recently read a tip about using these for short cold stratification. I put some Royal Catchfly seeds in the pellets, put the pellets in the refrigerator for one week and then removed. I quickly got 90% germination. Neat!",

The mulch is a great mix to help the seeds with nutrients to help grow. The lid is great but I tape it down to stop it from blowing away or use small rocks to keep weight. I have used these a few years in a row. Also easy to use for newbies to gardening like me.",
