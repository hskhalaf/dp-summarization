      "text": "If what you want is something you can mindlessly spin, this is not it. A so-called fidget spinner is just one wheel and it just spins. Fun enough but this toy is more dynamic. Hold the large circles and let the arm swing loose. Get just the right motion going and you have what physicists call chaotic motion, with momentum exchanged between the large and small arm in unpredictable ways. This one has a learning curve! I found it's most interesting when walking, as the walking motion translates to circular motion. Well made of what I believe to be stainless steel with quality bearings.",

He was really excited when he got it in the mail & tries different ways to get it to spin. It spins good & isn't noisy while spinning like his other one. Really happy with this purchase.",

      "text": "While the concept is kind of cool, execution and expectations fell a little short for me on this one. It is very smooth on both axis, and can keep you occupied for a while, the problem for me was length of time on spin. Way too short... and the reason is that by its design it is a lopsided spin. And you feel it. And because its lopsided when spun it slows down rapidly which for me makes using it not very satisfying. You may be different as we all are and maybe enjoy it. For me it's a nice addition to the collection.",

It works a little better if I use it between my thumb and middle finger, but I still experience the same problem.

The machined edges almost feel a little sharp. It's hard to get a smooth consistent spin on it, so it's not super satisfying. It is kinda fun to get the little bearing going. I doubt it will get much use beyond a quick 30 second test from time to time. But...oh well, it's fine.",

It is too big for my fingers, and my daughters fingers to hold without the spinner part swinging back around and hitting our fingers.

I'm sure it's only pricey because it is made of metal, but other than that it is amazingly fun to play with and is easy to use in my non dominant hand while writing on school. Beware, however, because your forearm will get tired after about 30-45 mins of continuous spinning!",
