We were looking at taller (48') pools, but the only sizes available were either way too big or way too expensive. 30\" turned out to be perfect. We're two adults, 50-60's, average health. This is easy to get into, even tho we just happened to have a double step for it. If you are shorter than 5'6\", you might need a step to keep from racking privates! Also, warms up quickly, so refreshing without stopping your heart! We have it tucked away in a secluded corner of yard... perfect for midnight skinny dip!! Lol!!",

Now it's leaking 4 inches a day everywhere & doesn't filter AT ALL. We still have 3 months or more of blazing hot summer left where I live. So disappointed to have wasted my money on this for this season. I need a refund or a replacement. :-(",

It didn\u2019t even ship until Friday night, meaning it sat their warehouse for over 30 hours, which caused it to arrive four days late.
