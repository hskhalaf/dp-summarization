I'm going to have to get some adhesive tape or something to prevent this from happening or get a new set of liners. Other than that....Great find!",

I'm thinking about buying another pair in a different color. I highly recommend Chooka boots!",

      "text": "These boots were really good quality, which I was not really expecting. They have a nice cloth lining that is helpful since rubber boots can get so cold. They are fairly heavy because of the thick sole. I typically wear a size 9, and I ordered a size 9, and they fit perfectly in the foot. The upper calf is fairly wide, but I like that because it is easy to tuck in pants and thick socks. They are really cute, and I love wearing them - I don't mind rainy days anymore!",

She did not walk in them all that much as she uses different boots for the winter and we didn't get that much rain this spring/summer. You can get boots from more established brands for similar prices.",

I was originally leaning towards a Hunter mid-calf height boot however the price didn\u2019t seem worth it. The Chooka boots had great reviews for a 1/3 of the price. They were comfortable to wear for 6+ hours in a muddy field. My only complaint was that they faded around the toe area. The rubber is now lighter and worn after 1 wear. For a dressier/office boot go with Hunter. For a pop on and wear in light rain this is a great option for the price.",
