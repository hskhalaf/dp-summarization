All other rafts have had to be replaced after one summer of hard use because the handles ripped apart. It didn\u2019t get 5 stars only because this is not big enough for more than 2 teenagers and one 5 year old child. Even with that, it\u2019s a little tight.",

The 4th time we tried it didn't hold air. We kept having to go back to the marina bc it was deflating. I'll never buy again and don't recommend anyone else should. Update: I emailed the seller.

The patch kit was crap. This is a seasonal product. The window for return was January. Tubes are not used in northern Minnesota in January so there was no reason for inflating or testing it until its initial use 10 days ago. It should be replaced free of charge in my opinion.",

However, at a certain speed when accelerating this thing takes a dive under water with the people holding on to the hand straps. This problem has been reported on another website already and I must confirm this. If you pull up the front hard during the acceleration process until you reach planing speed, and the guy driving the boat knows how to handle it, it's manageable/avoidable. I am thinking this is due to the center position of the rope which should be probably attached more towards the bottom to get some positive lift.

Ever since it looses air everyone I use it and it is getting worse each time. It's a lot of fUn when it's actually inflated but be sure to use it immediately so you can return it if it has a flaw.",
