This moisturizer is unlike any I\u2019ve ever used before, extremely lightweight but not mousse-like or fluffy like other moisturizers advertised as soft and light, this is more like a primer texture. It\u2019s more expensive than I typically ever spend on facial products, but you truly only need a pea to a chickpea sized portion for it to be effective. My skin is prone to breakouts so I use a lot of products that tend to dry out my skin, but that hasn\u2019t happened once since using Malin + Goetz.",
