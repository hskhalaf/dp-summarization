      "text": "Folks, I really thought this was going to be fairly nice shoe shine kit. First, everything is small, especially the brushes. The polish brush is made for a smaller person and that makes it difficult to hold in a normal hand. That makes it hard to polish boots or shoes. Second, the polish was melted went it arrived. That doesn't really change the consistency, but when I got it, it was stuck to the lid and it made a mess. Ok, I understand it's a $15 kit - not one of the $60, but I really expected it to be as good as one I picked up from Wal-Mart.",

The wax polish container is much bigger than I expected! Don't think I'll be finishing it any time soon. Buffing cloth is great and easy to clean. The bag itself is mediocre; I took everything out and put it in a box.",
