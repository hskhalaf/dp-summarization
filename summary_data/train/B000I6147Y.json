This situation is easily correct by gently working the bar further out from the hole in the board until wire is aligned with slot.\" Then it even gives you a picture. It's easy, pull the bar out, problem solved, don't be an ignorant idiot and waste money returning this item.",

After having used it for 3 weeks or so, I can't recommend it for cutting cheese (despite the glowing reviews of the soapers). You do need to align the wire with the slot\u2014OK, no problem. The issue is that the handle is too loose to keep a straight cut down through the cheese resulting in slices that are inevitably thicker on top or bottom. Of course, making fine adjustments after cutting off a couple of preliminary slices (or should I say wedges?) results in misalignment of the cutting wire with the groove. There seems to be no way to make consistently uniform slices with parallel sides.",

Simple simple simple! The instructions clearly state that it might need adjusted! I think this thing is awesome! I would not hesitate to buy again if I needed a good cheese slicer.",

I was planning on placing a stopper block so I could cut soap at consistent sizes but I don't have high hopes for any consistency even with a stop block. I may still give it a try, soap is a different consistency than Tillamoock Cheddar. I'll update my review if anything improves.",

However, just follow the instructions to re-align it. 2) When cutting thru cheese, the handle makes a slight \"clacking\" sound when you're finished slicing. However, this doesn't seem to affect the performance. 3) Easy to clean - I just use a wet paper towel. Happy slicing!",

It works great, slices thick and thin, and has never snapped a wire (and I've had it more than a year now). Works best on cheeses like cheddar. It's easy to adjust the position of the wire by bumping the arm. It's easy to clean, I just run a toothbrush down the groove if anything sticks. I like that there is a sticker on the bottom with instructions for buying replacement wires, who keeps instructions for things like this!",

Information printed on the bottom of the cutter would be a better idea. Easily burned into the wood base, it would be there forever.",

I am able to quickly slice very thin slices. I can slice a 16 oz block of cheese in just a couple of minutes. it is 4 stars instead of 5 because the wire naturally comes down and hits the upper part of the block. To have the wire go into the slicing notch I have to pull it to the right- not terribly difficult but not ideal either.",

This also causes the cheese to be cut a little crooked. normally you would be able to line the cheese up with the squares on the board for the straight cuts, but this isn't possible because of the misalignment.",

That, coupled with a lack of stabilization on the board, made this pointless for precise soap cutting.",

The slicer itself appears to be reasonably well made and I'm sure it will cut cheese just fine. I tried it with a piece of my soap and it did cut it but not without some struggling.

It is easy to use, easy on the wrist and the cheese does not crumble. So far I have cut cheddar, Colby and pepper jack. I only gave four stars because with the harder cheese (cheddar) the wire bends a bit more so does not fit perfectly in the groove like when I cut the softer cheeses. A slightly larger groove would fix this issue. Regardless though, it still cut the cheese nicely. I would recommend this product.",
