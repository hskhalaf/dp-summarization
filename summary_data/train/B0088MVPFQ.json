      "text": "Mario 2 is far better than the original Mario DS. The original was fun with the traditional platform style of play that we have all come to know and enjoy throughout the Mario franchise, but Mario 2 has a lot more action and color. Some of the annoying things from the original were removed, like you can now save again and again after beating a tower or castle. The annoying chomping sounds from the piranha plants is also gone. In this game, you focus more on getting coins while also collecting the three big gold coins, finding secret levels, and beating Bowser. I've gotten a lot of extra lives just from all the coins I collected.",

No case, no insert, just the little cartridge by itself. I purchased this game under the impression that it was new. Item description didn't say it was used but I paid the price for a new one. Not having the case decreases the games value. I'm not happy at all. This looked like a little used piece from GameStop. Should've been in a case with the little booklet. These people just haggled me to get more money.",

I love the streetpass challenges lately. Another perfect Mario game! Super Mario Bros. 3 is my all time favorite video game for many years, but this is very similar in fun and play control. I will probably always love Mario anytime this happens. Raccoon Tail, Yeah!",

As far as the prize being not so great, granted its not some huge thing but it was a lotta fun to get to a million coins and to see your little coin counter go up and it still counts even after you've collected the million so that's really kool too. I still think it was a fun game and I've all ready beaten it twice just for the fun of it.",

Or if you want to play with friends, New Super Mario Bros U or Super Luigi U are great games. There's one for the Wii as well, but I haven't played it.

I do not find the more recent titles to be as difficult as the originals, but they are pretty. I will admit that 2 has VERY hidden secrets and coin stars which make for a higher level of replayability. I enjoyed my time with the game and, much like any other Mario game, I look forward to picking it back up a couple years and playing it again.",

Can you get one million coins?\n\nFEATURES\n * New Super Mario Bros. 2 is an all-new side-scrolling adventure game featuring Mario and Luigi. Two players who each own the game will have the option to play the entire game in two-player multiplayer mode using local wireless.\n * The game records all the coins players collect throughout the game, so completing a level is only part of the fun.

A sequel to the 2006 Nintendo DS release, New Super Mario Bros., this new game version challenges players to rescue Princess Peach from the latest kidnapping by Bowser, and to collect as masses of Nintendo gold coins while doing so. Of all Mario titles released to date, New Super Mario Bros. 2 contains the the greatest emphasis on gold collection, with over a million coins available throughout the game's 80+ stages. Additional game features include: wireless co-op multiplayer support, new and returning power-ups and hidden items, and SpotPass automatic download functionality for the wireless sharing of information with friends. \n\nA whole new battle against Bowser in which gold coins are key.\nView larger New and returning power-ups that dramatically affect Mario's platforming abilities.\nView larger MARIO HITS THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM JACKPOT\n Bowser has once again kidnapped Princess Peach, but besides rescuing his lady love, this time Mario has another objective. The Mushroom Kingdom is bursting with more gold coins than ever before. Each level is littered with gold as coins rain down from overhead pipes, trails of coins are left behind special gold enemies and gold pipes transport Mario into coin-filled caverns. It's up to players to collect as many coins as possible throughout their adventure. \n\nENJOY THE PLATFORMING FUN WITH A FRIEND\n New Super Mario Bros. 2 allows players to share the fast-paced fun with a friend over a local wireless network. The game's 2-player co-op mode requires both players to have a Nintendo 3DS system and a copy of the game. Together players can play through the entire game, collect double the coins, team up to unleash devastating double Ground Pound attacks on enemies, and more. An extra player can even help when continuing from your solo play save file. \n\nCOLLECT, LITERALLY A MILLION COINS\n Coin collection is important in every adventure in the Mushroom Kingdom, but New Super Mario Bros. 2 takes this to new heights. The game is filled with more coins and gold-related features than any Mario game before, and includes the frenzied Coin Rush mode in which you play three levels back to back trying to earn as many coins as possible. In fact, the game literally holds more than a million possible coins, and keeps track of each for you as you proceed from beginning to end. SpotPass functionality built into the 3DS allows you to share your running total with friends. If you reach a million coins, you'll get something special. \n\nKEY GAME FEATURES\n * New Super Mario Bros. 2 is an all-new side-scrolling adventure game featuring Mario and Luigi.
