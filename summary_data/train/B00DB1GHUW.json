It certainly could have been designed better but it is not a major issue if you simply screw in the top screw first and hold bracket with the top screw being center and the bottom at either 3 or 9 as if looking at a clock face. Once the top screw is tightened you can simply rotate the bracket to align the bottom screw at that point, much easier than trying to tighten the top screw from above.",

The bracket holes to attach the brackets to the wall are poorly designed so that you can't screw them straight into the wall because the bracket curves in the way. You have to angle your screws way up or down to anchor the brackets to the wall. Rods slip into each other without a way to stop them from sliding inside each other. Good; the rods are heavy duty and easily support heavy curtain fabric.",

But they sent us one flawed set and one new set ----- so we ruined our walls installing the first set. The rods are up but after hours of frustration. When we got to the second set my husband realized that they had corrected the flaw. It was overall, an awful experience. Amazon should have pulled all the flawed items. It took hours of work to restore our walls. Amazon should compensate us.",

There is an arch shape of the bracket that covers the top hole, making it extremely difficult to screw the top in. I had to play around for a while, angle the screw carefully to get into the wall. I had to buy shorter screws (from Lowes), allowing the brackets to be mounted. Very disappointed.",

The curtains I hung are heavy panels with black-out linings because I used it on a west facing window down here in south Texas. There is no sagging at all, the rod is ver sturdy and so easy to put up. I would highly recommend this item.",
