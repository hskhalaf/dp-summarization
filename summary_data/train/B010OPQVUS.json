Update (9/5/16): I've now bought a second one for my Elliptigo Bike. That bike is a firm ride and if you've ever been on San Diego streets you know how horrible they are. Again, Rock Solid.

I have bought two because even after wrecking my motorcycle the phone was still in the holder and still firmly attached to my bars. The only reason I do not have the original is because i failed to remove it from my bike before the wrecker took my bike. I bought another one for my new motorcycle. Install is quick and easy.",

Depending on your phone, rubber mesh can cover (or even push) some side buttons as well as cover the corner of the screen.

It has the same feel as a car mount for your phone the back can be pivoted. For anyone wanting a mount for the phone this one would be the one to start with. Ride safe and only look at the phone when you absolutely have to.",

It works absolutely perfect! I put it on a Harley with ape hangers so it has a ton of vibration, it NEVER moved at 70 mph. It allowed me to Bluetooth to bike radio. Great product, good follow-up by seller. Choose this one!!",
