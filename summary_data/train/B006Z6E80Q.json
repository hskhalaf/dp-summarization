Bought three and found they are easily stackable when storing away. In the freezer or fridge I would set the bottom one on a small plate for a sturdy base. The cubes are very flexible and the food pops out easily. We've come a long way from making food in ice cube trays back when I had my first baby! This is a must have for homemade food prep.",

At first I thought it was just that awkward freezer smell but after soaking, washing, and sterilizing, it still smelled terrible. Additionally, the functionality of the lid connecting to the tray is a little off. A lot of times it will just pop off even if I have the ridges tucked in just so. If I didn't keep food frozen in a cross pattern where the connecting ridges were, it was even more difficult. Great idea but really bummed me out for my first try at freezer storing baby food.",

A quick run under the faucet loosens them up to remove one at a time- great for when that's all you need, but a little time consuming to completely empty. Still a convenient product though- would buy again! I also use this to transport food when we are traveling- I have one trey for breakfast food, lunch, and supper!",
