Utilizes same frame as solid screen material, which is a fantastic frame setup but you can see two support bars down screen in their 1/3 segments (or where ever you put them). They are most noticeable obviously using bright scenes... like hockey ice. Screen material is indeed acoustically transparent though. I used brighter in wall speakers behind since the screen will absorb some of the high frequencies. Would purchase again but may try a different color wrapping over internal support bars other than the black velvet provided. Takes two people to build and hang. Overall, it is a beautiful set up, very appealing in any standard of room.",

It can be done, but takes an unreasonable amount of time. But again, for the price vs the other brands mentioned above, it's understandable, being that those other brands cost well over $1000.",

It took about 45 min to put together and then hang it up, by myself, although a buddy could have made the hanging easier. Note, I am pretty mechanically savy, so it could take longer. The screen seriously looks professional on the wall, even when the projector is off! Highly, highly recommended.",

Makes a big difference to the image quality when compared to projecting directly on a white wall. Also, I got the grey version but realised that white would be better since my projector contrast is already very good. I got a replacement white screen from silver ticket (just check their website).

With a second person to help guide the end of the rods, it would probably be easier. I chose grey material due to not being in a fully light controlled environment.

The screen looks good, was well packed and seems to be solid, but truthfully it's not needed if you already have a similar color with an eggshell or semi-gloss finish paint.

      "text": "AMAZING IMPROVEMENT over projecting onto white wall!!! Fun & easy assembly! Took about 45 mins. Simple, clear instructions. INSANELY CHALLENGING TO HANG. Took four people over THREE HOURS to successfully hang it on the wall. Requires *exactly* lining up four corners of screen with four screws in the wall... Would be essentially impossible for one person to hang. Absolutely need a second person to hang; expect very very long arduous process of making minute adjustments to the four corners hoping the magically all \"click into place\" at the same time.",

I have noticed a rattling or buzzing coming from the screen at certain frequency. I never hooked bottom of screen to wall so that may be causing some of the problem, need to investigate. Hopefully I can resolve the problem.",

But....with my 4k optoma uhd60 projector I now noticed the woven pattern on scenes that are white. It's not just a little noticeable it's actually distracting. I previously had a Carl's sheer wave acoustic screen before this acoustic screen and didn't look as good as this one. Not 100% sure acoustic screens are the right way to go for 4k. I can't totally remodel my theater for a complete different setup though. So this one will stay and I will deal with the woven pattern. Other than that it's a great screen",

I had my wife hold one side while I finagled the top bracket to the left 4\"in then repeat for the other side.

When attaching the screen material to the \"hooks\" make sure you start in the middle of each side and alternate between sides back and forth until you end at the corners. Picture quality is amazing. The black frame erases any bleed-over. I considered the projector paint, but I've so glad I went this route instead. Overall, I would highly recommend this screen!",

    "description": "The STR-169150 Silver Ticket fixed frame projection screen features a native 16:9 format and a whopping 150\" diagonal viewing surface. FULL HD, 4K, 8k & 1080p HDR and Active 3D Ready. This entry-level screen truly assembles much faster than any other brand available! Forget about tucking the screen material into the frame - the Silver Ticket Tension Rod System saves you time and frustration. How does the material connect to the frame? Each side of the material has a pocket. A rod slides through the pocket to attach to the frame. This saves you time in the assembly process, but also removes any puckers or wrinkles to provide a flat viewing surface. The rod holds the material perfectly square all around the whole frame. This pocket and rod system remains hidden behind the frame so you only see the movie. This screen features real projection screen material, not a sheet. The material is stretchy multi-layered vinyl made specifically for watching projected movies. Wait until you see the colors! There is no resolution lost at any angle. Mildew resistant, flame resistant, and washable with mild soap and water. Forget about tricky installations - this fixed frame screen mounts on the wall much like a large picture frame. The sturdy aluminum frame is WRAPPED not flocked with a light absorbing black velvet fabric to absorb over-projected light so you don't have to be a professional when aligning your projector. Other brands use square tubing in their frames, but this frame is wide extruded aluminum and contours down to the projected image so you won't have any ugly shadow on the image area. The frame connects to the wall in 4 mounting points to hold it strong and square. Even after mounting on the wall the screen can be horizontally adjusted to ensure perfect positioning! The Silver Ticket Fixed Frame is available in many different sizes and aspect ratios.",
