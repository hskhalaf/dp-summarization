I slid on my hardwood floor--I am hoping that the pair I received are just defective soles. Its like they are flat--then waxed then flat--on both shoes. (see photo) Can you check the bottom if you bought and let me know if this is the case on yours? Otherwise they are perfect comfort--just afraid I will slide. Thanks",
