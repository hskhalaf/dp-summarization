Takes some C batteries but seems to last a very long time as I haven't replaced since buying. Honeywell products seem rock solid to me, just go for this brand. The ringer is nice enough ;looking that you could mount anywhere on a wall if you wanted to. I'd get this over some cheap no name brand.",

I won't use any other features this product has to offer however, having the capability to keep volume somewhat lower was a big concern of mine. The chime box is rather heavy once you insert the four C batteries, so I will wait until I can borrow a drill or wait for my maintenance man to securely install being I live in an old building. Meanwhile.... I put it on top of a bookcase. Works great. Very stylish too.",

I got a second button which issues a different chime sound, so I know whether its being pressed at front door or back door.

The cover of the inside unit is 6 inches by 8 inches, and the part that touches the wall is approximately 5 inches by 6 inches. It can be mounted horizontally or vertically, and it runs on 4 C cell batteries, which are not provided. The wall anchors that came with the unit didn't work very well, so you might want to buy your own. The outside button comes with a piece of double sided foam tape for easy installation (two screws are also included).",

Still, I like the chimes selection and doorbell combination I received.
