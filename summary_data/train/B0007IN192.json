Bicycle, a name I grew up with (just as a card player with the family, not a gambler) caught my eye among the plethora of products out there. Of course, the chips are just perfect. Classic hard plastic with the grooved edges that make stacking a breeze. I'm pretty sure my skeletons agree, that is, when they're not being distracted by pesky skeleton animals.",

I expected simple plastic poker chips in three colors that we could use to play poker instead of coins and more expensive options. The set arrived, and I got what I expected. Are they fancy? No. They cost $7. They work fine and come with a small rigid plastic case that makes it easy to store them. Again, if you pay $7, expect quality for $7. I would buy again, unless I wanted fancy chips, in which case I would buy a different set.",

They will still work for what they were intended - poker. I really haven't played cards with a pack of these chips since childhood. The chips I got seem a bit thinner than I remember them. Still, they are well made and lock together like I remember. I'm satisfied with my purchase.",
