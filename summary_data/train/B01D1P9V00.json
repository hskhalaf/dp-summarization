This iron is heavy enough to do a good job, holds enough water and releases a good amount of steam. I like the self cleaning mechanism. Steel plates seem to be better and longer lasting than the non tick soleplate I had in my previous iron. For the price, its definitely a good buy.",

There are a couple of issues I noticed, and could could use improvements: First, is the view window for the water level, the whole tank is a burgundy, which makes seeing the water level difficult, if there was a clear strip on either (or both sides), to easily identify the water line, that would be uber beneficial; Second, the warming light doesn't seem to turn off, but the iron is adequately hot for the given setting(s). When I first used the iron it did go off at the desired temperature, but has since stopped turning off, not sure if this is a short, or other defect of sorts.",

I thought that maybe I over filled it so I tried with little water and it still leaks. Very disappointed in Black & Decker.",

Having recently returned a $70ish R-brand which I just \"knew\" I would adore, I figured with free returns I had nothing to lose. Get this one! You won't be disappointed!
