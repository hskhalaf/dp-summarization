We use it when washing ceilings baseboards and walls even! I slightly altered mine by adding a telescoping handle for a little extra convenience when doing hard to reach areas. If mine ever breaks I will buy the same one again! 100% recommend this mop!",

I find that the Scotch Brite mop leaves particles behind, especially in corners. I also notice some dust just being pushed around, much like dusting with a dry paper towel. It works better when damp and the head needs to be cleaned frequently. I think you'll find it handy, but temper expectations. It may not be the complete solution you're looking for.",

This thing picks up all the hair. The best part is that you can use any kind of cleaner you want with it, so you're not stuck with whatever cleaner they put on the Swiffer pads. Plus, you get to just leave the pad on for awhile instead of replacing it every time. It's also really good at buffing out those more obnoxious spots on the floor. Totally recommend this thing.",

The handle is very lightweight aluminum (easy on the arms) and the mop really cleans thoroughly while picking up lots of dirt and hair easily. If you have a hardwood floor or tile (or other hard surface), this is a good way to clean.",

The microfiber cover swiftly picks up hair and dirt. Great for us because we have a German Shepherd dog and a toddler. Finally it doesn't feel like such a chore to mop floors.",

      "text": "I've used many cotton floor mop so microfiber mop is something new to me. I got the mop today so I used it to mop the entire floor and I have to say it was a pleasant mopping experience. The mop has a nicer feedback than my previous cotton ones while mopping. The description says that Microfiber is superior than cotton at picking up dirt, but I didn't notice a significant difference though. Overall, this is a very cheap mop that get's the job done.",

I clean my floors with a combination of warm water, dish soap and vinegar, and I am consistantly amazed at how much dirt these mops pick up every week. It really feel like my floors are actually cleaner in the end.",

Picks up the dust and dirt even in the corners, and washes easily and dries in the dryer. It is good to have a couple on hand so that you always have a clean one to go. It is easy to slip it on the mop and with a click it stays in place as it should. No cons for these!",
