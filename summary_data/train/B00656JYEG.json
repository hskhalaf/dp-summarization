Can't say for certain if it was this lotion or the tanning bed lotion I bought and started using at the same time. But I can say this didn't help. The smell wasn't my cup of tea either. Wasn't horrible, but not a pleasant smell to me. Almost like an old light perfume scent thrown into the bottle to mask the chemically smell of the lotion. However, I could smell both. I returned and got a diff lotion that works much better.",

This one has quickly become my new fav!! The smell is so light and refreshing! It\u2019s not thick or oily feeling and instantly soaks into your skin! I have such silky and hydrated skin I can\u2019t even believe it! The ONLY thing I don\u2019t like is the pump doesn\u2019t lock.. I keep it in my gym bag because I tan after working out and there\u2019s been occasions it has self pumped into bag :(",
