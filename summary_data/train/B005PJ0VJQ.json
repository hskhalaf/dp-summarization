Recommendation - don't grab the center of the seat to unfold your new chair, instead pull gently on one seat corner until it opens a little and then pull on the other seat corner until it gives a little and at a certain point the entire chair seat will open easily. I suspect as the chairs are used it becomes easier to open them, but mine are still new. The third-party vendor was wonderful and gave me a postage paid label to return the broken chair and then sent a replacement. I would order these again.",

The mesh makes them super comfy like they're padded. And BONUS - the chairs are really wide so they don't push your shoulders forward like other chairs or make you feel cramped when setup for an audience. I drove around to several different HomeDepots trying to get 30 chairs, after the third place, I gave up and ordered from Amazon. So easy, and came right to my house in perfect condition - not dusty like the HD chairs (don't get me wrong, I love HD, but c'mon, the dust!).",

They are a bit (maybe 2\") wider than normal, but that makes a big difference. They are also very flexible plastic mesh that makes them much more comfortable to sit in for an extended period of time. They come in a big box fully assembled.",

They are light, easy to store, simple to clean, and will never rust out. If they will last at least 2 years, then the economics will work out.",

In any case, i would recommend these as back up or temporary chairs in you have not found your perfect set yet but need something to sit on and not be in pain. And the best part, there was no assembly needed!",

The plastic mesh area keeps you cool and has enough give to make these comfortable chairs to sit in for much longer than a flat metal chair. Worth the extra money if you need extra seating for parties or anything (and you care about the chairs your guests sit in hah).",
