The Kidde KN-COB-B-LPM Carbon Monoxide Alarm fit the bill. It costs under $15. It runs on two AA batteries. And it installs in minutes. The alarm is loud, and its features are very basic. You have a test button and a couple of LEDs to show the alarm's status. That's it. If you're looking for a fancy detector loaded with features, this isn't it. If you want simplicity and low cost, this detector will do the job.",

Designed for quick and simple installation.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\n KIDDE 9CO5-LP \n With the use of sophisticated electronic components, the Kidde 9CO5-LP battery-operated carbon monoxide alarm protects you and your family from the dangers of carbon monoxide. Also included is an intuitive slide-out battery door that gives easy and immediate access to the batteries and a safety feature mechanism that makes the unit difficult to close without the proper installation of the batteries. This easy-to-install alarm is appropriate for all living areas and comes with a 7-year life warranty and 5-year limited warranty. \n\n CONSUMER BENEFITS \n The Kidde 9CO5-LP will alert you and your family with a loud warning signal against the dangers of elevated carbon monoxide levels in your home. This battery-operated carbon monoxide alarm continuously monitors carbon monoxide levels, even during power outages when AC-only units are not providing protection. \n\n TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS \n This unit uses an electrochemical sensor, and when it detects carbon monoxide, it will alert the user with a distinct pattern. The alarm pattern is four short beeps, followed by five seconds of silence, then four more short beeps with a corresponding red LED light. This cycle will continue for four minutes and then change to one cycle every minute until the device is reset or the carbon monoxide is eliminated. In addition, the red LED light will pulse to indicate carbon monoxide has been detected until the device is reset or carbon monoxide is removed from the surrounding area. When there is no carbon monoxide present, a green LED light will flash every 30 seconds, indicating a properly operating alarm when power is present. \n\n WHAT'S IN THE BOX \n One Kidde 9CO5-LP unit and two AA batteries. \n\nFEATURES/SPECIFICATIONS\n * Battery operated (3AA batteries included) - Provides protection during power outages \n * Battery lockout system \u2013 Deters covering battery compartment without installation of batteries \n * Slide-out battery door cover \u2013 Gives immediate access to batteries \n * Test/reset button \u2013 Tests the unit for proper operation and can also reset the Carbon Monoxide alarm \n * Low battery signal \u2013 Alerts user when the battery needs to be replaced\n * Green LED \u2013 Flashes every 30-seconds to indicate the unit is operating properly \n * Red LED \u2013 When a dangerous level of carbon monoxide is detected the red LED will pulse and a loud alarm pattern will sound",
