I spend the majority of my time at home, so I can use the full-size tool for any of its listed capabilities 2. The first trip I took with it, TSA confiscated it and threw it away as it looks basically like a knife (or as scary - the guy showed me the x-ray image), so I didn't really have it to use. It's also nearly metallic, so when the TSA guy picked it up, that basically sealed the deal. Great concept, but not sure the practicality is there.",

However, the product is light weight and I do not notice it in my wallet. Further it has already proved useful opening packages and bottles. I can see the product being handy for several situations over the many years I expect it to last.",

Screwdrivers do work neat, but what I like is the protruding arm to poke in tight spaces.

The deputy said that \"We aren't the TSA.\" when I said it was approved for in flight and couldn't understand why he needed to confiscate it at a courthouse.
