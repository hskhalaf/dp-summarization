Moving the phone away by more than 5 feet or turning it off caused the scale to function correctly. Bizarre issue but manageable.",

The pros are that the platform is removable, it uses AAA batteries (rather than Li CR2032 batteries), no imperial/metric switch on bottom of the unit and the scale has a small footprint and is very stable. The only con is that there is no backlit display; but then, the scale would probably require 4 batteries rather than 2.",

I set the bowl on it, clear the weight and begin adding ingredients. I add the almond meal to the proper weight - clear it again - and add the proper weight of sugar. Easy as pie.

I love that the front can be pulled out so I can see the measurement around large plates or bowls. Just make sure not to touch it while it counts down when it turns on--it will not be able to measure appropriately if you move it or touch it while it calibrates. I couldn't live without this scale!",
