I've had to bend the little lever back in place a few times, but it still works. Keep in mind that this is pretty small. You're not going to skin a buck or scale a fish with it.

It is so convenient I usually forget it is there until I need it, or until a security guard is confiscating it on my way into some venue or another. I think these are pretty durable, I've never broken one. Haven't even lost one. But so many taken away. Each time I end up logging into amazon and ordering another. The small price paid for my inability to learn from my mistakes and my unwillingness to be without such a simple, sometimes indispensable, tool. 10/10 will buy another the next time I fly.",

I thought I\u2019d need to get used to that, but it is growing on me, and actually the matte finish creates a little friction between my fingers when using it so all is well.

At my workplace, a regular sized SAK would cause fellow employees discomfort, but this SAK hardly gains notice as a knife. And I rarely deploy the blade, since the scissors can be used for most cutting needs. The tweezers are quite precise and the toothpick is convenient. It's not for hiking or general fix-its in the house, but a useful everyday pocket tool. The white color is quite pleasant and further adds to the unobtrusiveness of the knife.",

That brings me to the second point: the steel\u2019s durability. After light use over several months, I already have a few nicks in the blade. That\u2019s bad enough, but the blade has also dulled very quickly.
