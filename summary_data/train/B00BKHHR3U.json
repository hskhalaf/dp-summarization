Once applied, it looked peachy nude, not dramatic or an over powering orangish color. This is perfect if you are wear dramatic eye makeup and need a shiny non sticky gloss to polish off your look.

It\u2019s kind of a weird shade to pull off, not sure how else to describe it but light. This can be fixed though. Instead of swiping it across the lips, dot it 3-4 times on the bottom lip, rub your lips together, and blend with your finger. You still get the gloss, scent, and a nice peachy pink shade that doesn\u2019t look too washed out. That\u2019s the word, washed out. The NYX butter glosses are great, I recommend for either super light or super dark skin shades.",
