It has the U shape on the very ends making it convenient for your head or to put between your legs. it has a washable cover. The stuffing has also held its shape. Cons: i do find the cover to be a little rough, however, i think it makes it easier to spot clean. It is very large in the bed, but smaller than most pregnancy pillows.",

However, I continue to wake up throughout the night and in the morning with really bad back pain still. The only way i've been able to stop the back pain is if i lay on my back with the pillow under one side so i'm not completely on my back. For some reason, it also gives me an earache in the morning...not sure what the cause of that is. Overall, I'm still using it as it does provide some additional comfort but it is not helping with my back pain as i was hoping.",
