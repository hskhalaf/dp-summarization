She is constantly calling me to the kitchen to show me what she can do with. \"Honey look, see how I can do this!\" I say \"hey thats great\", even though I don't have a clue what she's doing.

Several uses (cleaning up flour, lifting dough, picking up chopped veggies, etc.). This metal version is probably going to scratch your counter if it is a material that can be scratched, so watch out. However, if you use your kitchen there's probably lots of scratches in it! They make a plastic version that I find less worrisome on this front, but the plastic version lacks the flex that the metal version has.",
