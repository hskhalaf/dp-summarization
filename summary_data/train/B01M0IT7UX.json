Dark lighting pictures look awful also compared to my colleagues' phones. Also FYI if you want your megapixels to actually work, you should change the settings to capture the high resolution picture.",

The only good thing about the phone is that the rear camera takes awesome photos but the camera won't stay open long enough as the phone over heats. I wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone.

The display on the XZ is unbelievably clear, it's very well made, love the design, it's ridiculously fast like the absolute fastest camera and shutter I have ever seen on a smartphone. Auto focus is unreal and camera app opens instantly (huge improvement of past Sonys). Highly recommend",

I managed to get around it by using 3rd party apps. However the messaging sucks on this phone it conflicts with Facebook messenger and eventually SMS stopped responding. It will constantly ask you to choose a default messaging app, very annoying. Word predict sucks too. 3 stars Sony.",
