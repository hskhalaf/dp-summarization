      "text": "We ordered this cover for our large kidney shaped pool, with hot tub, and it covered the entire surface well. Of course there was some extra cover fabric at the corners which we tucked under the water tubes. We had also previously purchased a pool leaf net, which we also installed. The Blue Wave Bronze cover seems to be very well made, especially for the price. We will have to see how it holds up for the Louisiana winter and leaves. The warranty is a bit misleading in that it is heavily prorated after year one, and you must pay for shipping. Also, the warranty shown on the Amazon listing is for a different model with a 12-year warranty.",

I did use the winterizing kit as well.. but none of the surface water bled into the pool water that I could tell. the 2nd year (this year) the water was still pretty clear, however the cover is starting to get big holes in it where it sits on the edge of the pool.. So I may be able to use it one more year.. but.. i might have to look for something else.. I doubt i would buy one from these guys again.",

They want you to send it back a $24 to get a new one, which is about $43 new.... Don't BUY! Will not last a year!!!!",

Its light weight makes in easy to handle, yet it is every bit as strong as other \"HEAVY duty\" and more expensive covers. It is waterproof and floats. It was the size specified. It has gromments around the entire perimeter 18 inches apart and at all the corners, plus water tube sleeves. My experience with this pool cover has been entirely positive.",

Very hard to unfold for this size pool and after the first week of rain the cover just sank to the bottom of the pool and all the leaves were in the pool. Would not recommend for an area with alot of snow or rain. This was a waste of my money. Only saving grace is I can use it as a very cheap grade tarp. Very thin. tears easily",
