Been a month now, 12 inch is too soft and edge support is insufficient for my 220 lbs. 10\" was much better, love the 10\" and cheaper. If your 100 lbs maybe the 12\" is for you.",

      "text": "Love this new mattress - was surprised it enlarged so quickly - almost instantly - so be prepared. No odor (except for the plastic its wrapped in), and the comfort is fascinating. I bought this because someone mentioned it was firm, and they are correct, but there's also 4.5 inches of gel/mem foam and comfort foam that are soft. When you get up, you can actually see the bed linens move as the bed adjust back to normal. It is very cool and comforting to sleep on. Remember the thickness of the mattress you purchase should be dictated by the weight that will be on it every night, just FYI. The cat won't stay off it : )",

Both have diminished by 90% since sleeping on this mattress. Our previous mattress was from Ikea, a coil/foam hybrid whose sides collapsed within three years. I am reserving a 5 star rating here because ou time with tell if this mattress will have any longevity. Right now it is about a month old and we love it.",
