They stay on my head while I'm working out, jogging weight lifting etc. After 3 or 4 hours hours my outer ear hurts a little bit but there has to be some tension for the headphones to stay on and I don't usually wear them that long anyway. Battery life seems around the 10 hour mark to me, but maybe a couple more. All in all the best workout headphones I have ever used and my first on ear headphones for working out, I'll never go back to in ear!",

They slide off your head while lying flat on a bench with out even moving. Sound qaulity is poor. Can have a conversation with someone whilst full volume. The gyms music is louder in my ears than these headphones. Not at all happy with choosing these.",

Also the bass of these headphones are amazing and with it being such a low priced product it makes it an easy buy.",

The sound is very good considering the price and the anti sweat/water feature works great. The controls are simple and work every time. Thanks Plantronics, you did a great job!",

Total waste of my time and money...not happy at all. Plantronics you really need to address this issue, and not continue to sell faulty headphones, especially as it wood appear there have been other customers complaining of this issue. Remove the batches that contain the faulty batteries and show some respect for your customers",

I really liked everything else about them...but just not not quite big enough, and I can't move my ears, so back they (the headphones) went.

Range is also excellent - I can wander around the gym, easily 30 feet, connection stays strong. Sound quality excellent, easy to wipe down when sweaty.
