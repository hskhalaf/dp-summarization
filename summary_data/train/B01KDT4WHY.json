The LCDs were very difficult to see during the day and at night mirrors had a weird glare. I decided to try this Mirror because of the advertised super brightness LCD. I was very pleased with this mirror! Don\u2019t waste your money on anything else. The LCD is the best I\u2019ve looked at and have tried. Mirror is auto dimming at night and functions as an OEM type mirror. Looks OEM as well.",

It no longer shows the screen when in reverse, and it doesn\u2019t show temperature or direction anymore either. We are extremely disappointed. Spent $190 on this unit, $80 dollars on a Pioneer camera and install wasn\u2019t cheap either. Now we need to have it checked out to find out why it has stopped working.",

I also plugged the video IN to the mirror into the video out of the head unit. So when a movie is being shown it appears there as well. All options worked and I plan on using this same product on other vehicles.",

Temperature sensor seems to be a really sensitive to ambient temps around engine bay when sitting still and idling. But once your moving, seems to be pretty accurate. There is some adjustment in the software that can compensate some for this temperature. Compass seems to work decent once setup is complete. Follow the directions that come with unit. Auto dimming feature is a really nice upgrade for my 1998 Jeep. Pairing with a decent backup camera as well. The worst part about the unit is the install. Well at least hiding the wires behind the trim panels.",

The reason why I am only giving the rear-view mirror 4 stars is because it sat lower than the factory. I would say a good 2-3 inches lower. Otherwise everything works great!",

She is getting older and needed a safe, easy to install camera system for use in reverse. I chose this based on average reviews, cost, and features. I cannot comment yet on the function of the product. This will be a Christmas gift, so I will follow up with a review once she has it installed and can give me her feedback.",

It fit perfectly on the existing OEM mirror mount on our Toyota Sienna and looks like a factory install. My only negative comment would would the setup is a little un-intuitive and the instructions weren't much help (for example, you have to put the car into reverse to adjust the guides - no mention of this in the manual). That aside it really is a nice product and a great safety feature. Would recommend to a friend.",

I highly recommend this mirror.",
