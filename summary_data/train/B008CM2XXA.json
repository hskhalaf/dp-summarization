I'd buy another one right now if I needed to. I probably will in the future for my garage. I got some tools that need sorting.",

This product arrived in excellent condition except only that one of the rubber attachments that \"soft lock\" the drawers upon closing (not the rear locking mechanism that operates using the key) had separated during shipping. I emailed the company, and I was immediatly emailed short instructions on how to resolve the problem. The chest is beautiful, rugged, and operates smoothly. Customer service is prompt and efficient. I highly recommend this Salon Cart for any grooming shop or mobile grooming van. This Viper Cart is totally professional looking, and I look forward to many years of trouble free service. Michael",
