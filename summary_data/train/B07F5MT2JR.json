I wear them as my standard work/office shoe now after years of wearing New Balance. NBs are also known for their wide-set bunion-friendly profile, and that was fine enough until I turned 40. After going through a half-dozen different shoes and having my bunions get progressively more painful, I stumbled onto these and - voila! - all my problems were solved.",

I took them on a fishing trip where I would also be white water rafting and these were awesome. They are super comfortable on dry land or in the water. They also dry relatively quickly if you take out the insole. I just bought another pair in a different color. I'm loving them.",
