There was absolutely no damage to my device but unfortunately, that meant that the case was the one that took a beating. So it didn't last me one year but as you can see, that was my fault. I already bought a replacement case from the store (more out of immediate need) but if i had the time, I would order this again.",

Unfortunately, the rubber coating chipped off after the first time I dropped it. My cases usually last about a year before they\u2019re damaged and I need a new one. I paid a little more for this one thinking this wound a nice durable and low-profile case. Really a let down. Edit: I am now awaiting a new case. Seller reached out to me regarding these issues stating it\u2019s a rare occurance and has shipped me a new case, free of charge, to try again. Will update once again if case holds up to my expectations!",
