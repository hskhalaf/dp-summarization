I didn\u2019t buy them for pain, my dog is 2 and in very good condition - we bought them because he has dry skin and the occasional stomach problem and they seemed to have helped quite a bit! He itches less and has less dandruff!",

And to just give away the ones I have. She said Zesty Paws has a 100% money back guarantee. So I didn't even have to go the usual Amazon return route. Wow. She was so personable and so nice.

The dog takes these as if it were his favorite treat. I've gotten other products only to have them spit out. There is nothing bad to be said about this company.",
