      "text": "We bought the the frosted Model a few weeks, ago, and had it installed. We are very happy with this purchase for a few reasons. First, if you look at one of the pictures, look at the rollers, no more Soap scum, the two doors slide very easily and lock with a magnet, which I think is a very nice touch. It's very sturdy, and looks classy. I'm not one for the traditional sliding door, so I was very glad to have found this product, plus the No Soap Scum on the bottom is a pet peeve of mine.",

My brother and I had this installed in 4 hrs, yes very proud of ourselves. it fit and works perfect. I finally have lots of light in my shower, I put a white clingy plastics film on portion of the outside of the doors leaving a 5 to 6 inch gap at top; for some privacy.Its beautiful, so happy.",

We feel that this door was very reasonably priced with great reviews. My husband and cousin were able to install it on their own in one afternoon and it\u2019s perfect! We love it! And the doors are magnetic so that was a nice surprise! We did have some issues with leaking in the beginning but we added more caulk and that did the trick! I think that was more on our end though and not the door. Overall very happy!",

The problem is after it\u2019s cut to size, there\u2019s little or no space left to properly seal the bottom and sides because it goes in as one big piece. After caulking the edges several times, it still leaked. Had to totally remove the entire enclosure, disassemble and slightly trim all three edges, then reinstall with lots of extra silicon. The totally time was maybe 16 hours, but with hindsight and better instructions, should have only taken half that time. Looks great, but a real pain to install.",

The quality of the unit appears to be very good. Cleaning the glass is simplified by using Cleaning Vinegar and a wiper. No water escapes through the door.",

One thing they don't tell you is that if your tub unit has a slight curve at the bottom of the opening you will have to file the metal corners of the rail to get it to fit properly! It is a 90* angle at the bottom of the track, so unless you have a 90* corner, be prepared to make an alteration by filing the metal...after all that it looks great!",

I got the door in December, but my plumber wasn't available when the door arrived, and then I was out of town for several months before getting back to have the door installed. Today my plumber was installing the first panel of the door into the frame, and it shattered in his hands. He has installed many doors before like this before, and this has never happened to him. I waited until over 60 days after the door was delivered, so I am unable to return the door.",
