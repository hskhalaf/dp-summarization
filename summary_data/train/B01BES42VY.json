Also Jansport has a lifetime warranty so if anything happens (knock on wood) I have that just in case! Worth the $$$!",

Your products used to be so good, but this thing is really cheap. I will never buy another one of your products again. I am sending it to the warranty center, but now I have to spend the extra $ to buy another backpack while I wait for you to do something about your crummy product. Shame on you for making such a cheap product, and for charging so much for it.",

There is so much room in the section for a laptop. I can fit at least 2 2\" binders in addition to the laptop. There are so many pockets and the key clamp is so helpful. The best part is the telescopic handle is the perfect height for me. I am 5'6\" tall. It doesn't hurt my back to walk with it. Thank you, Jansport!",

The placement of the bar that is connected to the pull-along handle is in the center of the bag. It feels hard and also reduces the stuff that can be in the bag. I feel that my regular backpacks of comparable size hold more stuff. The computer pouch/sleeve is very tight and a 13 inch laptop sticks out on top.",

I almost forgot, but one more thing I like about this back is that it stands upright and doesn't fall forward when loaded with books.

      "text": "I was in the market for a new computer bag and I also needed a bag for school and work. My current bag was putting a major strain on my shoulders and I wanted to get a rolling bag that didn't look too business. When I first found the JanSport bag I was thrilled, it was sporty, had wheels, and looked well built. After 4 monthes of normal use, the retractable handle is BROKEN! I plan on writing a letter to the company to let them know of my disappointment with this product. Buyer beware!",

The handle has multiple levels that it can be set at to accommodate people of different heights. It has the ability to hold a great deal of things. I can load up books and supplies for class, as well as food, and I still have quite a bit of room. The wheels are very sturdy. I would highly recommend this product.",
