My old camera was damaged in a fall over a year ago... and worked but not well, and the flash was damaged so couldn't take indoor or nighttime photo's anymore.

    "title": "Nikon D60 DSLR Camera (Body Only) (OLD MODEL)",
    "description": "Nikon D60 10.2MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n Are you looking for a real digital SLR that\u2019s easy to use? Do you want mobility without sacrificing capability? Would you like simple operation and enough features to step forward creatively? If so, then get to know the Nikon D60. Now you can experience the best of both worlds: enjoy one-button simplicity with Auto, or try many exciting levels of creative control. There is room for everyone to explore the thrill and magic of photography. Have fun, and don\u2019t worry -- it\u2019s a Nikon. \n\nBuilt on 90 years of optical expertise and decades of award-winning camera designs, the Nikon family of cameras covers every type of picture-taker -- from seasoned professionals to travelers on vacation. The D60 is the latest example of Nikon innovation, transforming complex technology into a fun, powerful and easy-to-use camera. Nikon delivers the cutting-edge technologies you would expect from a digital SLR -- fast response, creative versatility, and breathtaking image quality -- while eliminating complications and frustrations so that taking pictures is enjoyable and stress-free. With 10.2 megapixels, the D60\u2019s image sensor delivers high-resolution pictures with rich, faithful color and detail that are ready for stunning enlargements. It also gives you the freedom to crop pictures exactly as you want them. And with Nikon\u2019s 3D Color Matrix Metering II, you can expect beautifully exposed pictures under almost any lighting condition, with Nikon\u2019s original digital image processing concept, EXPEED, comprehensively optimizing your pictures, shot after shot. \n\nNikon D60 Digital SLR Highlights \n\nNikon Integrated Dust Reduction System Dust in front of your camera sensor can mean distracting spots on your pictures. That\u2019s why Nikon does everything to ensure clear pictures, including minimizing the build-up and appearance of dust. Nikon\u2019s exclusive Airflow Control System is one of the two main protections against dust. It leads air within the mirror box towards small ducts near the base, preventing internal dust from settling in front of the image sensor. The D60\u2019s second form of defense is the Imaging Sensor Cleaning function, which was originally built for the D300. Every time you turn the camera on or off, this function uses vibrations to steer dust away from the optical low-pass filter in front of the sensor (deactivation and manual activation are also possible). Nikon engineers have also dealt with dust and other tiny particles in many other ways to prevent such image degrading material from attaching to the filter or being seen by the sensor when you are taking pictures. With all these measures in place, you can concentrate on getting the shot while exploring the wide array of Nikkor interchangeable lenses that a Nikon digital SLR opens up to you. \n\nRich, Smooth Detail with Active D-Lighting Sometimes, even a perfectly exposed scene will not render an ideal photograph. With difficult lighting conditions, important details can be lost in the highlights and shadows. But with Nikon\u2019s Active D-Lighting, the D60 can correct these exposure issues instantly and automatically, while you shoot. Simply set Active D-Lighting before you start shooting. Active D-Lighting is available when \"Matrix\" is selected for metering. \n\nEye Sensor The Eye Sensor activates every time you look through the viewfinder, turning off the information display on the LCD for comfortable shooting. \n\nCompact, Light and Comfortable The D60 is compact, light and ready to go wherever life takes you. The D60\u2019s size is not the only factor to consider; its shape is ergonomically designed to fit in your hand naturally and comfortably. Nikon\u2019s experienced engineers know that operating a camera shouldn\u2019t distract you. That\u2019s why each button and texture on the camera\u2019s exterior has been carefully considered for the most efficient and fluid operation possible. \n\nThe D60\u2019s bright, clear optical viewfinder is also designed with the user in mind, its helpful indicators and intuitive icons helping you achieve ideal composition with the optimal settings. \n\nNikon\u2019s Intelligent Built-in Flash -- Simply Brilliant Proper flash lighting used to require skill, time and patience. With the D60, however, flash photography is simple, instant and accurate. Thanks to Nikon\u2019s cutting-edge i-TTL flash technology, all the complicated calculations happen automatically, giving you balanced flash illumination under almost any conditions, even difficult lighting situations such as backlit subjects. With Auto mode, you just point, shoot and let the camera do the rest. It\u2019s that simple. \n\nDisplay Format Options The information display in the 2.5-inch LCD monitor lets you check essential camera information quickly and easily. Choose whatever display format fits your taste best: each of the Graphic and Classic formats have three color variations to suit your preferences, while Wallpaper uses one of your own pictures as the background. Graphic format uses visual displays to show shutter speed and aperture, as well as the mode dial every time you turn it to a new setting. The D60 even recognizes whether you are holding the camera horizontally or vertically, and then automatically displays camera information on the LCD monitor accordingly. \n\nIntuitive Menu Navigation The D60 lets you alter settings and functions in many ways. For all the choices it offers, the menu is still amazingly simple and intuitive, with navigation made easy thanks to a carefully considered design. If you are ever unsure about a specific feature or function, simply press the O button for detailed information. It\u2019s like having an onboard instructor to answer your questions. The D60\u2019s convenient assist images help you select appropriate camera settings. These useful reference images help explain the effect that each function has on your photos -- very helpful for exploring new features and making the most of the camera. \n\nCreative shooting is just a quick turn away With the D60, you will always be prepared to shoot a wide variety of subject matter. Just turn the mode dial to fit your shooting situation and beautiful results are yours instantly. \n\nQuick responses, captured moments Amazing moments can pass by quickly, but the D60\u2019s fast 0.19-second startup, split-second shooting time lag and fast, accurate autofocus capture more of these moments with precision. The camera\u2019s high-speed continuous shooting also helps capture fast-moving action at up to 3 pictures per second for as many as 100 (JPEG) pictures. \n\nA wide variety of in-camera Retouch Menus Even after a picture is taken, the D60 offers ways to explore your creativity further. With a wide range of options to choose from, the quick, simple and extensive Retouch Menu allows you to create a duplicate image with amazing photo effects, leaving the original picture intact. And it\u2019s all done in-camera -- without the need for a computer. \n\nThe right touch -- Quick Retouch Sometimes you want to make sure that your picture has the best balance of contrast and saturation. For this, choose the Quick Retouch feature. It creates an automatically retouched copy that has been optimized for better-looking pictures. \n\nOriginal animation -- Stop-motion Movie Want more fun out of digital photography? Try making a stop-motion movie from a series of consecutive pictures. Simply select the first and last frames from a sequence of shots. You can easily re-edit before saving it as a movie by changing the starting image or removing specific images. There are also several size and frame rates to choose from. \n\nExpect much more from your pictures -- In-camera NEF (RAW) Processing Nikon\u2019s NEF (RAW) format lets you enjoy an incredible amount of creative freedom and control over camera settings -- even after the actual shot is taken. If time is tight or you are unsure of which setting to use, it\u2019s even possible to shoot first with NEF (RAW) and make adjustments later. That\u2019s right: you can take pictures, and then change the image quality, image size, white balance or even exposure compensation. All operations are quick, simple and do not require a computer. \n\nExplore further -- Filter Effects The D60\u2019s Filter Effects let you experiment with color and light. Each of the Red/Green/Blue Intensifier effects let you enhance the color of your choice. Try the Cross Screen feature to create starbursts radiating from scene highlights. For other options, use Color Balance to modify the entire image, or experiment with Skylight and Warm Filters. \n\n\n\nREVIEW FROM DPREVIEW.COM\n\n\n \n\nLearn more about this camera\nat DPReview.com Nikon D60 Digital SLR: Highly Recommended by dpreview.com \n\nThe D60 is the third incarnation of Nikon's compact, user-friendly entry-level SLR line that started back in 2006 with the D40 (which replaced the first Nikon 'starter' model, the D50). The original D40 was a hugely important camera for Nikon and can be given a lot of the credit for the resurgence in Nikon's fortunes at the volume end of the SLR market (which had been totally dominated by Canon since the launch of the EOS 300D / Digital Rebel). The D40's success (which continued long after the D40X made its swift appearance only 6 months later) isn't hard to explain; it was keenly priced, nicely designed and built and capable of excellent results. It was also a camera that proved cameras do not sell on megapixels alone (even at launch its 6MP resolution was far from 'class leading'). \n\nThe D40X, which was positioned as a premium alternative to the D40 rather than its replacement, didn't mess around with the formula much at all; a new sensor with more (ten) megapixels and a lower base ISO, plus a slightly higher continuous shooting rate. The D60 is a direct replacement for the D40X (the D40 will stay around for a while as Nikon's budget option), and once again it's not a major upgrade; the sensor remains the same (though now has a dust reduction system) and the external design is almost identical. There's a few new features, including the same Expeed processing 'concept' seen in the D3 / D300, Active D-Lighting, an eye sensor (to control the screen display), and some tweaks to the interface, but perhaps the most significant change isn't to the camera at all; the move to an optically stabilized version of the kit lens. Auto Focus only for AF-S or AF-I lenses \n\nAs with the D40 and D40X, the new D60 doesn't have an built-in focus drive motor which means it can auto focus only with lenses which have their own drive motor (AF-S and AF-I lenses). The lack of a drive motor can be seen by the missing mechanical focus drive pin on the lens mount (see images below). One of the D60's new features is an electronic rangefinder to help manual focus on non AF-S / AF-I lenses. \n\nNikon D60 key features  * 10 megapixel DX format CCD (1.5x FOV crop) \n * Nikon EXPEED processing 'concept' (as per D300, D3) \n * 3D Color Matrix Metering II, 420 pixel sensor \n * Multi-CAM530 three area AF sensor \n * New Image sensor cleaning system \n * Eye sensor (turns off LCD display) \n * ISO sensitivity range 100 - 1600 plus HI 1 (3200 equiv.) \n * 3.0 fps continuous shooting*, unlimited in JPEG \n * No status LCD, LCD monitor based status / settings screens (now rotates) \n * Help suggestions on LCD monitor (eg. scene too dark, try using flash) \n * Large 2.5\" 230,000 pixel LCD monitor \n * Short shutter lag and viewfinder blackout \n * Support for SDHC (SD cards over 2 GB in capacity) \n * In-camera retouching: Quick Retouch, D-Lighting (shadow / highlight enhancement), Red-eye reduction, Trimming, Monochrome, Filter effects, Small picture, Image overlay, Raw processing, Stop-motion movie \n * USB 2.0 with PTP and Mass Storage device support \n * Very compact, light body \n * Improved menu user interface \n * EN-EL9 Lithium-Ion battery (7.2V, 1000 mAh) \n * New stabilized AF-S DX 18-55 mm kit lens \n\nDifferences compared to the D40X  * EXPEED processing \n * Image sensor cleaning system with Airflow control system \n * Automatically rotating user interface (for using camera vertically orientated) \n * Stop motion movie function \n * New stabilized kit lens (AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR) \n * Eye sensor \n * Electronic 'rangefinder' for manual focus \n * Active D-Lighting with dedicated button \n * In-camera Raw processing \n * New JPEG retouch effects (Cross Star and Color Intensifier) \n\n*Slower with noise reduction enabled \n\n\u2022 Read more at dpreview.com \n\n\n\nSee more",
