I used the turbo sprayer and it cut right through the dark discolorations down to the paint. The patio looks like new. This electric model cleans as well as the gas power washer it replaced. I didn't have any of the problems some people previously mentioned. At this time I'm very pleased with this purchase. Before ordering the GreenWorks 1951 I checked Consumer Reports online review. It's a CR Best Buy. I'll update this review in one month if I have any issues.",

The cord is hard to wind, the water tube is a hassle, the attachments are very hard to get on and off.

It will clean a concrete patio without a problem. I tested it on some vinyl siding and it did no damage. I was able to clean my vinyl fence in no time. I am very happy with this. I would not recommend this if you have a big job such as power washing an entire house.",

That allows you to plug into horizontal and vertical outlets. Mine arrived with the GFCI as part of the plug, so only can use vertical outlets.
