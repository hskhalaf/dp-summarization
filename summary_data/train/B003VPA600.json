Also, Velcro on the straps means I have to be sure to keep the sandals away from dog hair and excessive gunk.

Several people answered, advising me to go with the size 9. I followed their advice, and am very happy to report the shoes are a perfect fit. The day they came I put them on, expecting to wear them an hour or so to break them in. I ended up wearing them comfortably all day. I am also pleased with the way they look on my feet I totally recommend these sandals.",

The soles look hard, but feel like you are wearing a great pair of cushioned sneakers. Very comfortable for all day wearing around the house or out and about. My only reason for giving these less than five stars is the fact they seem to run a tad large. I typically wear a 9, but I could have easily gotten an 8.5 without having my toes run off the front end. Just the same, these sandals are comfortable and fit securely with the velcro straps at the toes and ankles. I will enjoy them this summer!",
