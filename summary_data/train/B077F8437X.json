One says its thin, one says its thick, one says leaves hair soft and shiny, one says leaves hair greasy, etc. Personally this conditioner left my hair sticky and greasy feeling even when I used very little and rinsed very well. My hair is dry and curly and this made it feel gross and look dull and lifeless. It has no smell that I have noticed at all! Are they packaging different product in each bottle or what?? I have also used less expensive products with much better results!",

It does not weigh down your hair at all, quite the opposite, it detangles and my hair feels light and clean. I will be ordering this product again and plan on ordering the shampoo as well!",
