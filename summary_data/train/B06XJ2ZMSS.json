So after modifying this cabinet and going up instead of wide, I took all my spare parts and made a little bitty cabinet for my slippers and my lunch bag.

      "text": "All my shoes have been sitting in boxes for lack of space in my room and organization, it was easy to snap together although a little time consuming but that's unavoidable. Once put together each compartment had space for many shoes much roomier than I had thought, material is sturdy and easy to wipe clean, design is kinda cute too, not to mention this company was just so incredibly nice, I emailed them asking if I could buy a few spare parts so I could set it up totally vertical and they happily sent them no problem and it arrived quickly too, 100% recommend",
