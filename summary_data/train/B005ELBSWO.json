A lot of the harddrives I work with in my studio have to be plugged in the wall just for power but this one doesn't. It helps save a lot of space and makes the studio more organized. The transfer rate is pretty fast too. I'm just waiting for companies to start making Thunderbolt Harddrives. But that probably won't happen for a while. Now, if Mac's only had USB 3.0 then I would've bought another drive. But since firewire 800 is the only fast transfer peripheral device, I'd say that his harddrive is well worth the money.",

Everything is moving to either USB3 or Thunderbolt and even Apple is starting to abandon Firewire, but I still don't have a USB3/Thunderbolt enabled Mac. Anyway, the WD Passport is a solid choice. It's well built with an aluminum enclosure. For a portable drive it's fast. According to BlackMagic Speed Test I'm getting 67MB/s write and 69 MB/s read. The drive also has a USB2 connection but it's not a standard mini-b connection which is annoying. I rarely ever use the USB connection anyway so no big deal. The USB transfer was noticeably slower at 28MB/s Write 36MB/s read.",

      "text": "I resorted to doing my Time Machine backup after delivery of the WD My Passport Studio portable drive using the enclosed USB vs the Firewire cable. The reason; there is not a Firewire input port on my new iMac. I had to order a Firewire to Thunderbolt dongle from Apple so that later I can continue to use the WD Passport drive ported to the Thunderbolt port. For some reason Apple did not design the new Macs with the Firewire input. I guess I will live with this, but when you add in the cost of the dongle, it jacks up the price to go to Firewire by another $30. Otherwise the external drive seems fast and a good deal.",

Finally, as a nice touch, the WD drive is designed for Macs and the aesthetics fit right next to a Mac. Definitely recommend this unit if you want 1 TB of extra storage (I assume the other sizes are just as good).",
