I received grill without any issues and no damages. It was simple to assemble in less than 45 minutes. Used it about a dozen times and cooks evenly and heats up fast. It is also easy to clean compared to other grills I've had in the past so that was a nice experience. Perfect product at this price point and would definitely purchase again. I'm receiving a free scraper for this review. I would still give it five stars without a scraper.",

So I tried this this Cuisinart hoping it would last longer. Cuisinart is poorly designed. Highly undependable spark starters on each burner takes many attempts for each burner. BTW, why have a sparker on each burner?. The heat output at maximum is about 60% of the Charbroil grill. I can't cook effectively on this. And BTW, this has occurred with 3 different propane tanks. It has been another couple of months, I'm putting it on the curb. What a poorly engineered piece of junk.",

Put a few fireplace bricks on the tray and you're good to go. This grill is basically like all others in the $100-200 range...cheaply made and will likely last 3-8 years.",

It really takes 2 people to assemble it-some pieces need to be held while the other person is assembling it. Then too, you can pay extra to have the grill assembled. We had never assembled a grill so it did take us a couple of hours putting it together-learning experience. The flavor of the food is worth the extra work and value.",

Multiple times. It was a struggle to keep this thing lit, which might be due to the windy day and the huge gap in the back. You can easily get a better grill from Charbroil for the same price, and I would not recommend this to anyone.",

It took me a few hours to put together, which was a bit of a pain. The fact that it was damaged and a bit bent out of shape prevented some of the holes from lining up- I had to re-bend it. Still, I got through it and it works fine; I deemed that easier than trying to take it all apart, repackage it and ship it back.",
