Couple these with durability, a reassuring toe strap, and a healthy selection of colors, and wearers got themselves a fine hiker. However, users didn't like its cumbersome build and annoyingly time-consuming, adjustable straps. People also felt misled by its inconsistent sizing. In conclusion, Chaco\u2019s Z/2 Classic has a lot going for it that tries to outshine the seemingly huge shadow of flaws casting over it.",

These are also smaller per size than the Chacos I purchase from REI, not a big deal since they fit me but odd.",

Putting them on was no easy task for me either - especially this style (on my size 13 feet). And I didn't like the big toe wrapping strap design. Once on, they did not feel secure... too many straps going in all directions! ;-) I'm sure other styles work fine, but I returned them and went for a pair of Tevas with a simpler and more sturdy design.

If I snug up to fit my foot without cutting off blood flow, I have 4 to 5 inches of loose strap that drags to the outside of each foot. Had to superglue some Velcro on the heel strap and tag end to keep them from underfoot. Very unstable when foot is wet. Starts unsafely sliding around underfoot in grass dew. Wanted them for the beach and activities like washing the car. Have to set that aside for safety.",
