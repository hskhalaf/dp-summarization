To begin with, it lacks a on/off switch therefore the only way to turn it on or off is to plug and unplug the power, this is kind of clumsy. Secondly, there is no temperature control. Once the container of food reached the desired temperature, the oven cannot be turned down to prevent the food from overcooked. For that reason, if green veggies are left for too long, they will turn brown. Finally the case is really low quality. It is very flimsy and insulation is next to nothing.",

I was a little questionable.) He works in TV and spends most evenings at \"live shots\" away from an office microwave or even fast food some nights. With this item, he actually eats leftovers. Pops them in and can eat a warm meal out in a blizzard if he has to. It's pretty amazing technology and has kept the husband fed for almost 2 years now!",

They sent me a replacement pad telling me it wasn't supposed to have done that. Those guys stand by their product. I will buy again from them.",

My go to so far is a frozen chicken breast and frozen broccoli in a pyrex dish with lid. Cooks perfectly in a few hours, and is delicious and healthy, and way better than reheating the same thing in the microwave...plus requires pretty much no advanced prep (except for remembering to plug it in a few hours before lunch).

Heating food generally takes approximately 45 minutes to an hour. So, I sometimes plan a workout around the wait time or just relax. The HotLogic is not a microwave, so with that in mind, I don't let the wait time bother me.",
