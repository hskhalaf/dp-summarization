They will charge you and end up concluding it is your gas line. Google it. Look it up. Hundreds have this problem. A class action lawsuit is being investigated. Check it out for yourself, don't have to take my word for it. This oven is garbage, and a waste of almost $1,000!",

    "description": "The Samsung NX58H5600SS 30 In. Freestanding Gas Range with Custom Griddle and 5.8 Cu. Ft. Convection Oven, in stainless steel, combines the power of a gas-powered cooktop with the speed of a convection oven. Five gas burners range from 5,000 BTUs to 17,000 BTUs and include a large, oval-shaped center burner perfect for casseroles and other large dishes. Three cast iron grates lift easily from the cooktop surface to facilitate quick cleaning in case of spills and boil overs. The convection fan system is great for baking and broiling because heat is distributed thoroughly and food cooks evenly. Plus, this range comes with a custom-griddle designed to fit perfectly over the center burners so you can cook a variety of delicious foods at once.",
