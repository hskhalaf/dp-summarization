      "text": "We have been using a laptop for years and now I have this fantastic PC I wonder how on earth we have managed so long without something like this. The set up is very easy and I find it intuitive to use. Love the fact it is a space saving device and that if we wanted could move it to another room and use it on wireless mode. I find it quiet to use and the sound is pretty good too. I'm very glad that we spent the money and purchased this -a great home PC.",

Disappointing, but then again, motivation to get a decent wireless keypad and mouse of the calibre one would expect with the overall package. This certainly diminishes my enthusiasm regarding this purchase.",

    "description": "The Lenovo C540 features a space-saving slim design that will look good in any room. Click here to see a larger image. LENOVO C540 ALL-IN-ONE DESKTOP PC\nA PERFECT BALANCE OF PERFORMANCE AND AFFORDABILITY\nThe Lenovo C540 is one of the most affordable 23\" All-in-One PCs available. With a 3rd generation Intel Core i3 or Pentium processor, this PC's performance is better than most in its price range. Great for email, video playback, the C540 also comes with Lenovo Assistant - an easy to use interface to organise your favourites, clean up history and junk files, and manage the PC's network connections and energy consumption. Plus, smart features like Lenovo Dynamic Brightness System and Lenovo Eye Distance System ensure that the C540 is comfortable to use, even for long periods.\n\nCOMFORTABLE\n23\" FULL HD SCREEN WITH BUILT-IN ENTERTAINMENT\nFeaturing a 23\" LED-backlit Full HD widescreen display and cinematic 16:9 aspect ratio, the C540 is great for enjoying movies and videos without eye strain. Having trouble locating the DVD reader/writer drive in such a slim design? It's built right into the side of the PC - giving you easy access to watch your favourite movies as well as back up your files.\n\nADJUSTABLE SCREEN ANGLE\nYou don't always use a PC on your own at a desk, so the C540 comes with an adjustable screen angle to ensure viewing is comfortable whatever the lighting conditions, even if you're sharing the screen with other family members.\n\nYou can customise the Lenovo C540 to adjust the display brightness to protect your eyes, and warn you if you're too close to the screen. Click here to see a larger image. LENOVO DYNAMIC BRIGHTNESS SYSTEM\nThe Lenovo Dynamic Brightness System protects your eyes by automatically adjusting screen brightness based on ambient light conditions. This system is user customisable, it can be set up to automatically power off the display to save energy when the user is away and it is auto run at startup.\n\nLENOVO EYE DISTANCE SYSTEM\nThe Lenovo Eye Distance System alerts you if you are too close to the screen. Fully customisable, simply select the distance you want the system to alert you at and a pop-up box will appear when the C540 determines you have moved too close.\n\nSUPER SLIM FOR SMALL SPACES\nThe C540 desktop's all-in-one design makes it perfect for small spaces: university room, busy kitchen, bedroom, studio or other cramped quarters. The compact C540 combines the traditional tower desktop, screen with built-in camera, speakers and microphone into one slim unit. Also, fewer components and cables equal a tidier and more compact workspace.\n\nThe minimalist dimensions of the C540 allow for setup and use anywhere, while the intelligently-designed aluminium stand is sturdy but takes up little space. The stand design also provides space to slide the keyboard and mouse under the display, allowing you to keep your desk or work-surface uncluttered when not in use.\n\nThe Lenovo Assistant is an easy-to-use interface that's designed to keep your PC clean, organised, and running efficiently.

The HD webcam will capture and stream video with greater detail and truer colours than standard webcams, perfect for recording videos to upload to social media site, or for talking with loved ones.\n\nSIMPLIFIED\nLENOVO ASSISTANT\nOn the C540, you'll find Lenovo Assistant ready to help -- an easy-to-use interface to organise your favourites, clean up history and junk files and manage the PC's network connections and energy consumption\n\nThe Lenovo Assistant is designed to make it easy for you to keep on top of a number of computer tasks, including helping to resolve internet connection problems and select the best power usage setting. It will also help clean your browsing history and passwords, tidy files on your desktop, clean junk files and manage web browser favourites.\n\nONEKEY RESCUE SYSTEM\nYou can rest at ease knowing OneKey Rescue System is there to simplify data backup and recovery, allowing you to focus on using your computer instead of worrying about its maintenance.
