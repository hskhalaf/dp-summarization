I am having a blast getting into photography and improving my skills with it. Then I will look at upgrading to a DSLR camera.",

With this, they always come out in focus. The zoom is awesome. The only cheap thing about this is the lens cap doesn't fit snugly so it falls off easily. I would still buy this camera knowing that, though.",

So far I have been taking mostly super macro of flowers and bugs and they are VERY beautiful. I display them on my computer walpaper slide show and the detail and clarity are beyond my expectations. I have been taking most pictures with camera attached to a monopod which helps stabilize the camera. This camera is very easy to use, seems to have a very good lense. I love it.",

I like the super macro setting, and the mode whre it takes pictures as long as you hold the button down is fun too. As a summary, this is a great camera, especially if you are looking to keep the cost low. :)",
