      "text": "I very much liked it when I first started to use it. However it stopped working after a few weeks. I never put anything in it other than distilled water so clogging wasn\u2019t the issue. Upon further inspection I found a gap in the seal where the wires connect on the top where the water comes out of. Im sure this caused water to condense inside and caused the motherboard to corrode as you can see from the images im uploading. Also i see there is no real water proofing where you connect the power so it looks a little corroded in there as well but the power supply is still there because the lights still work.",

We can definitely tell the difference especially since now it\u2019s getting cold in NYC and our car heater is on. Before using this humidifier, the heat from the car would make my sinuses feel dry and I had to immediately open a window. It was a constant struggle between breathing smoothly or being cold. This humidifier makes our car rides much more comfortable!",

The humidifier has a sticker that says not to add scented oils or perfumes. Overall, a good humidifier for a decent price.",

Had a family trip that was going to take a while but when the a/c is on in the car it dried out the air and for our new baby that a few months old that was a no go. But with this humidifier it made it so it didn't dry the air so bad in the great. Love this little thing!",
