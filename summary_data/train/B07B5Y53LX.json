This backpack is the perfect size for me. The material is more denim-like than anything, so i was very happy about that. lenses are protected very well and there's enough space for your camera in the top compartment even if you have an attached zoom lens. The handles for the removable storage compartment were a bit cumbersome while in the backpack, but i just tucked them away. Overall a great camera backpack that hopefully lasts me a while.",

The design is with protection in mind, one cannot get to the camera unless the bag is taken off and open from the lower back opening. The top part of the bag is also roomy, and can hold lots of aux stuff such as cleaning supplies or an ipad. I could use it as my main travel bag as well.",

That's just the bottom half. The top half has a separate lined compartment with room for miscellaneous items. Laptop (12.25\" x 8.25\") fits easily in its padded compartment. Side pockets with hefty Velcro closures sure to keep your stuff in the bag, and a few other zippered pouches make this a great all around backpack for an amateur photog like me. Looking forward to the field test.",

I was able to take three bags and put all their contexts into this backpack. Yes it was heavy with the laptop, but condensing my purse, laptop bag and camera bag for travel through an airport was amazing!!",

It would have been better if there was a tad more room or flexibility in these two pockets, making it easier to fit in a Nalgeen water bottle or similar sized container. Otherwise, I quite liked this bag. The camera insert workd very nicely and it was overall quite comfortable.",

You must work through needless clutter to access lens and camera body. The camera storage dept. is incased in a nylon bag with handles. Some might find this helpful. For me, it was more annoying to access the compartment. After removing the camera section, it posed more trouble getting the compartment back into the bag. The bag looks nice and is well manufactured, but the camera angle is more of an afterthought in my opinion.",
