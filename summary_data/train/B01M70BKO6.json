I attempted to remove the Macy's label and what remains is a sticky surface. Now, whenever I sit the palette on a counter top, it doesn't slip. Here's the bright side, the colors are nice and I plan to use it for travel. I only wish that the seller had disclosed this return item prior to my purchase. Lesson learned. In today's bigger picture, let's be thankful we're healthy and have a sunkissed glow thanks to Tarte!",

From the pic you can tell I'm a dark medium/ tan skin tone. The packaging was actually pretty secure. The palette was a little dirty from product, but no biggie.
