I shall see if it can withhold the frequent use of 7 year olds. The yellow \"pole\" in the center is made of rubber so it does not stand upright as shown. The child has to pull up on the handles as they jump. This makes it easier to store. It is very lightweight and will be great for bringing back and forth from recess.
