IT is much easier to install the software on a computer without existing Kodak software. Yes, you must mark the photos as favorites to transfer but it is really simple from there. The photos are crisp and clear so far as we only have about 20 trasnferrred. HIghly recommended toreplace the old brag book and bent envelope!",

It is relatively simple, compact, lightweight, and picture display quality is quite good, though 2.5\" is just barely big enough. A similar unit with a 4 inch display would be welcome. It reads SD cards without problems. Transferring photos with the Kodak easyshare software isn't easy. There should be a provision to just copy the files rather than messing around with \"favorites\", \"albums\", etc. We just copy the pictures directly onto the card and transfer the card from computer to viewer.",

Well worth the money for not having traditional pictures getting ruined in your wallet.",
