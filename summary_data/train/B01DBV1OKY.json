I've tried cleaning the small rubber feet, which helps somewhat, but then they just accumulate dust after a while and start slipping again. So I've had to keep the tablet angled more horizontally.

It shows an iPad Pro fitting perfectly into it with the edges lining up, making it seem like the product is considerably larger than it actually is, as if it\u2019s the size of a regular iMac base. The product is well constructed but it is incredibly small about the size that would be good for a regular iPhone, not a 13 inch tablet. It\u2019s kind of sad because if the product was a little bit larger it would be perfect, but it just doesn\u2019t seem too stable with the full size12.9 inch iPad Pro.",

I cannot speak enough good things about this product. Thank-you The picture above is with the Ipad Pro.",

The only drawback is the Show movement when attempting to use the buttons or touchscreen - like an animal just far enough out on a branch to sway slightly. Not being specifically designed for my purpose, I give it five stars all round.",

Really sturdy, it bends to pretty much whatever angle you want it to. It also comes with replacement pieces in case the rubber parts fall off, which is a nice little addition. It also works as a pretty good iPhone stand, and if you're brave enough, it'll also work with a 13 inch MacBook. The only complaint I have is that I wish it folded flat, you can't really carry it anywhere.",
