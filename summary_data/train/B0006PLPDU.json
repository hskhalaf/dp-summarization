I applied a thin base coat and after the polish I applied 2 top coats( 15 minutes apart so that the polish could dry). My photos were taken 5 days after my manicure and I think they look pretty great. There is a little wear and tear but not like other polishes I have used. There are no significant chips. For this to happen with regular polish , not gel or SND or shellac is amazing. I prefer regular polish to the others. Soya has a life long customer.",
