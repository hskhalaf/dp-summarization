I am not an expert with video equipment or processing it after recorded, but have been happy with the camera and software. I can get it recorded and get it into a format for youtube or my iphone or computer fairly easily. I wouldn't trust it to be very water resistant without the additional case.",

    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\n\nThe Contour+ captures beautiful 1080p video. It utilizes a 170\u00b0 wide-angle rotating lens that delivers a true high quality image that captures all the action with minimal distortion and fish-eye. It records Full HD in all its glory.\n\nPROFESSIONAL STORYTELLING\nProfessional storytelling demands the right tools and the right technology. Designed as our first hands-free camera for the true filmer, the Contour+ delivers both for this advanced segment with expanded capabilities and supplemental features. Packed with the highest level of progression of any hands-free to hit the market, Contour+ is made to capture not only the action but also the full story with depth, focus and clarity. The result is rich video from one camera with all the tools to do the job. \n\n\n\n\n\nCONTOUR+ PRODUCT FEATURES:\nFIELD OF VISION\nStunning footage is what makes the shot and the Contour+ is specifically set up for capturing the perfect visual. The reason is a market-leading mix of tech functions from a six-element glass lens and 1080p video quality to adjustable white balance for dialing in the details of each location. The Contour+ also expands normal perspective with a F 2.8, superwide-angle lens, integrating peripherals and backdrops that get cropped with a narrower focus. \n\nFULLY CONNECTED\nWith all our modern devices, connection is key\u2014so we\u2019ve made the Contour+ the most connected POV camera ever. First up is Bluetooth, which provides filmmakers a wireless viewfinder to check the angle on their phone before dropping in. The camera also connects via an HDMI port, allowing instant replay on a laptop or widescreen direct from the microSD card. The upside is eliminating the lag time of downloads and transfers when checking footage on location or back home.\n\nLIVE ACTION\nAction moves at real time, so why deal with a delay in the coverage? The Contour+ enables live streaming\u2014via HDMI and external transmitter\u2014creating a direct connection to film shoots, event coverage and contest runs. Whether for broadcast or simply building a following, this capability allows filmers and athletes to provide an inside window when the action is happening. No other hands-free can make this claim, so grab this one if you\u2019re headed to the X Games.\n\nCRISP AUDIO\nVideo is only one part of the story, which is why we\u2019ve equipped the Contour+ with an external 2.5mm microphone jack. This crisp audio capability allows you to interview characters from friends and fellow athletes to random people that appear in your shots. And, by capturing dialogue that gets said in the heat of the moment, you\u2019ll add an additional standout quality to segments and stories. It\u2019s a tool utilized by true pros that we thought you might need. Just keep it clean. \n\n\n\n\nADDITIONAL PRODUCT FEATURES\nGPS\nLocation is a central element of any story and the GPS receiver in the Contour+ tracks exact location, speed and altitude while shooting in hands-free HD. The slick feature links personal footage to a specific place and adds interactive depth to your story. \n\nSTORAGE\nRunning short on space is a huge hassle, which is why the Contour+ stacks all your footage on a removable microSD card. Compatible with cards up to 32 gigs, the setup allows an easy swap to a fresh card when you\u2019ve filled the first one to capacity.\n\nSTRENGTH\nWith a burly, water-resistant aluminum shell, the Contour+ is made to take a beating in extreme environments from raging storms to muddy tracks. For full submersion sports add the waterproof case to keep it dry up to 60 meters deep(available summer 2011). \n\n MOUNTS \nDialing in the ideal angle is a critical component to capturing unique footage. Contour+ makes it easy with custom body, gear or vehicle mounts for the full spectrum of sports from shooting and skiing to high-octane motorized activities. \nSee all contour mounts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIDEO FORMATS\nVideo Format Resolution Frame Rate \nFull HD 1080p 1920 x 1080 30 fps To capture those awesome moments in the highest resolution available. Tall HD 960p 1280 x 960 30 fps For those sports like surfing that are better suited to a taller image. Action HD 720p 1280 x 720 60 fps When frame rate is more important than resolution. The perfect setting to capture the fastest action. It reduces blur and rolling shutter effect. Contour 720p 1280 x 720 30 fps When space on your card is at a premium and you need to record that last epic adventure. Still Photo 2592 x 1944 3, 5, 10, 30 or 60 sec When you want to freeze frame the action, the photo mode is your perfect shot. You can pick from 5 rates to best capture that moment. \n\n\n\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX?\n \n\nContour+ Camera MicroSD Card (2GB) Rechargeable Battery USB Cable Mini HDMI Cable \n\nMicrophone Cable Lens Cap Rotating Flat Surface Mount Profile Mount \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMPARE CONTOUR CAMERA MODELS\n\nCONTOURHD Adventure Video CONTOURROAM Adventure Video CONTOURGPS Video Mapping CONTOUR+ Professional Storytelling Instant On Record Switch \n\n\nWaterproof to 1 Meter \n\n\nBuilt in Battery \n\n\nBuilt-in Tripod Mount \n\n\nFlush Front Lens \n\nStill Photo Mode \nLaser Alignment \nLow Profile Design 1080p, 960p & 720p HD Video USB Output Internal Mic 2GB Micro SD Memory Card Included \nRemovable Lithium-Ion Battery \nEasy On Record Switch \nGPS Video Mapping \n\niOS/Andriod Support via Bluetooth \n\nConnect View Compatible \n\nConnect View Card Included \n\n\nLive Streaming via HDMI \n\n\nExternal Mic Jack \n\n\nWide Angle Lens 135\u00b0 170\u00b0 135\u00b0 170\u00b0 Lens Type Four Element Glass Custom Six Element Glass Four Element Glass Custom Six Element Glass Lens Rotation 180\u00b0 270\u00b0 180\u00b0 270\u00b0 Weight 4.3oz 5.1oz 5.2oz 5.3oz Dimensions 95x55x34 mm 100x55x34 mm 95x58x34 mm 98x58x34 mm Included Mounts Goggle Mount,\nFlat Surface Mount\nProfile Mount,\nRotating Flat Surface Mount Goggle Mount,\nRotating Flat Surface Mount Profile Mount,\nRotating Flat Surface Mount(2) Included Cables USB\nUSB\nUSB USB\nMini HDMI Cable\nMic Cable \n\n\n\nCONTOUR RECOMMENDED ACCESSORIES\nCONTOUR BATTERY CONTOUR CAR CHARGER CONTOUR FLAT SURFACE MOUNT CONTOUR PROFILE MOUNT CONTOUR HEADBAND MOUNT CONTOUR BIKE MOUNT \n\n\n\n\n ACCESSORIES FOR EVERY SEASON \n Shop Contour Recommended Accessories by sport: \n\n WINTER SPORTS \n AUTOSPORTS/MOTORCROSS \n MOUNTAIN BIKING \n HUNTING/FISHING \n SURF \n UNDER WATER \n PAINTBALL/TACTICAL",
