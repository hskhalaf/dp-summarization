There is only one fault (not bad enough to not buy it): There is no inside hook or loop for keys. You drop your keys in the bottom, and have to grope through the \"stuff: to find them.

I say so far because I've purchased a couple backpacks (different brand & seller) that ripped a month or two after purchasing. This backpack is great though. Good storage, variety of pockets, strong material, comfortable, etc. So, I'm the laptop pocket is in an interesting spot. It's behind the shoulder straps. Dont mind that but it bulges into the main pocket/pouch of the backup. Also warning! Do NOT get this if your backpack is bigger than a 15.6 otherwise it will not fit. My laptop is a 15.6 and it just fits.",

Other backpacks have a loop for hanging that is stitched to the backpack itself.

I would return the backpack if I could but by the time I realized my neck pain and headaches were caused by the backpack my return window had closed.",

      "text": "I bought this backpack to replace my Janpsport. I wanted something a little more sleek and professional looking. I love how it has dual outside pockets, so I can put my umbrella in one and my water bottle in the other for the commute. The hidden pockets on the inside are just the right size and amount for my thumb drives, mouse, and other electronic devices. I usually carry my laptop (15 inches), wire bound planner, daily reader, toiletry bag, my pencil case, and a small wallet. And I still have room. I'm thinking about purchasing another one just for travel to match my carryon bag.",

Only have a couple of small gripes: the side pockets are not big enough to hold larger water bottles and the built-in Cable for charging should be accessible from the \"front\" Compartment as this is where I Carry the charger/ battery.

      "text": "I travel every week for work and need something that will make life easier for me, but sadly this bag doesn't do that. It's not comfy on the back like a bag pack should be, and my back starts hurting very quickly with this. I don't have this problem with other bag packs so sadly I will have to switch this one out! I wish they paid more attention to ergonomics! Also, I don't think it has enough space, but that's perspective. I have had this for 6 months almost, and it's time to retire it!",

There are pockets for pencils/pens and other small items. The side pocket is the perfect size for a water bottle (even a large one) and misc stuff in the other one.
