I\u2019m comfortable having it in my living room by my desk, rather than hidden in the bathroom with a fan on.

Only caveat for many will be the cost of the maintenance of the box(litter trays). With 2 cats, we're replacing them every 2 weeks, and they aren't cheap... for me, they are worth it, however. Some might disagree, and I wouldn't argue. Research the costs before you take the plunge... I'd absolutely recommend it to a single-cat household, cost-be-damned.",

The amount of litter in the packages was so inadequate for the job that there is no way to know if it would absorb urine if used in a thicker layer. I am left hoping I can find some kind of clumping litter that will work in this machine. The machine seems OK.

      "text": "Got this for my mom who has back problems. Cleaning the litter box everyday was hard on her. After having this for a few months I can definitely say it was worth the money. The crystals only need to be shifted around (to maximize absorbency and scent ) every other day or so, and the crystals we change completely every two-three weeks for our 2, big 15 pound cats. Reaching the third week is a little potent though. We clean the tray and metal rake with cleaning supplies about once a month which makes the box stay pretty clean. Would recommend as long as you are willing keep up with it somewhat (noticeably less than a normal littler box though!",

It scoops just as much litter as it does poo. I honestly don\u2019t recommend this product before just switching your cats to crystals. I would return if still within the return time frame window.

      "text": "We have 3 cats and I needed 2 litter boxes, so I chose 1 of these and 1 of the front entry style. They use this one far less frequently than the front entry. I recommend buying 2 front entry boxes if you need 2 litter boxes. As for convenience, it's the best invention I've come across. The odor is far less, the cats seem much more content and healthy. It's worth the expense if you can afford it.",

    "description": "Style:Ultra| Color:TaupeStrike scooping the litter box off your to do list. With the ScoopFree Ultra Self-Cleaning Litter Box, there\u2019s no scooping, cleaning or refilling your cat\u2019s litter box for weeks. It uses crystal litter that provides 5 times better odor control than traditional clumping litter by absorbing urine and dehydrating solid waste. This low tracking litter also helps keep your floors clean because it is 99 percent dust free and doesn\u2019t stick to your cat\u2019s paws. Safety sensors ensure that the scooping cycle only occurs when your cat is out of box.

There\u2019s even a health counter that tracks how many times your furry feline uses the box, which is a convenient way to detect early signs of a health issue, and the included privacy cover gives your cat a secluded bathroom.
