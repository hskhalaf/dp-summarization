    "description": "Ruff Dawg has created the BEST BALL EVER for dogs with a Lifetime Guarantee. Ruff Dawg Ball is made of heavy-duty solid rubber and measures 2.5 inches in diameter - similar to the size of a tennis ball. Perfect for small to medium sized dogs up to 60 lbs. For larger dogs or extreme destroyers, choose the Ruff Dawg BALL XL (3.5 inch diameter) instead. The Ball is super high-bouncing and can take serious abuse - while still gentle on teeth and gums, so the play can go on and on! This Ball floats for water play and comes in assorted bright neon colors so it's easy to spot in the grass or pool. After January 2017, RuffDawg began to manufacture the Ruff Dawg Ball exclusively in factories in and around Worcester, Massachusetts with a better quality and designed dog toy in neon colors that will float and last. All Ruff Dawg toys are 100% Made safe in the USA of recyclable, FDA-approved materials, free of phthalates, latex and BPAs. Ruff Dawg is a family owned company that has been keeping dogs fit and active with premium quality Made-in-the USA toys since 1998. If you have received one of our previously China manufactured products, please contact us at sales@ruffdawg.com for a replacement.",
