I'm what you'd call an \"advanced DIY'er.\" I don't run a commercial business, but I have a 100-year old house, so I do a lot of work myself. I take good care of my tools. I'm slightly disappointed that the bearings cooked on this, but I don't see a better cordless tool on the market, so I'll likely replace it with the same tool.",
