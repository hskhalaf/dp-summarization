Will see how long the container lasts now that I\u2019ve opened it and only used a little bit, but either way I am happy with the price and quality for what I used it on.",

The Elmer's is a finer consistency and filled the holes better and even stronger. Sanding was easy, too.",

I've tried adding water to get it going again but then it becomes granular when you put it on which defeats the purpose. I recommend that the company make a lid or cover that is easier to keep sealed to prevent its drying out. I won't hold my breath though.",

The Elmer's putty works to fill in all the gaps, even the ones that were about 1/8''-1/4'' wide. It hasn't had to be re-puttied, nor has the putty dried up and fell out.
