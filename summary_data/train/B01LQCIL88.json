I'd recommend doing a bunch of level 1 grit batches first, especially for younger kids. It's the shortest tumble time and will keep the littles intrested. Then once you have a nice batch you can decide which to keep the way they are, which to tumble with level 2 grit and repeat the process for fit 3 & 4.

I have not used it for tumbling rocks so I can\u2019t speak to how well it does that but add a broken bottle and a couple of scoops of sand from the beach and 3-5 days later you have sea glass!

You will need additional grit, as well as plastic beads or other additives for good results. Also, be prepared to spend about a month tumbling for decent results, as will any other tumbler. The rubber tumbler runs cool and quiet however.",

This takes a lot of patient for a kid because it takes weeks for the rocks to get super smooth and shiny.",

We went to Chattanooga last year and he had gotten a bunch of rocks from there that needed to be tumbled. Bought some more grit and starting on the process again.
