Not as trendy as a Herschel, but way better in terms of storage and actual usefulness.",

I was able to fit 7 boxes of Girl Scout Cookies PLUS my notebooks, binder, folder, and planner in the main compartment. (with room left to spare!!) I\u2019m the type of person that overpacks stuff for school, but with my Duel 26L I can overpack and still have a lot of room left. Also, I decided to get Stormy because it wasn\u2019t cloth and I find that when it rains the backpack dries down faster than if it had cloth material on the outside.",

The glasses pocket is small and useless for glasses you actually care about protecting; you can't fit even a small glasses case in their. But you can use the pocket for other stuff, obviously, and I keep my glasses in their case in the front pen pocket.",

That just goes to show you that Dakine makes top quality backpacks. Seems to hold everything from his books, binder, ipad and other things. I would use this one if i had a need for it lol.",

I am disappointed not only because the \"black\" is actually very grey, but because I can't even use this to carry a skateboard! The straps do not get close to tight enough.

    "description": "Pack it all in the updated Duel backpack. The Duel features quick and easy loading in the main zippered compartment, plus a dedicated laptop sleeve to get from one class to the next in a hurry. With plenty of organization features, you'll never rummage around looking for your phone, pens or keys. Load your lunch and snacks in the dedicated cooler compartment strap, your skateboard or jacket into the external carry straps and you're ahead of the bell!\n\nCare Instructions:\nAdventures are messy. If your Dakine bag gets dirty, we recommend hand washing with mild soap (like Nikwax Tech Wash), cold water and a soft bristle brush. If hand washing is not going to do the trick, use a front loader washing machine. To ensure your backpack doesn't get tangled, place inside a pillowcase or mesh bag before washing. Always use cold water, mild soap and run on a gentle cycle. Never bleach your pack. Hang to dry in a warm but shady place, ensuring both inside and out are dry before storing.",
