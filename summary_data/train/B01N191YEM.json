      "text": "My daughter loves it! It's simple enough for little kids to use and play with compared to the bigger version (WowWee Chip) that requires more teh training and apps. This is perfect for little ones who wants their own little robot dog. The size is perfect for little hands too. It has some good weight on it and it not cheaply made. It rolls on carpeted floors!! It doesn't come with batteries, it requires AAA batteries and a small screwdriver to open up the battery case. Easy peasey toy, simple enough but very entertaining and brings a lot of joy to the little kid. No frustration with this one. Daughter loves it very very much! Shipping was super fast!",

Then the whole toy couldn\u2019t do anything but the eyes would lit up and there was sound and music, no movement. Therefore I was truely upset since I had thought for the price, it would have been better quality.",

    "description": "Meet Chippo - your favourite watch doggie. This little black puppy with a gold doggy-bone collar prides himself on being the toughest of the Chippies pack. Chippies are a pack of playful, interactive, remote control puppies that love to show off their many tricks. Pet their heads for different reactions including sniffs, barks, puppy kisses, and even a sneeze! Use the remote control to make your pet dog dance, sing, chase its tail, or tell it which way to roll. Chippies can explore your room on their own, or guard it from intruders using their infrared sensors; they\u2019ll even sing together as a pack! Smaller in size than the original CHiP robot dog, Chippies feature bright LED eyes, posable hind legs, along with playful sounds and animations.\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\n\n\nA Playful Pup of Your Own!

Whether they\u2019re zipping down halls, having a dance party, or exploring their environment, these pups are ready to play at any time of day! \n\n\n\n\nCHIPPIES LOVE YOUR AFFECTION Just like real puppies, Chippies love it when you pet them! They\u2019ll react in adorable ways including sniffs, barks, puppy kisses, and even a sneeze!\n\nTAKE THEM FOR A WALK! Grab the included remote control, and take your puppy for a stroll! You can also make Chippies dance, sing, or chase their tails.\n\nINTRUDER ALERT! Chippies make great watch doggies in guard mode! Red eyes warn intruders to stay away - if they come close, your pup will sound the alarm!\n\n\n\n\nAdopt One Today These puppies are looking for an owner to love and play with them. Choose the puppy personality that\u2019s right for you and bring home a doggie that\u2019s tons of fun!\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Startup Describe your product in 3 words.\n\nFun Robot Puppy\n\nHow did you come up with the idea for this product?\n\nWe thought it would be fun for CHiP to have puppies, so we brought a smaller, remote-control version into the world with some of the same tech and all of the lovability! \n\nWhat makes your product special?\n\nChippies are equipped with WowWee Smart Tech.
