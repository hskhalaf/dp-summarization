I recommend you moisturize you skin very well before applying and make sure you don't apply all at once. Put it on in little dabs around the face then rub in well - initially there will be a cast but let it sit for a few minutes and you'll see that it absorbs very well. If there's still a semblance of a cast just keep rubbing. I recommend an oil as a base (argan in my case) for those with dry skin. But it doesn't irritate and I like how much use I know I'm getting out of it.",

If you\u2019re going to use this on your face, i definitely recommend you mix it with something to make it spread easier. And pat it it, don't rub it around, or else it might peel off.

There is no white cast (I have medium olive skin), and while it is a little bit greasy, it doesn\u2019t make me look like an oil slick (I also have combination skin; oily t-zone). Due to its price, I most likely won\u2019t re-purchase unless it goes on sale. Pros: Works well & is low waste. Biggest con: Price for the amount.",
