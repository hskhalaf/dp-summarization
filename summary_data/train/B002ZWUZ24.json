It's been used inside, outside and kept in storage. The table really holds up in the elements, kids and everyday wear and tear. I wouldn't hesitate to buy hear again.

This lets them eat snacks without getting the furniture and carpets dirty, while waiting for the new kitchen table. Be cautious if the kids cant touch the ground with their feet yet. They can fall if they lean back too far. They should definitely be supervised while sitting. Also this table does not have good traction on tile. It slides around easily on ceramic tile. You can put a mat or carpet under it to help that. Due to the sliding, I give it 4 stars. Overall good product. Affordable price, portable, and saves my carpet and furniture.",

However, I was a little disappointed that the table sways from side to side when my grandson sits down at it or gets up from it. It isn't going to fall or anything like that.

I chose this table because durability and safety was a primary concern with so many toddler/preschool aged little ones. It's not bright and colorful but I needed function and safety. Individual chairs can easily be moved around/tipped, and used for climbing. We use this every day and it's easy to fold and move to another room or out of site if needed.",

The reason for this particular purchase was due to the fact that you can slide in from all sides vs. the child's picnic tables, as cute as they are, prevents a child from sliding in and out, therefore, I felt she would get a lot more use from this open seat style + children would have a bit more seat room..",
