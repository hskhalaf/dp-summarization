GET IT! BUY IT... FORGET about the inside FLAT type forever. PS: Put mine in the window -just to test. Havent even mounted OUTSIDE properly yet - and all \"sifting\", blink-outs, \"no signal\" B.S. - GONE! wow. Cant wait to mount properly, for even BETTER signal. Even rain doesnt affect now! Before? weather a little bad?? Forget about watching TV! very frustrating. With this antenna, even changing channels - MUCH faster now! Like I said... {for jsut $36? BEST DEAL around!}",

I bought a rotor and antenna and every TV channel needed to rotate the antenna because of the multiple reflections from surrounding buildings. I decided to try this Yelaw. It is so good that it never needs rotating; it picks up every channel from one position. It even picks up Fox, which my previous antenna failed to get at all. Love this Yelaw.",

The only real complaint is the remote, you have to be right on top of the remote box and the biggest complaint is the antenna does NOT turn in both directions unless you let it go to the far left or right position before it will turn the opposite direction, so fine tweaking is quite difficult. It was easy to set up and the directions were clear.",

I realize that weather conditions have a lot to do with reception but the new antenna's performance is relatively the same as the antenna that I previously had been using. I think the 150 mile range of this antenna is slightly exaggerated as most of the channels that it received were under the 100 mile range. Other than that, the 8-10 channels that I am able to constantly view without any interference are very clear.",
