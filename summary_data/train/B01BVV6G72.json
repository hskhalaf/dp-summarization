This one suits my needs perfectly....compact...has all the needed features. I had a Nikon ...time to replace....it actually had too many features. Buying this as a package with what you need....is simple and easy....and you are ready to go! All in all...great value...delivered two days with Prime! Life is good even when you get old....keep it simple!!! My career marketing...learned that too many features...more things to fail...best to buy one step above the basic....last longer!!",

      "text": "I'm a 71 year old who has pondered for years whether I should buy a better, more expensive camera although my PowerShot ELPH 100 HS (bought 5 yrs ago) worked well, and my pictures were satisfactory. After hours of research, I was still hesitant to shell out big money due to budgetary constraints. Then, I came across the Canon PowerShot 180 bundle. All I can say is, I'm completely satisfied with this camera, It's a great value, takes wonderful pictures, and has a bundle of accessories included. Run to your computer (or walk) and check out what's being offered! Few purchases please me as much, and I make dozens annually, mostly through Amazon.",

I which it had a little better \"shake\" option - pics very easily blurred. It also has kind of a \"cheap\" feel. At the price range though it's not a bad buy. I just wouldn't by the package - not worth it. If you want a tripod for it - buy seperate - Amazon makes a good one.",
