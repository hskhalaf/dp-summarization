Its midsole is composed of time-tested EVA and HOVR, which is a technology borrowed from the company\u2019s running line. Its upper is made of two-tone mesh, and it just feels great on foot. The fact that this shoe is relatively affordable makes it a really attractive offer that\u2019d be too hard to resist.",
