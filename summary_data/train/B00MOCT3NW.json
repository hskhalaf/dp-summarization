      "text": "The projector was very lightly used. After about 200 hours on the lamp, and a month past the 1 year warranty date, the projector shuts off randomly due to overheating at 70F ambient temperatures. There's no visible dust buildup on or inside the unit. This seems to be a very common problem for BenQ projectors - do your research before purchasing, I'll certainly be veering away from their products going forward!",

      "text": "So, if you want a projector that will work just fine for about a year (200 lamp hours) and then start overheating and shutting down after 20 mins with ZERO support from manufacturer, then this is the projector from you. New bulb - same thing. Tried reaching out to BenQ, like yelling into the wind. Seriously, look up BenQoverheating then try to find support from BenQ. I\u2019ll drop another $800 on a projector but you bet your bottom dollar it won\u2019t be a BenQ.",

Only negative things about is sometimes its fan noise is noticeable.",

It's very bright and easy to set up, it is however very picky about where it's placed side to side. I had to move my original mount to the left about 8 \" and looking at the image I could have probably gone 6 instead. That's what I mean, the previous projector was not that picky side to side, there was enough adjustments to get it square on the screen. The picture is nice a crisp, great detail. As long as you get it centered you're in for a great show.",

One caveat is the lack of HDMI ports - only has (1) but it's versatile elsewhere and if I really need more HDMI's I could buy an external port. My PS4 and Apple TV work seamlessly - I've had 4 people tell me they want a projector now.",
