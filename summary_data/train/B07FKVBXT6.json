It cuts regular grass but struggles to cut crabgrass and other weeds. The battery life is the absolute worst- the first time I used it the battery, which was fully charged, died after about 15 minutes of use.

The WORX WG170 GT Revolution is not quite the quality of my old trimmer, but it's getting the job done, and cost significantly less.

My gas powered weed wacker died after 12 years and so I thought I would give a battery powered one a try. The Battery lasts me 2 1/2 mowings, which is way better than I thought! This weed wacker is 1/3 of the weight, and the edger works awesome, the wheels were a great idea. Down sides are: I wish I could use a thicker line and weed wacking isn't the greatest, used to a bigger head, but definitely worth it.",
