When sitting on this stool your legs are straddled like sitting in a saddle. This reduces your leg reach to the floor. As a hair stylist, I have purchased and used many stools over the past 30 years and never encountered a stool that does not lower to 15 or 16 inches. I am 5' 3.5\" with a 28\" inseam and this seat is not comfortable. I think you would have to be at least 5' 6\" to use this stool.",

The foam doesn't wrap around the wood and the base is skinny just like the one you said not to buy! Also! the handle to move the seat up and down is in the back! So I have to twist my body all the way around AND reach under the seat to move it! It's not a $100 chair is a $40 chair.",
