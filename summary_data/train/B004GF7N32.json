A design that works for people doesn't necessarily function on a walking dog. When we got home from our first walk using this slicker, we stopped by the garbage to toss it.",

But if you choose the sizing based on the dog's length (as I did, purchasing a medium for my dog with a 16\" body) , you will get a coat that is too big around the chest area, even with the adjustable velcro strap. Why can't the manufacturer make a small or extra-small size that has a longer body length??",

If a medium is for a 14-19 inch dog (as is tells you to measure), why is this part of the coat only 12.5 inches when it arrives? That makes absolutely no sense. I was excited to get this, but ultimately disappointed. My sheltie is 13\" at the shoulder, weighs 16 lbs and measures 16\" from base of neck to start of tail and the medium leaves a good bit of her back exposed (approx. 4 inches)",
