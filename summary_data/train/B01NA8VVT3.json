I have had the replacement for 5 months and now this one doesn't print. After a few more hours with Epson they want to send me a 3rd printer. I want a different printer- this one will stop working again in 6 months when it's out of warranty. Epson refuses. The print quality isn't that good when it works, I don't want their junk any longer. I asked for the phone # to corporate and they transferred me to eternal hold.... Terrible printer, terrible experience!!!",

I have had two earlier ones so I got this for my wife when our laser printer suffered a terminal fuser failure.

We especially like the ink uses easy to refill bottles rather than the parade of cartridges most ink jets require. Doesn't do double-sided printing and doesn't have a document feeder but it produces great prints quickly and economically.",

It includes up to 2 years of ink in the box (1). That\u2019s an incredible amount of ink \u2014 enough to print up to 4,000 pages (2), and equivalent to about 20 ink cartridge sets (3). The ET 2650 delivers an unbeatable combination of convenience and value, giving you the freedom to print anything you want in color, without worry. Plus, save up to 80 percent on ink with low cost replacement bottles (4). The ET 2650 features built in wireless for printing from tablets and smartphones (5), plus a 1.44\" color LCD and built in card slot (6). (1) Based on average monthly print volumes of about 150 pages. (2) Included ink bottle yields based on the ISO/IEC 24712 pattern with Epson\u2019s methodology. Actual ink yields will vary considerably for reasons including images printed, print settings, temperature and humidity. Yields may be lower when printing infrequently or predominantly with one ink color. All ink colors are used for printing and printer maintenance, and all colors must be available for printing. For more information, visit our official site. (3) About 20 cartridge sets estimate based on print yields of the included Black and color ink bottles as compared to standard capacity ink cartridge sets for similarly featured cartridge printers as of July 2016. (4) Savings comparison based on the purchase cost of replacement ink bottles and the cost of enough cartridges to achieve the total page yields of the bottles using the manufacturers' online prices and yields for the highest capacity cartridges for the best selling, similarly featured consumer inkjet printers priced at $499 or less per NPD, July 2016. Actual savings will vary based on print tasks, print volumes and usage conditions. (5) Most features require an Internet connection to the printer, as well as an Internet and/or email enabled device. For a list of Epson Connect enabled printers and compatible devices and apps, visit our official site. (6) Adapter may be required.
