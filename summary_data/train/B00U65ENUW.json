I DO sleep better with it and more comfortably, especially in the neck area.",

But the travel size starts out thinner & gets completely crushed under the weight of my head. Useless. I wish I could return it, but I think I missed the deadline. If you're a back sleeper, you'll probably be ok. But a side sleeper will wake up with a crook in your neck. Packingwise, it's still fairly bulky & with mediocre weight savings. You could do better with a blow-up from a camping store.",

Whoever thought it was a good idea to force us to advertise their brand on something that is supposed to be a household good is a distasteful person indeed.",

So, I ordered the travel size and I received it in 2 days. It's just as comfortable as the the standard size. Love it!!!!!!!! I also love the traveling piilowcase that comes with the pillow.. Roll it up and go.....",

I wanted a pillow that could tuck in my neck area and keep me from awakening with a stiff neck.",

The pillow is really soft, yet supportive, making it super comfortable for me. I suffer from some neck pain that comes and go and this pillow doesn't cause me any pain at all. It is so easy for me to fall asleep on this pillow too! I highly recommend!",
