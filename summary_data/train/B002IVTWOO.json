I have used them for moving firewood and other related items since. They are comfortable to wear. They have lots of padding in the palm area, but I wish the fingertips were thicker/sturdier as they are starting to be exposed now. If the fingertips were improved, I would easily give these 5 stars, but have to take one away for how quickly the fingertips wore out. They were also a bit price compared to other options.",
