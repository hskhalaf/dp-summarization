Besides a regular pair of blunt edge tweezers, every home should have a pair of these around for those problems that the blunt edge tweezers just can't handle. The tips are just as sharp as they look so you do want to keep the little rubber tube over them when not in use to avoid accidental sticks. Well made, these are worth the price!",
