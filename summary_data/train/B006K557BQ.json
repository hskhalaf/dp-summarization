I even compared them to a non brand headphone with wood pieces in the headphone and there was no comparison, the non brand headphones outclassed them Sony's. I found that very disappointing.",

I have an expensive pair of Bose noise-cancelling ear buds and although the sound quality is superb there is still plenty of ambient sound that leaks through. These, on the other hand, might even tempt Proust out of the house--the ambient sound elimination is like being in an isolation box. Indeed, it's almost spooky how well these work. As for the sound quality, I'm a big Bruckner fan and his symphonies (especially the Seventh) sounded particularly rich to me. I'm not into heavy bass-driven music, so it is possible that Eminem might come across a bit tinny but then again I'll never know.",
