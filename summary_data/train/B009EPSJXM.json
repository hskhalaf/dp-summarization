The difference is so spectacularly better that I am still in awe and jokingly state that you need sunglasses to watch the bright and high contrast picture. I view my shows on an 80 inch wide screen that lowers in front of my fireplace and allows the ambiance of a fire below and great movies in high def above. A Sony 7.1 amp with video switching rounds out my home theatre experience.",

We are using it almost at its smallest setting 100\" at about 16 feet and it displays a great picture, even during daylight hours.",

Both power and temp light being solid red and the projector is unusable. Called Epson support and they said to ship it to Dallas to get it repaired, which will probably cost more than another projector. AV forums indicate that this projector is known for being bad. Lesson learned and I won't be buying another Epson projector.",

The 3020 has much deeper blacks, better 3D controls and picture, and the overall picture quality seems far superior to the old 3010. In my opinion, this is the best projector on the market for the money. 10/10 would buy again.",

The Epson blows them all out of the water in terms of performance and bells and whistles. No rainbow effect like the DLP technology. I am still learning the features including the 3 D functions.

      "text": "First off, all the good things you've read about the picture quality are true. The picture is bright and beautifully accurate. The real rub with this projector comes from the rattling noise it generates as it adjusts for white balance. I read about it before I bought the projector, but I had no idea how obnoxious it truly would be. It's not always rattling, but any sort of motion or scene change can cause it. In quiet points in movies and shows it will drive you nuts, in loud action scenes you will still notice it. This isn't a quiet rattle. I \"stepped up\" to this from a 720P Mitsubishi HD1000 projector and I am very disappointed.",

The 3D isn't quite as bright as I'd like (the glasses cause it to dim) but It does work well. I still wish it had an optical sound port (I have a Bose system connected to my PS3 with optical and it does sound more crisp than plain old analog). Strait of of the box the image lacks color and is not sharp. Luckily the customization is very detailed. JKB",

The issue is: It makes lot of noise and you hear click click sounds while changing the channels and while watching the movie with low volume. I did see at my friends house who bought the same product and it is not a defect. It is working as designed to work. So my friends, please do not buy this product and look something else. Thanks",
