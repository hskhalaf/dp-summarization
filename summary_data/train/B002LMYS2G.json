My only complaint is that there are only 50 wipes in one packet. We go through them like crazy! Seriously, take the time to look at the ingredient list and to educate yourself about other baby wipes and their ingredients. It's scary what they put in non-organic wipes. It's important that we introduce the safest possible products to our baby's sensitive skin - these are the best option around, hands down. We don't trust any other brand.",

The wipes are strong and soft, they work well even on tough diaper messes, and the scent is awesome (not floral, not artificial). Best of all, they work well for kiddos who have allergies or get rashes easily. There\u2019s never too little liquid, either. Nor have I had a wipe disintegrate on me. The best wipes around, hands down.",
