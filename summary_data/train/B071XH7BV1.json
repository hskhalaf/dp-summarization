I also need a battery base for my Echo 3 but the price is absolutely ridiculous so I'll wait. I haven't tried longevity on this yet but if it does as says I will be happy.",

    "title": "Fremo Evo Plus Battery Base for Amazon Echo Dot 2nd Generation (Black)",
    "description": "Style:Evo PlusThe creators of EVO proudly introduce EVO PLUS. The echo dot continues to evolve at a fantastic pace; however, the one limitation is that it requires you to be tethered to wherever you decide to plug in the device. Nothing kills the joy of having a wonderful device more than feeling like it is leashed to an electrical outlet. That is where EVO PLUS comes in. EVO PLUS allows you to move you echo dot to other areas with ease. Imagine for the next social gathering at your home, being able to move from the living room to the dining room, and then the Patio, without interrupting the music playing. OR simply being able to bring your echo dot from your bedroom to your kitchen, without interrupting your daily flash briefing. Owners know that the echo dot adds a level of convenience to your life, and EVO PLUS brings that convenience to a whole other level.",
