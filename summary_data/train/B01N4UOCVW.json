The Central Perk logo/image is on the front and back of the ornament, and it has a sturdy red handle and red inner lining. The coffee on the inside is swirled with the FRIENDS logo across it. The red ribbon ornament hanger is attached to a small silver ring set just at where the top of the handle meets the cup. This series of ornaments is pricey, but it does make a great gift for a fan of the show.",
