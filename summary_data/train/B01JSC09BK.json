Although two built in cup holders mounted mid stroller and one cup holder for each seat, but no trays. A lot of storage down below.

      "text": "The only problem with this stroller is that it is really noisy. The base plate where the child stands rattles A LOT when no child is on it. I had to take the base plate off because it was annoying me so much. I love the handle height because I am 5'9\" It folds well, but you have to take the seats off for it to fold completely. They are easy to take off so that's not a big problem. My kids are on the larger side and they fit quite comfortably in this stroller",
