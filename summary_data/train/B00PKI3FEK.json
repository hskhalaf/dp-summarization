So you are getting discs that are essentially the same as the name brands \"DX\" line of discs for less than half the cost. Perfect for my family of 6 where we needed lots of discs. Can personalize the blank tops with permanent marker. Can buff out scratches and chips with scraps of carpet. Bag is fine for storing them. Very happy with purchase. Disc weights were consistent between the 3 types: Red Mid Range: 147grams Yellow Driver: 156g Blue Putter: 164g",

This set gave us the most fun round we've had in a long time, and these discs are good enough that they could actually find slots in our regular bags. If nothing else, it was gonna be interesting to play completely blind with these cheap, unbranded, unknown discs, so them being great to play with, even regularly, was a pleasant cherry on top. 5 stars for extremely high bang-for-buck.",

I was looking for sets that my children could use to allow us to play as a family. This was perfect. Who wants to put a $20 disc in a 7 year old's hand - especially in a wooded and rocky course. None of the discs broke and we have used them a few times. We will continue to do so until my girls are old enough and good enough to benefit from higher end discs.",

I was busting long putts left and right. This is a great beginner set.",

The set was affordable enough for us to provide sets for everyone that attended. The only thing that would make them better would be for them to have some kind of labels to identify them as individual sets but we easily solved that with a sharpie.",
