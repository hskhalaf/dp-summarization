Upon placing my daughter in the Jumperoo and switching on the panel it did not work, did the 'reset' option, again didn't work, checked batteries which were okay, then put a multi-meter on the circuit boards and both circuit boards don't work! Seeing I reside in the Philippines I can not get a replacement part or refund as it would cost more to return the item and receive a new one. So, if you reside outside US, don't bother with this product, look for another brand and another supplier/deliverer. Cheers",

This version has updated the footprint from a circle to this triangle shape, and also boasts easily removable polls that allow you to take it apart if need be, or for storage. It arrived well packaged and takes about 5 minutes to assemble (the hardest part was removing all of the protective wrapping from the pieces). We highly recommend!",

      "text": "Our 5 month old granddaughter LOVES it. She is just able to reach the floor so I'm guessing in another month, when she can really jump she will love it even more. My only issue, If you can call it an issue, Is while unwrapping it, I broke one of the strings that hole to little toys to the \"leaf\" covers on top. Those string are so short that I wasn't able to re-attach it. I intend to replace all the string with longer ones so that the can actually reach the hanging toys. But so far, I think this was WELL worth the cost and expect to get much more use out of it.",

She bounces, squeals and laughs, just like we hoped she would! it's not too noisy bec the music can be adjusted, and it doesn't clank loudly when she bounces around. Very happy with our purchase. Adding to first review: 2nd grandchild is nuts over this toy, too! She's only 5 months old, but she bounces for hours of fun. Perfect for that stage when they don't walk yet, but they don't want to lay around or sit in a fixed chair.",

Negatives: The two plastic leaves on the top are very fragile and didnt last long. Wish it had more teethers because my daughter is not very interested in the toys it features.

Her pediatrician said as long her feet are either dangling or able to be flat on the floor, she's fine. Also, that she shouldn't be jumping up on her toes because it can cause her to be a toe walker later on. Just an FYI.... \ud83d\ude09",

Now he really loves it and will bounce and play in it for 30 minutes or more before getting bored. It is a great entertainment tool and exercise jumper also.",

My complaints are that the leaves holding the hanging animals give too much and will break off if played with too much, not ideal for an infants toy aimed at them playing with the hanging toys. Also my other complaint is the upright portion of the stand moves and wiggles as if the connection to the bottom is loose. For the price, I was expecting a better quality and longevity. If those two issues were fixed that I would recommend this jumperoo to anyone, as of now, I recommend with caution.",

The doctor advised that we not put her in there longer than 10 minutes at a time until she was able to pull herself up on her own since up to that time babies use the tips of their feet to push and are not flat footed. I would definately buy this again, although I really don't understand why there is a snack tray on it. Who would put snacks on something that jumps around? All in all 5 stars.",
