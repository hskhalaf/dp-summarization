      "text": "Worked perfectly for us last fall. We had been borrowing a manual extractor and harvesting day had turned from fun to too much work. This gem works great. Half the price of anything comparable made domestically. Quality appears to be more than adequate for the hobbyist with a dozen hives. Will update after we use it fall of 2016. As with all tangential extractors: Spin out one side of frames on moderate speed. Turn frames over and spin out on full speed. Turn back to first side and spin out on full speed. This keeps the foundations from busting out of the frames.",

At half the price of many other motorized ones, we decided to take a chance on this one and are glad we did. We are a small Apiary with only 4 hives. It was so nice to put them in and let them spin. We did bolt it down to a solid table which we had, rather than using the legs provided. This made it more stable and the correct height for us. I arrived in great condition and all assembled except the legs.",

The only thing that we have found is that the legs don't seem to be very sturdy for the size of the unit. We bolted it to 3 6x6 pieces of lumber that we had laying around to help it from vibrating so bad while running. Overall, we are VERY satisfied with this purchase.",

Better to cut the capping off than to roll. I wonder if having the gate underneath, if it would drain better? Unless you take the motor off and turn the barrel upside down, you can not get the last cup or so out. Is it worth it???",

We saw it used to extract several supers and then purchased our own. If you have the space, build a wooden base and affix the feet to it...that eliminates all wobble. We chose to spin the kitchen without the base...so it just took a few extra minutes per load to get the most honey out of the frames. Please with value and function!",

When the motor first was turned on, it worked fine, but the the rest of the product can't actually sustain a quick spin of any sort because the pieces aren't terribly well fit to each other. I knew that might be an issue while putting it together, as a lot of the parts had multiple holes in them and didn't quite fit together perfectly. 2. The motor stopped working pretty quickly. It now spins about one rotation every 4-5 seconds, so obviously can't be used to separate honey. Currently I'm manually spinning it with stick, so it's just a very expensive bucket.",
