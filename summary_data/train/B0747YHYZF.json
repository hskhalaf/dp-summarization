      "text": "Having previously tried bio-feedback training that actively senses and vibrates to warn against muscle tension in the neck and shoulders, I was disappointed to realize that the Upright GO only senses vertical alignment. For that very limited functionality, I don't know that it quite warrants the price tag. Still, it does keep me from slouching to the side as much, and the app is straightforward to use.",

I wore it in the shower, even using a soft back scrubber, before I realized my mistake. It didn\u2019t fall off, and it is still functioning perfectly, although I don\u2019t know why, since it isn\u2019t supposed to be water resistant. I certainly won\u2019t do it again, but I do think it attests to the quality of the product. The case, stickie pads, and charging cable are all top quality.",

      "text": "The upright go actually works. It has a gentle adhesive to stick to your upper back (never hurts at all to pull off) and you set your own posture. You can change the setting based on whether you\u2019re sitting at a desk or up moving around. In training mode, you get a very gently buzz (feels like a phone vibrating) reminding you to correct your posture. Within two weeks my posture had seriously improved- the go can simply track (no buzzing) and my stats improved daily and my back and neck hurt considerably less! Again, highly recommend this for anyone wanting to improve posture. I would purchase this rather than a posture brace.",
