      "text": "This shoe is very comfortable to wear while going for a walk or moderate walking through out the day. However, I needed a new pair of work shoes that would last through an 8-12 hour shift, and these were one of the worst shoes ive ever worn for a long period of time, standing on my feet. The memory foam sole is comfortable for a short while, and then the foam is squished all the way down and i feel like im standing on the hard ground. My heels ached after wearing these to work. One more good thing about this shoe is that the fabric near the toes allows for freedom and movement",

I wear these only for cardio training (I have flat weight shoes for lifting) and am very pleased with them. The only negative is that NB tends to run a bit on the big side - something I knew as a long-time NB wearier and forgot. So I ordered a Wide and they fit, but they're a smidge too wide. Not enough for me to return them, but I don't run or do classes like zumba, etc. If you do and you wear wide, I recommend getting it first in standard size. If you aren't happy, you can exchange them.",

They do not offer enough arch support so not good for jumping jacks and my feet were rolling around in them so not good for squats/lunges. Maybe get a d for weightlifting since they are relatively flat. Also, I wear size 9 in every single brand, in some brands I am a 9W, but, always a 9. However, in New Balance, even 9.5 is too short so I recommend going 1 size up.",

They look great with the pink and black but they are mostly black so the pink isn't obnoxious like many other shoes. They look good with any shade of blue jeans and because they are not big and bulky, they look good with leggings. I'm buying another pair so I have the shoes I love for when they change styles",

So far these fit great and again, the pain in gone ! Also lower back pain has eased down a lot.",
