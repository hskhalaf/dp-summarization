The metal rings for tags and leash clip are durable and securely in place. It is a buckle collar which eliminates one more thing to break.

The collar is too wide for full-time wear, but it's wonderful for taking him for a walk. When he decides to take off like a freight train and defend us from, say, UPS trucks or passing foxes, I'm confident this collar is strong enough to restrain him. The metal buckles and leash ring are also strong. Recommended for your big dog.",

It is also very soft so I do not worry about it digging into his neck if he pulls on the leash. The width is thick, but it looks great. There is the brass closure which naturally hangs underneath the neck and then there is also a brass loop that naturally sits on top the neck, which is great for quickly attaching the leash with no added hassle! I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good quality leather collar for their dog.",

Even for a large dog, it is kind of bulky to wear. Found a high quality leather collar and leash which are Amish-made from a company called Leerburg. Try both and find out yourself.",

The reason I bought the collar was that the collar had no hash dyes or chemicals. The listing contained vital information that others did not, it was clear and gave sizes and product information that I actually received. Especially on the collar inside was soft and padded yet was also strong in materials used outside the collar. I was thrilled to find this collar listed with many of the features I wanted for my pet and was thrilled when I received the collar. I received the collar fast and was packaged well Thank you Van Duffy Products!",

This is the first collar I've found that you can actually kind of see under all his fluff. It's still a little big on him, but he'll grow into it quickly. Previously he wore a collar with a plastic buckle...you couldn't see it on him, and if he pulled a little it would just come off so it was basically useless. I was looking for something hefty, I think this will fit the bill.",

It's a very, very nice alternative to the poly/nylon collars that anyone could find at a pet store, and is super sharp looking. I love that there are two straps for the end of the collar so the end isn't flopping about. Additionally, the ring on the top side of the collar is super strong and great for clipping the leash on.
