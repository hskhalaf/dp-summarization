My service is T-mobile so I'll just have to get used to the AT&T start up. Another thing is I rarely leave rattings for things I buy and bought this phone in the used section category so it was cheaper.",

My phone is allways in power saver mode. I always turn off the gps if i do not use it. i always use my screen at very low light. Do not run so many apps at same time. I love the design. s pen is very good. but my main purpose was the battery life. I may buy note 2 one more time or wait for note 4.",
