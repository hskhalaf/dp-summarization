I later bought a normal thermometer and it read 1.2 degrees less which doesn't sound like much but makes a huge difference in newborns. We always just thought by the time we got to the hospital or doctors office maybe his temp just dropped slightly..but nope it was a false reading that this product gave us.

You don't have to open the app just to take a temperature, which is great because it's already difficult enough to take my temperature when I'm half asleep. Anyways, I'm not sure how well it works for tracking BBT, but as a household thermometer this is perfect.",

Before buying the Kinsa Smart Thermometer, I used the free giveaway which took a long time to show the results. Now I have my temperature within 10 to 15 seconds, not only that, the iPhone app records my reading. It\u2019s a great way to keep track of not only my temperature, but also possible symptoms. It is a great addition to my Smart Blood Pressure and Pulse Oximeter that measures my oxygen saturation level, or the oxygen levels in your blood. In summary a great medical device at a great price.",

I was hoping this would get the temperature in the ballpark to suggest a fever so in case I need to take a rectal temperature (the most accurate way for babies) I can do so based on the initial underarm reading from this. The problem is this is very inaccurate and provides inconsistent readings. Since it's very inaccurate, I can't trust it to provide ballpark temperature so I'll have to do rectal temperature every time based on tactile feel of the child.

Just awful usability during a critical time. The features are nice that you can sync it and the tip is so soft and bendable. I think it would be better for adults or older children who can do oral temps maybe?",
