Next time I will just DVR the show when it comes on regular TV. Would not recommend the show due to length and skipping.",

It was disappointing because the whole concept of the \"Elf on the Shelf\" keeps the young children guessing in great anticipation for Christmas. The movie could've played out the real meaning of Christmas, or of giving, or sharing. In real life at our house, in the final days right before Christmas, our elf was found holding baby Jesus! So even an elf can fit into a religious season.",

Think about it, the elf is there to make sure your children are behaving while it is disruptive???? It's a time piece forever.",

I was brave enough to order it to see if they have Closed Captioned in the back of DVD cover. YES!! It has English Subtitles!! So I reported to Amazon.com that they missed the information.
