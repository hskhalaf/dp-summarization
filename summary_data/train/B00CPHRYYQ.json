Was a little tricky connecting the 2 together once the ceiling portion and the projector portions were installed, had to get the angle just right, and holding a 23 lb projector took several tries. Overall, meets the needs, and will likely suffice for most all projectors within the bolt pattern and weight limit.",

It took me a little while to figure out the right combination of adapters to use but once figured out, worked well. My only other issue is that I was expecting to be able to lock in tightly all settings (tilt, yaw, etc.) but I cannot. The projector does not move by itself but I can easily make rough adjustments even after I made everything as tight as possible. Maybe this is by design? It's not a big deal, though.",

The mount is basic but is does have 3 different adjustment so it projects perfectly on my wall. Instructions were pretty clear on putting it together, there is also a youtube video specifically for this mount. I only wish I had paid more attention to the color I bought. I have a white projector and white ceiling but bought the black mount. Delivery was quick and on time.",

I have a larger projector and the mount gives enough to move the picture off the screen. If you have a fairly stable environment it should not be an issue. If there are objects that might hit it you will have to adjust frequently.",

I had purchased 2 mounts previous to this one, and those did not allow the end user to change the angle of the pitch nearly as much as you can on this mount. Minimal assembly was required to position the mount to the brackets on the projector, but after that mounting to the ceiling was really easy. I have had this for about a month now and love it.",
