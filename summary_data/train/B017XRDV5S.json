You might want a blanket to drape over the seat as sometimes when you rock the base of the chair rubs the back of your leg in just the wrong spot and can cause irritation. As for the people who had issues with the chair breaking, make sure to check the chair for loose connections every so often to prevent those types of issues.",

The seat cushion felt like is was made from 100 year old repurposed car wash sponges. The sections that came preassembled looked wrongly done so, but then heavily glued to compensate; Dings, scratches, splinters, you name it. Save yourself the trip to the Amazon shipping center to return this thing and don't buy this product.",

Updating my review: ten months later both arms have broken off and I've had to replace the cushions after they became too gross looking to bear. The ottoman died a few months back in a toddler mishap. Overall I'm bummed, didn't even last a solid year (or infancy span- now I have to buy a second to use for a couple more months tops).

The seat cushion is a bit stiff, but I imagine it will wear in (and out) after it begins being used nonstop on a daily basis. Assembly looked pretty easy (hubby did it), and it was put together quickly. The price was decent considering how much use I plan on getting out of this glider.",
