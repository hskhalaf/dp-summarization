      "text": "This is a really good game based off of Minecraft. You definitely don't have to be a hardcore Minecrafter to play it, but it is recommended, obviously. Like every other game, it tends to lag depending on how many other programs you have open, but performance is good when you don't have other things running. Overall, a really fun-to-play and user-friendly game. I really love that the characters think of you differently based on what you do/say to them, but that's just Telltale Games doing a great job once again.",
