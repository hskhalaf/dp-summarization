The brown color did not come out in regular wash. I will have to bleach. Not sure what this is. But, if you're not using anything on top, your child will be laying right on this.

      "text": "Amazing travel air bed for our toddler! Our almost 3-yr-old has almost outgrown his toddler bed at home, but this toddler travel bed will fit him for several years. Happy he will still be able to use his favorite crib bedding with this smartly designed mattress, since its inset air chamber fits toddler sheets! He loves having his \"special bed\" with the comfort of his home bedding when we travel to the grandparents', hotels, etc. We love The Shrunks company and their inflatable bed rails as well! So quick to set up, break down and the products all actually fit in their travel bags after first use.",

My kids love them too because they sleep thru the night. Assembly takes about 30 sec. putting them away maybe a whole minute? And no need to use the pump for that. Air comes out very easily as it folds.",

We use it for sleepovers in our bonus room , hotel room, and at relatives homes. It is the perfect size. We have used it for a 14 month old all the way up to a 7 year old!

We live about 700 miles away from our extended family and visit often(3-4 times a year for about a week at a time). My kids are tall so pack and plays were not an option much past age 2. Their toddler bed/crib sheets fit and they blow up in minutes. The bumps on the side keep them in the bed and it rolls up really nice and small. We shoved my 9 year old nephew in it once and he still fit in it so you can really get years out of it. Great product, I couldn't travel without them!",
