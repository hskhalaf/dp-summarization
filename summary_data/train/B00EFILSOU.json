The settings are easy to use. I like that it uses a camera battery and not AA batteries. Other cameras that I have had that use the AA batteries go dead so quickly. This battery stays charged for months without any problems. My only complaint would be that when you need the flash, it will tell you to lift the flash up. It doesn't automatically pop up when needed.",

      "text": "I got this camera for my wife. I use several Canon DSLR's, but she just wants to \"point and shoot\". This Canon is rather large but very light. It tended to feel a bit cheap. The photos were alright for the price of the camera, but nothing to get excited about. I returned it and bought the Panasonic Lumix DMC. It's $300 but it is very compact, takes great photos and is simple to use. The one additional pet peeve I had with this camera is that Canon does not supply an owners manual. You have to download it from their website.",

    "title": "Canon PowerShot SX170 IS 16.0 MP Digital Camera, Red (discontinued by manufacturer)",
    "description": "The Canon PowerShot SX170 IS Digital Camera is a compact, point-and-shoot featuring a 16 megapixel 1/2.3\" CCD sensor and DIGIC 4 image processor to produce high-resolution, well-detailed stills and HD 720p video. The processor also works to provide reduced noise levels and overall image clarity as well as power throughout the camera to enable a High Speed AF system and intelligent auto shooting modes. The built-in Canon 16x optical zoom lens provides a 35mm-equivalent focal length range of 28-448mm, covering wide-angle to telephoto lengths for shooting in nearly any environment. Intelligent IS image stabilization is also available and features six unique stabilization modes suited to different types of shooting. For image composition, playback, and menu navigation, a 3.0-inch 230k-dot LCD is available and features a wide viewing angle to support use in bright conditions. The SX170 IS also features a refined ergonomic design to increase comfort during use.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n Untitled Document \n\nZOOM BIG, SHOOT COMFORTABLY\nZoom in on images you're not likely to capture with a smartphone. The 16x Optical Zoom on the PowerShot SX170 IS camera gets you up close to kids and wildlife, down on the field and up on the stage, while Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer keeps images steady and clear. The 28mm Wide-Angle lens captures everything from large family shots to breathtaking landscapes. With the 16.0 Megapixel sensor, you can crop and enlarge all you want, and the DIGIC 4 Image Processor ensures fast, precise performance. Relive fun times in smooth, detailed 720p HD video. Or simply point and shoot for excellent stills quality in all kinds of situations: Smart AUTO senses the conditions and chooses optimized camera settings for 32 pre-defined scenes. High Speed AF captures quick action shots, and Intelligent IS counteracts camera shake for virtually blur-free shooting. Easily see what you're shooting and show off what you've captured on the big, clear 3.0-inch LCD screen. Powered by a slim, new rechargeable lithium-ion battery, the PowerShot SX170 IS sports an even smaller, more ergonomic design that makes this the perfect camera to have at the ready all day long.\n\nPRECISION CANON OPTICS\nPOWERFUL 16X OPTICAL ZOOM WITH 28MM WIDE-ANGLE LENS\nThe PowerShot SX170 IS camera features a powerful Genuine Canon 16x Optical Zoom Lens that delivers outstanding optical performance and versatility. With precision engineering and decades of leadership in optical technologies, Canon has created a bright, wide-angle lens that provides an extraordinary 16x zoom range. The lens starts at 28mm wide-angle and extends to 448mm telephoto (35mm equivalent), giving you tremendous coverage and reach. The telephoto end lets you capture subjects from a considerable distance, while the 28mm wide-angle makes it easy to shoot sweeping landscapes, large groups of people and tall buildings. Moreover, this superb lens incorporates innovative designs that enable it to fit the compact profile of the PowerShot SX170 IS.\n\nPOWERFUL CORE SPECS DELIVER BEAUTIFUL IMAGES\n16.0 MEGAPIXEL IMAGE SENSOR\nThe PowerShot SX170 IS camera's 16.0 Megapixel CCD sensor delivers impressive photos with fine detail and brilliant color. The high resolution ensures superb image quality even when cropping or making very large prints.\n\nCANON DIGIC 4 IMAGE PROCESSOR\nCanon DIGIC Image Processors have set the standard for functionality and performance since their groundbreaking introduction in 1999. With each successive generation, DIGIC Image Processors have brought elevated performance and powerful new features to PowerShot digital cameras. The DIGIC 4 Image Processor has ushered in high levels of picture quality and accelerated processing, making possible features such as high-speed continuous shooting, HD video and Face Detection Self-timer. More powerful noise reduction algorithms also provide improved low-light capture.\n\nPRESERVE AND SHARE YOUR MEMORIES IN SPECTACULAR HD\nCANON HD VIDEO ADVANTAGE\nThe PowerShot SX170 IS camera lets you record highly detailed 720p HD video at 25 frames per second with clear stereo sound. Imagine the fun and excitement of being able to shoot high definition video whenever you want, right from your compact digital camera.\n\nDEDICATED MOVIE BUTTON, WIND FILTER FEATURE AND OPTICAL ZOOM WHILE SHOOTING\nIt's never been easier to shoot videos with a PowerShot digital camera. The PowerShot SX170 IS camera has a dedicated movie button that lets you start and stop recording instantly. The camera is always ready to shoot stills or video whenever you want. The camera also incorporates an electronic wind filter, which suppresses wind noise that can muffle or distort the sound. The PowerShot SX170 IS lets you use the full range of optical zoom when you're shooting a video without sacrificing HD video resolution.\n\nA SMARTER CAMERA MEANS BETTER PHOTOS AND VIDEOS\nSMART AUTO\nThe PowerShot SX170 IS camera features Smart AUTO: sophisticated Canon technology that makes getting that great shot as simple as pressing the shutter button. Smart AUTO automatically detects scenes by assessing various factors in both the background and the subject. Detected scenes are analyzed using 32 predefined shooting situations. The camera then makes optimal settings to ensure the best possible image capture, whether you're shooting stills or video. Smart AUTO also includes Advanced Subject Detection, which allows the camera to detect and track non-human moving subjects like animals and vehicles. With Smart AUTO, all you have to do is frame your shot and capture away.\n\nFASTER FOCUS HELPS YOU CAPTURE EVERY SHOT\nHIGH SPEED AF\nThe PowerShot SX170 IS camera is equipped with Canon's latest advancements in autofocus (AF) technology. Working on multiple fronts, Canon has developed AF that is significantly faster than on previous models, for a shooting experience that's spontaneous and natural. The extremely responsive High Speed AF lets you capture great shots as they happen, with reduced lag time.\n\nSeveral engineering breakthroughs contributed to this major enhancement to speed. In addition to improved AF algorithms, the camera can process multiple sequences simultaneously, and takes advantage of reworked controls between AF and the start of shooting.\n\nA STEADY IMAGE IS A BEAUTIFUL IMAGE\nINTELLIGENT IS\nThe latest advance in Canon Optical Image Stabilization technology, Intelligent IS, analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation. For stills, the system automatically selects among Normal, Panning, Macro (Hybrid) and Tripod IS modes. When shooting video, the system automatically selects among Dynamic, Powered, Macro and Tripod IS modes. With Intelligent IS, you can concentrate on image capture, letting the camera make the most effective IS settings to help capture the steadiest possible image.\n\nNormal Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills. Panning Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement. Macro (Hybrid) Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting. Dynamic Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking. Powered Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified. Tripod When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed. SEE WHAT YOU'RE SHOOTING ON A CLEAR, BIG SCREEN\nLARGE 3.0-INCH LCD SCREEN\nEasy to see from a wide angle, the camera's 3.0-inch LCD screen with a great resolution of approximately 230,000 dots gives you the big picture, whether you're shooting, reviewing or showing off your images. This high-resolution screen offers a crisp, clear picture to make shooting, playback and using the camera's menu functions especially convenient.\n\nSMALLER AND MORE COMFORTABLE THAN EVER\nRECHARGEABLE LITHIUM-ION BATTERY\nJust pick up the PowerShot SX170 IS camera and you'll discover how comfortable a super-compact camera can be! The new ergonomic design and smaller size are the result of a slim new rechargeable lithium-ion battery.\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\nSHOOTING MODES\nPowerShot cameras offer shooting modes that make it easy to take perfect photos in a wide range of shooting situations by providing intelligent presets with optimized settings.\n\nManual You have complete control of exposure, selecting both aperture and shutter speed manually.
