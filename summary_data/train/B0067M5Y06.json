      "text": "Crap... Had for two years and it fried - no chance of recovery; So I checked with OCZ to return it under the three year warranty it was sold with only to find out that it is no longer supported by OCZ and they will not honor the warranty. Nice truth in advertising! Look at this link  I called them just in case this was wrong and they confirmed that they do not support this drive and when I said the drive came with a three year warranty they said that was a Type-O and it was supposed to be 1 year. How convenient, I'm done with OCZ products!",

      "text": "Installed into Pentium D Vista box to replace the 80GB Seagate system drive. Migration was quick and without any issues: 1. Clonezilla of 80GB HDD onto SSD 2. Gparted to expand system partition by 20GB 3. Disconnect HDD connect SSD 4. Boot it up One minor item, OCZ Toolbox did not recognize that an OCZ SSD was connected - I had intended to check the firmware and update if necessary before cloning the drive (OCZ indicates it is a destructive update process). No big deal - it's working. As far as performance, the Vista box is running in AHCI mode and only has SATA-2. Crystal DiskMark reports 267MB/s read and 135MB/s write for sequential I/O test.",

This SSD did fit perfectly inside the PS3 Slim bay if you wanted to know. You all much think what a waste of SSD inside PS3 right? Had my reasons to test this out and see what time on game would get better and would XMB pop up quickly. My other reason was power-saving plus 1TB of data to have as well in SSD form.",

This can be a big plus when using encryption, as it basically kills the performance of SandForce based SSDs. The Octane meets my expectations in every way and so far has been absolutly trouble-free with the latest Firmware. Another plus is the capacity of 128GB, whereas many other \"120GB class\" SSDs (like Agility3/Vertex3) only offer 120GB. My Octane shipped with FW 1313 which is known to cause servere problems - so if you buy an Octane, make sure youhave to latest Firmware and if not update it and you will love this SSD.",
