Only two of the four are even usable anymore and they are fading fast! Not worth them money as I now have to replace them!",

      "text": "We bought in the fall of 2015 and like K. Slovak wrote in their review, we've concluded that these are a pretty product but NOT functional as a stool. We assembled these carefully and then attached the assembly tools to the bottom of the stool thinking we might need them someday. Little did we know that we would need them almost everyday. The screws simply will not stay tight rendering the product unsafe for it's intended use.. So it's good for a plant stand, but not a stool. Stool rating = 1 star. Plant stand rating = 2+ stars. Definitely NOT recommended as a stool.",

The provided Allen wrench works OK for the chair assembly. If you have an electric drill and correct bits it's easier but you'll still need the Allen wrench unless you have an angle drill attachment. The screws are actually quite heavy and shouldn't be a problem for chair longevity. Gluing and screwing the chair together would be a good idea but maybe not really necessary.",

I didnt notice the red dots on the legs and was complianing that it would have been nice if it were better labeled when suddenly I realized it was labeled& I had assembled it incorrectly. It also requires some pushing to get the legs to fit (it is meant to have a curve to the legs) so they got a kick out of my faces. Anyhow, it is definitely sturdy-I use it to put lotion on my feet when dressing after showering and it holds up my plus size body so I am pleased. No more falling over trying to put my socks on.",

I put the first of two together using the supplied allen wrench, while a little time consuming there were no issues. A cordless drill (used judiciously) with the correct bit made assembling the second one much quicker. A 1/4\" ratchet with the appropriate bit would make it that much quicker as the top to leg connection can't be done with a conventional power tool. Once assembled, these are exceptionally nice looking and sturdy, made of actual wood with the finish and color very even. I would recommend some sort of felt pad or plastic slider be installed for the legs. Overall very happy with them.",

Advise that you study the part list and parts and assembly pictures before starting because the instructions are mainly pictures. It is a cute little bench, nice and sturdy. I like the looks of it.

      "text": "This stool is exactly what I wanted. The directions were clear. The finished stool works fine. Assembly of the stringers to the legs was acceptable. However, using the small hex wrench provided to assemble the legs to the seat was horrible. The four long hex-head wood screws used to attach the legs to the seat required a lot of hand strength and the assembly was tedious. I tried other hex driver systems but the clearance was so limited that only the small hex wrench that came with the product fit.",

The second is still functional, but some of the wood has chipped off one leg, making it very unattractive. I'm not happy with this purchase and the quality of these stools is abysmal. These were used in our kitchen at our counter. We don't eat there regularly, but they do get use. The seemed to fall apart just about every time we moved them to clean the floor (okay, exaggerating, but it was frustratingly often).",
