Long story short, I wore the gloves to one practice out the box, and the ball went through my hands 3 straight times like it was straight butter, took them off and didn't drop a single ball. I gave them to a friend and we wiped the sticky towel on it and same with him. We couldn't even grip the ball just trying to hold it. Stick with Nike and Under Armor here, learnt my lesson the hard way.",

Very very sticky gloves as stated. I play running back and it rained the whole game and I never had 1 issue with these. I'm 6'0 with fairly big hands and I ordered a Large. At first I thought they weren't going to fit on my hands but once i got them on they felt great. Would recommend getting a larger size if you don't like such a tight fitting glove but perfect for my liking.",

UPDATE: The company emailed me back and they sent us new pair of gloves. Customer service was fantastic. Will be buying more from this company.",

The material on the back of the hand is very comfortable and breathable, makes for a very nice fit and keeps hands from getting sweaty. The fit is the only knock I'd have on these, I ordered a pair of XL gloves and they seem tighter than XL gloves of other brands, would have liked about another 1/4 inch of length on these in the fingers.",
