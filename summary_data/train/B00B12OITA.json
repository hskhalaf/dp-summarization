Wife don't trust it so I am returning but if this is just a backup to other safety measures it maybe decent as if it triggers everybody in the neighborhood knows someone is in your pool. One thing to note is i only tested like 2' away. Once it failed the close test I never bother with testing at the further part of pool.",

We test it regularly and it sets off appropriately when we drop an eighteen pound weight in the pool. Anything weighing less than 18 lbs that we tried did not set the alarm off. Overall, this product has been hassle-free so far and I am happy with it.",
