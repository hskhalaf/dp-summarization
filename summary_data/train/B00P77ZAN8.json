Second thing isn't the games fault, but the community has almost 0 creativity which leads to many boring games against net decks because people who suck at games involving any skill rely on hearthstone to feel like they've actually achieved something when they grind to legend with a deck they didn't make and a 52% win rate... Zzz. When new expansions come out though and you have to rely on your own deck building skills it's extremely fun having an 80+% win rate and watching legend card back players crumble.",

The real problem I have found with this game is the match-making and how some classes seem vastly out of balance and overpowered. As I casual player I can't really recommend the PvP match ups as without time invested or real world money spent you'll be in for a frustrating time.",

Good players, who understand the game, specifically created new accounts with basic cards and reached legend, just to prove it's possible without spending a penny. On what you can actually spend is the expansions. Cheers.",
