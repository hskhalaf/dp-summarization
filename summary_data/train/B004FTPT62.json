This brush is perfect for all tough jobs. The bristles are stiff, the base is well crafted, solid wood. The brush has held up really well (there aren't any bristles falling out and being left on the floor). You do need to use your own mop/broom etc handle (anything with a twist at the end) or you could use by hand. Overall, I'm very impressed with this brush- good quality, excellent price, and holds up amazingly well.",

    "title": "Weiler 44026 10\" Block Size, 6 X 18 No. Of Rows, Palmyra Fill, Wood Block, Deck Scrub Brush",
    "description": "Size:10\"| Style:Palmyra\n\nThe Weiler 44026 Palmyra fill deck scrub brush is a push broom head that has brown Palmyra fiber bristles in a wood block, and can be used with a Weiler 44018 or 44020 broom handle (sold separately) for scrubbing decks or other rough surfaces. The Palmyra fiber bristles can be used indoors or outdoors to remove heavy dirt and debris from rough surfaces. The bristles are arranged in six rows, with 18 sets of bristles per row, to facilitate scrubbing. The wood block is heavier than typical plastic blocks and is better suited for moderate to heavy cleaning. The block has two handle holes, a threaded one that accepts a Weiler 44018 broom handle and a tapered one that accepts a Weiler 44020 handle (handles sold separately). The brush measures 10\" long. The bristles are 2\" long.\n\nBrooms are cleaning tools used to sweep floors as well as porches, decks, driveways, sidewalks, and other outdoor surfaces. They typically consist of a long handle attached to a broom head with natural or synthetic bristles to trap dirt, dust, or debris. Certain brooms can be used indoors or outdoors or both, or on rough or smooth surfaces, depending on the type of bristles they have and other factors. Some brooms are color-coded to prevent cross-contamination and help facilitate workplace organization. Brooms are used by janitors, housekeepers, and other professionals in a wide variety of commercial and industrial environments, including airports, hospitals, hotels, offices, schools, and stadiums.\n\nWeiler manufactures precision brushes, abrasives, and maintenance products. The company, founded in 1898 in Germany and headquartered in Cresco, PA, meets International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard 9001.",
