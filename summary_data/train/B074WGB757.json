Installation pointer. The instructions are terrible. I couldn't figure out to remove the toilet seat. Put the seat up and push buttons on both sides of the hinge to release seat from the mount.

      "text": "I bought this item in July 2019 but it was not installed until September 2019 during my major bathroom remodel. There is a problem with the valve controlling the reservoir refill. The plumber who installed the toilet has been back here twice to try & adjust it but says it appears the valve is defective. Some days it works fine but most days it continually empties & refills of it's own accord. We are now at the point where we constantly have to shut off the water main to avoid a ridiculously high water bill from the wastage.",

      "text": "This was the first toilet we have installed and it couldn't have gone smoother! The instructions were clear and it took only 1 hour to get the water hooked up and the toilet seated. I was concerned that there wouldn't be enough water on the flush to make everything go down but we have had no problems with that at all! This toilet is very sleek and modern looking. Overall this is a strong recommend if you don't want a clunky toilet in your small bath or even in a large bath!",

Toilet is certainly not protected on left side -should have had styrofoam insert. I paid for a plumber and he charged even though the toilet was bad. Well, it wasn't his fault so I cant blame him. Will now have to find another toilet. This toilet would have been nice so I am VERY disappointed.",

Overall great value. Another plus when I discover two small missing bumpers for the seat were missing the customer service sent them out FedEx quickly. Kudos for customer service.",

Besides that, this petite commode looks fantastic and appears to be very well made. However, if we didn't have to use a stick and a force cup plunger to stir up the contents after every deposit I would have easily given it an overall five star rating.",

I don't know if it was a design flaw, or a manufacturing flaw, or just a poor design. I can't imagine why you would want water in the base of the toilet. Don't buy if you plan to winterize your house.",

You can visibly tell that the seat is the type you can get on ebay for about 15dollars. It moves even when tightened to the max. Very bad design and quality. For the price the the piece you touch sit on the most is just crap. Factor in about $40 dollars for your own seat in addition to the price of the toilet.

The Part where you flush on top also feels flimsy and cheap. Can't believe what they are charging for this. I would not recommend.",
