When I called T-Fal on their 1-800 number, it took me a long time to get hold of their rep and she said that the warranty only covers the pot and not the handle and other parts. Its definitely sketchy practice when your warranty covers only POTS. I am going to go with Presto or someone where they have a 12 year warranty and clearly mention what they cover in it.",

An added and welcome feature is that we have found that it is less prone to overheating and burning the food, probably because of better heat distribution. This is more a feature of the induction range but it still needs a good magnetic stainless steel pressure cooker to make the whole thing work. Don't misunderstand, you can still burn the contents but this combination does appear to be a lot more tolerant of the heat up process. Pressure seal and gage appear to work appropriately.",
