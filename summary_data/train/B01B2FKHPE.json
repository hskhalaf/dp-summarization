      "title": "\"Cool\" Shifter knob...",
      "text": "This \"Cool\" shifter knob works great on our 2014 Mazda6 (6 speed manual). I think it looks and feels great, but the wife does not think it is cool. I would have preferred a screw-on knob instead of the cheap plastic adapters, but I guess this method makes it work with any shifters. Overall for the money I paid I am happy with my purchase... I wish the Vader version didn't have the ugly swirls in the helmet plus this one was a few dollars cheaper... (I got this as part of a deal for the day). Only had this a few days so I can't comment on how it will hold up over time, but it seems well made.",

      "text": "Pros: - The item seems to be from a durable material (I\u2019ve had it for 2 weeks so far) - The adapters are great if your shift knob screw is a different size from the stormtroopers socket. - This comes with 3+ tiny screws that you use and tighten the stormtrooper. Using the alias key that they provide you with Cons: For some reason, no matter how many times I tightly screw in the little screws, somehow, they begin to loosen up which causes the stormtrooper to move left to right a little bit Other than that, very great product and shipping time !",

      "text": "I really like this item! I have a white Toyota Tacoma, with black trim, aka the Stormtrooper Edition. The shifter knob comes with three adapters. Unfortunately, none of them fit my shifter. I went to the hardware store with my stock shifter knob, and found a long bolt that would screw into it. Cost was less than two dollars. Then, I took a hacksaw blade and cut a small groove longways across the last few threads to make a poor man's tap. I used it to rethread the smallest adapter, and it screwed on very well. I used some threadlock for safekeeping. I like the weight of the knob, and it feels very securely attached. And it looks great!",
