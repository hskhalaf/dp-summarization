      "text": "I initially posted a one-star review labeled \"Disappointed\" because the peeler scraped the carrots I was preparing rather than peeling them in nice, long strips. Well, count me in as a mental midget -- I did not notice when I cleaned it before use, that there is a thin plastic protective strip on the blade, which obviously made the peeler inoperable. I almost threw the peeler away in disgust, but decided to wash it anyway. It was then that I noticed the protective strip. Once removed, the tool worked beautifully and as expected. So if you do buy this kitchen tool, be sure to remove the protective plastic strip from the blade before employing it!",

Although the Cutco might (and I am not sure) be sharper, the Spring Chef is superior for this reason: peels are a lot less likely to get in the way by sticking to the peeler. Because of how this peeler flexes, it is much less common to discover a peel slice clinging to the peeler, preventing it from doing its job. The peels fall off almost always. Once in a while you have to remove a peel, but less than half as often. Great design, great product.",

So, I'm assuming if it makes I'm that happy, it will make others happy as well, as he's pretty particular.",

I've used it several times already on potatoes, lemons, oranges, apples and even celery to remove the tough ribs. It has worked amazingly! The price was a little higher than most vegetable peelers you can find at box stores but you immediately can tell you got what you paid for. The order came quickly and the item was well packaged.

Incredibly sharp and the swivel feature for the blade is an excellent design feature. I was thinking this as a gift actually for some foodies I know but then I was thinking why insult their current peeler - not worth it. But truly a great product and razor sharp.",
