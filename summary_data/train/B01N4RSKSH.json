I was a little skeptical that this would work much faster than the hammer and chisel I had been using. It plows threw the thinset like butter. Used a so called \"self sharpening chisel\" not sure how they get away with that claim? I had to pull out the grinder. Just make sure you buy the SDS-PLUS bits and chisels. I bought a SDS max and its twice the size, doesn't fit.",

      "text": "I used this with a flat scraper blade to remove 106 square feet of vinyl flooring from concrete. It has plenty of power and is not too heavy. I liked the fact that I could scrape the adhesive off the concrete and it only hammered until most of the adhesive and backing were removed; then it kind of \"buzzed\" when removing the residual adhesive. Hard to explain. It only hammers when a certain threshold of force is applied. Who knew? I highly recommend this tool. It is not a true demolition hammer, but for what it is, it is wonderful.
