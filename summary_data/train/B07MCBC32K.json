However it deflated completely within an hour. Blew it up again and deflated just as quickly. Very disappointed In this product especially Since the price was quite high. At least for it to stay inflated. Would love a refund. The company emailed me 2 days after I wrote this review and said they were sorry for the bad experience, and were sending me a new air mattress. The mattress came quickly and works great. Finally a company that stands behind their products and cares about their customers.",

      "text": "My daughter travelled for 75 days with this bed this summer with a drum Corp team. It was inflated, slept on, deflated and packed everyday. It stayed inflated, was comfortable and very easy to use. It is loud inflating as most but inflated so quick. Built in pump is so convenient and easy to use. She got one little pinhole puncture in it at one point. We found the hole, used repair patch and was good as new. Very satisfied with this purchase.",

This air mattress required me to inflate it least twice a night. Not fun for my new neighbors who had to listen to the noisy roar of the inflation. Not helpful to me or my back to wake up twice a night to do this. Spend a little more money and get a better air mattress is my advice.",

We plan to sleep on this for the next 2 weeks and we are confident it will hold up. The inflation is easy, just turn the knob and press the 'on' button. Plus it contains a power cord compartment on the bottom end of mattress. 10/10 Would recommend!",

We recently began having my grandson for sleepovers who is only 3 1/2 years old. The mattress would not stay inflated throughout the night. I gave it several attempts figuring that there was a \"break in\" period but eneded up with the same result every time. It's really a shame because I really liked the mattress and it blows up very quickly but if it won't hold air throughout even 1 night, it defeats the purpose . Very disappointed",
