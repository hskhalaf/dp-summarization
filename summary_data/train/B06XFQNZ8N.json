It's almost transparent, and that adds to the impression that the case is not at all intrusive. All the buttons on the phone align perfectly with the case, and the slot for charger access is perfectly placed. The closest thing to a criticism that I could offer is that the back of the case is not textured in any way, and since it is slick plastic it can be a bit slippery in the hands -- so get a decent grip on it.",

Very easy installation: put one end of phone in case, then \"stretch\" other end of case over opposite end of phone. Works fine with my screen protector. I haven't had any drops more than a couple of inches yet, but will update my review if there are any issues. Would definitely buy again!",
