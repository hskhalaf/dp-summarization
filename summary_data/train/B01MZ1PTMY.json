Then after we re-threaded the female threads and got it working, it stop turning off. Contacted the insurance policy that I also bought from Amazon, but no results. I'm returning 3 of tbe 5 that aren't working. My advice is to buy Dewalt sanders. Just another for note, getting ready to order 6 dewalt Sanders to replace the 5 that I bought in September. I'm going to use these red one for target practice since the insurance I purchased doesn't help and no one will contact me Waist of money. Buy Dewalt",

It came with a velcro pad, which is not specified anywhere in the description. I prefer a PSA pad, but they are easily enough changed over.",

      "text": "Works as advertised, smooth, operates under 100 psi, reason for four stars and not five.... sanding discs are not as easy to locate to fit sanding pad locally. I have finally located pads from 100 grit all way up to 2000 grit but many vendors were used to accummulate a wide variation of sanding discs... other size pads appear to be easier to locate pads. The sander will handle other pads which might make their options available... I think the supplier should provide two options for sanding pads. The unit works great and lives up to other reviews.",
