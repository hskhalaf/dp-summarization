My nephew stands in his crib until his mom turns on the light for him. It is also nice that it has both a blue & green light projection. I would highly recommend if you need a baby or toddler gift for a little boy. I have also purchased a similar product for girls - the projected colors are pink and orange. Just a very cool gift! Thank you!",

You are getting a great deal with this!!! Highly, highly, highly recommend!",

Some of the reviews are saying it's too bright, but I personally think it is bright enough in the blue to serve as a night light, and dim enough in the red and green options that it can be a soothing light for sleep. Easy button turn-on and has automatic shut-off so batteries last a little longer. I plan to buy additional ones later on for gifts for other kids.",
