An hour ago I changed the oil in my car for the 20th time, (135K), and I had to clean up 4 qts of oil all over my driveway from the filter seal letting go within 30 seconds of me starting the car. It went on like the threads inside were wrong or crooked and didnt seal after it was installed. I grabbed the old filter out of the trash and it installed perfectly so something was definitely wrong with this one. I just wont be buying another that's for sure.",

If you look around on the internet you will find there are people that have taken apart oil filters and compared the insides. This one rates fairly well with having a bunch of filtering material, good flow with a good bypass valve design. If you use this filter with good synthetic oil and top tier gas your oil should come out very \"clean\" which should translate to longer engine life.",
