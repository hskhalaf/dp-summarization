However, it is still a great watch! ---Original Review--- Citizen makes great watches and these, Titanium Chrono watches with Eco-Drive, are great looking and very functional! These watches are very light and I barely feel them on my wrist! In addition, they keep the exact time by syncing with the Atomic clock in Colorado.",

The water proof feature will protect the watch from my carelessness around water. The Titanium band keeps the watch light and durable. So far no scratches which is one of the titanium's weaknesses according to online reviews. I look forward to many years of service with my Citizen Eco-Drive.",

But I must say that this Citizen is something special. Titanium with perpetual calendar that updates itself and just like the automatics, never needs a battery.

The only downside is the functionality of the chrono; there are a few steps involved to get to it, but in all honesty, I typically will use the chrono on my phone, so it's really not that big of a deal.

The Citizen Eco-Drive\u00ae Perpetual Chrono Atomic Timekeeping Titanium Watch for Men, featuring a lightweight yet robust titanium link bracelet, has a fold-over clasp with a hidden double push-button closure for easy on and off. This water-resistant timepiece features a chronograph, a perpetual calendar, 12- and 24-hour time, an alarm, a power reserve, a tachymeter, and the day and date.

We believe that better and now are both infinite, and that there is always a next \u2018better\u2019 and a new \u2018now\u2019 in which you can start pursuing it. It was clear from the onset of this project that we are dedicated to this ideal\u2026not to the past but to the present, and all the way we can improve it. To help communicate this belief to the world we have created a new global CITIZEN brand movie, brand identity and brand website that represents out Better Starts Now philosophy. \n\n\n\nSee more",
