      "text": "I recently received a Mini iPad #5, and needed a sturdy case. My first choice was a green leather case; however, when I went to purchase, alas it was sold with a potential of no further units to come. So I found what appeared to be a sufficiently protective, inexpensive case to carry me forward. It arrived, fit perfectly, even the cut outs were perfectly placed! I am truly surprised. The first case is now back in stock, but I won\u2019t get it, as I have an incredible case at a third of the cost! Buy this case, you will be pleasantly impressed!",

      "text": "I've used multiple JETech covers and they area great alternative to the more expensive Apple case. This cover is a fraction of the price and is no different than Apple's. It is very grippy, all cutouts are precise, and the inside of the cover has a nice soft texture, the body is a bit better protected than Apple's magnetic case with very minimal change in size and weight. It is a little bit of a fingerprint magnet, but just a damp cloth on outside cleans them right up. Maybe the magnets to keep it in the stand mode could be a touch stronger, but that's only trying to find something wrong with it.",

I much prefer the single fold of the Kindle cover--it is steadier in both vertical and horizontal propping. Overall it this is a nice cover, and I would buy it again.",

If you so much as brush your hand against the lip of the case while closed it will open. So, nice in your hands for usage but garbage for protecting it while closed.",
