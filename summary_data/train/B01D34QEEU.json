I tried to gently wipe the stains off with a baby wipe and guess what?? Those black stains turned out to be solids stuck to the down feathers. They started chipping off into a black like powder. I had to cut through the nylon fabric and much to my dismay it turned out to be bird poop. Literally, animal waste stuck to the feathers. This is gone to the garbage. A shame and waste of good $19.99 on something so sick.",

In certain lighting it looks more like a grayish purple. I am definitely going to order another color. I highly recommend this vest.",

The only downside is that the exterior pockets are a tiny bit small to fit your hands into comfortably - but they zip up and there are additional interior pockets on both sides. It also comes with little pouch that you can fold the vest into which helps when you want to layer up or down. All in all, a good buy for a great price.",

It wasn't hard to make it work, after I realized what I needed to do (get the material out of the way). It is very lightweight, and packs down small. I think I will make my bag even smaller, as it could take up less space if it were packed tighter. It fit me perfectly (Large size... I'm 150 lbs, 5ft 3 inches. I usually try getting large sizes.) I'm quite pleased with my purchase.",
