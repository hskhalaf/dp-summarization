The wrap is extremely thick, seems to be 3 times thicker than any other wraps I've seen. It's also super stretchy so I was able to secure all my boxes and my furniture. We had to wrap things last minute while already outside and the wrap even worked flawlessly in the cold. Overall thrilled with this product. A+++. Highly recommend.",
