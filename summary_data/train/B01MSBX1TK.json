Decent enough, just a little let down by the quality of the stitching. Update: The company reached out to me after my review and sent me a new canopy at no cost. Not giving 5 stars because of the initial issues, but increasing to 4 because of their follow up.",

A lot of tent for a decent price. CONS: Legs not very stable when fully extended. Tent material rather thin (concerns of longevity / durability with extensive use).

This one was used to protect guests from the afternoon sun that peeked through some trees. It is overall not as heavy in total weight as our other canopy of a similar design and size when it is dismantled for storage which we like. It was easier to put up than our other canopy. It is attractive. We are very happy with it.",

      "text": "DO NOT PURCHASE!!! I bought this tent a month ago and decided to put it up today for a bbq. It is out of the return window so I don\u2019t have the option of returning this tent. It lasted 30 minutes. What a waste of money. I ordered 10lb weights to hold it in place as well. Nothing worked. A wind gust and a shower knocked it over and bent a leg and broke some other poles at the top of the tent. I am so disappointed with this product. My daughter\u2019s birthday is tomorrow and now I have to go out and purchase another tent!!",

However I accidentally forgot to take this down before a small thunderstorm blew through the other day(with the feet weighed down) and it survived a few very significant gusts of wind, so it\u2019s sturdier than I expected.",

All in all very happy, and we're hoping it'll perform as well *next* year. PS Because all the booths are set up on the street (concrete), there's no way to peg the supports to the ground; I got weights (which slip over the struts) and they worked very well holding the \"booth\" steady.",
