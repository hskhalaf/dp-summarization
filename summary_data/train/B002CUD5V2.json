The only reason this isn't getting a one star, is because the bag is pretty nice. Might be worth it to put in the extra dollar and get a nicer set.",

You can obviously tell these are not the best quality, but for a beginner like me, I think they're just what I need. Golf bag is also nice. It has trouble standing though, you have to use the aid it comes with. Reason why I don't give it a 5 star is because the bag cover came with a couple of small perforations. I reached out to the seller, and they sent one in worst condition than the one with the holes I originally got.",

    "description": "Looking to take up the game of golf but don't want to break the bank on clubs? Turn to the Confidence Power men's hybrid club set, which includes everything you need to hit the links with confidence. The set's long clubs include driver and a 24-degree hybrid wood with a steel shaft. The hybrid replaces the difficult-to-hit longer irons without sacrificing an ounce of performance. For the mid-range to short approach shots, you can pull out one of the cavity-backed irons, which are built to offer more forgiveness. The set includes steel-shafted 6-, 7-, 8-, and 9-irons, along with a pitching wedge. And beginning golfers can make short work of the greens thanks to the steel-shafted putter. The set concludes with an upgraded stand bag with auto-pop legs, plenty of external pockets, and a rain cover. \n\nAbout Confidence Golf \nFounded in 1967, Confidence Golf has been producing innovative, high-quality golf equipment aimed at beginners and improving golfers for more than 40 years.
