You can just fill out, which it pretty much imports all the info from your federal, and still have to pay $20 to efile it. Very misleading until you hit the view more button in the item description.

This issue has been resolved in a product release scheduled for March 26, 2020. .......' I paid $53.99 for TurboTax deluxe, paid another $26.65 for state e-file, had 0 errors when running checks, they guarantee 100% accuracy and then the return gets rejected with no fault on my side. And all they message is 'sorry for your inconvenience'. If you want to talk to a live person you have to pay another $30. I am furious.",

Considering you get your refund quicker, electronic filing is the way to go.",

Moreover, it didn't transfer data over to the state completely so I had to re-enter the data in the state forms by hand. They should make the state e-file included. Also, I got a text at 1 am in the morning stating \"congrats! your state tax submission was accepted!\" ARGGGH!!!!",

The 5 free federal e-file is correct but you have to pay $25 to E-file for the state. You could say I misread it but I'm not the only one here. It's the way the description is written that is kind of misleading. Regardless, I like the direct import from stock accounts and tie to the bank for deposit/withdrawal. Why can Intuit include 1 free state E-file to make life easier for everyone?.",
