      "text": "The Klipsch Reference R-10SW doesn't come with any bells or whistles so be cautious when purchasing if multiple subwoofers are used. I feed this subwoofer via my Wharfedale subwoofer which has speaker and RCA line level inputs and outputs. The Klipsch Reference R-10SW only has right and left channel line inputs. In fact this sub does not have a power switch and is auto on only. What you gain with this subwoofer for the price is sound quality and power. The Klipsch Reference R-10SW is a great value for price paid even if it's the older model and it looks gorgeous. Great all around subwoofer!",

Over a month now with proof of delivery avsoundz will not respond to my emails. You may want to think long and hard before buying products from this manufacturer or vendor!

We listen to all types of music and this sub handles all genres just fine. Punchy enough for kick drum bump and the ported 10\" provides appreciable depth for pop/r&b bass.
