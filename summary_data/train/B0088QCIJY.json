If you dont know what you're doing you WILL need to hire a professional! Read the fine print before purchase. It is NOT a \"plug and play\" unit. It doesn't even come with a power cord. You need to hardwire one. You also need to make sure you have the appropriate voltage to plug into, you need 220. Beyond that it's been a great heater so far!",
