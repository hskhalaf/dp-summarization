      "text": "This was my first lens. This is pretty much the best lens for the money that you can buy when starting out. I still use this lens today. It is very sharp and super quick. The bokeh that it renders is really creamy. As with most nikon lenses, this is very well made and offers a really sharp picture. Initially you'll find yourself wanting to shoot at 1.8 during every shot. Really good for low light situations. Overall I can't recommend a better priced vs quality lens for beginners or even vets for that matter. I highly recommend this lens. Superb!",

Everything doesn't need to be shot at the highest stop of (1.8). If you shoot at this you will notice only a small part will be sharp and in focus. Portraits with this lens work best between 2.8 -5 standing at least arms length awayyou will get the whole face sharp instead of the eyes.",

The only down-point is that sometimes 50 mm is too close for some shots, even if you step back, sometimes you screw with your composition, but this only happens if you want to take a picture of a large subject or a landscape, which is not the purpose of this lens for me.",

Outside, it works great, as I can always move back to take the frame I want. Works great in low light conditions. Recommend it to everyone.

And I just love it. I will update this review on Monday after a photo shoot I have for commercial photos that my family uses for social media publicity of our flower arrangement shop. Stay tuned.

That is why I give this 4/5 stars but otherwise, the build quality is fine even though some people might fret because of the plastic build. Plastic it is, but it is NOT low quality plastic. Unless, you intend to drop this onto concrete, you have nothing to worry about. Again, this lens is razor sharp and it makes for excellent panoramic shots and portraits, shoulder length and beyond.",

      "text": "Not quite as sharp wide open as I'd hoped, but it's at least usable at f2.0. My 50 1.8D is unusable until f2.8++. This cleans up much more quickly and is much better wide open to boot. I think stopped down the 1.8D is a bit sharper than this 1.8G, but the difference is minor. Using on a D800/D810, so on other cameras it would probably be very sharp wide open. I'm happy with the lens. It's definitely a step up from the 50 1.8D. And in my tests looks very much like DxOLabs said it would on the D800E (closest they have to my D810).",

Wide open the portrait bokeh is nice with a little overall veiling flare and softness but it clears as soon as you stop down half a stop. Seems silly to pay more for a 1.4 lens that does the same thing (also soft wide open). I love this as a portrait lens on a DX body. The older D lenses might focus a tad quicker but the quieter, smoother AF action of the G lenses is nicer overall.",

Other reviews state it front focused a lot. I do not have that problem. In manual mode the focusing is also dead on. This is used in my photo shoots when space is limited. I figured for the price I'll try it. I'm glad I did.",
