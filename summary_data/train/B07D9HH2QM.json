That\u2019s the main thing I wanted it for but the other features on this are just a plus... like being able to charge the speaker just by leaving it in the sun. ****update**** this thing being waterproof is a life saver!!! I would like to close this review out by saying I am not the smartest person in the world but I can tell the difference between a good and a bad product. I love doing reviews and I hope to one day become the number 1 reviewer on amazon. If this review has helped you any at all please hit the helpful button!!! Thanks!!!",

The speakers worked great, sound quality and volume were good and the music was welcomed. Plan on purchasing another one as a gift for Christmas!",

If you switch between aux and bluetooth you have to press the phone call button on the device. The voice that prompts is a bit annoying since it has a heavy Chinese accent. But meh, you get over it quickly. Other than that, the solar charging and battery pack charging for your usb device works awesomely. Charged my phone while bumping some Underground Hip Hop in my garage. Good times.",
