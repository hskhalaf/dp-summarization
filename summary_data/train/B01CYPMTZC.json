While on the road today I pulled up to a car that was stuck in the snow. I thought, hey I'll just use that handy tow cable I bought! I attached it on both ends to a tow point and got back in. On the first light pull the tow strap snapped immediately. It is cheap garbage. This is pathetic they are actually selling this to people that would need it in an emergency. I'm sure the rest of the equipment is just as cheap. DO NOT PURCHASE",

The kit contains a reasonably complete set of decent quality materials needed for a roadside emergency. I supplemented the kit with 50' of paracord, 2 heavy duty garbage bags, 6-in-1 screwdriver, 4-in-1 mini screwdriver, a small roll of duct tape, and a LED headlamp. The multi-tool was too flimsy for my liking, so replaced it with a Stanley multi-tool. I'll probably buy a couple of more for other cars and make the same additions and substitutions.",

The size is nice and compact, with enough room to add some personal items of my own, if needed. The only suggestion I would add is to maybe add some hand warmers. Not really emergency type item but could be used when changing a tire in the winter. You have the gloves, which are a nice, but just throwing it out there as a possible viable inexpensive option. All in all, great product and I will recommend this to my friends and family.",

Towards the end of the online course, they had great recommendations and provided a list of items to keep in your care for being prepared \"in case of an emergency'\".

I then realized I needed to get someone a gift that is difficult to buy for and immediately ordered a 2nd kit. I loved the kit as did the person I gave the gift/kit to.",
