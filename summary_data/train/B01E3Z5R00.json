There was some slack which made a little noise but with adjustment and closing door so extra fabric was on inside it was very minimal. SO much better than traditional shades especially since they cover entire window!.",

However, although the width fits (window is 34\" - these mediums said they cover to 38\") they are at least 2\" short height-wise. I think the large would probably have fit better but there was no option to pick large. It would have been helpful if the height of each size was listed in the description so one would know if both dimension work. I purchased these for a road trip and will be using them to allow air in while sleeping in the back, so even though they are short they should still work for my purpose.",

This are like T-shirts to your car doors so every bit of the window is covered with a nice shade, they do not fall off and a plus is you can roll your windows down to let the air in without losing the shade",

It will still flap. I do like that I can open my windows to vent without worrying about someone getting in, momentarily at least.",

I sleep in my car now and then, and this makes it possible to leave the car windows open while keeping the bugs and stray glances out. I used them the last time I went camping and got lots of comments about them.",

I am so happy that I had found a product that not only covers the whole window to keep the sun out of my Childs, but also allows me to roll down the window for a nice breeze and keeps the bugs from getting in. Though there are reasons why I am giving these a four and not five star rating. They do not fit snug on my Kia Souls back windows, this allows the wind on the outside to tug on the fabric making it hard to see other cars when switching lanes. This may be due to the shape of the door for I have yet to try them on a different model of car.",
