My husband and I recently went to Niagara Falls and were able to get incredible photos and movies with this inexpensive camera. It even took great night shots when the Falls were lighted. Our photos and movies were much better than those of a friend who also traveled to Niagara Falls recently and used an expensive camera than is big and bulky. I love that this can slide into my pocket and I don't have to worry about dragging around big equipment.",

Looking at various reviews we finally settled on the WX300 even though it cost a little more than we originally wanted to spend. After our cruise of the Baltic followed by a two week trip through Germany resulting in about 2,500 pictures I can say that this camera takes very good pictures in any condition including low light; it's amazing what you can see when you utilize maximum zoom. I can strongly recommend this camera",

My biggest complaint with this camera, the reason I had to quit using it, is that the thin metal surrounding the lens is flimsy. By wearing this camera in a small bag on my belt while driving, this metal was pushed in by pressure from my seatbelt. This in turn, caused the thin metal leaves of the lens cover mechanism to stick, leaving the lens itself exposed. The lens coating eventually was damaged by my repeatedly manually moving this lens cover out of the way.",

Fabulous indoor pictures with no flash! 20X optical zoom is amazing and pictures come out amazing both indoor and outdoor. Just leave setting on Auto and enjoy snapping away. 100% satisfied. But just get a rubber case since the camera is thin and a bit slick. So far I'm loving it.",

Image stabilization works very well. Many different \"scene\" modes, including a panorama mode that actually works pretty well. A lot of features in a small package.

Thought maybe it needed to be charged so plugged it in but it won't even charge. Now I have to send it to Sony for a repair and I have to pay for shipping it to them. Just not right.
