      "text": "Great little pump, 1 star off for lack of shield size choices. Bonus direct pump if you use Lansinoh Momma bottles. Potentially a great little hand pump with no squeaky handles or leaky shields (looking at you, Philips Avent), fantastic suction, super quick letdown induction, a nice stand, got a lot of milk each time- I mean like 5oz in under 8 mins flat. Unfortunately for me, the shield sizes seem to be equivalent to Medela Medium 24mm and XL(?) which is too big. So although the mechanics are very nice, I've only been willing to use this pump 3-4 times in a pinch (double electric veteran), because the too-big shield causes sore boobs afterwards.",

Only thing that's kind of annoying is that there are a lot of parts to put together/take apart/wash each time. But I feel like the only pumping solution without a million parts to clean is the hakaa. Which is a bit of a different concept anyway. I do recommend this product if you are out and about a lot and need to pump without having to plug in somewhere. It's also a lot less to lug around than the big electric pump even if you do have an outlet handy.",

I am able to pump just as much milk and in the same time or less. I actually prefer this manual due to the fact that it\u2019s more portable, easier to clean, and is quieter than my electric. I would recommend this product for working moms that are looking for a quieter and convenient alternative",

I only wish water didn\u2019t get into the top when rinsing so I didn\u2019t always have to take completely apart. But not a biggie.",

If you're someone who needs to have your electric pump at full strength, this may not work as well for you, otherwise it should be fine. Glad I bought this instead of a more expensive manual pump.",

      "text": "So glad I bought this. I never intended it to be used, just as a backup or travel item. When I started getting damaged boobs from pumping a lot (we had issues getting started), I gave this a try and whoa! No idea something totally manual could work this well. I haven't used my electric again, I'll now keep it at work when I got back and use this at home. It was so nice to be able to control suction so I could get out my milk effectively during a letdown but back off if it started to hurt. My boobs healed up from the electric in a couple of weeks.",

I can tell that I am able to pump more milk with this one and it is much more comfortable to hold and is much more durable than medella. The tray that you can place the pump in makes it so that the pump does not tip over or spill. The let down feature helped my milk supply immensely. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone planning to breast feed. My only regret is that for my electric pump I bought a medella and not the lansinoh brand!",

    "title": "Lansinoh Manual Breast Pump with Stimulation and Expression Modes, Single Pump Included, Hand Pump for Breastfeeding, Quiet for Travel, Pumping Essentials",
    "description": "The Lansinoh Manual Breast Pump offers a convenient and quiet pumping solution at an affordable price. Manual breast pumps are great for the mom who is pumping occasionally. A manual breastmilk pump gives mom the ability to pump anywhere because it\u2019s compact, lightweight and doesn\u2019t require electric power. The Lansinoh Manual breast pump uses innovative two-phase technology to conveniently and comfortably express breastmilk. The handle of the pump adjusts to easily switch between Stimulation and Expression phases. The Stimulation phase allows more rapid suction, similar to baby\u2019s suction pattern at the beginning of a breastfeed, to elicit a letdown. Once milk starts flowing, it\u2019s easy to switch to the Expression phase which provides slower cycles with more suction to efficiently express breastmilk. The ergonomic easy-express handle allows for comfortable positioning to reduce hand fatigue, and two flange sizes, standard (25mm) and large (30.5mm), ensure ideal suction and pumping comfort. The soft rim on the flanges provides a more comfortable experience and creates a better seal when pumping. Lansinoh milk collection bottles are designed to fit the full Lansinoh breast pump, milk storage and baby bottle feeding range. Includes a storage lid for convenient breastmilk bottle storage and NaturalWave nipple with collar & cover so baby can be fed directly from the same bottle used for pumping. Also, now pump directly into Lansinoh Breastmilk Storage Bags with the use of any Lansinoh breast pump to save time and reduce breastmilk transfer. Founded by a breastfeeding mom, Lansinoh has been committed to helping moms succeed in breastfeeding for over 30 years. Lansinoh is a leader in breastfeeding products and accessories, famous for its award-winning cornerstone product Lansinoh lanolin and Lansinoh nursing pads. For more information, please visit Lansinoh.com or connect with us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest and YouTube. Do not fill past the 6oz mark.",
