I just no my experience with this grinder has not been the greatest.",

Another thing to consider if you're naive to manual grinders as I was before making this purchase... It takes about 15-20 minutes of fairly rapid grinding to make 50gm of coffee grounds (about a medium size French press pot's worth). I can't add that to my morning routine so this is now decorative or going to a thrift store. :(",

As other reviewers have noted it's basically a Hario Skerton clone, the glass container is nice and spacious, but personally I just use the grounds right away. The additional silicone ring definitely adds stability when in use on a kitchen counter, and this is a big aid in getting the desired consistency. My only complaint is that the hopper tends to not feed into the burr in a regular fashion. This often results in me having to smack the top of the grinder to get beans to actually fall into the grinding area.",

The setting takes a bit of experimentation but not too much of a hassle. Everything seems quality built and should last a very long time. Great deal! I look forward to using this for many years to come. :)",
