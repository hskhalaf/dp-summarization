The carry bag is very durable and the flag on top is a nice touch! My only gripe would be the lack of a second chain layer, so some puts might go through this basket that would definitely get caught in a Mach3 or Mach5, but it forces you put well and have good technique. This is the price you pay for mobility, as an extra chain layer would make this thing too heavy for a day at the park.",

      "text": "It works alright. It is very light and easy to setup so it's great for something to keep in the trunk for some quick practice. The DGA Mach light is the portable I prefer after using both tough. It is about 18 pounds heaver, but feels and looks more realistic to me. But! if it's lightweight and ease of use you are looking for the DISCatcher is really nice.",

The only downside is that the discs aren't dropping into the basket as often as I would like but I have a feeling it is not the catcher's fault. I have the utmost confidence that whenever I order merchandise form Amazon it is top quality, reasonably price and delivered promptly. Thanks for making life so simple. Mark G White",

      "text": "At first I was skeptical,The outside of the box was showing a red catcher and I ordered a yellow one. When I opened it up, it was yellow. I immediately pulled it out of the bag and I set it up very quickly. The top was a little tilted but who gives a crap. I broke it down and was able to put it in it's bag with no problem at all. It was all good. I will be using it this coming weekend at the park. The reason I gave it a 4 star rating was as I left it set up for awhile, The smell of the new product material was very powerful in my apartment.",
