Weather radio (162 MHz) is a great addition. Small, rugged package - good top switch for flashlight - suitable in the hand. Actually has LED for charge status (blink - charge; on- full). I haven't completed battery life testing yet but other inexpensive AM/FM or AM/FM/Weather are eating through 3 AAA cells in as little as 3 hours.

The only downside I noticed is that it is difficult to tune to a channel with the small know on the radio. But it is a small radion, it couldn't be much bigger.",

VERY compact but don\u2019t let the small size fool you. This is a great item!",

Not only is it a flashlight, but a radio and a cell phone charger as well. It also charges by three different means-hand crank, solar cell, and usb mini charger. This is a great device for disaster preparedness. You just never know when disaster will strike, so buying something like this would be a great idea.",
