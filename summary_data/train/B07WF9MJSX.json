I will be using this to stream at&t's \"watchTV app\" over at&t's LTE network when the power is out so the battery made a big impact on my decision. The only negative so far is this was sold to me WITHOUT a SIM card. I had to drive to an at&t store to get a SIM card. Not happy about that. Especially because these are supposed to come with a preinstalled SIM.",
