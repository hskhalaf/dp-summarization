It has such a nice fresh and light fragrance. Smells of summer.

The only reason I gave them 4 stars overall is because they don't always fully desolve in load. Maybe they get wrapped up in a shirt or something, I'm really not sure. Otherwise a fantastic product.

I really noticed it when I washed my dog's bed today, which is white. I wash it once per week. With Dropps it came out completely white and clean.
