I have never had a cheap toilet have a noticeable defect like this. It does flush great which the American Standard it replaced never did.

Also, although it says it is a 1.6 gallon flush, I'm sure it uses only about a gallon of water at the most based on the recovery time to refill. Everything goes down the first time every time, at least so far. Couldn't be more pleased.",

      "text": "Drake Toto toilets are the best! My husband and BIL installed the two of them in a few hours. We purchased them because of reviews and the fact we wanted to save water. Now I am so happy to report they stay so much cleaner than my previous toilets, possibly due to the shape of the bowl and the way they flush. As promised there have been no clogs at all. It is an excellent choice and we are pleased . We have had them now for about 2 months",

      "text": "I read a lot about dual flush units, plenty about different features, heights, handles etc. Bottom line is the toilet, installed without an issue, is a great height. The flush is so fast and powerful that I don't see the need for the complexity of a dual flush unit and the refill time is twice as fast as my more expensive Kohlers. For the price, free shipping and good packaging this is one of those safe bets. Word of caution the Toto seats are kind of weak, chose a different brand.",

      "text": "This is an ADA-compliant toilet, and as such sits higher than the standard installations in most older homes. As a consequence, small poops fall further and the splashing water tickles my bottom. This is the only flaw in an otherwise brilliant design. The flush cycle is short and powerful thanks to the ingenious shape and size of the evacuation port -- everything goes down. Very short time needed to refill the bowl, and 360-degree rinse from under the rim means no skid marks from the occasional torpedo turd.",
