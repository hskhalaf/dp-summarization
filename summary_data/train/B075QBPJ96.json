I used the toll-free number, and even though the person was polite, he was not able to do anything except open a case. Apparently support is in Asia, and they take about 24 hours to respond to an email. Long story short is after upgrading the firmware (it happened to come out in the interim), my device works again. In other words, I took it upon myself to upgrade the firmware, it was not suggested by support. If this product had costed $35, then ok it's disposable and just get another, but it cost a lot more than that. I would not recommend.",

The android app worked flawlessly and provides easy access to all recordings without the hassle of ejecting the SD card and inserting it into your computer. I love how the app allows you to change any of the settings on the camera. Only \"wishlist\" would be for extending the power during Parking mode. Otherwise, I am thrilled with the performance of this unit and the quality of the video.",

Crystal clear HD images day or night, parking mode if you want it, and easily viewable recordings via the app. The only issue, and from my understanding it's a Google/Android issue, is the somewhat slow transfer speed of videos via the app. Update: After using it a few months there has been no degradation of quality. I actually captured an accident where a pedestrian was hit by a vehicle while crossing illegally (both parties were fine) and my footage helped the police determine fault. Still recommended.",
