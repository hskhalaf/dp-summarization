      "text": "Purchased this Metro DataVac to clean dust out of a desktop machine that had been running for years without proper maintenance. Easily vacuumed a quarter to a half-inch of dust off of fan screens and heatsinks. Remember to tie down fan blades before vacuuming to prevent spinning them too fast and damaging the bearings! As others have reported the unit can run quite hot after prolonged use. Also, I had to add a rubber O-ring where the hose connects at the front because it kept falling off...there just wasn't enough pressure to keep it tight, the slightest twist would uncouple the hose from the tank. Still better than blowing dust around!",

I highly recommend this for anyone with computers, platform consoles, or servers in a really dusty environment. I added a tube sock to the exhaust/ blow end when vacuuming just to add another layer of particulate capture. It really doesn't need it, but my wife was concerned that it would just through dust around the house. The filter seem to do a really good job though.",
