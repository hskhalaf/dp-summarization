      "text": "I switched to Jack Black's Wax Pomade after trying Clay Pomade. The Clay Pomade had a stronger hold but was extremely sticky and hard to apply. Wax Pomade is an awesome product especially due to the addition of tea tree and sage leaf oils which are good for your scalp. The hold is fairly strong but flexible. If you need to re-style, simply use water and run a comb through your hair and you'll be good as new. For comparison, I've used everything from American Crew, Paul Mitchell, Uppercut, Bumble & Bumble, and Kiehl's. Jack Black really blew away the competition with this one.",

I can say that I've finally found it. It took a few days to determine the right amount to use. You don't need much for great control. I found by working it until it's warm in my hands resulted in the best results. Put it on and comb everything in place. Once it set a little, comb through again and you have a great style and control. Will be purchasing again.",

I have tried several of these Jack Black products with varying degrees of success and this one did the job. I have straight hair and like to change it regularly so I need a good holding product and this did it. Would give it a try!",

      "text": "Love Jack Black products for the most part. I generally prefer thinner less thick products, but this pomade is pretty thick and I still enjoy it. Take a tiny amount get it warm in your hands and apply. Gives a nice texture and good hold without making your hair crusty or crunchy. Scent is how it should be, somewhat manly. Washes out quite easily as well which is nice.",

It smells like wax too, which isn't that great. I put it on my husband's beard and it didn't do anything. The hairs were in the same places as before. Wouldn't recommend.",
