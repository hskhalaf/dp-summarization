It is a stylish, comfortable, and well-fitting basketball shoe that leaves most buyers satisfied with their purchase. However, its cheap-feeling materials may seem a bit uncomfortable and may also wear out quickly.All in all, there is very little to complain about its performance on the basketball court. However, don\u2019t expect too much from these budget Nike basketball shoes. You\u2019ll get precisely what 75 bucks has to offer.",

The back rubs against the worst part of the Achilles and has little padding, bball is out of the question in these. The traction is a joke and a dead giveaway they're not meant for the hardwood. Light, but also cheap, and not in a good way. These have become my gym shoes and are adequate for that, no bball though.",

None of the logos are raised and everything feels like it's a $60 shoe. Horrible grip when playing on the court and had to wipe feet almost every play for better grip. I would say this is a better fashion sneaker than being used as game used shoes. I would recommend this shoe for daily use and that's about it. If you want something better, than go pay $200 for Jordans.",
