I didnt get an allergic reaction to it, but I also didnt put this on my face. One star rating because it is suppose to have a \u201clight\u201d or \u201cmild\u201d scent according to the 5 star reviews..... those are some shady reviwers, cause this stuff stinks and the stink lingers. Furthermore, the seller does not allow return. Very upset.",

Since Jojoba oil is very close to the oil that your skin naturally produces, it doesn't clog your pores. There's not any offensive scents to the oil either which is great because I have sensitive skin that reacts to perfumes. I highly recommend this product.",

My blemishes have improved significantly since starting to use this as my daily moisturizer also. It has a very light nutty scent that is hardly noticeable at first, and completely gone once applied to the skin. An added bonus... it\u2019s certified organic!",

It is non-greasy, and the dropper makes it easy to add some drops to your facial creams or liquid makeup. A wonderful product that can be applied to every part of your body. I always want to have this product on hand. It really works!!",
