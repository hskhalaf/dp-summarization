It seems a bit cheap for the price I paid. It's very sturdy once you sit on it but a bit wobbly while you prepare to sit on it. The legs are placed inside the corners so I assume to help support the weight of the person or persons but also their placement contributes to it's unsteady initial feelings as you are preparing to sit down. I believe if they move the legs to the corners it would improve it's stability.",

I ordered it for an apartment that I plan to only live in temporarily and thus did not want to spend to a lot of money on furniture. I was expecting the typical type of cheap furniture that you can get on amazon: unsturdy pressed wood, dusty packaging, complex assembly. But when I received this, along with the wood table by the same company, I was very pleased to discover that the furnature looked very nice and was made on solid strong wood. Also, the assembly is very easy\u2014literally it only takes 5-10 minutes and is only five steps.",

I\u2019ve assembled a lot of mail-order furniture over the last few months, but this was the best quality I\u2019ve seen in a do-it-yourself kit; this company obviously takes QC very seriously. The BirdRock 34\u201d rubber boot tray is a perfect accessory for shoe storage. So highly recommended I decided to order a second one for my stairway landing.

The styrofoam was wrapped which is nice so you don't get all the annoying little pieces all over your floor. Putting it together was so easy my 6 year old helped. Took under 10 minutes. Sturdy. My only complaint is this is not espresso, more of a cherry wood. But since it is real wood I figure I can stain it darker to match my dining table.",
