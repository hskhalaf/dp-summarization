The biggest issue we have with the tent is getting the section by the side door to pull tight. That's a pain. It never seems to tighten across the top quite right. Other than that, my son and I put the thing together for the first time in about 45 minutes and got it packed back up (and in the bag) in about the same amount of time. After doing it a couple of times I can see this being a 20-minute process both ways.",

This tent is terrific in the rain and warm weather, it fits two queen air mattresses and 2 twin air mattresses easily and we still have room for a few tubs and other camping gear. In a severe rain storm we even had a table and chairs inside to play games. We did use a tarp on the bottom for ground cover but we have had no leaks. The only think I do not like is the set-up time and the amount of rain-flies to pull out but, I'd rather be dry and comfy than wet and set-up fast!",

Wind gusts up to 30mph, and torrential rain. The only water that got in the tent was when the wind pulled the tent stakes up and the rain came in sideways. We are definitely looking forward to using this tent again, hopefully with less volatile weather. We will be buying more substantial stakes for future camping trips.",
