They don't last forever is the only issue, so after a couple months, you might want to change them out. The smell of the sneaker balls never completely fades, but it does significantly decrease over time. If you're wondering about the smell, it's basically baking soda. I highly recommend these for all athletes, gym goers, or those with generally smelly shoes :)",

They deodorize my shoes without making me smell like a linen closet, aren't overwhelming scenty for those with sensitive noses, and the smell doesn't smell \"fake\", just fresh and truly deodorizes rather than just changes the smell. I would recommend these to anyone needing smell free items that may otherwise smell.",

I keep one or two in my gym bag depending on if it was a basketball day or practice for football which provides a stronger stench. These work within about 30 minutes of twisting them open and placing them in your sneakers or gym bag. They have a powdery fresh scent that's not overpowering. And they tend to last close to a month depending on how much of a smell you're trying to eliminate.",
