We used it to grill chicken, burgers, toast sandwiches, etc. Dinner was ready in minutes. The only thing was that the personal grill was too small, so we decided to upgrade to this larger one and give away the personal one. Within two WEEKS of using the grill every other day, a screw on the hinge fell out. I tried to screw it back in, but it keeps falling out, so I believe the plastic has worn down. The grill still works, but the lid is a bit wobbly. Pretty disappointing quality.",

Shrimp doesn't take long to cook, and I was worried that it wouldn't soften the onion very much. It came out beautifully and most delicious. Everything cooked to perfection. Though the skewer closest to the opening needed another minute longer than the others. I feel like if it can cook a shrimp-kabob so well, chicken and other burgers will be a breeze.",

      "text": "This grill is great. My son and husband eat chicken and steaks cooked on this grill like they've never eaten them before. I had to ge used to how long to cook food on it so its really your preference but it does keep food from being dry and removes the fat in the drop pan. The price was too great to pass up too. Been wanting one for a while but needed a large one for my BIG 'OLE boys meals and I am so glad I got it. Cooks fast and if you clean while it is a little warm still it is very easy.",

I just loved it except it was a little too small. This new one is a great size but does not have temperature control, just an on off switch and the plates do not remove. I wish I could find a large one with the other two features. I will continue to use the GR144 until I find a new George Forman. I did consider another brand but for the price of the George Forman and the quality of the grilling you cann't get a better grill.",
