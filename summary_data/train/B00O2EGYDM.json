They weigh 2-3x what the Audiovox remotes on my other vehicle weigh and take several times more pressure to actuate the buttons (no more accidental button presses when fobs are in Your pocket).

      "text": "Great range! High quality sturdy remotes! Most remotes (even my oem for my chevy) are cheaply made and don't last. These feel like they will last forever! The buttons take more force than the oem remote (which is good), no more accidentally locking, unlocking or popping trunk in pocket or purse! Can buy two systems fore different cars and use one remote for both! The only bad thing (with any remote starter) is wiring them up.",

I read all the reviews hoping that it was a great product, only to find out that the time I put into installing it and configuring it I could have had a nice $300 one installed. There has been with the first two units a hood error. The tech support was helpful but there should have been a way of bypassing this issue. To say the least I would not waste my money on something this troublesome.",

Ended up spending way more to have this installed when I could have purchased a different unit in-store and saved $80.",
