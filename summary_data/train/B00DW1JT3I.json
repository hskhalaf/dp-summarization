      "text": "First, let me say that I'm not a NERF warrior. (But that sounds like fun!) I got this to shoo away pigeons from our house. Given our property location a 22 or even a pellet rifle was not an option. I though a NERF round would encourage the pigeons to move on. For that it is perfect. This little blaster has the range to shoot a NERF round to the top of our roof (one story house), and the accuracy is quite good. I have now convinced the neighborhood pigeons that the other houses look much more inviting. Thanks Hasbro!",

Typically I leave a loaded (but smaller) nerf gun on their nightstand so they're not entirely defenseless. Then war breaks out. I haven't had /too/ many jams, although I will say one was so bad that I took the gun apart (there are LOTS of tiny screws!). But it hasn't happened since (could've been a bad bullet and my own carelessness.)",

      "text": "After owning for a few months it broke with relatively light usage. The repair was simple, just a cracked internal plastic piece, but hence the three starts. My previous review is below; my favorite of the nerf guns that are hand pump so far- accurate and the dart magazine is great, fits in a few of my other guns as well. the pump handle being on the bottom in the grip position makes it much faster to fire then the ones that the pump is on top. it does jam occasionally if your darts are getting worn (stepped on, played with by a cat ect) but less than most my models",

Suddenly the darts won't shoot anymore and after a lot of headache the first time this happened we discovered they were getting stuck and sort of scrunched up in the middle of the gun (where a couple are at a time in between being in the cassette and actually being shot). We had to open it up and basically dig out the darts that were stuck with a metal skewer. They were complete trash. Now as soon as it doesn't shoot we know to check there, but we've thrown away numerous darts which is terrible, and still lose some time to time when they get stuck.",

Shooting this thing is fun, loading this thing sucks. After playing with this thing for about a week the bullets starts to take a little shape. If the ammo is not in \"like new condition\" it will jam. Mines jam every time now. Sits in my son's toy box just collecting dust at this point.",

The only 2 things hindering this awesome blaster is it's size, as somebody under 10 would have major problems due to the blaster's size, and it was discontinued in stores, so it costs a little more than usual.",

Must've thrown out a few dozen darts already that it has destroyed due to jamming issues -- after less than a month with moderate usage. Also bought the Rapidstrike, Strongarm and the Triad. Rarely have jamming problems with those. I just missed the return window, too! When it works, it's awesome. But it jams so often it's practically a waste of money for me and, more importantly, I have a disappointed child on my hands.",

Another plus with this is that there's a special chamber you can open to extract jammed darts. Sure comes in handy.
