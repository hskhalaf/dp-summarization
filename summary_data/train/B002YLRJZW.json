The hard plastic doesn't seal well to my floors and I end up sweeping multiple times to get it all in the dust pan.",

This Libman model is light and easy to use, but my only gripe is that it is not angled in the corners and it is difficult to get in those hard to reach places. Additionally, the dustpan itself doesn't have a rubber stopper on the bottom edge, so you have to hold it in order to scoop everything in it or else the dustpan will move.",
