I have really bad allergies which often causes me to have a sore throat & sometimes a bit of nasal congestion but this humidifier removed both of these problems. I also love the fact that it is an essential oil diffuser as well. At night, I use either eucalyptus or peppermint oil because it clears up all of the congestion & I typically use lavender oil throughout the day. This is an amazing product & I would highly recommended it to anyone!!!",

After few nights of using it, my nose doesn't bleed anymore and I can breathe better at night. So far, it is working very well for me and it helped me a lot.",

No leaks on the floor, works very quiet, you can't even hear it at night and also has a great night mode for no light at all and during the day you can use the light mode and it switches colors by itself. Very slick design as well, looks like a part of the furniture. Also has a great option to use essential oils for smell diffusing, will have to give that a try as well. Over all very happy with this humidifier!",

It has a large tank, so it lasts around 18 hours on high power, and I love putting a few drops of essential oils in the tank too. It\u2019s beautiful, and I love the different mist settings, and that you can turn on sleep mode so there\u2019s no light on overnight. We will use this for years to come!",

First one from different manufacturer no one was home to talk to or get it resolved. Easy to fill, clean and use. put out a wide mist that really works. Like that you can also add oil.",

The reason why I put four stars is because I wish the electric cord could be removed from the humidifier itself when I need to fill it with water. Also, I wish we could use it only for the lights as the children love the lights. But overall, great humidifier and I recommend it.",

I also wouldn't reccommend it for a kids room because it doesn't have a lock when it is closed so its basically a little bucket of water.

She\u2019s had a cool mist humidifier her whole life and it seems to help her through the cold and flu seasons. My only hang up is that after a week of use, the motor inside began to sound like it\u2019s reving up and could burst. It takes several times of turning it on and off to get that sound to ease. We\u2019ve tried cleaning it and more but cannot figure out why it wants to be so loud.",

I bought it cause my bedroom gets very dry during the winter and this humidifier really helped me. First of all it is very quite, and it releases a very nice amount of moist in the air. It has 3 different setting you can choose from to release moist and you can also choose the features of having it on with lights or without as you wish. You can also add essential oil and it works just fine. All in all a nice product for sure in my opinion!",

There is an option to have it produce light which is great, especially if using in a child's room as a nightlight. Over all, I would recommend and would purchase again :-)",

Only thing I don't like is it leave about 1/2 maybe less of water that you need to drain if you want to dry it out for any reason or can get yucky if your not using it continually.",
