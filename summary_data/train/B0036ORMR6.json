The sound is very clear and precise, even at low volumes. In fact the noise isolation is probably better than on the RHA. However, after 2-3 month of not particularly intensive use, i got the dreaded \"one bud now plays at 1/4 volume\" problem that made me shy away from Shure earbuds. I think that I will stick to Sennheiser buds when I want something compact, with microphone, iPhone-compatible.",

Additionally, the cable itself makes very loud static noise when your clothes brush on it. If you plan on sitting still while using these, then I think you'll be happy with the purchase, assuming they're functioning per design. Otherwise, keep looking. Regarding getting them replaced, Scosche handles replacements directly. Their technical support told me to mail the earphones with a copy of my receipt and only THEN would they send out a replacement item. That was over two months ago... I still have nothing other than a lack of $50.",

Every time the cord brushes up against something it sounds like you are in a thunderstorm with music in the background. Some cord noise can be expected but the cord on this is horrible. The cord is very limber, flexible and appears as a braided fabric. I would return these if I could. Off to the Apple store, at least they take earphones back, within 14 days.",

I have nothing else to compare it to except the original ear hones that came with the ipod. I'd rather have larger over the ear, head phones, but these will do when exercising etc..",

Now, it's a standard rubber cord. Unfortunately, this was an important feature to me, as I find the fabric-wrapped cords are easier to manage and less likely to tangle.

I will attempt to get a second replacement as the 1 yr warranty is not up. I loved using these headphone more on the replacement set.

As others have noted, there is a little cord noise, but the cord sheathing that causes it is also what makes them durable. My oem cords started fraying after 2 days of working around the house.

The controls work perfectly with my iPhone too. Bravo!",
