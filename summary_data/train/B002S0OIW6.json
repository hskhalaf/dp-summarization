But as I've been getting into real fine furniture building, I decided on some better gear. The difference is huge. I'm not sure of the correct terms; whether it's vibration or feedback or whatever, but this thing just gives me much more control over what I'm doing. It's solid and feels great to use. Feels like I'm a proper gentleman woodworker now. (You know, without all the actual skills maybe. But still... I got a fancy mallet now so I'm 1/2 way there.)",
