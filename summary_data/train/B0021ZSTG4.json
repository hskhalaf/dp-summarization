Im very confident that this lifter is sturdy enough to lift & transfer my heavy cakes & cheesecakes without worrying about it not being able to hold their weight. I highly recommend this QUALITY spatula/cake lifter!!!",

I'm partially disabled so my husband helps me cook, I have often tell to him to grab the Fat Daddy when we are lifting something heavy or unwieldy. It has really come in handy, so happy with this product and purchace!",

I haven\u2019t used it for baking very often because silicone mats are much easier but if there\u2019s any lip on the pan this is more difficult to use.

It works fine for me, though, because I build the pizza on a flat cookie sheet, slide it onto the pizza stone, and then take the pizza out with this spatula when it's done (which would be difficult to do with the cookie sheet).",

      "text": "This is a great tool, especially for a home baker like myself. The offset handle is strong and provides a nice grip. The stainless steel is thick and sturdy. It is slightly heavy but considering that your using it to move cakes/cake layers from point A to point B, I think this very good quality. Also, considering how high food costs are nowadays I don't worry about my costly ingredients ending up in the floor before I can get the finished product to the cake stand! A great buy and arrived the very next day.",

It's come in handy quite a few times, in particular when I've had most of a 9X13 cake that I've wanted to remove in order to store separately and free up use of the pan. So - as my title suggests - it's not something that a new-ish cook/baker should rush to buy, but it's a nice accessory for the baker who \"has everything.\"",
