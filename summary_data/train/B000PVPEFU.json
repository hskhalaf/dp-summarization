I have hundreds of dollars worth of different blushes from Havanna to Clinique and nothing looks as natural, beautiful and flawless as NARS Orgasm.

The color is GREAT, however, and really just gives you a healthy, natural glow. Great for women with fair skin. And the color goes on evenly and stays on all day!

This one has no shimmer and is more of a berry color. I have pale skin with pink undertones and highly recommend Nars blush. The pigments in these blushes are beautiful and definitely worth the money!",

I was so disappointed that after a few months of use the cake started flaking and then started disintegrating. As I stated before this has not happened with the other (much older) blush that I own. I am beginning to wonder if this is a fake, a lower quality product being sold under the name NARS.",
