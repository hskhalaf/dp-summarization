I heard the noises coming from the next room while I was watching TV so I'm sure this is not normal. Definitely won't be trying another.",

I had been warned that they really smell when you first use them and it's true.I don't know why this step can't be handled by manufacturer before shipping.It took a full day before the smell started to go away. AT that point I plugged in the second heater to go through the same process.I never got it to stop smelling because at that point it started leaking oil all over the floor. Didn't order a replacement and now I'm concerned the remaining heater will leak at some point. Will be checking out local retailers and hopefully find one that has a better product. Don't have any idea why this product got such good reviews.",

Make sure your circuitry can handle 1500 Watt before you plug it in and always plug into a surge protector. I only gave it 3 because it did not contain very clear warnings about this. Otherwise, it works ok. One solution might also be to have a separate outlet that goes directly into the breaker box and does not share the circuits with the other outlets.",

Why doesn't it have another side cover? It used to have handles on both sides so it could be moved around. NOW, it only has a handle on ONE SIDE which is impossible to move it with and the other side is way too hot to touch to move it. Please let me know why you changed this heater? To be cheaper???????",
