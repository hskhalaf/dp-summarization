I wear these daily! I haven't been pregnant in over 5 years, and I had nothing on hand to wear. Glad to see something that is modern AND comfortable AND affordable available now. A little tight at first, and after a day, they were perfection. I started wearing them around 14 or 15 weeks... I'm at 18 now. The length is great, color is awesome, and they are very comfortable. Highly recommend.",

I liked the length and look of them...but I need them to be comfortable and not a yoga exercise having to keep them staying up while chasing 3 other small kids around. For the record I ordered the XL and I wear a size 16-18 normally as well as while preggers.",

I'm about 130 lbs and 6 months pregnant and ordered a small. They fit great! The only downside is the belly part seems to fit me well now so I'm not sure how they will fit as I get bigger. That part is not quite as stretchy as I would have liked. Overall can't go wrong with these.",

I think if you have slender hips and don\u2019t mind a super long band these are a decent pair of jeans. I really like the material for the price and they are super cute, they just don\u2019t fit me well at all.",
