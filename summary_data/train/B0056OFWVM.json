      "text": "Bought these because I was tired of figuring out what to do with all the excess strap. Had a 1200 mile journey with the kayak on the roof of my SUV. Just awesome! Straps cinch tight and no strap flapping in the wind! Some reviews say they come loose or don't tighten properly but I think that is operator error. You don't depress the rachet when done and tight like you would with other straps. These you tighten up and leave wherever the last rachet click is. If you bring the rachet all the way down, the strap loosens. Boom schnickety straps yo!",

When not in use they were in my ATV back storage box, or in the back of my car, never sitting out in the weather when not actively used. after a year they started acting up releasing and retracting, I found corrosion of the metal was a problem though they weren't stored outdoors. I now spray them with WD-40 periodically, but they don't work like they used to.",
