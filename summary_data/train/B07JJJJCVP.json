If you are \"upgrading\" from an older base station and have, say a couple of cameras and a doorbell, you will be rewarded with around 20 minutes of \"checking base station firmware\". I may adjust the rating once they fix the zones \"feature\"",

Another very annoying quirk is their tech support because they (Arlo) seem to think that this COVID-19 crises is a fair excuse to cut back on support staff.

      "text": "If you need a camera to detect motion greater than 20 feet away, the Arlo is not for you. They use infrared (IR) technology to detect objects warmer than the background environment. Although this may be good enough for many applications, it does not work beyond 20 feet. My garage is farther than that from the camera so this did not capture any motion. Other brands that don't rely on IR can do this reliably. This important information is not listed in the features here. I only found out after the fact on their website. IR Motion detection won't work for me and I am returning. FYI.",

      "text": "I've had this for a few months now. I've checked and rechecked my settings but so far there's not a significant difference in video quality. Sharp is hardly the word I would use to describe the image quality. The \"spotlight\" was a big selling point for me, but only activates approximately at 8-10ft away (which isn't far when considering guest/intruder proximity) and is the intensity and coverage of turning your cell phone light on. Mildly helpful. The noise cancelling is helpful. Not sure if it was worth the purchase price considering you have to upgrade the base station from Pro 2.",

The signal strength from the base station to the cameras is pitiful. Spent hours moving the station around to try and get a decent signal to the cameras. The activity zone to set and detect motion completely doesn't work. So now every time a car goes by I get an alert. Maybe I can put some tape over the expensive camera lens to block the road off. Seriously disappointed with my purchase. Thought I would add a doorbell but not now. Will start tooking for a similar wired system with app.",
