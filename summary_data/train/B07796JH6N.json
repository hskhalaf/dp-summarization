Update: the company reached out to explain what the problem might be. They offered a new unit and or a refund. I opted for a refund as I don't want to risk the new unit having the same problem. I amended the star from 1 to a 3 only because their customer service was quick to respond and attempt to help.",

      "text": "The unit is ahestetically nice but is not really working, quite disappointing. It is supposed to generate negative ions, I have for years a real ionizer around and what I can say is that no ions are emitted at all. And in fact is not cleaning the air at all. On a real ionizer you can feel the air be moved even without a fan. On this unit, even if the fan is running, is barely possible to \"feel\" the airflow. I have some doubts about the choice to power the unit with a standard USB charger. I would have choose to start with a higher voltage for the high voltage generator.",
