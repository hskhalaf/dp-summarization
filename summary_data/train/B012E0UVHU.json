We are on day 5 of the probiotics and I've already noticed a huge difference in him. He is less fussy and has started regularly passing healthy gas and stools again. They're not cheap, but well worth it in my opinion. Because he's an infant, he only needs 1-2 drops a day. I plan on continuing to use these regularly to help boost his immune system!",

      "FREE KIDS FROM TUMMY TROUBLE - Probonix will help your little one reach a healthy balance of bacteria in the gut, leading to a healthier immune system, better digestion, and lower chances of long-term GI health issues. Probonix could help your child with issues like: gas, colic, thrush, diarrhea, eczema, constipation, asthma, lactose intolerance, and more!",
      "PROPRIETARY FORMULA INCREASES EFFECTIVENESS - For a probiotic to be effective, the live bacterial cultures must survive the harsh environment of your stomach to reach your intestinal tract. Probonix\u2019s one-of-a-kind acid-coating process enables the live bacteria culture to pass safely through the destructive and acidic environment of your stomach and into your gut. Competing products may promise more probiotics per dose, but Probonix Restore will get more of them alive and to your gut.",
      "8 LIVE PROBIOTIC STRAINS - Our liquid probiotic uses an exclusive formula of 8 of the most effective probiotic strains: lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus,bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, and lactobacillus reuteri.",
      "TASTES GREAT AND EASY TO USE - No refrigeration required. The liquid format makes it easy to give to infants and small children. It can be placed directly on the tongue. Or if your child doesn\u2019t want to take the drops directly, under 110 degrees Fahrenheit (temperatures of 110 and above will start to kill off the healthy probiotics in the mixture). The required dosage is small enough that your child won\u2019t even notice it in their drink.",
