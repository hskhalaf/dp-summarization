The pro (and I think the reason the design is as it is) is that the bag is leak-proof (at least when right-side up) and the soft material allows for flexibility in transportation (and what seems like less total space). I'd rather its design than any cons that could be introduced by a break in the bag's seal (if there was a water spout for excess water). I've used this for grocery delivery, groceries, and for camping. Easy clean-up. Excellent bag. Worth the price.",

It's more expensive than the coolers that can be purchased at most stores but the quality is so much better. Definitely worth the price.",
