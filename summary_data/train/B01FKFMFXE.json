Then they can cash in their stars for screen time...or save them up for something special. I'm loving that they are doing their stuff by just looking at the chart without my asking and I'm loving not arguing with them over their screen time. The magnetic stars are awesome! So glad they can be reused over and over unlike stickers. And it comes with I think 70 of each.",

The stars are constantly falling with the slightest bump or brush - the magnets aren't super strong, which I get because it's made for kids, but I do wish they were a little more magnet-y. Lots of good chores/responsibilities come on the magnets already and I like that you can write in your own. Would buy again.",

    "title": "Roscoe Learning Responsibility Star Chart | Customize for 1-3 Kids | Magnetic Chore Reward System",
    "description": "The Roscoe Learning Responsibility Star Chart set helps develop responsibility, goal setting, and co-operation in young children. Designed to address the weaknesses found in other products, our set is the direct result of feedback from hundreds of parents and caregivers. Easy to customize for use as a chore, behavior, incentive, reward, or responsibility chart.\n\n Each set includes:\n\n 1- Dry erase chart and marker. The colorful design is printed on a long lasting dry erase covering. Measuring 16.5 x 13.5 inches, our board is larger than other brands which provides a less crowded space for tracking progress. Use the color coordinated cord to hang it from a nail, hook, or doorknob. The chart is magnetic, and will stick to a refrigerator door or other metal surface.\n\n 3 \u2013 Individual goal magnets. Customize the chart for 1-3 children. Each magnet displays the child\u2019s name, their desired reward, and the number of stars that must be earned for success. Our system allows you to remove unused name magnets from the board so the chart is truly customized for YOUR children.\n\n 12 - Illustrated activity and chore magnets. Each magnet has an illustration and printed text describing a common task or chore. Illustrations allow young non-readers to be reminded of their daily tasks (and we think they are cuter than plain text).\n\n 210 \u2013 Colorful foam magnetic reward stars in three colors. Our star magnets are made of thicker foam and have stronger magnets than other brands. The thick foam makes them easier for small hands to manage and the thick magnets keep them in place. Other brands use thin magnets that end up on the floor and can be a choking hazard.\n\n 1 \u2013 Custom sized storage bag for loose pieces. Our cotton bag is custom sized to hold all 225 magnets AND the dry erase marker. No more unsightly pieces scattered all about.\n\n Model: SC01201",
