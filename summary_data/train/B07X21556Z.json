It takes a while to get used to where to place it in your nose, but you want to make sure those passages are opened up. If I get it in the wrong place, it's a bit to tight with the magnets (hence the 4 for comfort). It won't stop snoring from \"gunk\" on the back of your throat, but I usually use a long gargle of mouthwash to stop that. But it really keeps your airways more open.

      "text": "Embarrassed to say but I snore terribly or so I\u2019m told. Saw this product and thought the price was worth trying even if I ended up pitching it. I use it almost every night (I\u2019ve had them since around Christmas 2019) and I\u2019m told the snoring has completely stopped. It takes a minute to get used to because you\u2019re putting it on a sensitive part on the inside of your nose, but after that initial uncomfortableness wears off it is worth stopping the snoring.",

It's more comfortable than some of the items I found in my local drugstore, like the cones you put in your nostrils - so uncomfortable - and breathrite strips - messed up my skin. This clip also fits my nose on both sides, even the side my septum deviates into, whereas the cones wouldn't fit in there. Overall, I am very satisfied with how it works. My one complaint is that of the 2 clips that came in my package, one wasn't sealed right, so bacteria got in around the magnet, also, the magnet from the other side ended up in the contaminated side. Maybe I can get a replacement?",

He is a very sound sleeper and I can't sleep at all with the racket he makes. This nose ring seems to help, although if he's on his back he still snores quite loudly. When he sleeps on his side, the anti snoring device does help the snoring to stop. I think it becomes a little itchy because he brushes it out, sometimes, in his sleep and we have to look thru the covers to find it the next morning, but he says it's comfortable and he doesn't even realize he scratches it out of his nose.",

I could probably eliminate the nostril itch altogether by trimming my nose hairs, but it hasn't bothered me enough to do anything about it yet.",
