It is very good quality stainless and is plenty large enough for my needs. I can fit several vegetables in at one time. Both of the pots I will use it on have large handles, but this is not a problem because this steamer sits high enough over the pots to leave room for the handles. This steamer exceeded my expectations! I am so pleased I purchased it.",
