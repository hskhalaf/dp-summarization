It's highly disappointing that the manufacturer doesn't properly clean this product after the manufacturing process. It's a health risk to ship products used for food preparation without removing all chemicals.",

I had to soak mine overnight and still had to scrub like crazy to remove egg/potato casserole. Second, the little \"rim\" toward the bottom that allows the pans to stack is HORRIBLE to try to clean! Why couldn't they have made these so that the rim was only on the outside and on evident on the inside? I spent 30 minutes cleaning both of these with toothbrush and scrub brush after forgetting to spray them........ Wish there was a teflon coated or equivalent version.",

Do it several times as long as you get black gunk when you run a paper towel in the inside groove. Black gunk will be in the paper towel.
