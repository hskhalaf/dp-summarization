Instead I jumped on Amazon and found these FORTEM Ratchet Tie Down Straps, I really liked that they not only came with a zip up case but that they also are high visibility green. This worked great and with out issue. 4 1\" widespread straps with bar straps as well for 24.99 is a great deal for these. I will recommend these to family and friends.",
