Its screen has a disappointingly low resolution, its processor doesn't put up much of a fight and it has an 8- rather than 13-megapixel camera. Unless you crave 4G, the Motorola Moto G is a much better buy as it offers a better screen, the same processor and costs half the price.If however you're after the best mobile tech but in a more pocketable size, Sony's superb Xperia Z1 Compact is where your money should go.",

The phone worked flawlessly so far since May 1st, and I am sure it will in future. Thanks Amazon.",
