Manual specified light should only be on when pushing the light button on the remote or when charging has completed. The second collar does not transmit the signals correctly. It is supposed to transmit for as long as you hold the button or time out automatically after 10 seconds. I\u2019m worried with this fault, it either will not work when sending the signal or perhaps get stuck beeping/vibrating/shocking. I have emailed the company twice with no response before writing this review.",

That's all it took - one time - and she learned. She is a 60lb Staffordshire Terrier, otherwise tough as nails. So, this is a good quality product and effective training tool. In the wrong hands, however, it could be a tool for cruelty, so, use wisely and beware of who you allow to operate the remote control.",

One of my dogs needs it at about 78 and the other at about 94-95 before they react to them. That's one thing that's good about these; the ability to fine-tune them.

The collars will disconnect from the controller after sleep mode for an extended period (make sure you check every time or you will not be able to correct the behavior).

We're using this to reduce barking, digging, chewing on our fruit trees, and harassing our rabbits.

The collar itself is amazing and works wonders, but I have TWO dogs, so now I have to switch this collar on and off of each and train them completely separately because I only have one that works out of the package of two. Makes training much more frustrating. (It came fresh out of the box not working-never responded once) would like to send one back for a partial refund.",

Our use of these collars and purpose was to deter barking, and it did that beautifully during the time in which they worked. Our use of them was on the VERY low side. We used them steadily at time of purchase and for about a month - then only as needed for the behavior modification. So it is disheartening that they with such little use are worthless now. :-(",

When that didn't work, they sent me a free replacement. They care about lot about their customers' satisfaction. It says a lot when a business cares. Now my 3 dogs are being trained to behave better- staying in the yard, controlling their barking, and not chewing my kids' toys. There are multiple levels to correct bad behavior. You start with the lowest recommended level and increase as needed. Very happy with the product and their customer service is awesome.",

My only problem is both collars work when set to number 2 but when the collars are set to number 1 on the remote they don\u2019t work. I\u2019ve tried both collars as number 1 with no sound/vibrate/shock. I\u2019ve tried both collars as number 2 with sound/vibrate/shock all working. When the collars are working I see a complete change in attitude with my dogs. Our biggest problem is jumping on people and jumping on counters. With the collar I can easily correct the behavior while I\u2019m busy doing other things. Disappointed mine didn\u2019t work properly, but would recommend to others.",

Overall I found it so easy to use and quick to learn. Which is nice. The collars come very long so you can size it up to any dog breed and when you get it at the length needed for your dog, you can easy just cut it off. Or leave it.",

They immediately stop what they are doing and run right to us. Great training tool and prevention/end of farm animal deaths (it comes down to the dogs going or loosing poultry, etc. These collars saved the puppies. ) Cons: Only one charger comes for both collars which is inconvenient, since our pups wear these 24/7.
