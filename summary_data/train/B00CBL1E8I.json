Renting a trailer soon and want it to be secure when on location, this one is too big of a question mark to be trusted.",

It is a very sturdy anti-theft mechanism that I'm going to purchase for my camper trailer now that I see how well it works for my regular trailer. I highly recommend for everyone and it works for the larger tires as well",

However, like any lock they really are for appearances as someone can grind it off in a few seconds with a cordless tool. Nonetheless I do like having it on my trailer as makes me feel a bit more comfortable about leaving it out. Do wish it could go one size smaller in width. Will fit lots of sizes of tires which is a plus and comes with built-in lock.",
