They are perfectly comfy around his waist and a little big throughout his crotch, but the Medium size was getting tight on his hips. Even a little big on him, they still hold all of the fluid well, and he actually pees the diaper and stays asleep, so they are big accidents. I think his sheets have been wet maybe three times in a year wearing UnderJams. We couldn't be happier. :)",

I'm not sure if UnderJams are more of a backup option, or good only for small children, but my son still wets every night and is right between sizes (so we size up) and washing the sheets became a daily task as long as we were using these. We will be sticking with GoodNites until he stops nighttime wetting.",

I\u2019ve had to ask my son to remember to feel them and put the thicker side in front, which he may or may not remember to do.
