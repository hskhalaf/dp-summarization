Went with wires connection because of easy install should have know better.",

That was larger than was available in several spots. I had to get creative to get the camera wired to the back-up lights thru the 4Runner lift gate. Once it was wired, the camera and display worked well. It has been installed less than a week so no idea about reliability yet.",

What I did, because I already had installed the first that was wireless, I installed just the monitor and used the existing camera and it worked perfectly. Then, I thought what the hell, I installed the camera that came with it and the picture quality was way better. Guess what? This is my full time back up camera. You won't be disappointed.",
