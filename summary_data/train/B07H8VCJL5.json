It sense objects and avoids them so you can direct it by waving your hand at it. When you want it to stop, you just catch it is in the air. We've had a blast with it. For indoor use, it's great because it doesn't bump into anything. The one time we took it outside, the wind blew it away because it is very light and quite small, maybe 4 inches in diameter.",

The drone has already fallen several times from 5+ feet, but I dont think it will last many more falls. Its a little expensive for this build quality. Update : After my son used it for a few more times, it is now showing signs of losing its sensing of obstacles. It hit the ceiling and hit the wall a couple of times.",
