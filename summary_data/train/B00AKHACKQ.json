Intonation was spot on. Bridge overly complex...will make string changes unnecessarily difficult. Legs work fine. Terrific gig bag. Really love the guitar, especially at this price point. Play several times a day. Using mostly E7th. (Would like to get an 8 string console in C6th next, but am not crazy about the Rondo natural ash finish). Well done!",

    "title": "SX Lap 2 Ash 3TS Electric Lap Steel Guitar w/Bag",
    "description": "This full size American swamp ash body lap steel features 36 frets and offers a single coil pickup for clear and bright sound. Unlike a typical guitar, the strings of a lap steel are not pressed to a fret when sounding a note; rather, the player holds a metal slide called a steel (or tone bar) in one hand, which is moved along the strings to change the instrument's pitch while the other hand plucks or picks the strings. It is perfect for Blues, Rock, Hawaiian, Country, Bluegrass, and Western Swing. The strings are spaced widely, with 3/8\" between each one. This makes it very easy and enjoyable to play. The single coil pickup has 8K ohm resistance. Measurements Overall length: 36 1/2\" Body length: 13\" Scale length: 24 3/4\" Width at lower bout: 8 3/4\" Width at upper bout: 6 9/16\" Body length 13 3/4\" Width at the nut: 2 5/16\" Width at the 12th fret: 2 5/8\" Width at the 20th fret 2 7/8\" Body thickness: 1\" String spacing at the nut: 1/4\" (2 1/16\" overall) String spacing at the bridge 3/8\" (2 3/4\" overall) String sizes: .010,.015,.017,.022w,.028,.032,.038,.052",
