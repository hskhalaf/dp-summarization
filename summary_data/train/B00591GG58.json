When storing the handles inside the skillet make sure you put down paper towels to avoid scratching the non-stick surface. Also, watch the temp as it heats up quickly. It pulls a lot of power just like a slow cooker so make sure it's plugged into it's own outlet. But warnings aside this is a keeper.",

Frying five (5) eggs at a time reveals a \"hot spot\" in one corner, so that egg needs to come out about 30 seconds before the other four (4). Otherwise, the yolk is almost totally hard while the others are perfect with the whites immediately surrounding the yolks are slightly runny.",

Great for quick one pan dishes as well. I do not put in dishwasher, no need as it cleans up so easily why bother. I will check back in in a couple of months to update.",

This little honey kept us from starving during our kitchen remodel, when I could prepare an entire dinner in it (meat at one end, potatoes at the other, vegetables in the middle). It's a snap to clean up, as well. Just be careful to use utensils that won't scratch the coating.",

I've cooked all sorts of different items in this from meats to creamy sauces and it works very well. My only quibble is that it doesn't heat evenly, but it's never caused me any major problems. It also stores away very nicely.",

I had it about 8 months and hated it the whole time - then one morning it just stopped working! So that solved my problem - I got another Presto and I LOVE it. I think too that they improved the heat element because it is cooking so evenly. I will not buy another brand again!",
