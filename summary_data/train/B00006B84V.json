      "text": "I have used CH products for many years and they have not disappointed. The Flightstick Pro has one big advantage over most other joy sticks. It is ambidextrous. I currently use two Flightstick Pro\u2019s working together to provide all the functions required for a Combat Flight Simulation. They work great once the functions / combinations have been relegated to the subconscious. The only down side to using the two Flightstick Pro\u2019s together is that some flight simulations will not recognize each joystick separately, thereby reducing available functions. As with all CH Products the Flightstick Pro is very well made. And, I do not work for CH! :)",
