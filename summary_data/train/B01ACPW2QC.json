This foundation is fairly heavily pigmented, so my skin ends up feeling smoother, softer, and the wrinkles and pores far less defined than with other products. Has SPF, which I always have to have on (my other color is lobster- there is no in between.) Bonus- despite the fact that it's heavily pigmented, it does not feel heavy on the face. Two thumbs up!",

I will say that it does make your foundation stay on and wear better throughout the day. It is easy to apply with a makeup sponge. It comes out white but blends into the skin with no tint of any color at all. So it's ok for your foundation longevity throughout the day but does zero on blurring or minimizing or hiding pores.",

That product is not even close to being the same shade I had. The new packaging 205 product was much lighter. So went immediately to Amazon and was lucky to find the old packaging there. I don't know why or what the difference is in the shades, but I am very fair and the new packaging product 205 made me look dead.",

Because if the olay in it, there was a sort of slip feel to it but not in a oily way. It felt like it was hydrating the dryer parts of my skin, and controlling oil where I needed it.",

Smells nice but not overpowering. Very nice finish and I am not oily or caked up at the end of a long shift. Will buy again in a different shade next time",

Reminds me of using bb cream. It blends in well with my skin and stays on throughout the day, I don't think this would work with oily skin though. For the price, it comes with a lot of product. Would definitely recommend for anyone on the go :)",
