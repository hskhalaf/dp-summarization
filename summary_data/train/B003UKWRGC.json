After using the template to sink sleeves and screws to hang the box, I was not happy with the security of the box. The lock is great and its built like a TANK. But a thief could, with no tools, just lift it right off brick wall it was installed on. I drilled a single hole thru the middle of the front plate and that secured it well.",

Highly Recommend!!!",
