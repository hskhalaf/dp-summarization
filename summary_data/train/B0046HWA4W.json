Now she has this huge tunnel. Her dog loves it & runs through it with ease. Her first tunnel was a cheap/small kids tunnel from Ikea. This one is 3Xs as long! Only complaint: The stakes are wimpy. They bent as she pushed them into the ground (didn't use a hammer -simply pushed by hand.) We'll have to buy some camping stakes. Hope I was helpful!",

I like that it can be S-shaped or rounded, but it doesn't compress into a smaller size very well. A regulation tunnel has the braces about 4\" apart; These are twice as wide so when compressing, the fabric inside hangs down and obstructs the tunnel itself. I haven't yet figured out how to compensate for that. On the positive side, it's lightweight and stores flat, though it takes a few minutes to get inside the case.",

The spikes it comes with bend too easily, and using stronger spikes that actually stay in the ground cause the attachment bits on the tunnel to rip off in a matter of 2-5 uses. I maybe have three attachment bits still on the tunnel. Maybe if you used tunnel bags it would be better. Overall, you get what you pay for, and the price really can\u2019t be beat if you don\u2019t mind some additional jerryrigging.",

      "text": "I love the tunnel. It is Medium grade material- withstands our dogs running through it. Long enough to put a curve in it when it is set up. Fold up easily. 2 Problems with it- 1. you can not shorten the tunnel to make it less than 18 feet because the extra material between the supports crumples up INSIDE the tunnel and makes the pathway slightly obstructed and smaller and confusing for the dogs. 2. the anchors are only 6 inches long and flimsy- they easily pull out of the ground. I had to replace them with heavy duty tent stakes to anchor the tunnel. I still would recommend this tunnel for the average family training their noncompetitive pets.",

When I opened the box the first thing I discovered. One of the handles on the cover it's in, is totally torn off! I can't understand how, however packed the item did not notice this problem. I sew, so of course I will re-attach the handle. I will be hoping the stitching on the tunnel is more durable. Thank You",

The metal hoops (the small ones made to put the metal poles in so the tunnel holds in place) are rusted and caused the material to have rust stains. There's also black spots in places and I can't identify what caused those. Although it's pretty stained, I'm not going to take it back because it'll eventually get dirty outdoors anyway, and at least it doesn't have any holes in it. However, I can see people being upset over those things...",

The 18 foot length is wonderful because you can adapt it to many configurations, even using it zigzag around poles or linking one room in the house to another. I would highly recommend it. We've even had 2 dogs running thru it and playfully tumbling all the way thru it as they made it thru the tunnel.",

When the dogs are running through the tunnel the stakes keep it from sliding across the ground or from rolling. I would buy this item again, but I doubt I will have to, this is a well made item!",
