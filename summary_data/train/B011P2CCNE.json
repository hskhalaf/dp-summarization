I know it sounds weird and confusing but if you wear a size L in t-shirts or L in jackets and coats place an order for an XL and it will fit like a L even though the coat may come in with a tag saying \"XXL.\" I must say this jacket has a beautiful texture and it is very this, which you should already expect from a down jacket. I will be ordering the grey version of this jacket soon, I am very happy with my purchase.",

Very impressed! To compare it as an extra to my Granite Gear, is a huge compliment. I will most probably \"water guard this jacket.\"",

Based on other reviews, I sized up to an XL but it was slightly too roomy (usual size is M), so I think the L would've fit better. I can't say whether it's warm or not since it wasn't tested outside.

I can't be certain that the lighter weight is attributable to less down filling, but I suspect that's the case. Still, the ZSHOW jacket is good enough for casual wear.",

I do see feathers coming out sometimes once or twice so far in a month of daily usage, I don't know if I should expect to be perfect with the money I paid for this. I doesn't bother me. Handles pretty well in cold as well. Very stylish and looks really good.",

      "text": "This coat is super warm. The best thing about it is the fact that it cuts out virtually all of the wind. I was very glad I brought this coat along to a funeral I had to attend. I stood outside in low 30 degree temperatures with a 25 mph steady wind with some gusts up to 35 mph for at least 45 minutes. This coat passed the test with flying colors in my book! Will definitely buy again if the need arises.",

So I bought Small but Instead, It fit me, I am size S-M woman. I think it was a mistake in the label because inside the tag's jacket says XS and tha paper tag to label price etc, says Small. When I bough the Large size both of the tags match. So at this point I just ordered Medium, hopeful that is the right size.",
