I ended up throwing them out, because I need that handle. There is still one left from the original four, but it's of course the orange, which is my least favorite color, and so not used much.",

The only reason I'm not giving them a 5 is that they say 16oz which is technically true if you fill them to the absolute top; what they have is actually 14oz of usable space. I'm glad I got them but this is the typical push the numbers as far as you can stuff. So if you want a mug that really keeps the drink cold you should like these, and chances are you're not as persnickety as I am. :) At least for your sake I hope you're not.",

Last week the bottom fell off the red mug and the gell was oozing out everywhere. I\u2019m now down to two mugs and afraid same thing will happen to them so I have discontinued use and will search out another brand.
