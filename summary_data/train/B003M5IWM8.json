They both have the same 3-hole mounting screws. You need to cut a 29mm hole saw groove through the plastic face and a 1/2\" center hole, both only 1/16'\" or so deep. I will use up my supply and then go to the 8-hole system. The sander works just as fast as my PC, but is quieter and smoother. Overall I am pleasantly surprised.",

With the right grit of paper, the sander had no problem getting through multiple layers of ancient paint where we tore off a porch that didn't belong. The dust collection system works better than any sander I have used; that's especially important to us with a house this old. It's also super easy to change the sanding discs and the pad really grips, unlike some sanders where the sandpaper starts to migrate off the pad a few minutes after you change it.",

Dust collection bag works well, but I hooked up a $10 washing machine drain hose over a #10 o-ring to my shop vac for near dustless sanding. Very comfortable to use for extended time one or two handed and easy to control due to design of main handle + adjustable secondary handle. Glad I did my research, but wish I would have bought this years ago.",
