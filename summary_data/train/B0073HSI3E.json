I put up with the extra work on the audio in order to get the 1080P. Screen and scene framing is smaller too. Quality is going downhill. I make 'films' not backyard videos.",

I took the memory card from old camera and now it works. Very frustrating but ok now. I guess if worse comes to worse I can buy a new memory card.",

Other cameras have a bad delay from the time you push the button until it takes the picture. This one is almost instantaneous. It's not as fast as a DSLR, but you don't lose your shots either. We've had several cameras in the past from the likes of Samsung, Vivitar and others, but we've liked all the cameras from Nikon. They're responsive, slim and do they're job.

I am even thinking of returning it.",

I like the CMOS sensor and optical zoom on this camera, but the macro is terrible. I use this camera for work and I could never take closeups of anything low-light or anything reflective like stainless steel. I started taking my dirty sensor Canon back to work because the macro there was great. Next camera I'm going for a Canon CMOS sensor ELPH like the 320 or 330 HS.",
