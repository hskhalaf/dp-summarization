There isn't really an easy way to have it cut thru a sandwich :( you have to basically cut each slice of bread and then make your sandwich. You cant make a Turkey sandwich and then cut the whole sandwich it doesnt cut all the way thru and then starts tearing the bread apart. The metal \"cheese\" cutters are bomb dot com. Bees knees. I personally would love the plastic sandwich cutters in metal but gave me the idea to use the metal cookie cutters, we are satisfied :)",

Her teachers even asked me about it because they were so impressed. I definitely think you should cut the bread using these before putting anything inside. It\u2019s less messy and easier to get a good cut, and then add the PB&J or anything else :)",

The yellow love the little animal picks for fruit or cheese. I haven\u2019t tried the small shape cutters yet. I\u2019ve used regular cookie cutters for their sandwiches in the past but these seem to work better as they are deeper. So fun!",
