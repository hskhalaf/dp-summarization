Curls via the flattening iron are super in and also happen to be the one thing I can\u2019t do with my hair.. UNTIL NOOWWW!!! This bad boy is literally the perfect tool for curling or straightening your hair. It does have a \u2018lock\u2019 feature which I found annoying at first because my hand kept accidentally touching/locking it mid curl, but I\u2019ve found that it actually helps to curl my hair when it\u2019s locked? Personal preference. It\u2019s definitely a learning curve, but with some practice, I\u2019m pretty sure I will rule the world of effortless curls eventually. I\u2019ll keep you posted ;)",
