This company makes no attempt to hide ingredients or fillers...what you see is what you get. Powder peanuts...no salt, no sugar. 100% goodness! I can make as much or as little as I want, make it as thick or as creamy as I want, can make it with water or almond milk, and can add my own stevia to make it as sweet as I want. Spreads wonderfully and works well in baking too! Great price point for as much product that you get. Will continue to order!!",

So a bit of Peanut Powder helps! Ideally, I'd like to use more, but I'm on a budget. I also like adding a bit of water and dipping fresh banana in. REALLY cool drink: fresh or frozen banana, almond milk (great source of calcium), Peanut Butter Powder, and maybe some greens (not too many), ice cubes and wow wow wow! Healthy and yummy!! I could live on that if I had the money!!",

My only complaint with the product is the scoop which has a very short handle making it difficult to scoop without making a mess especially towards the bottom of the container. The reason this is frustrating is I've used their Creatine as well (similar container) but the scope is longer and more appropriately sized.",

While the powdered peanut butter does not taste like Jif (b/c Jif adds a bunch of sugar and hydrogenated oils), it still tastes like peanuts without being overbearing. I put it in my smoothies, oatmeal, and paleo pancakes, and it lasted me a few months, so the price was definitely worth it. I will definitely be buying more in the future.",
