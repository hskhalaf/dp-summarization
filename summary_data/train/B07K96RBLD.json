People felt that it was comfortable, secure and non-irritating as it wrapped the foot. The quality of the components was also praised. Meanwhile, a consistent complaint among users is the poor construction of the shoe, which has resulted to a lack of durability.",

        "The upper unit gained favor for being breathable and flexible",
        "Some runners felt that the pronation support given by the Brooks Adrenaline GTS 19\u2019s midsole was more substantial than the ones in the previous iterations",
        "The general quality of the components wasn\u2019t overshadowed by the price, some runners noted",
        "they felt that this shoe had an affordable starting price",
        "Purchasers liked the fact that, for a stability shoe, the Adrenaline GTS 19 didn\u2019t have a heavy build",

Showed them to my osteopath, a man who always knows more than I do about everything. Was amazed when he told me they are the only show he recommends. So that's rare praise indeed. I ordered half a size larger than my normal shoe and they fit perfectly.",

However I do find the shoes a little wider than preferred (I have moderately narrow feet) and thus these don't quite feel as solid and supportive as I was looking for. That said they were comfortable enough on first outing (slow 5 miles) with no adverse effects. Generally I can't help but feel that all running shoes regardless of maker seem less robust and long-lasting than they used to be, as the 'minimalist' fashion has taken over - or is that just a sign of me getting old?",

Overall I highly recommend the GTS 19, a big step up in comfort from my asics and also 40 euros cheaper on Amazon than any sports shop near me. Short Update: Just did a 10k race in these shoes and they were perfect and come into their own over longer distances. I'm going to get another pair just to have them. A+",
