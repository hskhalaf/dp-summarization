I'm about 180 pounds and 60 years old, but it was embarrassing to have the last swing crack and cave in. This new one was really easy to put together and I'm betting it will outlive me. The chains it hangs by are a little heavy and I think the maker should consider using 'familiar' porch swing chains. The sounds the swings make are as important as the overall feel of the swing.",
