      "text": "A bit tricky to get the spigot and thermometer set properly. Used lots of teflon tape to get it right. Ball joint on spigot does have some lubricant on it which would definitely ruin your beer. Boil the heck out of it prior putting on kettle to get rid of the lube. Pot held up well for the boil...no scortching and easy to clean. Pot bottom seemed a bit concave. When I added the 4+ gallons and grain, pot continually rocked. I plan on hammering it down to level it off.",
