He asked me for help on some of the problems since I am a math major and he did not understand the solutions provided. However, at least two of the problems I noticed solve the problem a very difficult way. I had to show him a much simpler way to solve it. I also noticed that on one problem all the multiple choice answers are incorrect.",
