It only plays 1 song (ABC's) and it stops halfway through and you have to push the button for it to continue. I chose this one over some other Mega Blok options because the letters are printed on. My kid loves to pick off stickers and I'm so tired of placing stickers on toys, especially when I know he'll peel them off.",
