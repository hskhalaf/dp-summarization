I stuffed it with a couple of moving blankets to make it heavier than if I'd just used sheets or towels, which gave the back a more solid feel. Seems durable but I would recommend turning it occasionally so your club is not always impacting the same spot. A worthwhile gift or purchase for the golfer who likes to practice in the off season or between trips to the range.",

I would rather go play golf or go to the range and get an idea of the actual ball flight. I've used this bag with a video camera to try to see if my swing looks good. If you are looking for an impact bag, it seems to be made solidly and has held up fine during the times I use it. I would prefer something that can give feedback so I know if I'm doing something wrong, but I'm okay with this in between trips to the course or range.",

It features a small plastic clip on the bottom edge that you're supposed to put over a stake -- if you don't hit the bag straight on, it should spin around the stake. The clip is kinda small, so it's a bit limiting. A ground spike from another sports net should work. I don't know how long that clip will last, though. Of course, you don't want to hit this thing at full power, anyway.",

The bag comes flat upon delivery but then you just stuff it with towels and sheets. Then you can swing away at the bag but at less than 75% of your swing. I thought I would use indoors more but I didn\u2019t realize how loud the impact was. Now I\u2019m just using it outside. If you\u2019re an avid golfer then this is a worth addition to your practice tools!",
