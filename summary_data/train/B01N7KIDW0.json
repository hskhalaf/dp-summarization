I will purchase another brand/type of thermometer. 10/24- Raising to 4 stars for the Customer Service of seller.

      "text": "The thermometer works great. I like the adjustable depth and the ability to rotate the shaft to allow easy view of the temp. What is quite frustrating is the flimsy clamp. It's thin metal is too weak to grasp the pan, and too narrow to allow the thermometer to remain upright. I slid a kabob spear under the flat top of the clamp to keep it from leaning. Usable, but the manufacturer should go back to the drawing board. Or better, the test kitchen.",
