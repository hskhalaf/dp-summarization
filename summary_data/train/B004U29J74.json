Instead of repairing it, They sent me a whole new system - same model but an upgraded version - free of charge. The new one works better than the older model. The sound is crystal clear and the touch screen works well using your fingers. It is packed with features at a very good price - as good as the much pricier name brands. The only con is the volume knob is small and needs a rubberized surface to make it easier to use.",
