The remotes did not work initially and required technical attention for it to function properly; 3. The remote with the monitor came with a battery installed in addition to a spare battery which is unusual and gave me the impression that the system was used. In addition, having the battery installed prior to connecting the alarm posed the risk of damaging the unit due to leakage from the unit.",

I returned it s I cannot comment on its function. Maybe it was packaged poorly as there was no clear protector on that screen but I figured it shouldn't have been handled that roughly to cause that many scratches and damaged the LCD portion",
