While most foam cushions collapse with little use and soak up water like a sponge, Fiskars uses durable EVA foam that protects knees from hard, rough, cold or damp surfaces. Plus, it won't absorb moisture, resists rips and withstands abrasions for seasons of comfortable use. Ideal for gardening, it's also handy for refinishing floors, cleaning out the fireplace, organizing under the kitchen sink, and any other job that brings you to your knees. Sized at 11 inches wide by 18 inches long by 3/4-inch thick, it fits handily in a garden tool caddy or hangs neatly on the wall via the convenient carrying handle.",
