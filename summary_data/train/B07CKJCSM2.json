This update to the long-running series of neutral shoes was deemed worthy of the Rider name, mainly when it came to its general quality and efficacy on the roads. People loved the visual design, the agreeable fit profile, and the sturdy build of this footwear. Inversely, some structural elements of the shoe were criticized for its weight, small toe box, and uncomfortable overlays. Overall, the Wave Rider 22 is deemed to be a remarkable running shoe with reliable functionalities.",

I stumbled upon Mizuno's Wave Rider on RunRepeat.com. These shoes are fantastic! They are similar to the Brooks Ghost, however they are a bit lighter and there is more cushion in the heel. Additionally, they have a better fit, more snug. I noticed they do a run a tad smaller than Ghost. I wear a 9 1/2 in the Brooks and ordered a 9 1/2 for this pair. One may notice a little less room in the toe box area.",

There is no indication on the box, or the shoe, as to the width, but the product description states a \"D\" width, so I assume it's a \"D\". I will need to return these shoes, as they are too narrow for me - and perhaps have to shop for a new brand of shoe.",

Just bought the Knit R2's to replace this pair. My only complaint for this last pair of 22's -- the stitching of the logo on the upper would chafe on long runs causing blisters. I'm chalking that up to a random manufacturing anomaly. It was only on one foot and I never had it on earlier versions. The Knits have the logo painted on which eliminates that possibility. Mizuno should consider that for all shoes, it'll probably cost them less and reduce weight anyway. But that's just my opinion.",
