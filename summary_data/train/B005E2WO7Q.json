      "text": "What's not to love about a Kohler product? It's got clean lines and looks great. More pricey than other brands, but in my opinion worth it. Little differences make the product -- for example, the pedestal on this sink has an approximately one inch layer of porcelain at the base of it. So, instead of one continuous hollowed out piece (which many other brands have), it has a very solid base and balances much better on the floor. I was not incentivized to write this review, and I paid for this product. I just happen to love Kohler products, and this is no exception.",

It's substantial and doesn't look too small, it arrived in perfect condition and looks clean and minimal in the bathroom, which is what we hoped for. Very nice quality for a reasonable price.",

Mounting could be a lot better since you have to dry fit it and squeeze your hand inside the crevices to mark drill holes with a stubby pencil (I was lucky to find a golf pencil handy). I have thick walls with tile on top of the drywall which needed a longer mounting screw. I got it to work but the screws really should be 1/2\" longer. Also, the pedestal base seems to stand a bit further away from the wall than others I've seen. Depending on your bathroom, you may have the plumbing too exposed from the sides.",
