      "text": "This thing has an overall nice design. It fits well and it's simple, both in looks and functionality. Unfortunately, the e-ink screen is very artifact-y with left over bits of text or images getting left over after screen refresh or text and images not showing very clearly to begin with. It brings the quality of the device down quite a lot for me. The multiple apps it's paired with are overly complex and poorly designed (visually). I regret buying this and really can't recommend it.",
