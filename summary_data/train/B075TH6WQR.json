Amazon Customer Service have been really good about replacing units, but I am now getting a 3rd unit shipped to me (at no additional cost, I might add). The first 2 units have the same problem: Water flows into the cup before any cup-size button has been pressed, and the water is cold. Maybe the 3rd unit will be okay, but I'm not confident that it will be. ***Update: The 3rd unit malfunctions just like the other two. Unless the manufacturer can convince you that they have fixed the problem, stay away from this model.***",

You can make both larger and smaller cups of hot beverages compared to the original Kuerig which is a big bonus for us because we have oversized cups that weren't quite filled when we used our original Kuerig. Buyer beware the color matching, probably best to go with black unless you're able to color match",

I did not take either water receptacle on and off to refill the water, but rather I filled it by using a water pitcher. I am calling Amazon tomorrow to complain about this problem.

I also like the navy blue color which is nice in our white kitchen with other blue items. Only complaint so far is the tray comes off way too easily.

I have never had a Kuerig but the one we had at my last job never had this problem, so I thought I would mention it.",

Keurig did not make a handle or anything to hold, so you basically have to hold it with both hands and try to slide it into place. If the resorvoir is not properly seated, you will know because the low water light will stay lit. Another thing I discovered is that the low water indicator will not go out if the filter is clogged.",

The first cup of the day takes a little time for the element to heat but after that as long as it stays ON then the coffee is immediate!! I am so glad I bought this model.",

The options for cup choices make it a favorite of everyone in our house, including our guests that visit from time to time.

Worked great, quiet and easy to use. 3 nights in a row the machine shuts off during the filling and when you open the K-cup compartment, grounds and hot water go everywhere. I cleaned it up and thought maybe it was because of generic store K-cups so I tried brand name and the same thing happened. Did multiple cleaning cycles and nothing helped. It still randomly shuts off even when cleaning or running hot water through it. I was really disappointed with this machine and it malfunctioning. I am hesitant to buy another.",
