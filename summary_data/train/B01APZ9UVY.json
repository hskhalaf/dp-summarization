They're pretty small, so they work well for our training sessions, and the soft texture means they are easy to eat. I'd buy them again, but looking over the ingredients they look to have added sugar (brown sugar and molasses), so I might search out something a bit healthier next time.",

Two of my dogs LOVE this Salmon flavor best, the other dog really didn't like it, but likes the Turducken well. These treats are quite small, yet soft enough I can still break them in half if I want to, without a mess. I'd HIGHLY recommend these for training!!!",
