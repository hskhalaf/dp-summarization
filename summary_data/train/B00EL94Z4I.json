      "text": "I don't recommend plastic screen protectors for tablets because, in general, tablets are more protected than phones due to having a closing case with edge protection. If you don't have one of these cases for your tablet, I suggest getting it. While plastic will offer more protection against impact, your tablet likely isn't going to take impacts like your phone would. Plastic also smudges a lot more than glass, and it doesn't feel as nice. It also displays a yellow tint which over time will get worse. It's not a bad screen protector, but it just feels cheap. Get a glass one instead. For phones, plastic is OK.",

I have found that tech armor is by far the easiest to install with no bubbles. They almost always go on clean the first try. Also the \"dust tape\" that they include in the package is very helpful. It allows you to remove little specks of dust or hair without sticking you fingers under the protector. I have previously used scotch tape for this purpose but their tape is stronger and does a much better job. I would definitely recommend this brand.",

The protector is completely invisible unless you look carefully at the edges, and as far as I can tell touch responsiveness is not affected at all. Application was fiddly and stressful, but that's the nature of the product, not any kind of design flaw. The included bubble removal card, dust pick-up tape strips, and (very) small microfiber cleaning cloth are helpful. I feel much better knowing that my baby has been protected by a Smart Case and the Tech Armor screen protector since day 1.",

For an iPad, I recommend starting the pressing at the camera end to align that hole correctly, because that alignment is more critical, difficult, and less forgiving than having the alignment slightly askew at the large round home button. You have to touch the iPad harder when this barrier shield is applied, but not to the point where functionality is significantly impaired. It's nice that it comes with two.",
