You couldn\u2019t notice it much, but we didn\u2019t want it to be a bigger problem down the road, so we emailed the company, sent pictures of the crack, and within a couple of days received a new headboard. Also, the assembly instructions tell you to put the gems facing out on the head and the foot of the bed, but the picture shows the gems facing in. It works fine both ways, but looks better when you can actually see them.",

She's about 25lbs and I'm about 115lbs so a total of 140lbs and there was no cracking sounds or bending going on lol. (Probably shouldn't be laying in a toddler bed). Regardless, it is strudy and beautiful! Love how big the jewels are and how soft the head and foot boards are!",
