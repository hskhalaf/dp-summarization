It was such a fuss trying to get it set up. I was so looking forward to this as I need a phone with a stylus but a lot of hassle unfortunately. Amazon said they would contact Motorola and call me back. They didn't call back and a week later I tried again - they said they would do the same but it was closed. They offered me the same call back service but I never trusted it so I sent the phone back. Poor customer experience sadly.",
