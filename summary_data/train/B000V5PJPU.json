My wife would always shake her camera and ruin a good shot. We would throw away over half of her shots. That has improved by 90% with the double antishake technology. The large review screen and touch features is an improvement over the last camera. Although complex to use, I have gained ability with useage on the touch screen. The battery may be a little small for all the capability, but I took 175 mixed flash photos before the battery warning came on.",

    "title": "Sony Cybershot DSC-T200 8.1MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom with Super Steady Shot Image Stabilization (Black) (OLD MODEL)",
    "description": "With slim vertical design in three fashion colors and a giant 3.5-inch widescreen touch-panel LCD that fills the back of the camera, the DSC-T200 catpures your attention before it even takes a shot. 8.1-megapixel imaging, a Carl Zeiss 5x optical zoom lens and special features like Face Detection and Smile Shutter mode help you bring out the best in everyone -- and the Sony Double Anti-Blur Solution delivers sharp color images even in low light. With the HD output, you can also share images in high definition on your Sony Bravia HDTV or other compatible HDTV screen.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nWith slim vertical design in three fashion colors, and a giant 3.5-inch widescreen touch-panel LCD that fills the back of the camera, the DSC-T200 captures your attention before it even takes a shot. 8.1-megapixel imaging, a Carl Zeiss 5x optical zoom lens, and special features like Face Detection and Smile Shutter mode help you bring out the best in everyone -- and the Sony Double Anti-Blur Solution delivers sharp color images even in low light. With the HD output, you can also share images in high definition on your Sony Bravia HDTV or other compatible HDTV screen. \n\n\n\nCyber-shot DSC-T200 Highlights \n\nHigh Performance \n\nTechnological wizardry for effortless photo mastery! Capture perfect portraits, smiling faces, action far and near in beautiful, blur-free detail at 8.1 megapixels. \n\nProduce crisp, clear portraits every time with Face Detection technology Whenever you shoot portraits of family members and friends, you can count on clear reproduction of faces whether subjects are perfectly still or moving slightly. Sonys advanced Face Detection technology synergizes with Bionz to deliver highly precise, high-speed auto-focusing of up to 8 subjects faces when shooting portraits. This synergy ensures quick camera tracking of subjects, even when faces are slightly in motion, and significantly improves the performance of various camera features. For example, it enhances Sonys original auto white balance and skin color control to prevent mistaken estimates of the luminous source (resulting in a reddish image) and mistaken correction of face color. It also improves exposure (including AE) and flash adjustment to prevent under/over exposure of your subjects face and ensure suitable brightness. These improvements in turn help prevent blackout and whiteout in the subjects face caused by exposure and flash settings optimised for the background. Moreover, red-eye reduction automatically activates when Face Detection is ON. Together, these advances enable instant analysis of image data and optimization of exposure and tone according to the scene. All Face Detection features work together to deliver ideal portraits every time. \n\nMeet Smile Shutter, the first photo feature that knows how to capture smiles Capture joyous moments that used to get away! Whenever Face Detection finds a face, the unique new Smile Shutter mode can spot a smile. Simply activate Smile Shutter, and the camera takes a picture -- automatically! Using Sonys proprietary algorithm, this innovative intelligent auto shutter system responds actively to smiling faces. To start, just choose Smile Shutter from Scene Selection, then press the shutter fully on the subject to be taken; the camera automatically detects the smiling face and closes the shutter. To detect the different degrees of smiles by your subject, you can set Smile Level sensitivity to \"high\" (to detect a faint smile), \"medium\" (for a normal smile), or \"low\" (for a hearty laugh). If there are several subjects in the frame, you can use the Touch Screen to specify the smiling face you want to take as the main subject -- or let the Smile Shutter choose the main subject and take the picture. Moreover, the Smile Shutter is great for taking horizontal as well as vertical pictures -- including group pictures where everybody is smiling, and self-portrait shots that automatically catch spontaneous smiles at the right moment. Think of the countless smiles you never want to miss -- a childs innocent grin, joyful faces of family and friends, your own happy face in travel photos -- and use Smile Shutter to turn good times and good feelings into treasured shots. Time after time, youll smile at the results! \n\nEnjoy 8.1 megapixels of exquisite detail Sony's acclaimed 8.1-megapixel Super HAD CCD offers high-resolution performance in compact dimensions, as well as numerous advances available only from the worlds leading CCD manufacturer. For example, an advanced sensor configuration reduces the gaps between microlenses so that each sensor captures more light for brighter, more accurate images with less noise. Clear, faithful image reproduction is now yours to enjoy. \n\nSharpen your edge with the Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar lens The DSC-T200 gives your images the startling accuracy and extra emotional impact of a highly renowned Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar lens. Originally designed in Germany, this high-contrast lens delivers natural clarity without distortion or noise. Its just the right complement to Sonys high-resolution CCD and 5x optical zoom. \n\nExtend your reach with 5x optical zoom This is the world's slimmest camera with 5x optical zoom. And smooth, seamless zooming from 1x to 25x expands your photographic possibilities. You can capture magnificent scenes at the 1x setting, zoom closer with perfect clarity using 5x optical zoom, attain 8.5x zooming at high-definition quality with HD Smart zoom (16:9), or focus on minute details like faraway flowers with 25x Smart zoom (VGA). Whether youre photographing natural scenes or capturing the facial expressions of distant loved ones, the DSC-T200s powerful zooming capabilities let you make the most of memorable shutter opportunities. \n\nSony boosts your photographic potential with Bionz The cutting-edge Bionz imaging processor, first introduced on the Sony Alpha DLSR, is now available on a Cyber-shot. Bionz takes advantage of Sonys accumulated imaging technology to digitally process the high-resolution image data from the 8.1-megapixel CCD at high speeds and deliver dynamically clear, high-resolution images with natural color reproduction and minimal noise. Its a level of precision unheard of in small cameras. \n\nOptimize the dynamic range of your images automatically D-Range optimization employs a sophisticated image analysis algorithm originally developed by Sony to automatically determine the best exposure and contrast settings for optimal dynamic range in almost any shooting environment. In this way, the DRO gives your images a natural look with clearer details that match what you see with your naked eye. This is especially effective when shooting backlit portraits or any scene with dramatic contrast between background and foreground lighting. For example, the details of stained glass in a high-rise cathedral can be captured along with the deep blue sky. \n\nA clearly better solution: Double \"Anti-blur\" Sonys Double \"Anti-blur\" Solution reduces blur in your images -- both subject shake blur and camera shake blur -- through an intelligent combination of Sonys original Super SteadyShot optical image stabilizer and high sensitivity shooting up to ISO3200. These features are highly effective at reducing blur even when shooting fast-moving subjects and portraits in dimly lit rooms. The gratifying results are extremely clear images every time you shoot. \n\nHigh Sensitivity suppresses subject shake blur When environmental lighting is dim, such as inside a room or outdoors at twilight, the high-sensitivity ISO3200 setting lets you achieve natural results without using a flash -- even if the subject moves. Blur is reduced and details are clear in the subject and background, so you can take full advantage of the cameras 8.1-megapixel resolution. \n\nSuper SteadyShot minimizes camera shake blur Camera shake blur, a common byproduct of handheld shooting, is effectively reduced by the Super SteadyShot optical image stabilizer. This feature employs a built-in gyro sensor that detects camera shake and a shift lens unit that compensates to help prevent blur. As a result, images are clearer in various circumstances, such as when shooting photos in dimly lit rooms. \n\nElegant Ease \n\nJust touch the wide screen for instant photo inspiration. The revolutionary DSC-T200 sets the new standard in simplicity, sophistication, and supreme Cyber-shot style. \n\nOutstanding widescreen 3.5-inch Clear Photo LCD Plus The slim, compact DSC-T200 is the first Cyber-shot to feature a 16:9 aspect ratio 3.5-inch wide LCD -- largest yet in the T series -- turning the entire back surface of the camera into a dramatic photo frame. This not only provides a comfortably wide viewing angle, even when shooting in 4:3 aspect ratio, but also serves as an elegant gallery for brilliant vertical and horizontal images. Furthermore, the easy to see 3.5-inch Clear Photo LCD Plus is designed for superb accuracy in color reproduction. The 230,000-dot high-resolution screen delivers superior clarity and color reproduction for exceptionally precise images, so you can easily check camera settings and capture beautiful, true-to-life pictures in vivid, natural color tones. A multi-layered AR coating reduces reflections, increases display contrast, and ensures excellent visibility even in bright sunlight. The result is unmatched pleasure in shooting, seeing, and showing your images. \n\nExceptional ease of use with the unique touchscreen The greatly enhanced Touch Screen integrates Touch Icons and on-screen buttons for easier, faster, more intuitive operation, while the 16:9 aspect ratio wide screen ensures easy visibility of all controls. Moreover, the DSC-T200 streamlines operation with a simple, uncluttered on-screen menu -- showing just whats needed for convenient operation without confusion. Only icons and buttons needed for the shooting situation are displayed, allowing fast, stress-free operation without any hesitation. You can see all information at a glance, then just touch the screen to instantly choose from a wide range of camera and movie shooting modes, change settings and displays, or select from three display modes. In fact, its never been simpler to capture and enjoy beautiful photos. Beginners and experts, youngsters and adults -- anybody can take great shots with the DSC-T200. Effortlessly! \n\nPleasure \n\nCreate photo and slide show dazzle on high-definition TV. Gather friends and family for a sensational way to share the enjoyment of your own personal picture show. \n\nPlay your images and slide shows on high-definition TVs Now the images you shoot can easily be displayed in full HD quality on a high-definition TV such as Sonys popular Bravia. Simply connect your Cyber-shot via the optional HD output adapter cable and enjoy individual images or personalized HD Slide Show with Music. The DSC-T200 makes it easy to share the excitement with everyone in your living room at a stunning 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution. \n\nIndulge in the pleasure of HD Slide Show with Music The DSC-T200 can automatically create slide shows of your images, accompanied by music, for playback on the camera LCD or an HDTV. You can personalize your slide shows by combining four visual effects (Simple, Nostalgic, Active, and Stylish) and choosing any of four preset musical pieces stored in internal memory. Your favorite tunes can also be imported from PCs to the DSC-T200 for use as background music. New improved visual effects let you customize image playback and preset musical pieces or imported background music help make the viewing experience more dramatic, fun, and memorable on every level. Moreover, its easier than ever to operate Slide Show with Music without starting over each time. You can use new direct playback with a single tap on the Touch Icon, start from HOME or the middle of the show, touch the screen to pause, or easily change settings. That means new freedom to show and share your slide show as you choose! \n\nPaint creative arrangements This function enables you to add a stamp, draw or write on your images using a supplied Paint Pen. For example, its simple to add a message to a photo -- write \"Happy Birthday\" on a gift photograph or add a favorite message to a picture. Painted pictures are saved in the camera as copies, apart from the original pictures. Now, the DSC-T200 brings you more ways to enjoy the Paint function by decorating screen images with pictures or text. You can choose from an expanded range of 15 colors for pen and stamp functions and 30 stamp shapes, with 15 frames available for new screen images -- and save in 3MP size in addition to VGA. Paint is a special way to make photo memories even more precious, and bring a personal touch to very special images.\n*Notes: Painted images are saved separately from the original images. Resolution of the stamps, frames, and painted letters has no difference between 3MP size and VGA. \n\nEdit your images with in-camera retouching Fun, convenient editing functions let you easily touch up photos right in the camera, even immediately after you shoot. Now, the DSC-T200 supplies even more comprehensive in-camera functions to correct or process images. The new effects of Radial Blur and Retro have been added to the existing Soft Focus, Partial Color, Fisheye Lens, Cross Filter, Trimming, and Red-Eye Correction, giving you a powerful range of eight easy, enjoyable ways to personalize your photos. Radial Blur gives the dynamic effect of a freeze-frame shot, while Retro adds the stylish ambience of a classic photo. Once images have been edited, they can be stored separately from the original images and printed out whenever you like at extremely high quality. \n\nFeel exceptional pride of possession The elite new Cyber-shot DSC-T200 is a style icon in form as well as function. At first admiring glance, you might actually wonder, \"What is it?\" The revolutionary front and rear design of this T series model is not easily identifiable, breaking with the existing conventional image of a camera. Drawing on the vertical design and basic concept of the previous DSC-T100, the DSC-T200 adopts a slimmer, more sophisticated look. The Touch Screen dispenses with buttons to fill the entire rear surface, for the appearance of a photo frame. The downsized battery allows thinner dimensions than the sculpted rectilinear T100, while the elegant curvilinear DSC-T200 combines enhanced grip with streamlined vertical design and a wider screen, creating a graceful impression. Like its precursor, the DSC-T200 is available in three dramatic colors --sophisticated silver, chic red, and elegant black in a new graphite shade -- and the front of each model is finished with a fine-quality hairline process. Its a must-have Cyber-shot -- a pleasure to possess and display, and a joy to use. \n\nVersatility \n\nSo small, slim, stylish, and supremely capable! From taking pictures to viewing and enjoyment, the HD-compatible DSC-T200 revolutionizes your whole photo experience. \n\nMulti Resizing Change your pictures to suit your needs.This function allows original images taken in 4:3, 3:2 or 16:9 aspect ratio to be easily resized in-camera and their mode altered according to the application. Images taken in 4:3 and 3:2 can be resized into 16:9 at 2MP resolution for viewing on HDTV; images other than VGA (including 16:9) can be resized into 4:3 at VGA resolution for uploading to a blog or attachment to an e-mail. Fine tuning the trimming position is also easy with the 4-direction button displayed on the Touch Screen, and theres no need to import images into a PC to make all these transformations. Simply resize -- and enjoy!\n*Note: It is not possible to upload the screen image from the camera body directly to a blog. \n\nWide zoom display Change your viewer to fit viewing opportunities. A \"wide zoom\" function allows photos to be displayed in 16:9 aspect ratio. Even 4:3 and 3:2 aspect ratio photos can be displayed in 16:9 aspect ratio when viewing on actual HDTV or on the full wide-screen LCD display of the camera -- for a feeling of HDTV viewing. \n\nEnhanced, user-friendly experience The convenient interface greatly simplifies operation. Simply press the HOME button to select the desired function from the main screen. Since all DSC-T200 functions -- such as \"shooting\", \"viewing\" and \"setting\"-- are displayed, users can select a function with ease. \n\nMoreover, when changes to specific camera settings are needed, just press the MENU button. For example, you can press the MENU button to change the setting of the Face Detection function while shooting, or to process the image while viewing. \n\nNeed operational assistance? Ask Function Guide. Designed for all kinds of users from novices to veterans, this beginner-friendly feature offers step-by-step instructions by providing clear, easy-to-understand, simplified guidance as you operate the camera. For example, an icon guide on the control button describes the selected shooting mode. Additionally, explanations are provided for the Scene Selection mode, so users can easily understand the optimal shooting mode depending on the situation. The easy-to-use Function Guide not only displays icons but also provides clear instructions, making camera operation easier and more worry-free than ever before. Of course, the Function Guide can be turned On/Off according to your needs. With the Function Guide on, even beginners wont need a users guide. As you get used to the camera operation, turn the Function Guide off to speed up the operation. \n\nGrid lines When framing your scene, the new Grid lines feature puts a grid on the images so you can analyze the overall balance at a glance and determine the most pleasing composition. \n\nMatch every scene and smile with the right Scene Selection mode Convenient Shooting modes in the new DSC-T200 include Scene Selection modes that let you easily create beautiful images in almost any type of setting. Whether capturing friends at twilight with illuminated skyscrapers in the background, natural beauty at beach resorts, or fireworks in the night sky, the results are as spectacular as the scene you are shooting. Also included is High Sensitivity mode, which automatically selects the best ISO setting to allow a high shutter speed in any situation. Without using a flash, you can shoot outdoors at twilight or inside dimly lit restaurants and achieve clear, natural results. Moreover, unique new Smile Shutter mode can detect smiling faces, sense expressions, and automatically take pictures. This intelligent function handles all details -- focus, exposure, white balance, skin tone, flash, and even selection of the main subject in a group. Its easy for anybody to use -- so youll never again miss a winning smile. In fact, you may not need to \"Say cheese!\" any more -- unless you want to continue the tradition! \n\nStamina and quick response The DSC-T200 extends your shooting pleasure with enough battery power for 250 shots per charge. Sonys highly efficient Bionz imaging processor accelerates start-up time and reduces power consumption. Thanks to the convenient combination of quick start up time, improved shutter time lag, and long-lasting battery power, users miss fewer photo opportunities when travelling, at sporting events and everywhere they go. The camera can also be adapted to continuous shooting and start-up time is only 1.5 seconds. \n\nWhen the memory stick reaches full capacity, or even if there is no Memory Stick in your camera, you can still store images in 31MB (approx.) of internal memory. Youll appreciate this feature when you forget to bring your optional Memory Stick Duo or simply take more photos than you were expecting to shoot. Photos in internal memory can easily be copied to Memory Stick Duo. \n\nPrint your pictures directly from the camera You can easily print directly from the camera without using a PC. Just insert the memory card in a Sony DPP-FP70 or DPP-FP90 digital photo printer, select images on the 3.5-inch LCD, and print away! Or when using any PictBridge compatible printer, just connect it to Cyber-shot via USB cable, select images on Cyber-shots LCD, and print! \n\nPC organization with Picture Motion Browser Sonys advanced image management software, Picture Motion Browser, comes bundled with your Cyber-shot DSC-T200. Once installed in your PC, this software automatically organizes the images you upload from your Cyber-shot by date in a calendar format for easy searching. Basic features such as photo CD/DVD burning, adding dates to JPEG snapshots, and resizing images for transfer to Memory Stick have been improved for easier operation. And if you add an optional Sony GPS unit, the softwares advanced Map View function can even automatically organize your holiday photos according to where they were shot and display them where they belong on a world map that indicates the latitude and longitude.",
