Not exactly structurally sound, especially if you don't install the shelves. By the way, the shelves don't seem adjustable as the notches in the photos suggest. There are two permanent slots.",

They sit in my laundry room which is indoors in that the ceiling is the translucent policarbonate material. At certain times of year they got some sun and it gets very warm. My new Suncast , which is intended for indoors will be in the same location. I trust it will hold up as well as the first two",

      "text": "Great storage and looks nice but the only complaint I would have is the shelving. They should lock into place and not jump out of its position. You have to make sure the sides are push in to make the secure shelving position. Please do yourself a favor and do not attempt to go beyond the recommended weight for each shelf. I think your best bet is to always be under the actual rating. Its still a nice storage system to clean up an area and get back some of the space for safety sake.",

The Suncast Tall Storage Cabinet is engineered from heavy-duty, blow-molded resin and stands up to whatever you throw in it - or at it. Constructed with reinforced, adjustable shelving and lockable handles, it protects equipment and gear and keeps dangerous tools and equipment safely stored out of the way. Plus, the resin housing is resilient to warping, rusting or denting, but is lightweight to make set-up easy. Also, unlike other products with bulky, squared-off edges, Suncast products have a sleek design that elevates the garage environment, creating an attractive space.
