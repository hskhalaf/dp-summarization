There is another mirror attachment I can use instead but overall I wasn't super impressed. We are using this for geocaching and I do have young kids, but we weren't all that rough with it. The telescoping aspect is fine. I found that the mirror shifted position too easily for what we needed it for - slight pressure or even its own weight was enough to make it move, which is annoying when you are trying to see one specific spot.",

With my job, time is of the essence (housekeeping) and when I'm trying to look under beds and the mirror loses its position easily it adds to my time.",

I loosened the nut enough to exposed some threads and put a tiny drip of blue loctite on the threads before tightening the flex hinge nut back down. Now it's got the perfect tension on the hinge to allow me to manipulate the mirror head and yet stay where I position it, and the nut hasn't backed out. In my experience it's best to buy two of this type of item because almost certainly one will get broken if it's used a lot, so a two pack was perfect.",
