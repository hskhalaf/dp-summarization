These were perfect for protecting her feet. Once I got them on properly she got used to them quickly and didn\u2019t mind having them. I watched a video about using them and found that I wasn\u2019t pulling them up high enough at first. recently my dog injured her paw and I used these to cover her paw so she couldn\u2019t lick it constantly and that was great! She healed fast.",

      "text": "My dog was recently diagnosed with Degenerative Myelopathy (DM) which causes him to drag his feet and his nails would bleed from the contact of his nails on the concrete. These boots help protect his paws and, along with a wheelchair, we're able to go on long walks with no problems. They started to ware out in the toe after 4 months, but I would expect if I dragged my tennis shoes every time I walked in them they would ware out relatively fast as well. I still think they're worth the money. If your dog has no problems with the way they walk I'm sure they'll last a really long time.",

It took my wife and I to get them on his paws the first time. Of course the front ones he took right off. I walked him with just the boots on his back paws. It doesn't matter how I adjust these they keep coming off his paws as we walk. He lets me put them on now and walks with them, but they just keep coming off. Pretty frustrating and a waste of money. I did measure his paws to make sure I got the correct size.",
