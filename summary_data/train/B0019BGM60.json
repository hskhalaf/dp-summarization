Its certainly easy to apply to your floors and provides a rich, conditioning shine but also tends to leave streaks if you do not thoroughly buff the product with a decent amount of pressure on your floor mop. I also find that you need to apply it pretty heavily to get a uniform look, a simply spritz and you'll find that the resulting droplets absorb before you can polish the surface. I'll be trying other products before making any bulk purchases of this to clean my floors.",
