It is compact enough for a coat pocket or a purse but don't try to put it in your pants pocket. The one thing that kept it from getting 5 stars is I got no users manual with it. I'll have to try to get one from Samsung. Hassle.",

It takes excellent indoor photos. It also has tons of fun features to play with. The wifi works great as well. I was in the middle of no where and I happened to stop in front of a little country store that had free wifi and I was able to upload some photos to Facebook really quickly before driving off into a no wifi zone again. Can't say enough about this camera. It's great!!",

The only drawbacks: tiff file missing & manual flash mode nonexistent. It saddens me immensely that Samsung phased out this model earlier with no improved new model to replace it. What a shame! Samsung, you were on right track before, what happened?",

It has a nice wide angle zoom, as a travel writer I need this to shoot inside hotel rooms & cruise ship cablins. I also need the articulated screen when holding the camera above my head. The latest Canon G doesn't have either of these two features. Since everything I shoot ends up on the web I don't need lots of megapixels, or super high quailty. So far I would rank image files from this camera as very good.",

This camera lens does a wonderful job of capturing clear pictures to minute detail. I captured the eyes of bees, water on faces, in droplets and in streaming down as people came up out of the river! Amazing detail with wonderful clarity even when zooming up close to the subjects! I just can't figure out how to view pictures on the camera without encountering error messages, hopefully I can work out that detail.",

Also, after owning it 8 months, the wi-fi option no longer works, and the video will only record in slow motion. Don't buy this camera. Maybe the other people reviewing it work for Samsung?",

It turns the camera into a 18mm(90degree angle of view) f1.4 camera, hard to find this type of spec on a DSLR lens. Other conversion lens can't compete, as picture quality and distortion degrades fast moving away from the center. With the conversion lens-I get super wide shots(great for group pics in a room), and f1.4-low light-no need for flash, tilted viewer, silent shutter, on a compact camera, I get shots and videos that no other camera gives me.",
