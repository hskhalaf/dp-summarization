At least this one is relatively easy to adapt to use and uses an o-ring seal that is set into the spout so that it seals without over-tightening and inevitable leaking by distortion. Since it is now the law that gas \"cans\" have to be equipped with these safety spouts, this one is a good choice among those on the market. I could not find a design I liked better at any of the local hardware stores, big or small.",

After that I unscrewed the collar and inspected the o-ring. It seemed to be slightly deformed; perhaps by overtightening, but not sure. I screwed the collar on a third time and it seems to be ok now.

That makes it much more convenient to use and greatly reduces (though doesn't totally eliminate) spillage. Would recommend.",

Just push the button to open the nozzle and gas flows. Stop pressing the button and the gas stops flowing. Sounds simple enough but many gas cans these days come up with my complicated mechanisms to stop gas fumes that just don't work. The only thing that didn't work is the anti-overfill feature. For me, that's not really a negative. For other it might be. I just wanted to make users aware that it might or might not work. Mine did not.",

    "description": "Most spills occur tipping a normal can to get the spout into the tank opening before the liquid comes out, or removing the spout from the target vessel before overflowing. The No-Spill spout is fully user controlled so you tip the can vertical, insert the spout into the vessel opening, then press the button to begin and control pouring. To stop pouring simply release the button. Practically eliminates spills and overflows. The only Spill-Proof spout with thumb button control that does not push down on your tank's filler neck to pour. More control, fewer tip-overs of your small equipment. The fastest pouring Spill-Proof nozzle available. At up to 3 gal/min, compare to other brands at 1.5 to 2.0 gal/min. Meets California Air Resources Board requirements for sale or use in California. Autostop removable nozzle, single opening for filling & pouring, treated can body for low permeation. The most user friendly CARB compliant can available. Easily fills even the smallest equipment without the need to press down on the tank opening. 6-inch Flex Spout Extension (sold separately) allows filling of on-road vehicles, boats and many other hard to reach tank openings. No-Spill Gasoline cans are tested and certified to ASTM F-85299 Standard Specification for Portable Gasoline Containers for Consumer Use and our Diesel & Kerosene cans are tested and certified to ASTM F-97602 Standard Specification for Portable Kerosene and Diesel Containers for Consumer Use.",
