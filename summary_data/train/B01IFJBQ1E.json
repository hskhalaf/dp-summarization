I am sure you can find that item by looking in my profile at my other reviews I've made. Also, It would be nice if it came with 2 controllers instead of one. That is the only reason I will give it 4 stars instead of 5. Still would buy again though :)",

      "text": "Reminds me of my childhood. Punch out is on this system but it is not Mike Tyson Punch out. I hope Nintendo will add official Mods to add more games. The 8bitdo wireless controllers are a must have. The controller wires are too short. The graphic are terrible compared to today's standards but, this is what we grew up on. The play-ability of the games are still fun and exciting today. I have this system and the SNES Classic. I play these more that my Xbox Scorpio.",

You navigate the Menu with your Classic Controller and when you are playing a game you just press the reset button to go back to the main menu to play a different game. Easy to use and Great. Brings back old memories. Included Items are the NES Classic Edition, one Classic Controller, one power cord with the USB plug, and a HDMI cable.",

I think my only real problem is that the cords on the controller are super short, 3 feet I believe. I end up having to sit super close to the TV if I want to play it, which isn't exactly what I wanted. I think they sell extension cords so it's not a deal breaker, but still something to keep in mind.",

There are a bunch of games on here but I wish it had the capability to download or buy other games because obviously not all the NES games are featured. Kung Fu & Contra come to mind. Seriously worth the money though, my brother and I had some great conversations about it and really warped me back to being 11 years old again. Quite an experience!",

The one that comes with it, the cord is super super short!! And it seems the plus pad/directional is wearing out already, and we've only had it for like 2 mths!! I bought one on here for a spare (I think is was $10?) and the cord is waay long which is nice. Overall pretty cool though! I love playing on it! Brings me back ya know?!?

You basically have to play with the console on your lap. It's a joke. Buy an extension or wireless controller. And, saving game progress is a little awkward. You need to press the Reset button on the unit to save, so you have to get up and walk over to the unit when you want to save. Not the end of the world but odd and inconvenient.",

I also purchased the controller extension cables, as these are very short unless you're sitting super close to the TV. Overall, I'm happy. Again, my only complaint is that this only comes with a single controller. If I experience any technical difficulties I'll update my review.",
