Previous review: This thing smells so strongly of chemicals I had to leave it outside for a few days before I could even take a closer look at it. Even the box smelled awful. The toxic gas it produces can not be good have in a hot car. Once it breathed outside for a few days I took a look. It has tons of stitching holes in it. No way this will be 100% water proof. I\u2019m returning it and buying one like we already have for my other kids.",

And amazingly the car seat base left no marks on the leather. There were few impressions but they got even out within few minutes of moving this seat. I strongly recommend this to protect your leather seats. I haven't washed it yet so can't comment on sustainability of the material after washing.",

Regular seat covers wouldn\u2019t fit and there is very little room to work behind the seat for straps. This cover went on easy and covers the spot where I rub. It seems well made and durable. It was a little stiff at first but after a couple of miles it has formed to the seat and I forget it\u2019s even there. Time will tell how it will hold up in the Florida sun since I never put the top up.",

The black color matches my interior very well and that was important to me. It almost looks like something that would have come in with the truck. Now, I ordered the car seat version that was supposed to have a storage pocket on the front and it looks like they sent the \"for sitting comfort\" style. Honestly I think I like this better. With the car seat on this I think that mesh pocket would be fairly useless plus my truck has ample storage.",

      "text": "Saves the leather in our new car. Fits great and very thick. I particularly like the grippy bottom side so it doesn't slide around on the seat. Has done a great job at keeping our kids feet and car seat off the leather of the seat. Also because the padding is so thick, it prevents the carseat from digging into the leather and keep it from scratching the surface or getting things dirty. It also has a strap and buckle around the back top so that it will hold onto the headrest bars. The strap is a bit cheaper feeling than the rest, but otherwise it all works fine.",

Not once have I ever taken the car seats out after being strapped down tight and had any indentations in the leather. My reason for giving it 4 stairs instead of 5 is because they don\u2019t stick or stay on the seats unless they are held down by a car seat. They slide all over the place and it\u2019s kind of annoying. Other then that, these are great.",

They are almost identical in materials, look, and construction however these a little wider on the seat. That may be good for some and not good for others. These are a little more difficult to use on the booster type seats that need to be seatbelted in everytime. The wider seat covers up the buckle latch and it can be tough to find at times. If it's for a clipped in bucket seat that doesn't use the seatbelt these are fine and probably better.",
