Both DC emblems fell off after wearing them twice. Stitching around the sole was frayed upon delivery and is already comming loose. There's excess rubber all over the peice around the base of the leather on both shoes. Edit: bought a second pair with blue court graffik. These have a different leather grain, much more pronounced than the previous pair. This pair appears to be stitched correctly and no excess rubber. However, this pair was full price @ $70. Where the previous pair was $49.99.",

They're very \"poofy\" when you first get them unlike a lot of the older skater brands (Airwalks, Vans) nowadays that have changed to a thinner, less poofy style. I will say that if you're not used to the \"overstuffed\" shoes, you may want to go up a size so the tongue isn't putting pressure on the top of your foot. Also, the laces seem a bit short and difficult to tie, but that goes along with the poofiness, I think. Still, they're very comfy, well-made shoes.",

The wear is pretty normal, considering they are worn constantly, including at work. Will definitely keep purchasing DC shoes!",

I've gotten these and tried a few other pairs of DCs recently and I've bought more shoes this year than I've bought in the last 6 because they're all comfortable and look great. Even seems to support my ankle well which has been surgically repaired twice and tends to roll for no reason. Highly recommend",

      "text": "I am 30 now and I have not skateboarded everyday since I was 20. I don't know if it is because I grew up in these type of shoes or what but I just don't understand why people buy Jordans or Nikes. They are ugly and not that comfortable and they are always \"SKINNY\" as I call them. DC comes out with great designs and colors and I just stick with what works and what looks good on the street.",

This is the only kind of shoe that I actually wear for pleasure I would rate the shoe a five but I'm not too sure where the damage occurred to shipping if it was already damaged before they ship them out or if it was during transportation.",

However, approximately two weeks after purchasing the shoes, my son caught the laces on something which caused them to undo and fray. I had to purchase new laces. But, boys will be boys, so this is not necessarily a negative on the product. :)",

If you pull the strings tight, that doesn't change the toe space. They look slick but Adidas are definitely more comfortable and a little cheaper/same price. Obviously doesn't look the same. Anyway, hope this review helps.",
