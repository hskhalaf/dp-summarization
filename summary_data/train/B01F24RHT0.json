However, I have taken it on a few camping trips and it has begun to disconnect from any device I have streaming - my cell, a friends cell, an iPad, an iPod.. it doesn't matter what it is. It will randomly stop playing, but will still be connected via Bluetooth. Sometimes it will not restart and we have to switch devices. Such a sad thing when it was so glorious to begin with! I don't think I'll be purchasing from JBl anymore. :( Original post: Definitely exceeded my expectations! This little speaker has great sound and lasts for a long time!",

I\u2019m not sure on the exact battery life, but I\u2019ve used it for 5+ hours at the beach two weekends in a row without a charge and it\u2019s still got battery left. The higher the volume, the faster the drain, so a lot of that is up to the user. Sound quality is what you\u2019d expect out of a JBL, a nice midrange with a good deal of bass. I don\u2019t have any complaints.",

      "text": "Just get the Charge 4. After having both pairs (of the C3 and C4 and since they are a mere $20 difference in price now, the winner is the newer 4. Especially if you are looking for a stereo pair the Charge 4 pairs to bluetooth MUCH better. The larger bass radiators are better sounding. The USB-C ports are easier to use (bidirectional) and there is a light on top when paired so you don\u2019t trip over them by the pool when it gets dark! The grey is also a darker graphite color and less prone to staining and dirt. All these minor changes make the newer model superior.",

If your looking at the charge 3 vs the charge 4 buy the charge 3. I've seen and heard both and the quality gap is way to small to make sense of spending the extra money on the charge 4. My only other recommendations is buy a case for the speaker it durable but with exposed woofers on the side I worry about Puncturing one during transport.",

      "text": "Was worried the JBL Charge 3 would have too much bass, but it doesn't. The sound it good enough for me, and I'm picky. I love it. It pairs automatically with anything it's previously been paired to, if that device already has its Bluetooth on. The customer reviews said I'd like it, that it was one of the best options out there. I decided to trust them and ordered one for myself. The reviews were right! It's a great little speaker. Out of doors there's volume to spare. I think I'm going to recommend the JBL Charge 3 to all my friends. I'm so happy with it.",

I've only needed to charge it once in the month I've had it. I was late to the game of bluetooth speakers. They are so much easier than using our stereo system. I like the orange charging cord, easy to find. It is designed to be waterproof with a seal over the ports. I suppose it would survive being dunked in the pool accidentally.",

Everyone freaked out because they thought it was gone forever. Someone reached down and hauled it back onto the boat. The music was still blaring, and it was still in out-of-the-box condition. This is now my favorite bluetooth speak. In fact, I'm ordering another one.",
