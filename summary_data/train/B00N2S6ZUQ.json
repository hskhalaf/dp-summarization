This means that when you work on a file for a few minutes, and go to save your progress, your program will hang for several seconds while the HD spins back into action. This is a nuisance, and the HD provides no feature to control this. We had to find a free 3rd party program called xSleep to do so.

      "text": "I have always have good experiences with Toshiba hard disk products. This is a very fast hard drive. Image backup of my SSD drive normally took over an hour on either Seagate USB drive or Western Digital USB drive. It took less than 15 minutes with this Toshiba Canvio Basics. This drive uses a USB 3.0. I have seen transfer rate of over 125 MB/s on my 3.0 GHZ 8 GB RAM Dell computer. I am very impressed.",

I plugged it in and it installed in 30 seconds with no effort. Transfer was surprisingly fast! I had family photos and videos in the thousands and this baby loaded them fast and fit everything - including 1000 songs as well - with room to spare! Backed up 10 years worth of items from my laptop in about 2 hours. With the amount I had that's quick! lol",

It's practical, starts right away, at the click of a mouse, without complicated set-ups, log-ins, etc. I've already organized 20,669 tracks in 635 files and that's only taken up to 76 GB. AND I still have room for my pictures, videos, university documents, etc.All in all, I've only used up 117GB and ithat's pretty much all the files I have produced, downloaded and accumulated so far. I guess my challenge now is to find more files to try and fill that 1TB up in this life!!!!!",
