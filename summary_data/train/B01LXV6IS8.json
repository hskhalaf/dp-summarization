If you aren't an Apple user or have a mixed ecosystem, check out Sennheiser's HD series for better options. As they are \"on-the-ear\" phones, you may experience fatigue after several hours.

I have use them to test, the sound is pretty good but I don\u2019t like the fit, they feel too tight on my head and the ear caps feel to little. They are not the big ear cover like other ones I\u2019ve seen. I guess they are different styles I\u2019m just saying I like the bigger ones that cover your entire ear. I couldn\u2019t wear it for more than 15 minutes because of the pressure on my head. If I compare it to my BOSE I love my Bose thousand times more.",

Unknown if this is the problem with the Beats I've purchased. The second pair I sent back for repair and am still waiting for them to be returned. Apple/Beats needs to address this problem immediately. Amazon has been great with their fast response to assisting us with sending them back for repair, however we were told ten days. It's been longer than that. Thanks",

CONS: - Decibels could be louder. I tried these at max volume on all of my devices and was disappointed. Max volume should have your ears ringing but not the case here. - mid range cords and vocals are lacking. - The case requires effort to get the headphones inside. It should be effortless.",

I had been told they were of good quality so I got them, and I have enjoyed them so far. Easy to set up, and the charge lasts a long while. If you wear them for hours on end, your ears do get kind of sore, but i would expect that for any type of headphone like this. Does a pretty good job blocking out surrounding noise. We shall see if they stand up against the test of time and are worth the cost.",

On my headphones, I can easily maneuver back, forth and sound up and down. The Beats did not seem to have the feature. Nothing other than power on and off. I am rather computer savvy but could not make it work. Back to the MPOW unit. It functions better for me.",
