I simply want a whole house audio system that is wireless. Not possible from Bose anymore. I'll be returning this unit and changing brands.",

My first system would not stay fully connected. So I exchanged it for a new one but I didn't want to take the risk if the same thing happening. So I bought much cheaper system. It doesn't come close in sound but neither did the price. I hope in the future. Bose makes the app an option not a major part of the system....",

Alexa is sometimes buggy but then again even Amazon products are too. Tech support is very good though.

You can\u2019t adjust settings in the Alexa app, you can\u2019t change the wake word, it can\u2019t join other echo devices in a speaker group. Also the remote is does not work well. Buttons are hard to push and the backlight turns off too quickly and that also cannot be adjusted. Thinking that maybe I should switch to a Sonos system.",
