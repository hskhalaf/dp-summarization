I studied Mauviel, Ruffoni and Bourgeat for hours. I even bought the Mauviel 2.5mm copper set with bronze handles. I returned them because I prefer the cast iron handless and I really didn't like the large Mauviel stamp. Came across as gawdy. The simplicity and elegance of Bourgeat will enhance any kitchen. Now the cooking begins!!",

Real professional cooking tools. Improved my cooking in time, quality and taste.Please do not waste your money on any of the 150 series from the other supplier. You also will not appreciate burning your hands with bronze handles. A sole exception - I find the small 8\" 150c fry pan useful for saute' of small quantities of mushrooms, bell peppers, shallots for omelettes. It's faster than a 250 for very small amounts of food.",

Each and every pan cooks flawlessly every time, looks beautiful whether polished or with patina, and is a breeze to clean. My only regret is that it took me so long in life to discover the joys of cooking with copper.",

The stainless steel lining is fabulous and the polished surfaces really do help keep foods from sticking as much as they normally would. The heating response is fabulous. The thick red copper material (the best!) is not only beautiful, but conducts heat so well. If you are looking for a nice set to cover most cooking jobs this is it. I may purchase another sauce pan in the future, but for the most part, this is the ticket.",
