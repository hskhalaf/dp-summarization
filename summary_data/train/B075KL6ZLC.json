      "title": "Great USB mic",
      "text": "This is a great USB microphone once I overcame setup. I had loads of problems initially, I couldn't record and the LED would be flashing red very fast. I tired various Mac and Windows computers and had them same problem on all of them. I almost gave up and arranged a return, however are a bit of googling I discovered it was just a case of the changing the monitoring frequency rate to 48KHz the same as the microphone and it works perfectly. So a fantastic usb mic that could have better instructions",

Something that mine did not have and now I\u2019m really struggling to find the adaptor. Does anyone know where I can purchase this?",

The picture of the microphone in a table and someone playing and singing...its unreal. From that distance, almost doesnt capture properly the voice. Also im very disapointed that some boxes bring the adapter for a stand and some dont. Mine didnt. Obviously to make you get the shock mount. Sounds nice if you re very close.",
