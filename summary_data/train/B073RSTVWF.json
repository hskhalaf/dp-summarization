This still didn\u2019t help after cleaning it too. If they set the valve to open wider I think it\u2019d be fine. But didnt work great for us. Other than not flowing. It looked nice.",

After hollowing out a pumpkin, we chose a spot low enough keep punch coming out, but not so low that we couldn't use it. The accompanying tool cuts the perfect sized hole. Assembly was easy (good pics in the instructions) and we were off and running. The tap inself didn't leak, worked well all afternoon. Very sturdy feeling. Super fun at our tailgate. Looking forward to watermelon season!",

Definitely make sure to put the hole low enough, or when the liquid level gets too low it won't pour.

But it was still fun, and next time I will just put the tap lower and it will be fine.",
