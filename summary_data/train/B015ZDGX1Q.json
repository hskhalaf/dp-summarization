I don't know what he called me or said to me, but suffice it to say, these things are next level as far as being sound-proof/noise-cancelling. Super high sound quality and undistorted bass. I have a similarly-priced pair that is wireless, but was not compatible with the new Ninetendo Switch, so I had to get a wired pair against my will, and let me just say, I didn't want to like them, but sure enough these are the best headphones I've ever owned.",

Fit great, only trade off is they dont \u201cFEEL\u201d premium due to how light they are but that means longer comfort. Can definitely get loud enough for hearing damage or wearing on your neck.
