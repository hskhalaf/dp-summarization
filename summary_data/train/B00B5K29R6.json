I've tried every product sold at retail stores and the best one out there is Lubriberm.....but Codi products are definitely BETTER. When applying the lotion you can feel the moisture as you lather it into your skin. It's not sticky, not heavily scented, makes your skin glow and the bottle lasts a long time. Since I live in the desert, I use lotion daily and love it!!! I will continue to purchase from Amazon as long as it's sold on here:-)",

      "text": "Like so many other reviewers, found this lotion through my nail technician. I'm a Master Gardner so my hands were always wrecked....this stuff has saved them. I try to use it every time after washing/drying my hands. Seems to absorb better this way vs on dry hands. Also I've noticed that the brand name can vary, here on Amazon, but the bottle and label are always basically the same.",

First off - it does not leave a greasy feel on your hands or your body and secondly, it smells amazing - not over powering, but clean and fresh. I have given all of my other hand and body lotions away because I love the Cody Green Tea Hand & Body Lotion!!!",
