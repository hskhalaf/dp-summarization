My only note is that if you have a large mattress, I have a Tempur Pedic, you should size up. I bought the King size for my King mattress and it doesn't cover all the way down the sides. I can still see some of my sheets. But it will work for now. It really is a nice package for the money.",

I have a king sized mattress and found that this comforter seems more like a Queen. The King does not cover both sides of the mattress. It is not big enough to be considered a King. So disappointing as it matched my shower curtain perfectly and I appreciated the reverse option.",
