The fact that it was so small made me nervous, bc I had guests about to stay in the previously unheated room, but this little Lasko heater proved itself! It's super easy to figure out and works quietly. I'm now using it in my 2 car garage to warm up the space for my dogs at night. It's keeping the insulated garage at exactly the 60 degrees I have it set to, even though it's 10 degrees outside. I love it!",

      "text": "The heater gets warm, and rotates like it is supposed to, but it will only stay on for about 3 minutes before it pops the breakers. I have tried different outlets in different rooms. I am extremely disappointed because I was really looking forward to a rotating heater to keep my office warm.",
