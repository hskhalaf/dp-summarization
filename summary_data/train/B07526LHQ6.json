      "text": "So disappointed in these, especially given the cost. While the material is heavy duty the design is very flawed. The bands only get as small as the width of the band, and there is not a big enough lip underneath the metal clip, so in my case in order for me to make this fit around my ankle, I needed to force pull the Velcro through which meant it was not flat, or leave it loose. In either case there is not enough cushion between the metal clip and my skin making these very uncomfortable. Hope I can get my money back.",

There was also a card in there for a site to go to for workouts. I have only used them twice so far and they are holding up just fine. I will say that you have to make sure they are tight (no looseness at all around the ankle) when you put them on otherwise when you use them it feels weird. Definitely recommend this product.",
