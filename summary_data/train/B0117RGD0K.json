I was quickly on to Bose about this matter and to be fair to Bose they dealt with the matter imeadiately giving me a new replacement headset asap...I will put a couple of pictures on to show others what happened. I would have given these 5 stars if it wasn\u2019t for the headband cracking but again a big thumbs up to Bose for acting fast and resolving the issue.",

The build quality was really good and they are amazingly comfy to wear with many adjustments. There was a faint constant noise interference in the right earpiece so I returned them. I would have ordered a replacement pair but after researching the issue I found it to be quite popular with the headset with some people seeing the issue on day 1 and other people noticing it later down the line which has completed put me off and I expect better from a company like Bose so I thought I would leave this review to share the awareness of the problem.",

Cons: - Doesn't fold that small, so you're left with quite a big case to carry around - It being white, made that it would get dirty quite easily. - After using it longer than an hour, the sound would start breaking. The only way around it is to turn off the bluetooth connection and to reconnect it again. I called Bose support centre to report the issue, but they told me that it could take up to a month to get a replacement device",

And they are well made, super robust. And yet light. And while these are not noise isolating, they do an unbelievable job of blocking out background noise on the train. A commuter's dream!

The downside is the sound quality does take a hit when listening over Bluetooth connection. The sound can seem flat and you may question the value of the headphones. Use the provided headphone jack and the sound is opened up and a lot better, although you lose the convenience of Bluetooth. If you\u2019re buying these headphones purely for sound quality, I would look to buying the wired version. If however, you would rather the freedom of Bluetooth headphones, these headphones are sufficient. I also own the Bluetooth soundsport buds.

On about the third use he noticed an underlying noise, which has persisted with the headphones to date. At the same time he noticed ear pain, which started during use and ran on for a day or two after use. He took a break from the headphones for a couple of weeks, using them again this weekend, and sadly noise and ear pain continued. They have been returned as faulty to Amazon, who as usual were exemplary in after sales support.",

I've used them for conference calls, running, going to the gym and they've been fantastic. Sweat is no issue with these and if replacement ear pads are cheap to find online. If money wasn't an issue I'd have splashed on the ones above but these are the best value for money in my opinion.",

      "text": "By far and away the best headphones I've ever had. The sound quality is excellent - crystal clear with a detailed mid range and top end, along with a fairly rich and bouncy bass. Easy to set up, supremely comfortable and with a long battery life between charges, they feel robust too. Recommended.",
