After receiving the watch and wearing it for a day, I went back to MVMT and ordered a replacement gray mesh metal watchband. Much better. The other issue that I've noticed is that, at least on my wrist, the winding knob rubs and irritates the back of my hand. I need to ensure that the watch is always pushed up on my wrist in order to avoid this.",
