Took about 10-15 min. of getting all the Velcro and snaps located to fit....but fits nice when done. Has an abundance of magazine pouches and provisions for a bladder or other equipment. Left front has a Velcro \u201cfield\u201d that comes with a handgun holster attached. Since I\u2019m a south paw, I removed the holster and added the drop one.",

Certainly not svelt but makes it hard to shop when advertisers cannot be bothered with actual fit range. This does not come close to fitting me shirtless let alone with layers as might be needed. The velcro on the holster is cheap and there are no additional loop supports for retention. I would not trust this rig to hold my handgun walking around my house let alone in CQB. Can't give it a real review though because the POS doesn't fit. Had the advertiser POSTED the actual size ranges I might have saved $60.",

So for the next 20 minutes, I have to fight to get out of the thing like Houdini. Zipper is a critical component, it failed, and it's cheap. BTW, the velcro noise will give you away every time. I know it's inexpensive, the photos are cool, but think twice.",

Especially all the velcro and especially where I'm parking my 45 pistol. It's not going anywhere. It's industrial grade velcro. It's just noisy, when it's a huge patch.",

Second, pouch locations/holster placement are not adjustable as described in comments, questions, and implied descriptions. Nothing is MOLLE mounted on this vest. you can not change the holster side or move pouches. They are sewn in place in fixed location. After these two issues I didn't investigate sizing or anything else in detail, I repackaged it and started my return for a full refund. Sending it back tomorrow morning in \"as recieved\" which means useless broken condition. *sigh*",

Has lots of room and six adjustable straps to make the vest snug. At 6 ft tall and 225 lbs, vest fits well and all the pockets/pouches are extremely useful and in the right places! Duty belt is great! And the back of the vest has loops to attach extra equipment. From my perspective, I see that the material is breathable, it has big pockets on the inside (like a jean jacket) and the right shoulder has extra padding for the butt of your rifle.",

The mag pockets hold knives and flashlights, the big pocket under the shot shell strip will hold a spare glasses case.

What you get: A well-made vest that can easily hold a full-size duty pistol, accessories, and magazines for any 5.56 rifle. It gives you mobility and versatility.

I'm using both Magpul type and metal ones. Each pistol pouch holds two 9mm single stack mags. I'm the left side mag pouch for my BAOFENG Radio. I love the versatility. Love the belt pockets, perfect for a small flashlight and my multi-tool. The back has plenty of MOLLE loops for other gear or hydration system. The weight is distributed evenly. Doesn't feel like anything when I'm wearing it.",

The Shotgun shell loops are a little tight for 12 gage shells but after putting some in it I soon realized that tight is good. Keeps the shells in place. The side arm mag pouches are very nice with the exception of the pouch on the holster itself which is very tight for a 40 caliber mag. Overall a great buy for what you get.",

      "text": "Just came in the mail and looks awesome!!! Great adjustablity with the size. Im a medium build and i adjusted it to fit me perfectly. but disadvantage is it wont go any smaller, so if your a small person it might not fit, at least not snug like it would be for a slightly larger person. Overall This vest is awesome, so many pockets and straps for anything you could ever want or need. Feels soft yet very sturdy when you have it on. Great material, not some crappy off brand build. Haven't tested it out for real, but im sure it will take the test/beating. we will see. recommend for anyone who wants a good quality vest.",

I allows me to place my .45 Colt Commander into the holster and to manage several clips for both my .45 and AR-15, also the added function of adding shotgun shells which is very helpful if you carry all three weapons platforms. Not sure about the cell phone holder though, with todays cell phones might be to big. Otherwise the vest is solid. I wish it was Level III or even Level II protective.",

Doing away with those questionable \"pockets\" on the belt could free some cost to provide something to keep the vest from slipping forward!",

Matter of fact there's still plenty of adjustment left to compensate for wearing it over heavy winter clothing if need be. I am very satisfied with the vest, it's great.",

I have found that if you are not looking to pull your mags out of the pouches quickly, then you can stuff 2 metal AR15 30rnd mag in each pouch. The Poly mags are very tight. The fit was perfect, I am 5\"11\" and 210lbs. A 3lt camel pack fit nice. Also you will not be able to wear a ballistic vest under it [unless your small]. For the price you can't find a better vest.",

The rifle mag pouches are somewhat small for the bulky polymer AK mags though, but if you use anything else they should fit o.k. The pistol pouch has a velcro backing that attaches to the left side of the vest, but can be quickly swapped with another pouch (included). Overall it is a great little vest for your hard-earned money. Highly recommended.",
