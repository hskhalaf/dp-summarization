Only downsides: I would prefer Velcro to the snap-in attachments on the straps which could be wider, and the scorecard holder is useless as it does not have a way to attach the scorecard. My card fell out repeatedly and had to put it in my pocket. Am planning on a paperclip work-around. However, it does the basic job of pulling my clubs very well, earning 4.5 stars from me.",

In 18 holes I usually readjust the bag and re-tighten the straps securing in it place about 2-3 times per round. This cart was very inexpensive and for me readjusting is not a big issue. It is way better than carrying the bag on my shoulders for a whole round.",
