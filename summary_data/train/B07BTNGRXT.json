I have been 100% gluten free for 10 years or so for health reasons, and I really miss having waffle cones with my ice cream. Well, I miss it no longer. This magical device heats up quickly and converts GF waffle/pancake mix (I use the Hungry Jack brand mix with sprinkles) into a hot, crispy, wonderful waffle bowl. My only complaint is that it doesn\u2019t have a switch or slider to adjust heat/doneness, so you just have to use trial and error to determine how long to leave the bowl cooking for. But this is not bad enough to reduce my 5-Star rating.",
