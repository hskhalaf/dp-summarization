It keeps about 80% of the heat from a NM sun off you, a very clear difference. Rain tends to run to end if it's sloped enough. Has held up so far to 40 mph winds with no difficulty and has solid construction with rip stop fabric. Can combine with other triangles, shapes and colors if you are feeling creative. happy so far . A lot better than spending 6k on a pergola!",

So if in doubt, get a bit smaller size. This has held up nicely to a scorching Arizona summer with a lot of monsoon high wind storms.

      "Made of 100% 185GSM New HDPE (high density polyethylene) material--No recycled materials used, more healthy and safe. The breathable fabric allows cool breezes and light to pass through for better airy and comfortable space, so the canvas isn\u2019t waterproof",
      "90% Shading rate and protect against up to 95% harmful UV rays. Perfect for gardens, patios, swimming pools, bbq areas or other outdoor area",
      "Curved sides to enhance pull strength and prevent drooping, so the actual shading area would shrink slightly, tolerance 4~6 inches for each side. You could install different shade sails of different colors and sizes to get a larger shading area",
      "Please measure the size of the installation area accurately before purchasing. Leave 1.5-2 foot space for the hardware kit between D ring and fixing points, all edges are finished slightly curved so it can be stretched tightly.It can be used for 5 years under normal usage and normal weather conditions.",
      "Stainless steel D ring on each edge and 3*4.9FT long durable ropes are strongly guarantee fastness of installation. It is recommended to install the shade sail with hardware kit that's sold separately in our shop."
