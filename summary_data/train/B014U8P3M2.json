      "text": "Not sure about these. I broke a 3/8\"bit right off the the start in mild steel tubing. As I had registerd the bits I as supposed to obtain a free replacement. Sent the broken one in along with a copy of my registration. Appears they are sending the replacement back via Madagascar. Hopefully it shows up soon. Thes maller bits appear to be much sharper and stronger than my prior cobalt set. For the price I am hoping I made a good investment. Jury is out on that.",
