This is not an information based test, it is a test of skills - and the only way to improve a skill is through practice! I scored a 154 my first time taking the LSAT, and I am currently studying for the next one where I will hopefully do better. Still plugging away at these older tests.",

Tip: Since the actual exam has 5 multiple choice sections (4 graded, 1 ungraded) but these released practice tests only contain the 4 graded sections, use the sections of one or two of the tests to simulate the extra ungraded section. While this means you will only be able to take 8 full-length practice tests under simulated conditions, it's very important to be prepared for what the test day is actually like. Plus, you will still be \"taking\" those two other tests, just not all at once.",
