Not only did she freak out from the loud hissing noise, she hid for at least ten minutes under the couch. I felt horrible for doing it. It didn't help that our other cat, Mayhem, was also scared of it. Happy to hear it works for some, but it was definitely not something for our girls.",

One spritz of it near various areas I wanted to keep my cat away from--the door to a room he was forbidden entry to, the area around my printer--and he's never ventured near them again. And on occasion, when there's somewhere else that I want to keep him away from just temporarily, all I have to do is show him the little orange spray can and he slowly backs away, the poor thing!",
