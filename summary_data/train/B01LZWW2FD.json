This thing is incredible! I'm 6'2 and 220 and had one of the best night's sleep on an ultralight pad I've ever had. The valve design is epic. It has a one way large mouth valve that fills up quickly and doesn't leak at all in between breaths. Deflating it is as easy and popping your finger in there and squeezing out the air. I got it to pack right back down to the same size it came in.",

The first time I used it, it sprung a leak which I was able to successfully fix with the included patch. The second time I used it, several more punctures occurred and it became completely useless, leading to some very cold uncomfortable nights. I was in an environment for an extended period of time where I was relying on this thing and it let me down in a big way. This items appears to sacrifice durability for size and weight. If you need something that's tough, look elsewhere.",

I will admit that it was very comfortable when it was fully inflated, but that short window of time definitely didn't make up for the rest of the night.",

Update: A few more days in the woods, and no problems at all. It did seem soft after the first night, but I think it just stretched, because it has been stable after that. No leaks, and a lot less noise than my NeoAir. I'm happy.",

      "text": "I bought one of these considering the reviews, and I thought it was a gamble looking at the price and undecided if it was really worth. While I still think is a bit expensive, I do not regret it and bought two more for my kids. At the beginning I thought it was too thin, because it is thin. However, I'm about 240lbs, and I was able to sleep very comfortable while using it on gravel and not feel not one rock on my back. Very small and light, so it is a good item for backpacking. I recommended specially if you want to save space in your backpack.",

      "text": "So far rather impressed. I have some real pricy sleeping pads for alpine and winter use, but needed something cheap and light for a friend who\u2019s joining me on an upcoming trip. This was really easy to inflate, and had a \u201cvalve\u201d to keep air in while inflating. It\u2019s quite light and packs down smaller than a nalgene. It doesn\u2019t have any internal insulation so I\u2019d say it\u2019s best as a summer pad. We\u2019ll see how well it works in shoulder season but I imagine it will be adequate if you\u2019re a warm sleeper.",

Didnt take too many breaths which is a huge plus! It lasted on the floor for over 2+ weeks. I'm sure it wouldve stayed inflated had I not deflated it. When I finally did have a camping trip I took it with me and same experience super fast and easy setup and comfortable! I wish it was insulated! Love the little carrying bag it comes with.",

It was easy to blow up and take air out and was about to pack it back up perfectly. So I will give credit to that. But the sliding around is the major design flaw. When not sliding around was comfy.",

It tappers down by the feet, but is it comfortable, don't feel like I'm falling off; even has room for my Jack Russel to lay by my feet. I'm a stomach sleeper too, so that can make a difference. We need a little more squishy-ness than back sleepers, and less than side sleepers. I also brought it with me back home for xmas, this made sleeping on a flat futon so much better!",

No snags or leaks on our almost week-long trip. I think it's really great. I'd suggest pairing this with a closed cell foam pad to keep warm in the colder months and to keep from sliding around the tent.",
