I over tightened so the plastic clamp between the nut and seal twisted around the stem, and then it wouldn't leak. This would eventually strip the stem. Edit 12/14/17 There is a ridge top (concave side, middle not outer edge) of the piece that clamps onto the rubber seal. I removed this with my dremel. Still not leak PROOF but only a drop our two comes out instead of a small stream when turned upside down.",

This thermos/canteen met all of my needs. It never ever leaks, the design of the lid is both easy to clean and leak proof. The wide mouth shape is perfect for drinking without risk of spilling anything on myself by accident. The 20oz is just right for filling with 16oz of cold brew and the rest of the space for ice. The exterior finish/coating I thought would be slippery when wet but surprisingly it doesn't get slick when wet.",

Not a huge fan of the colors, they will all eventually chip, but buy the striaght stainless one, and youll be happy forever. Smart look, great functionality! Oh, also, the polished bottom piece is a nice touch. I think its really just redundant protection over the bottom and the seal where they pulled the air out, but I for one appreciate the detail.",

This definitely exceeded our expectation as it kept his coffee hot for actually longer than he expected (the company claims up to 10 hours, but he did not keep his beverage in the bottle for that long). Nice matte color and we did not have any leak issue. The top part was easy to disassemble to clean, but my gripe is that you need a good bottle brush to clean the inside of the 16 oz bottle (and probably 22 oz) thoroughly, as the opening is too small to be able to fit most adult hand with a sponge to clean.",

Make sure to tighten the plastic wingnut on the underside of the lid in order to solve this.

I think mostly because when you're drinking very hot liquid, the lip is large enough that the liquid sits there briefly before hitting your mouth - it gives you a chance to 'sip' before you burn your mouth. Many travel mugs have only two options; drink immediately and risk burning your mouth, or spill it all over yourself. Also - this is mug is very easy to clean, has a water-tight seal, and hold liquid cold or hot for hours... Fantastic product!",
