I liked the Elite so much that I bought a medium 6'6\" Elite. I tried the ultra sensitive all graphite expensive rods and I am done breaking the bank and my rods. I own 7 Ugly Stiks now and I dont think I will buy anything else. They just can't be beat! I put a Pflueger President on my medium for bass fishing and a Pflueger Trion on the ultra lite for pan fishing. These are great combos and I love using them.",

Long story short, don't eye ball the rod itself without it being fully set up as they will ALL appear to be bent!",
