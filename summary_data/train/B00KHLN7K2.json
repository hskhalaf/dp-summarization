The plastic lid is made of a brittle plastic. I accidentally dropped the lid from a height of about 3 feet onto a vinyl floor and the hinge snapped in half. Dropping something from that height onto a softer surface should not have resulted in the break. I would not recommend for frequent use.",

Too thin for pickles and about the only thing It is good for is making a salad.

Good idea; faulty design, because the plastic piece breaks easily during routine use, forcing you to buy a new $30 bowl which has the same faulty design.",

It was functioning well the first four times but just this afternoon, I used it to mix something for desert and noticed the puree button wasn't engaging. This after much care was taken in its use, clean-up and storage. If I can return it, I would in a heartbeat but since I've been on an ordering binge with Amazon, my place is too full of boxes so I had to get rid of the packaging for this blender as soon as I determined it was working the day it arrived. Very, very, very disappointed.",

To my disappointment, the material is cheap. It only works after several adjustments to the food placed inside and you have to keep pressing the button until it is finished. If you raise your hand up, you have to open, readjust before you press again. It is time consuming, it does not cut as efficiently as just a total waste of my time.",

Though people have complained that when you process food, it's not as even texture as others at higher price points, I disagree. This processes food evenly and quickly. Also, when I purchased, I was always worried about keeping it on too long, but there is no need to worry about that with this product. I can leave it on \"puree\" mode for 5+ minutes at a time without worry. Overall, a fantastic purchase.",

Already have to many kitchen gadgets taking up drawer space. It is super big at 12 cups. I have never had to cut up veggies transfer to bowl then cut up more. Can't beat the pour spout. My pancake batter goes from being mixed to pouring right on the griddle. I would give it six stars if I could.",
