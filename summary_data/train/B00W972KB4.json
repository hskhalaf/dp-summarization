Every time you will change HDMI Input you have to wait at least 5 minutes for \"Toggle\" or On/Off before the right input and the sound comes out. Very Frustrating.

I would have to run the speaker calibration again or completely power cycle the system several times a day. So for that reason I returned it.

Unfortunately the software is really quite basic and often crashes. The interface on the TV is like something from a 1980s computer and sometimes it refuses to respond. The remote control also looks like it been made by fisherPrice and has a cheap feel to it. Overall happy but sometimes the software drives me crazy!",

    "title": "2016 Enclave Audio CineHome HD 5.1 Wireless Home Theater System",
    "description": "At Enclave, we understand that half of the movie experience is heard and not seen. With the popularized sound bar audio solution, true surround sound is dismissed for convenience, ease of setup, and wiring issues. The Enclave Audio 5.1 WiSA Certified Wireless Home Theater System solves all that and more with uncompromising true wireless surround sound. The Enclave Smart Center connects to your TV with a single cable and will host HDMI and SPDIF (Optical) sources, including satellite, cable, streaming appliances, and gaming consoles. Included with the system is a wireless subwoofer, wireless rear speakers, wireless front speakers, a remote control, and the Enclave Audio Smart Center Speaker with ARC and CEC support.Note: The system works best with the left and right speakers either even with or in front of the center channel speaker. \n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\n\n\nTRUE 5.1 WIRE FREE HD AUDIO HOME THEATER Enclave Audio 5.1 wireless home theater system offers uncompromising true wireless surround sound with the ability to easily place your speakers as 5.1 surround was designed and intended. Surrounding you. Whether it is movies, music, sports, or video gaming, Enclave wirelessly surrounds you with every nuance of every sound, bringing your home theater experience to life as you've never heard it before. \n\nWIRELESS AUDIO REDEFINED - JUST UNBOX, POWER UP, AND GO Simply place your speakers in the appropriate location, plug in the speakers' AC power adaptors into any 110/220v power source, load up your Enclave Smart Center with audio sources, and the WiSA certified Enclave Audio system is ready to deliver 24 bit uncompressed audio wirelessly, straight out of the box with no configuration necessary. \n\n\n\n\nMULTIPLE INPUTS 3 HDMI inputs to connect your cable box, dish, gaming console, DVD-Blu Ray Player, Streaming appliance (Apple TV, Amazon Fire, Roku, etc.), HDMI pass-thru, CEC, and ARC are all supported. \n\nBIPOLE REAR SPEAKERS Each Enclave rear surround speaker contains two full-range drivers on opposing sides of the enclosure for a widespread, yet enveloping surround experience. \n\nStreaming and System Updates The Enclave Audio app for Android/iOS lets you stream music from your device, local network, or a selection of music services via Bluetooth or Googlecast (Chromecast required). Also update your Enclave Audio CineHome with the latest firmware releases for enhanced performance and feature additions. \n\n\n\n\nTHE WIRELESS HOME THEATER REVOLUTION BEGINS NOW No more soundbars giving you lackluster audio performance, Wifi drop outs, or Bluetooth latency. The Enclave Audio CineHome HD brings crisp, clear sound to your music, movies and games with WiSA wireless technology found in audio systems costing up to $20,000! \n\n\n\n\nAbout the Startup Describe your product in 3 words.\n\nWireless. Surround. Sound.\n\nHow did you come up with the idea for this product?\n\nWhile the rest of the consumer audio world was focused on making soundbars and whole house audio solutions, we found it quite discouraging that no one was focused on a single room true 5.1 wireless home theater experience. We believe half of the movie experience is heard and not seen so we took it upon ourselves to build what the market currently did not offer. The end result - an affordable, true 5.1, wireless HD audio surround sound system that you just unbox, plug in, and go.\n\nWhat makes your product special?\n\nOur product allows anyone with power outlets in their living room to enjoy a true 5.1 surround sound experience by having 6 independent speaker enclosures surround you with sound wirelessly, but with the simplicity of a sound bar set up. The WiSA Technology used in our system is found in systems that cost 5X - 20X as much, we are passionate about sound and knew that Wifi and Bluetooth audio transmission wasn't going to cut it. We worked tirelessly to incorporate this new technology, with speakers that were custom tuned to work with eachother at an incredible price. It doesn\u2019t get easier than Enclave's plug and play setup experience with rock solid sound that packs a punch.\n\nWhat has been the best part of your startup experience?\n\nThe best part of our startup experience has been building a team with like-minded individuals and working together to bring to reality a product we had in our head, that the market had a need for, and our customers thank us for.",
