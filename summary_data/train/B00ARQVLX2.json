At first I thought the unit was defective, but the instructions in the manual indicates the both buttons must be pressed. The button on top indicates it is a Lock button. I returned the unit. I found a local store with one unit that didn't have the extra button and the others on the shelf did.",

The newer model's design forces my wife to use two hands to operate it. I can stretch my fingers out to push the button on top AND the start button, but what a pain! I'd look elsewhere.

I may go back to a regular mixer or use my Vitamix. I was hoping this blender would save time and less mess by blending in whatever cook pot I was using.

The two handed safety switch (that others have felt was a negative) is not a big deal and really is designed to be a safety feature; like many safety designs is really only appreciated when it saved one from injury.
