The bag seems pretty discouraging since it's harder to zip open the main compartment. There is a outer zipper, but if u set it up right, it will be difficult to open also. The inner zippers are hidden and blocked by the bag straps. The bag storage is pretty good. Laptop storage and a smaller bag/pouch combo for phone, wallet etc. Overall not a bad bag. Like the look and the extra sense of security.",

Looks really good though. I'd give it 1 start but it does look very good and was made very well with the stitching, but you are honestly better off with Jansport or $10 knock off brand than this thing. I'd say this one is a poser to the higher quality packs that came out by the real guys. This one does not measure up.",

Very sturdy and is packed tight enough to make it as easy as possible on your back. The side pockets also make enough room to conceal a couple of water bottles or even a small umbrella which is very nice to have.",
