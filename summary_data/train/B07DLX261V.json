I have sent back Mopnado total junk fell apart as well as one I recently purchased another smaller version of Mopnado different company. This is the best and ease of use and I like the rectangle bucket. You push it around with your mop handle there is no handle attached to drag it. It has a nice sturdy handle to carry it around. Will purchase again. Thank you so much for a great product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

The 3 mop heads that are included all work really well. I have travertine floors, and am very picky about how they are cleaned. The microfiber mop heads are soft, non abrasive & clean really well. The spin system is ingenious, & I can't believe how effective and easy it is to use. Having the cleaning dispenser in the bucket is so convenient. Compared to other mop & buckets I've purchased over the years this is by far the best, & definitely my favorite. I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this item.",
