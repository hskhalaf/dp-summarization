It's small and powerful. The coffee comes out smelling and tasting great every time with no grounds. Takes up very little space on the counter and so easy to use! I am so pleased with this purchase and the price was great as well. I am now thinking of buying another one for the office.",

Makes coffee as efficiently as the much more expensive Keurig\u00ae that it replaced and the small footprint is exactly what I needed for the rather cramped space where it is situated. I highly recommend this coffee maker. UPDATED REVIEW: Twenty days after purchase the Chulux Coffee Maker stopped working (and only used around 10 times). Unfortunately, I discarded the packaging after a couple weeks, so no way I can make a return. Bottom line -- ya get what ya pay for.",

Lo and behold Amazon was having a Father's Day special so I immediately ordered it. This Chulux is simple to operate and makes a fabulous cup of coffee. I haven't experienced any problems with the Chulux. Coffee is hot and flavorable and NO coffee grinds in my cup or in the coffee maker. Love it.",

I use a measuring cup & it doesn\u2019t dispense the same amount it was filled with.

You need to be careful of pouring in the water... needs a container with a good spout that delivers the water directly into the hole. I was almost out of Melita filters for my 1-cup pour-over, and decided to give this a try... am not disappointed. It doesn't take up a lot of space. **You do need to purchase reusable coffee pods if you will not be using the disposable, pre-filled pods. No grounds go into the coffee as long as you don't overfill the coffee pod and make sure it's shut securely.",

Where a true Kurieg will do the adjustment, the Chulux requires you to actually measure the water 12 ounces makes a weaker cup then say 8 or 6 ounces. Other than that, I'm pleased with this purchase, this is not my primary coffee maker, it's for the times I want a single cup or a hot drink in the evenings. This works with most kcups out there. Couldn't rate the durability seeing as how I just received it. Overall very happy with this purchase",

Couple of things to point out about it....it takes about 4-5 minutes to make a cup(it's a single cup maker). That's because it takes time to heat the water. I will say when it is done, the coffee is very hot...so the heating system works for sure! The taste isn't the best(I give that a 3.5....but it could also be the coffee pods I'm using too), but it does have a coffee taste nonetheless. I'm glad I made this purchase. I've had a Keurig before this and it didn't taste any better in my opinion and it is 3x the cost.",

      "text": "Have used for almost two years and still making good coffee. I bought to use when I had to travel for surgery; do use at home if I feel like a cup of coffee in evening. Small enough to pack in suitcase, makes quick and good coffee! Uses any maker of pods. I don't use every day. I've only used filtered or bottled water, as instructed. Can also use refillable pod. Cleans up easy, make small or larger cup, you choose the amount of water. I recommend to anyone who wants coffee anywhere they go!",

Seems light-weight and plastic-y, but easy to use and makes a good cup of coffee.",

Now on my second one and within one week it started doing the same thing. Only ran about 4 ounces then stopped. Stand there and press the button again to get another 4 or so ounces. Will be returning this one also.",

You add however much water you want to make strong or weak coffee. ONLY suggestion would be to just make sure you empty it out before packing it in your bag.
