I know they make \"better\" \"newer\" one's but I've wanted the matching White/black combo for years and these are EVERYTHING I've wanted!! Lol The only negative I had ( hence the 4*) is it comes with the 1.5 ah batteries, If it came with the 2.0 ah batteries I woulda gave a 5 but still SUPER Happy!!!",

There may be better (Festool?) but between ergonomics, price & performance these are the best choice for us. If I'd read more carefully, I wouldn't have ordered w/ 1.5am, but not worth returning. Perhaps they'll serve as lighter followup kit (I tried little 12v some years ago, for this purpose, seduced because they were cute, but batteries were dreadful). Slightly larger concern is that drill, not impact gun, doesn't seem to fit other batteries. Again not a big issue but compatibility is important when you're on a ladder with 20 minutes to go on a Friday afternoon....;)",
