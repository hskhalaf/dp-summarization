They are smaller than Hostess Donettes, even when filled to the brim. The spatula is really nice and sturdy as well as the mold itself. Also, using the piping bags was 100% necessary and actually made it really easy to fill the cavities as well as easier on clean up. It would almost make sense to have more than one of these to do multiple batches at a time, but I don't think I liked it enough to spend more money on the same mediocre product.",
