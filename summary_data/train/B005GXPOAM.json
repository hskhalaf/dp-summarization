Different foot sets, needles, everything even a new beginning sewer could ask for.",

What I like most is the monogramming option! My son plays baseball, I like to have his jersey # on his hats, haven\u2019t done it yet but I can when I feel comfortable enough to do so. Box was puncture on one side but no damage was dThe threading option is neat, the bobbin winding, the footless sewing, reverse sewing all awesome for me. The reason I gave it 4 not 5 stars is because the monogramming is a set size, I\u2019ve included a picture, wish they could go bigger but I guess.",

Only thing I don't like is the threader, it makes no sense to me and is jut difficult. Love this machine though!!",

I grew up around sewing machines, ( my mom at one point had 12 new and or collectible), so I know a lot about these machines. For my first machine I am super happy with the ease of use. The only down side is the embroidery is a little sloppy but that may be just a user error. Love it!",
