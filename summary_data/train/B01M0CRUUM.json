Tried various substrates with varied results, a very slow and painful process. You need a space suite and welding gloves, the bounce back on a short nozzle is vicious, you get substrate in every orifice known to man. So what is it useful for? Paint strip everything first, wipe/ wire brush off the majority of the paint and use this thingie as a final polishing tool.....period.",

Lightweight design helps to make it easy to hold in different positions. Long pull trigger makes it easy to use one or many fingers to pull it.

This kind of messed up my plans of what I was going to use it for. When held vertical it worked great. I put the aluminum oxide media in it and it cut through rust and paint like butter.
