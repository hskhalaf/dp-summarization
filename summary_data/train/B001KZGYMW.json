Alternatively, if I am only going on a day hike, I can also opt to bring only a single, smaller platy bottle attached to the drinking hose. The setup is minimalist, lightweight, and modular. Additionally, the location of the filling/dispensing hole means that this system is easier to fill/dry compared to more expensive CamelBak systems.",

Really liked how fast the water flows through the Hose and bite valve. Kept the bladder in the big zipper pocket in my pack. When I put my pack down the bite valve would sometimes hit the dirt (my fault) and surprisingly was easy to clean off. All in all happy with the purchase and happy how it performed in the field.",

It's a pain to take it out of the backpack, fill it up, then work it back into the backpack and route the hose. Cleaning is a real chore.

One other downside is that it's a little difficult to fill from a natural spring because the opening is only about an inch in diameter. If that's not a concern then this is a great buy. Only use purified water though because other liquids could compromise the integrity of the vessel.",
