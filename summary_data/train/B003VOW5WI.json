I tried everything, every window position, temporarily outside, in the exact same location we could use our cell phones, etc. In addition, the requirement that the base be a certain distance from the antenna was difficult to resolve.",

      "text": "Although the customer support was most helpful, there is a design flaw in the unit itself. In an area of periodic signal loss, (such as living in the mountains) the unit is not designed to reset when the signal is regained. The result is that phone service may be out for hours or days before the consumer notices the red flashing light, and power cycles the booster. With careful adjustment to the antenna direction, I have been able to get the system to be perhaps 95 percent operational... still it's that five percent that could be an emergency call missed, that is a problem.",

It is very easy to install and setup. Out of the box, ready to use only takes five (5) to ten (10) minutes to be up and running with a signal boost of three (3} to four (4) bars. I can now use my Cell Phone anywhere in my residence. These same units sell for $300.00 in retail stores, which is rediculous, so the Amazon price fairly resonable. You will not be disappointed in this unit, for home use, if you are having problems with your Cell Phone signal.",

I racked up over 10,000 cell rollover minutes, ALL minutes going to waste and ALL while haveing to use long distance calling family and friends on a land line!

A recommendation I've been giving to customers is on the location of your external antenna. The best way to test your signal strength is by placing your phone where you are going to mount the antenna. If you can't get a steady signal with your phone then you aren't going to get a steady signal with the booster. You don't have to have five bars but as long as the signal doesn't come and go then the antenna will work great at that location. Great item from Wi-Ex.",

We installed the antenna at the highest point we could reach on their roof. We used the cable that was provided, drilled a hole in the wall and pushed it through into a closet near the center of the home. Once we powered the unit, cell service was immediately available on everyone's cell phones, Very easy to install and highly recommended.",
