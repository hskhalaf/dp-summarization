The remote features and the mic does not work on my android phone which needs a type-c to aux converter. I only use these for when I'm doing stuff on my laptop and staying still. That's pretty much all these are good for, listening to music while not moving, which is fine because the sound quality is pretty good for the price I got them for $45.",

I'll keep an eye on it but for now I'm very happy with this purchase.

Also, using the control button to repeat or skip a song rarely works. 11/12/2014 Update: They just broke. The left earbud just fell completely apart. What a waste of money.

The music can be turned on if the power button on the cord gets pressed. So, if you hear music coming faintly from somewhere..well there you go.

I bet that stuffing these in my pocket day after day had an effect on how long these lasted and I bet if you take perfect care of them they will last forever.

I personally have grown to find in-ear phones inferior, and now prefer a set of on- or over-ear headphones, such as the Tracks HD's (around $100). Given the quality of the Tracks, I thought these might be a cut above similar in-ear choices, but I decided ultimately to return them.",

      "text": "I LOVE in ear earphones, but SOL slapped this big conical piece of plastic on the back on the driver. That's right that big flat round piece has NOTHING to do with sound, its purely cosmetic and makes it harder get a good fit due to the size, weight and angle of that back piece. Also, that back piece broke one, which SOL was very kind to replace at no cost, but that's when I figured out that it's purely cosmetic. The wire passes through it but that's it. I think if they could consider the fit more carefully, these would be great.",
