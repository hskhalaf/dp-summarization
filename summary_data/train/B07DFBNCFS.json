It\u2019s been great! They remind me of the kissing Simba and Nala toys from the 90\u2019s!! Great memories. Very satisfied with this purchase.",

I literally thought they took batteries and nuzzled they\u2019re heads together but no.....there is TINY MAGNETS in their heads. But the problem is the magnet is probably the weakest magnet on the planet. You have to get it JUST RIGHT or the magnet doesn\u2019t attach and even when it does, it\u2019s so weak they don\u2019t even stay \u201cnuzzling\u201d most of the time. If my daughter didn\u2019t care about keeping them as stuffed animals, I would send it back. To advertise this as \u201cnuzzling lions\u201d is a joke.",
