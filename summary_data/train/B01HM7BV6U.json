Already assembled so will try part from old grill. My husband is a mechanical genius so he will figure something out. One or more of the reviews also said no part available. Will use a long lighter if needed. Good grill for the price.",

Thus, put the knob side of the firebox facing or on the same side as the black shield. Have needle nose pliers for sliding the igniter wires on to the igniter push button. If you get a side burner, that ignition wire goes onto the side slide of the igniter housing while the main igniter goes directly into the back or center of the igniter housing.",

I am HORRIBLE with directions, but this was fairly easy to put together. I will say this. Connect the ignitor wire from the side burner to the ignitor BEFORE you put on the protective silver plate.

Someone wrote it took them 4 hours to assemble? It took me about an hour, that included taking coffee breaks, phone calls etc....I could see it being difficult for someone that's not mechanically inclined. The packaging was incredible...suitable for inter galactic shipment. Haven't fired it up yet...gonna try tomorrow",

      "text": "This isn't a bad starter grill for someone who wants to test out how often they'll actually use a gas grill before making a big investment. The locking device and holder for the tank could use some improvements, and it is lacking a thermometer which is more of a nice to have. If you're handy with a step drill bit you can add one on the cheaper end. It does heat up quick and retains heat fairly well, but be prepared to use a match or long stem lighter to get it going. The starter button isn't worth the red plastic it is made of.",
