We traded this in for the the 16-cup professional model, which is significantly more expensive, but will be the last food processor we ever buy.",

      "text": "I LOVED my old KitchenAid food processor. This one--it does process food (reason it gets two stars rather than one) ; however, one cannot get the parts completely clean. Food works its way into the inner parts of the top and the handle in the main processing bowl. It is disgusting to look at. I have tried all sorts of ways to clean this machine. Also, food often comes out of the bottom of the processor bowl. I cannot recommend this food processor. I wish I could find the Good Will store to whom I I donated my old one. As soon as I can, I am getting rid of this one and will buy another brand!",

When it did turn on it struggled to grate one of the cheese sticks and then the blade stuck about halfway through. Took it apart to see if the cheese was jammed in the blade. No it was fine put it back together same deal. Once I got it to turn on again. Then the motor started smoking. Ended up grating the cheese by hand. Requested a return after dinner. Received a automatic response with free return shipping label, refund showed up on my cc a few days later.",

The machine feels cheap from the moment you pick it up, the motor whirs like a hamster on its wheel. Extremely disapointed.",

Update: Have determined that the shut where food items are inserted was not seated properly. A safety feature that disables the unit until it correctly in place. Works great when everything in in place.",

The only thing I didn't like is when you use the 3 cup bowl it's a little hard to get the top on - the key is to make sure the blade setting is lowest and line everything up exactly. I was grinding walnuts and some of the ground nuts got blown into the large bowl but not too much. It's powerful and works well for what I need.",
