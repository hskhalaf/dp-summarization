Unfortunatelly I cannot return them, but those shoes either are 2nd choice or foulty (I'm even thinking fake ones... but hope not for the seller). The low price doesn't justify this low quality. Avoid buyng this shoes from SHOEZOO.",

The soles and springs covering were covered in glue that would not come off. Still had the numbers written in grease pencil where it was rejected.",
