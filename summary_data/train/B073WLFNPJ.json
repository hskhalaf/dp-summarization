The wood is real and looks weathered and rustic, but the screw hole are left open and are noticeable. It works for my bathroom but as it is on a wall that shows the sides show I'm not thrilled to see the open screw holes.I feel that really takes away from the look of the shelf a lot. Also when putting it together consumers need to be careful when screwing in the shelves that they are lined up perfectly or the screw may split the wood, it happened to me.",
