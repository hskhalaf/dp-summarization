I've gotten VNC, Remote Desktop, an android terminal, and many other apps to work; for light computing this is entirely good enough to replace a desktop. Also great for organizing your photos and writing long emails.",

My suggestion is to find a USBC to HDMI cable and purchase yourself a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. The other thing is, if you're using any kind of sturdy case to protect your phone you're out of luck. You'll have to take your phone out of the case in order for it to set properly in the Cradle.
