This little Champion has a higher rating, set right up using the BadLands remote setup and pulls like a train. You can see the difference in quality right out of the box, and it was not much more than the garbage one, plus it has a higher rating. Also now have a Champion generator, and that thing is awesome too, so far........",

      "text": "I purchased this winch to install onto my 2004 Honda Foreman 450fe. I chose to purchase a separate mounting plate trhough Amazon thats made specifically for my Honda ATV instead of using the provided generic plate. The Winch and the Fairlead fit the plate perfectly and then I still had room to mount the whole assembly into place after turning the ATV wheels to the right. It was a tight fit but it went into the frame just fine. The winch works great, looks great, and was really easy to wire up. Would recommend to anyone looking for a quality winch.",

The winch works fine but when I you press the winch in, or winch out buttons they usually fail to work. As a result, I have to keep re-pressing the buttons 5, or 6 times until it finally activates the the winch. Very frustrating. I'll try to contact Champion to see if they will replace the control box and wiring. Other than that it pulls strong and it holds loads without drifting. I just called Champion Customer Service and they agreed to send a new control box. I should get it next week.",

It is about 20 dollars more than the 2500 lb Harbor Freight version, but it is well worth it. There is no need to find a place to hide the large solenoid and fuze that comes with the Harbor freight version.",

Second, the switch is quite bulky, the buttons are rather hard to push and the contacts are very iffy which is very irritating when trying to raise/lower a plow on the move. Fully 50% of the time I have to push again, and harder, to get the switch to engage. Final issue: this is my first winch and I don't have much experience, but it makes a rather unpleasant and loud grinding noise in operation. Maybe they're all that way; if so, disregard my concern.",

    "title": "Champion 3000-lb. ATV/UTV Winch Kit",
    "description": "The Champion Power Equipment 13004 3000-lb. ATV/UTV Winch Kit includes everything you need to start winching, including a mounting channel, a roller fairlead and a remote control. With a rated line pull of 3000 pounds, mount this winch on your ATV or side by side with the mounting channel to quickly harness the strength of its 1.3-horsepower (12-volt) DC permanent magnet motor. The 46-foot by 3/16-inch galvanized, super-duty aircraft cable is less prone to fraying, even when used in highly abrasive terrain, such as in rocks, mud, or sand. This incredibly strong cable is guided onto the 1.5 by 3.2-inch drum through the reliable roller fairlead to maximize the life of the cable. The three-stage planetary gear system along with the free-spooling clutch and handlebar-mounted remote control offer excellent control while winching. Designed with your safety in mind, this winch features dynamic braking of the winch drum so you\u2019ll have the stopping power you need for each job. With a gear reduction ratio of 171:1, the winch boasts a line speed of 4.3 feet per minute with a full load, and 8.9 feet per minute with no load. Accompanied by the heavy-duty clevis hook and handy strap, this compact and lightweight tool is anything but lightweight when it comes to power. Offering much more than a motor and a spool of rope, the Champion 3000-lb. Winch Kit is a necessary tool for any situation you might encounter. Champion Support and our nationwide network of service centers will back up your purchase with a 2-year limited warranty and FREE lifetime technical support.",
