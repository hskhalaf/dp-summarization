It charged with no difficulty and my entire family likes using it. The one item that I don't like is that it provides no protection for the iPad. It was not advertised as a protective cover. I like the magnetic way that it attaches and also the sturdiness of the keyboard. If it had more protection I would give it five stars.",

The battery charge seems to last forever: I recharge it maybe once a month and type up to an hour a day. It came with a slightly under-sensitive \"4\" key and that has remained an issue. I just have to hit it a little harder than all the other keys, would have been a 5-star review without this minor quality-control issue. All other keys started off working great and have remained that way. I wish the magnet holding it to the ipad was a bit stronger, sometimes they separate too easily.",

When closed, it turns off your screen and the Keyboard sleep mode allows it to work for many weeks on one charge. It's a great bang for the buck.

Another problem is the tab function which is essentially a 2-key pressing function. However, the worst part of this keyboard is the inability to securely close the iPad when keyboard is not in use, this should not be called a cover as this is misleading...

Specifically, it doesn't stay securely closed when folded up, and it falls off if you try to swing it out of the way. So you're stuck worrying about your ipad falling open or falling apart when carrying it. The keyboard also ends up so close to the screen that you can easily brush against the screen while typing, moving your cursor or worse. Also, the A key is way bigger than it needs to be while the ; and ' keys get short shrift. Seems like a better placement of ' at least would be helpful.",

Almost three months and I'm still on the first charge. One minor issue is that the glass screen protector on my mini adds just enough extra width to the profile that positioning of the mini within the groove meant to hold the mini in place while typing becomes unreliable, especially in the less-upright position. Be aware of this limitation when choosing a screen protector--a film screen protector would likely prove more effective. Overall, I'm quite pleased with this product.",

Has a great keyboard action and I love that you don't have to sacrifice 1/2 of your ipad screen to type. The only downfall is it could use a case of some sort to keep it clean and dust free when not in use.",

This simple and effective device is a great win-win with the ability to protect and multitask as a stand and a keyboard. Blue-tooth pairing took maybe 5 seconds. Thanks Logitech!",

It's unfortunate because I think this is otherwise a sturdy product. If you have small hands or perhaps order this product for a larger iPad, I'd suggest making this Logitech purchase.",
