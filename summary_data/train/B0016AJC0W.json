      "text": "I've treated a few trees with this wrap in Arizona. Although mostly protected from the sun, this wrap would disintegrate over the course of 9-12 months. Because it's made of plastic, it would dry up and literally fall apart. We first noticed small white pieces on the ground. Further inspection showed the wrap was coming off due to it eroding from the sun/heat. We try not to use things made of plastic in the outdoor AZ sun for this exact reason. I should have noticed the \"made of polypropylene fabric\" in the description. The brown paper type wrap we used on the same trees lasted much longer, held up much better.",

Also, it has no mechanism for self-adherence and required tape to keep the end in place before applying the tanglefoot. Once applied (as noted with pressure and adhesive end), it did the job of holding the tanglefoot in place, which has captured ants, flying insects, and other crawly things, allowing my fruit trees to thrive without infestation!",
