      "text": "Replaced the petrified grip on my 40-year-old Bullseye putter with this, and it brought the old club back to life. As soon as my brother-in-law saw and felt this, we ordered another for his old putter. I prefer the Slim style of the Super- Stroke to the fat one, for which I can never get a proper feel. Installation is a snap if you have one of the kits designed for the purpose, and the regripped putter is playable immediately.",

I wanted to test out a larger, 2.0 grip, but wanted to be ready to switch right back to the 1.0 grip that has been successful for me. So I bought both grips at the same time. The 1.0 grip is perfect for those who want a little more stability in the putting stroke without going to a hugely oversized grip. I like both 1.0 and 2.0 grips now -- not sure which one will \"win my loyalty.\"",
