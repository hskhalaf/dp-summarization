Also great for targeted heat, put one near my dogs\u2019 kennels in stairwell and keeps their corner warm. Moves easily. Remote and timer are very convenient. Save money on heating bills in larger houses by just heating where you need it. Would be great in a garage as well.",

I got one of those as seen on heaters that you plug into the wall and it just stays there on the wall and it does a better job to heat a normal sized bedroom than this full size heater does. Strange. On top of that, the unit itself gets very hot, so it seems like a hazard.",
