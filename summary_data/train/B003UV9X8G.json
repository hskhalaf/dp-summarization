      "text": "I bought this for parties and it worked great the first few uses but it soon developed a leak in the mechanism allowing air in after about 4 uses. This made it so that any beer coming out was all foam and you couldn't get a solid flow of beer anymore. I had been cleaning it about every other use up to that point, but I don't see how an air leak could have occurred from lack of cleaning after these few uses. I think there are better longer lasting products on the market but its hard to beat this price",

We've had great success, and our PBR flows out so freakin' smoothly. UPDATE: Man, it died on us. But it lasted far longer than I really anticipated for the price (damn near a year). What gave out, you ask? I can't be 100% certain, but I want to say a spring on the inside of the plunger gave way. It wouldn't pressure up much more than a single fart's worth. Eh well, was worth it for the time we had it!",
