The entire unit was covered in black grease and fingerprints, gross but not the end of the world. Then after using it for about an hour for the first time, the handle snapped into two parts. I ended up attaching my drill to the unit and used that the crank the unit. I'm still giving it 2 stars and not just one star because a) it was less than $100 and b) it works fine (just not with the handle it came with).",

The first thing I noticed was the smell, it had the grease/oily smell of an auto repair garage. There were also grease smudges inside. So again, take some time to really clean this. Taking it apart and putting it back together was not rocket science. The handle seems pretty flimsy, it is made from a soft metal. I don't anticipate this part lasting long. The crank/spinning motion is smooth. I just extracted (on 3/15/18) 8 frames of honey fairly easy.",

My reason for purchasing this unit is that it was the only unit I could find in this price range that is offered by a brand name company. I was afraid of the others in this price range that were from companies that were not recognized beekeeping supply companies. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a affordable extractor. Of course I would not expect it to hold up a large scale commercial application.",
