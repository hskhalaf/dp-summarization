I have used these and wore them every single day from May thru September, but finally decided it was time for a replacement. I love the quality of these shoes, but putting my foot in one of the old ones with my other foot in one of the new ones, there is a huge change in feeling. The quality is there, but the strap has stretched over time, constant wearing and walking, being soaking wet, the heat, the dirt, the cold, etc. I will continue buying these exact shoes Every couple years.",

I buy different colors, such as the black leopard, or the black pair I recently purchased, but all of them provide good support with the air cushion in the heel. I live on the Gulf Coast, so I need something cool to wear on my feet due to the warm climate. They make great shoes at the beach, and the opener on the bottom comes in handy sometimes. I hope they continue to make this style, because it's a great shoe!",

My feet have grown, but the sizing had to have changed in the past few years...just saying. They also run a tad wide which is good for my almost \"wide\" foot...just saying.",

This pair is my 4th and I could tell as soon as I picked them up, something has changed with their manufacture. They are lighter (not in a good way) - the materials seem lighter, like molded plastic, and the sole is one formed/cast piece rather than a construction of sole and support inserts. I suspect that the sole will wear out much faster than previous pairs. I'm hoping I'm wrong, and these last as long as my others have, but I suspect that won't be the case.",

These new ones are still being broke in but it is still the same quality. These new Fannings are ridged when you first wear them, but they form to your foot after a few times. Others have said they are uncomfortable, I can see this if you are wearing them on concrete, they're not a distance walking shoe. I would recommend buying a half size larger, I'm consistently an 8.5 women's but the 9 works best for me.",

I find myself always coming back to Reefs because of the comfortable fit, the overall quality of wearability/durability but most especially because of the toe strap. The toe strap is for me one of the most important must have comfort elements. I usually go for the standard basic women's balck thin straps (which is a little more feminine). This design while a bit wider and sporty, again the toe strap fabric and design is extremely comfortable as is the additional lift air comfort to the heel on impact. Extremely good sandal all around for price.",
