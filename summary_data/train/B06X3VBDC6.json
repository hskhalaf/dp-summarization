It\u2019s one of those things that you always have on the back of your mind and then when your electronic goes dead and you\u2019re unable to charge it you wish and get mad at yourself for not having gotten it. It is extremely durable. I love it because I share it with my little one so I don\u2019t have to be afraid of him being careless and getting it wet since it\u2019s waterproof.",

How long does it take to charge? How do I know how much of a charge is left after I use it to charge my phone? What does the blinking red light mean? Is it charging or discharging? My previous charger, which was recalled by Amazon, showed the number of charged cells remaining. This was a very helpful indicator for charger life. Wish this one had that feature. Then it would not only be cute, but also useful.",
