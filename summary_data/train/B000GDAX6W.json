The surge protectiion light is on so I hope it's working correctly for that. However, whenever I go to pull a plug out, the entire thing likes to come out of the wall outlet along with the plug I'm pulling. The last multi-outlet I had like this screwed into the middle screw hole of the wall outlet preventing this from happening. There needs to be something like that on these. I would have given 5 stars for this item but can't because it comes out of the wall outlet so easily.",

This pulls away from wall, and doesn't stay in the outlet. I wanted to return it since it does not function as described. Disclosing that the weight will pull it away from the wall is critical to anyone purchasing a device that is suppose to assist in excess plugs. The company wanted me to pay for the shipping... Not cool!!! Don't buy this product. Stay away from Globe Electric products.",

I use it in the bathroom because I need to plug in a hair dryer, curling iron and straightener all with the huge bulky plugs. The fact that I can tilt these helps the three fit without getting in each other's way.",

So if you actually used all six outlets it would put quite a load on the one active that it is plugged into. I have inexpensive 'surge protectors' that do a similar thing. Long story short, I feel comfortable putting lamp, radio, a couple charging devices and that's about it. I hope this makes sense.",
