It's been a while since we bought the set, but the kids continue to pull it out every time a new audience comes to the house. Definitely a great find. Their favorite trick is probably the ball in the cup, but they also enjoy the disappearing crayons.",

Some tricks were too difficult but there were enough that after watching the video and a little help from adults that he learned to do. He could do them well enough that he could perform a magic show for his preschool class. I made a little black cape for him and purchased a magician hat from Amazon. Class loved it and he has gotten his use out of it. Well worth the money.",

Would have been nice if the set came in a plastic suitcase of sorts because there are many pieces that can easily get lost. Children do not do well when pieces are kept in a box as opposed to a snap-shut container. An adult needs to commit to helping child learn each trick which are easy to master but guidance is very important.",
