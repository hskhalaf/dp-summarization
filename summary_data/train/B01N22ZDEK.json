      "text": "Just purchased last week - really happy so far! My husband is used to gas-powered mowers and said he was impressed with how light and easy to push it was. Cut the grass and weeds great. Our yard is fairly large and took a over an hour to mow everything, so we might end up ordering an extra battery. We had a lot of weeds so the battery only lasted about 50 minutes. It was really easy to assemble and get started. I was surprised how quiet it is. I can\u2019t even hear the mower from inside our house.",
