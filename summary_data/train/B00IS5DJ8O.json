When using this form nearer to the water where the sand is supper soaked with water, it's amazing. It just doesn't work that well with only slightly wet sand. The portable snap together design makes it easy to bring with you. The kids were entertained with the forms all day long. Kids loved it (6 & 3). We also had several people stop and look at our \"sand city\" while walking by.",

I got this for my 3 year old to use at the beach and he loves making the towers with it and it truly is very easy to use. Pack moist sand into the largest ring, add the medium ring on top and pack it with sand then finally add the small ring and repeat. You pick up the bottom large ring and it will grab the smaller 2 as you pick them up. Genius. All that being said, this should only cost $10 in my opinion.",

It will outlast the buckets which crack, but the plastic pails are cheaper, more readily available and much brighter colors. The youngest kids love to fill them and leave the sand in them (no building yet) so I would need 3 or 4 sets for their \"fences\" and \"walls\". Back to the buckets for me and my grandkids.....",
