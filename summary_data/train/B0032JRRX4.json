      "text": "Bought as a replacement for an older version that had some issues. The fact that it runs on Li-Ion batteries is great...better than carrying XX number of rechargeable AA batteries with you everywhere you go. The quality of the pictures is sufficient, but sometimes if the camera's not steady, it could produce a rather blurry picture. However, the majority of my pictures have been clear. I have not sufficiently tested the video feature, but the videos that I did capture were of good quality. A very good choice of camera if you are a fan of Canon cameras. Enjoy!!!",

It is tough, easy to use, compact, takes great photos and the battery life is quite good. She is very happy with it. For point& shoot there are several excellent makes of camera, but Canon seems to me to be the best buy. The only problem is obsolescence, all digital cameras become obsolete in a short time and it is impossible to get them repaired. Fortunatley this little Canon is a survivor and still works perfectly. Definitely recommended.",

No need to download software, although it is included just in case one needs it. Comes with cables and rechargeable battery. Battery needs to charged for first time before using. Only a photo flash card is missing but most of us have one or two around the house. Yes, there is a lag time between one photo and taking the next picture. There are sophisticated ways for Canon to get around this lag but that raises the price significantly.",

It takes well-focused, crystal clear pictures, even in basic point-and-shoot mode. The image stabilization is immensely better than on my Panasonic Lumix TZ5, and its ergonomics and image quality are clearly superior to her mother's recently-purchased Nikon point-and-shoot camera in the same price range. Another thing... the video mode is extremely simple to use and works great. Think I'll sell the Lumix and get one of these for myself!",

      "text": "I haven't used the camera that much but I have found it quite confusing to figure out settings etc. I don't feel you can call this a point and shoot camera. The pictures I have taken appear to have come out decent but for the price you can't complain. It seems to take good pictures, its slow as far as the shutter speed, a little tricky to focus, but again its a Canon and its a good value",

The ease and performance are awesome. Cannon has done it again. No complaints.",

Only good thing about this camera is its handy and light. But i would avoid buying this camera if your looking for good quality pictures.",

    "title": "Canon PowerShot A3100IS 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Red)",
    "description": "Color:RedFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n There's nothing more satisfying than taking great pictures! And with the Canon PowerShot A3100 IS, it's so effortless. The 12.1-megapixel resolution and 4x optical zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer ensure radiant, detailed images. Plus, you've got an advanced DIGIC III Image Processor with evolved Face Detection Technology and the Face Detection Self-timer for extraordinary control and performance. New scene modes give your images a professional feel. There's the Face Detection Self-timer for extraordinary control and performance and Smart AUTO lets you handle challenging conditions with ease. Plus this trim, fashionable camera is yours in three stunning colors. \n\n\n\n12.1-megapixel resolution Canon PowerShot A3100 IS Highlights\n\n\nPowerful A-Series camera with 12.1 megapixels, 4x optical zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer and DIGIC III Image Processor\nWith the PowerShot A3100 IS, dramatic, personal pictures have never been easier to shoot and share. This 12.1-megapixel camera lets you create impressive large photos of family and friends you'll be proud to display. The high-resolution 4000 x 3000-pixel images taken by the PowerShot A3100 IS can be enlarged up to 13 x 19 inches. \n\nThe PowerShot A3100 IS has a 4x optical zoom lens that makes it easy to get the inspiring, emotive close-ups that will make your images lasting keepsakes. This magnificent lens gives you the power to shoot subjects with razor-sharp precision and stunning lifelike color. So you can brilliantly capture a shot of a sweeping landscape, or a child's big smile. \n\nThe PowerShot A3100 IS is equipped with Canon's acclaimed Optical Image Stabilizer Technology that automatically detects and corrects camera shake--one of the leading causes of fuzzy or blurred shots. Even when zoomed in, you can get the steady, crisp, brilliant images you'll be proud to shoot and share. And Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer Technology is so convenient to use. It functions perfectly with or without a flash. \n\nLithium-ion battery\nThe Canon PowerShot A3100 IS uses a newly developed rechargeable lithium-ion battery. This compact, powerful battery helps make it an incredibly lightweight and slim camera. Charge-up is quick and easy, so the PowerShot A3100 IS will be ready and waiting for those special moments. \n\nNew Scene Modes deliver more creative freedom\nThe Canon PowerShot A3100 IS gives you even more creative freedom by including new modes made to get the kind of images people talk about. Super Vivid captures the colors you see with your mind's eye, saturating the scene with intense colors. Turn drab scenes into exciting compositions, when dull pinks blaze into brilliant fuchsia and off-yellows suddenly burn bright and hot. Even dark colors become richer with Super Vivid. Sunsets and floral scenes turn into bursts of color, and get your photo noticed. \n\nPoster Effect combines several similar shades into one color, turning subtle gradations of color into eye-catching, scene-popping contrasts across your image for a unique artistic look. \n\n18 Shooting Modes \nAdvanced presets for the best possible photos under certain conditions. With 18 Shooting Modes including Scene Modes, you're ready for whatever shot comes your way. \n\nSmart AUTO will do the work for you by intelligently selecting the proper settings\nJust set the Canon PowerShot A3100 IS to Smart AUTO and you're ready for maximum enjoyment from your picture taking every time. It's a relaxing and satisfying way to shoot because you can completely concentrate on your subject knowing that the camera has the technical details covered. Advanced Canon technology intelligently analyzes your situation and shooting conditions. Then it automatically selects an appropriate setting from 18 specially defined settings. So whether you're photographing flowers, a captivating sunset, or your friends at the park, you can be confident that you're getting dramatic, memorable images. Low Light mode in action \n\nLow Light mode for improved shooting in dim lighting\nWith an ISO of 400-3200, the Low Light mode takes the Canon PowerShot A3100 IS where no A-Series has gone before--into the shadows! Now even scenes notorious for having insufficient light, such as those lit by candles, fire, or street lamp, come through in fantastic color and clarity, with less noise. You can keep the feel of the scene intact without adding additional light, so the result will be scenes with the visual accuracy, depth and clarity you expect from a Canon camera. \n\nLarge, bright 2.7-inch LCD\nThe PowerShot A3100 IS's large 2.7-inch LCD screen gives you the big picture, whether you're shooting, reviewing or showing off your images. This high-resolution screen offers a crisp, clear and bright picture. It also features Night Display for easy viewing in low light.",
