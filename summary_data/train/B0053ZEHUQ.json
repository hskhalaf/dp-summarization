After experimentation with using it in bedrooms, if is now ensconced in main room in a corner, intercepting insects. Notes: Mosquitoes are attracted in human breath but more importantly in this case, to light. So if mosquitoes are a nuisance in the bedroom, don't use lights there!! includes TVs and nightlights. If must use, leave room dark until ready for bed, and turn off after use. Put the Dynatrap AWAY from the bedroom, as it will attract any mosquitoes in the home and they will be happy to find lunch before the \"blue light.\"",

I thought I would be limited by the fact it is not battery powered, but have had no issues. The cord is long, the machine is light and easily moved where needed. And you can keep it on 24/7 (which is recommended) and I think that makes a big difference. Worth the price!",

Trap emits light and odorless harmless carbon dioxide to lure insects in, the carbon dioxide is generated when ultraviolet rays from the integrated UV bulb reacts with a titanium dioxide coating inside the trap. Constructed to draw mosquitoes inside, once inside the integrated whisper quiet fan traps the insects and sends them to a removable screened compartment where they die of dehydration. Conveniently weights less than 3lbs and about the size of a large thermos enabling easy portability from room to room with an unobtrusive set up. Covers approximately 1,000 SQFT and plugs into AC with a 7' cord, included. Measures 12-1/2\"H x 6\"D.",
