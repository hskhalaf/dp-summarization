I'm not asking for a refund and I'll probably just put it away somewhere because it's super cheap, but keep in mind they might send the wrong size and need to pay better attention to what they're packing and shipping out compared to what they're advertising.

It makes my phone easier to hold and grip, the S8 is a little narrow for my hands otherwise. It is holding up fine, has no yellowing so far which is common in these clear cases and fits great. I gave it 4 stars because while it does it's basic job, it is not going to protect your phone like an Otter or similar style case.

Sure, it will save your phone from a few scratches, but if you drop it wrong there is a high possibility that your phone will crack like mine did. My phone is still functional, but it is a bummer that the back of my phone is now cracked.",
