The base weighs approximately 5 lbs. I got one for my mom who is a stroke survivor and has limited use of her left hand making it difficult to hold the phone and play her puzzle games. This is ideal for holding her phone for her. The arm swivels and there\u2019s a knob that tightens it so that u get the exact angle you want and it stays there. Highly recommend!",
