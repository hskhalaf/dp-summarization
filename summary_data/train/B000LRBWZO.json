Overall though, it's a great camera that I hope continues to serve me for many more years to come.",

    "title": "Fujifilm Finepix Z5fd 6.3MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Brushed Silver)",
    "description": "Color:SilverFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nFujifilm is pleased to announce the launch of the FinePix Z5fd; the first in its range of 'Z' series cameras to feature hardware-based Face Detection technology. Available in three colors, wine red, chocolate brown, and silver, the FinePix Z5fd becomes the flagship in Fujifilm's ultra-slim, style-compact line-up alongside the FinePix Z3 and Z2. With 3x optical zoom, 6.3-megapixel resolution, ISO 1600, Intelligent Flash, and new blog mode, plus Fujifilm's unique Super CCD HR and RP Processor II, the camera's diminutive size and chic outer shell seem at odds with the amount of technology at its heart.\n\n The FinePix Z5fd is small enough that it will fit easily into a pocket or the most minimalist of clutch bags. It features the traditional 'Z' series sliding lens cover, with a 'Z5' motif that lights up in operation, 2.5-inch scratch resistant LCD screen, and non-extending Fujinon 3x optical zoom lens so that it will emerge unscathed from even the most cluttered of spaces.\n\n Face Detection\nFujifilm was the first manufacturer to develop hardware-based Face Detection technology for its compact digital cameras. The FinePix Z5fd joins the FinePix S6500fd and F31fd in Fujifilm's current 'fd' line-up. Face Detection captures up to ten faces in a frame and optimizes focus and exposure to take the best possible people-picture. Incorporating the technology on its Real Photo Processor II has enabled Fujifilm to develop a range that can detect faces and optimize settings in an industry-leading 0.05 seconds.\n\n When Face Detection is turned on and the camera is pointed at people, target-like squares demonstrate that it has 'locked-on' to faces. The square will then follow those faces around in real-time until they move out of the frame or the picture is taken. In playback mode, pressing the Face Detection button will cause the camera to auto-zoom to each face in turn for easy close-up review.\n\n Face Detection is perfect for those times, such as nights out with friends, when tweaking manual settings to get the same result may not be the user's first priority. It can cope with back-lit scenes, settings where there's a more obvious focus point between people's faces or when the subject is off center.\n\n Real Photo Technology \nFujifilm's Real Photo Technology (RPT) is the combination of lens, CCD and processor that helps the camera produce images of impressive quality, no matter where you take it. Fujifilm's sixth generation Super CCD HR is a unique hexagonal shape, with a larger surface area than traditional sensors, enabling it to capture more light from the Fujinon lens. The Real Photo Processor II enables impressive operation speed and features an enhanced dual-noise reduction system that maximizes the effectiveness of the camera's high ISO capability.\n\n A camera for any occasion\nIn addition to its portability, the FinePix Z5fd features a host of unique Fujifilm technologies that make it the perfect take-anywhere camera. ISO 1600 light-sensitivity at full resolution enables it to take photos in low light without flash and with less noise than competing models might produce at a lower ISO. Flash-free images are much more faithful to the original scene, with skin tones looking more natural and no loss of background detail. In addition, because the sensor's unique shape enables it to capture light more quickly, it is possible to use higher shutter speeds without image blurring.\n\n For better results with flash photography, Fujifilm's Intelligent Flash system analyzes the scene and automatically controls flash power output. The result is balanced exposure where the scene is sufficiently illuminated without washing out the foreground in the picture or losing background detail.\n\n Natural Light and Flash mode goes one step further, taking two photos in quick succession, one with flash and one without. Both images are then displayed on the camera's screen for easy review.\n\n With 14 special scene modes, including Fireworks and Beach and Snow, the FinePix Z5fd offers a one-touch setting for any situation. Continuous shooting keeps the camera shooting for as long as the shutter button is pressed down. Once released, the camera retains either the first or last three images for excellent natural shots.\n\n The FinePix Z5fd records movies at 30 frames per second (fps) with sound.
