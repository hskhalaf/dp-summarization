First, the mask actually works; as it dries you could see pollutants being drawn out. It does minimize pores and it doesn\u2019t dry the face out...so the internal product meets its promises. The external container, a glass jar with spring-type lid, neatly contains a small spatula for application. There are no dried crusties clogging up a plastic container\u2019s cap. In all, this is an excellent product, and if the manufacture doesn\u2019t change anything, I\u2019ll be a customer for life.",

I loved how it didn't make my skin feel tight and dry after. Did not leave my daughter's sensetive skin irritated. Skin felt and looked very clean and moisturized!

I used it every other day for a week or two and experienced a skin purging. Now I\u2019m almost completely clear. I even had 3 painful cysts start forming, so I put the mud mask on them as an overnight spot treatment. In the morning, 2 were gone and the other significantly smaller.
