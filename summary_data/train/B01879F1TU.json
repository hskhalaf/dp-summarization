I've had it for less than a month and on average has fallen about once a week - one time was almost on my dog. 2 of the times it's fallen, it hasn't been touched since it was hung back up. The tape appears sticky enough just to hang again, but fails after about a week. Would suggest to add to the mounting method, as what's provided is absolute garbage.",

      "text": "I was so happy to find this product. I love the cork board/white board combo. Arrived without issue and stays up fine with the sticky tape that was provided. It\u2019s on a painted, slightly textured wall. Even tried to pull it off and it\u2019s stuck on tight. Perfect size for our needs too! Update: After several months the tape no longer sticks and it falls down. I can put it back up but it will fall again after a few minutes. Going to look into another way to mount it because I still really like this!",
