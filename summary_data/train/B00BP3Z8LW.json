All my peelings would get stuck back there and then wrap around the front of the blade. I would have to stop and clean it out all the time. Why put up with crappy equipment? This peeler makes really thin peels and never plugs up. It will peel as well on the pull-stroke as the push-stroke and will really fling the peel on the push-stroke. This peeler has a sharp blade. Couln't find any better.",

I avoided trying the other Linden Sweden peeler here on Amazon after seeing some negative feedback and decided to try this one only after seeing a review that said it was a better version. I am glad I did because everything else I have tried has been sub par. It peels with zero effort while making super thin strips and circles nicely for coring eyes. The fact that it performed so wonderfully on a carrot means that it will breeze through a potato with no problem. I will update this review later once I have used it for several preps.

The two are both good, but I would definitely recommend buying ONLY the Grip version. You will absolutely love it. I'm not sure how long the blades remain sharp. I guess that depends on your use, but I'm guess they're good for a few years at least. The price is reasonable, so you can always replace them if needed.",
