They welcomed its appealing silhouette, its multiple width options, its flexible underfoot platform, and the comfortable midsole. It\u2019s perceived as an agreeable neutral shoe for the roads. Contrariwise, the durability of the upper was considered questionable, and the color schemes were deliberated as misleading.",

        "Most of the people who have tried the Under Armour Micro G Pursuit were happy with its design and color schemes",
