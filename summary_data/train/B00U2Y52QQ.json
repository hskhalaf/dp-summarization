The purple pigmentation touches my leg and then it itches after it dries up. Please test it on your neck or your wrist before use it in shower. 3. If you have multiple colors on your hair, this shampoo will separate those colors so your pretty graduation/layers will be gone, and it is so awkward...",

      "text": "I love that it takes away my brassy blonde tones, and it does have a nice scent, feels very soft when using and my hair is fine after using it. My issue is perhaps an allergy to the dyes. I find my scalp is very irritated for days after using it and I have to give it a rest for at least a week. I would not recommend using this shampoo more than once or twice a week.",
