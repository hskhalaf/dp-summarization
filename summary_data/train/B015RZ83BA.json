      "HIGH CONCENTRATION EPA: Nordic Naturals EPA Xtra offers an exceptionally high concentration of EPA, and also contains DHA for balance. EPA supports a healthy heart and circulatory system, helps maintain joint mobility, and encourages proper immune function.",
      "BETTER TOGETHER: Omega-3s EPA and DHA occur naturally together in fish oil and work together in the body. Research shows that each fatty acid has unique benefits.",
      "WILD CAUGHT and SUSTAINABLY SOURCED: Every batch of Nordic Naturals fish oil is crafted from wild-caught, omega-rich fish from the freshest catch, sourced from the cleanest waters, and only in a way that fully protects the ocean's fragile ecosystem.",
      "BEST ABSORPTION FOR BEST RESULTS: Many concentrated fish oils on the market are in the ethyl ester molecular form, a synthetic fat with only about 30 years of history in the human diet. Nordic Naturals formulas are produced in true triglyceride form to ensure optimal absorption and results.",
      "THE ALPHA OF OMEGAS: At Nordic Naturals we believe that omega oils are essential to life. By correcting the global omega-3 deficiency, we give each generation what they need to grow healthy and strong. Through science and innovation, we are committed to delivering safe, effective omega oils."
