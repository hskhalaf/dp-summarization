The buns didn't fit in the bun toasting part (small, regular, grocery store buns) and were burned all over the inside of the toasting mechanism. Because the bun was burned all over the inside, it needed to be cleaned. We cleaned off what we could and then wrapped it back up in the box to leave on the shelf. We will never use it again and just show it off to people who ask about it sometimes.",

You may have to toast the buns more than once if you are like my husband who used sour dough and pretzel rolls. Common sense, but I will say it anyways, don't use frozen hot dogs.
