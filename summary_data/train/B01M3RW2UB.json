You do need to push the button to close it as well as open it but that is the only real functional detraction. Visually it is just stunning. The deep blue numerals and hands make this piece appear much more substantial than I was expecting and it is a hefty little piece making it look and feel like a much more expensive item. Having just received it, I cannot speak to durability of the mechanism or the finish but for the price, I am very pleased!",

I decided to buy this watch as sort of a temporary thing, and also because I love the steampunk design, until I could get the other watch (which had lasted me 8 years without servicing before it stopped winding, and that was with long stretches of time where it was continuously running). However, I still love the style of this watch. Also, it is an $18 pocket watch, which is very inexpensive for mechanical pocket watches, so I cannot say I was that shocked.",

He has never remotely experienced a timepiece that was entirely mechanical driven, no need to recharge. The glass front and pack allows him to see the flywheel spinning and all the cogs and gears. Only drawback is the face and numbers are colored the same, as well as the hands, so can be hard to read in anything but optimal light. Regardless, the cobalt blue is his favorite color and he loves it.",

I would recommend this pocket watch for anyone in the market for one, especially one that winds up. It's a great looking pocket watch, and can see thru the back side also. I also wantedd a watch i could use in case the SHTF one day, and I won't need to forage for batteries to keep my timepeice running...",

Two: This is a bit of an issue though, the chosen shade of blue for the numerals is very dark especially contrasted with the black background, it makes it really hard to see what time it is, even in good lighting.",
