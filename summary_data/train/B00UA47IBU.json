      "text": "Ledger wallets are absolutely the best thing you can do to secure your bitcoins. They also provide good tools for developing your own applications that utilize the nano. However, with the nano/hw1 you are limited to the functions within the firmware, meaning just basic bitcoin/eth wallet functions and a few others. The api is available on github if you look up btchip api specification. If you want real development freedom, I recommend getting the Nano S, as it has a fully functioning SDK to write any programs you want that utilize the secure element.",

      "text": "Super easy to use. I own 2 nano duo sets as well as 2 Nano S Ledger wallets. This version is by far better and you get two so you can create a back up if you lose one. Take my word on this, the little digital readout on the Nano S looks neat but is not worth the extra money at all. This Nano works every time and is super user friendly. It is also much smaller than the Nano S which I like a lot. 5 stars all around on this yiu don't need anything else to protect coins.",
