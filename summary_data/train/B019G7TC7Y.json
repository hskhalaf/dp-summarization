But unfortunately, especially for the price, the cream doesn't actually intensely moisturize at all...at least not my dry skin. It's so weird, because it feels great going on and doesn't feel drying. But by the end of the day my skin is flaking like crazy, and that doesn't happen with less expensive creams like my Hada Labo and Embryolisse Lait-Creme Concentre 24-Hour Miracle Creams. At $36.00 I expect much better performance from a supposed intensive moisturizing cream.",

I don't use any other special cleansers or toners (just a gentle soap in the shower). I am in my late 40s, usually wear no makeup at all, and have a healthy lifestyle. However, sometimes I am still prone to occasional pimples. This cream keeps my complexion smooth and clear. I think it's the squalane, which has antioxidant and antibacterial properties. A jar usually lasts me 6-8 weeks, depending on the season. It also has no fragrance. Great stuff!",
