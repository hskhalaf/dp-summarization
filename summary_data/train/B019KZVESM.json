I'm not sure if the negative reviews here are referring to the same model, but it's sleek and well built and surprisingly fast for such modest hardware. I use it for programming, and although it clearly doesn't compare to my i7 PC, it's absolutely fine for compiling code, running VM's etc. Would definitely recommend. Great battery life too. There is one con - the audio quality. Very tinny and quiet, however this rarely effects me as I don't use it for it's audio capabilities.",

The system was restored once with files, and the second time to factory settings, yet the problem persisted. I had been very careful with the laptop, and am therefore very frustrated. I am currently waiting to see if ASUS will repair or replace it. In hindsight, I should have spent more, and bought a MacBook...",
