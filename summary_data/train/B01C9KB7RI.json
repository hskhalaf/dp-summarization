      "text": "(update, only after about a month and a half the little rubber rings for the laces around the ankle busted they're thin and get brittle) order a size above what you wear. They do take a long time to put on and off but that is the only downfall. I know they make boxing shoes that have a side zipper but they are just a little bit more expensive so if you're looking to save a couple bucks and get a great pair of boxing shoes these are it",

My calves are a little big so it also helps being able to loosen the laces a bit for fit. I plan on buying them again in a different color. The burgundy is awesome, though.",

I am going to take the laces completely out and thread them a different way and see if they are any better and if not I may have to send these back. I like them but they need to be made bigger around the calf area. Hopefully, I don't have to send them back because I do like them but for $120 dollars I have to be able to wear them.",

The laces are real all the way down...this is awesome because you can make them as tight or loose as you want, but a little annoying because teh tongue of the boot is the entire length of the boot and sometimes shifts or wrinkles and can become irritating. They are fashionable though. So, you do not expect them to be super comfortable hiking boots. They are super cute.",
