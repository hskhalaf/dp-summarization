      "text": "I bought this for my boyfriend's dog because she is always going fishing with us and he'd been putting her in a human life jacket on the boat haha. It arrived way sooner then they said it would and he just loves it!!! They put a lot of thought into the design of this product. It fits Ellie great and leaves her with lots of freedom to move around the way she wants too, and she is one hyper active doggie hehe. The price for the product and product shipping were great!!! I would recommend anybody looking for a dog life jacket buy this one!!!",
