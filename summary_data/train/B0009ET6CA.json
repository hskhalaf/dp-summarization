It's a lightweight consistency, that absorbs well into the skin with no greasiness. I use it twice daily after PM cleansing before bed, and a drop of it under my foundation in the AM. The only drawback is that the scent - which is pleasant - is pretty strong. When I first bought this, I thought that it would irritate my skin because of the strong scent, but it doesn't at all.",

I have been through many bottles of this specific product that I have purchased at a local grocer and never had an issue, so I know it's not an issue with the genuine product. However, this one from Althea Beauty had a much thicker consistency than the ones I had previously. It also caused me to break out which I never had issues with before. Something seems fishy about this, but it shouldn't come as a shock since it was significantly cheaper than the retail price.",

A little goes a long way. I like how this formula leaves my skin hydrated without feeling greasy. I do use it as a base layer, though, and layer additional moisturizers on top to help repair my skin.",

I've used one other brand that didn't match up, and this moisturizer is the best bang for your buck. My skin stays hydrated all day, considering I have dry skin. I'm definitely transitioning to this product for the long haul. My only complaint is the scent. It doesn't bother me, but I think the company can do with out. Overall-- great product.",
