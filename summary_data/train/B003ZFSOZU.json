Black and white pix, parts are labeled by letter in the parts diagram, but not in each step pic. Hard to follow. Plastic parts do not fit together well. Holes don\u2019t line up with each other. My husband had to use a pipe clamp to get top and bottom to fit together well enough to put screws in. Its very cute and I am sure my grandkids will love it, but I don\u2019t think I will buy any more Step2 toys that require assembly.",

Took a bit of putting together but not too hard. I threw away the instructions on how to make the things out of the 'wood' pieces and can't find replacement instructions for those anywhere!

Some of the tools are a little cheaply made, however, and have broken. I really thought the little foam \"wood\" pieces that you can put together were clever! My oldest boy put all the projects together the first day we had it, and then lost interest. It would be a little better if they had more options and pieces to build other things.

Alex is very particular about putting things where they belong, so he was quite frustrated when the hammer, screwdriver etc. kept falling when he tried to hang them.
