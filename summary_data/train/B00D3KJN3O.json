I used a heavy extension card from my house and the voltage is 127 volts and the late evening is cool. Perfect for working the garden. The tiller was much better than a hoe, when the tiller was operating. I am anxious to see if the vendor will replace the electric motor.",

Due to its light weight, the machine bounced around a bit but I'd expected that so no big deal. After a couple of passes, it was for the most part, smooth running. Knocked the weeds down pretty well, I figure I'll till at least weekly until fall. So far, I'm quite happy. Greenworks devices ROCK!",

I found it best to remove the wheels while tilling up to 6 inches deep in hardpack clay soil. When hitting rocks and roots it will jump up but it is not difficult to keep in control.

      "text": "This tiller worked better than I imagined! I have about 180 sq ft of raised bed garden to which I added about 1 1/2 cu yards of compost and 24 bags of garden soil, manure and humus. I dreaded the thought of hours of turning with a pitch fork. So the day this tiller arrived, I put it together in about 20 minutes and had the entire garden tilled in under an hour. Great product!",
