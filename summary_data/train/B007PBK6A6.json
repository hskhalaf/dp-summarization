Wrapped a tanning bed, armoire, washer dryer and dresser with these. Didnt so much for dust and dirt but no scarring or scratches on furniture. Kinda drug these across the back of the moving truck with the tanning bed on them and they held sturdy. Washed well , no shrinking or excessive shedding. Recommended to all my family for their moves or just when storing things.",
