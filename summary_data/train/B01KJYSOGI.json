The only thing that needs more work is the Hue App. It currently allows user to set two scenes only : 1 for daytime and 1 for nighttime. I would love to see philips open it up more to allow users create more time setting profiles in corporation with the sensor. HomeKit integration should be added too! 4-Star now but if the above two pointers are implemented, then 5-Star!!",

      "text": "This can be used as a trigger/sensor for Alexa routines. I like that has a 2032 (US quarter coin size) battery so the installation choice is simplified without needing power wiring. To do the Alexa sensing, you will need to have the Philips Hue Hub already. Since I already use Hue smart lights, I have the hub. Otherwise, it is just a dumb sensor to trigger the lights. With the interfacing to Alexa, the routines are more flexible and voice activated. No problems with range and sensitivity. I don't know how long the batteries last. When I get near, the hue lights turn on. I think the price is high. There may be cheaper solutions with google, samsung, ittt, etc.",
