Then came the Deco faults, our Bedroom one would go offline at least a couple of times a week and now it's daily. Then the other one started doing the same. It,s a nightmare to get help from TP Link so much so they have shut their phone lines down as they can't cope. Avoid this mesh wifi as there are clearly issues and as you will see with other reviews the same faults.",

Built-in antivirus, management and parental controls are a bonus - and the optional guest network makes it easy for visitors to connect without compromising network security.",

These are easy to install and come with a number of features for both security and family use.
