I have a set of Klein 11055 strippers I'had for close to a decade that still work fine, but I liked the idea of a similar tool that could also do light needle nose plier duty. Unfortunately, the tool is kind of cheap. Within a few months it had loosened up making the cutters nearly useless, and then the lock that holds them shut broke off. At that point they were more annoying than useful, so I went back to the Kleins. It's a shame. It's a great idea that's completely hamstrung by shoddy workmanship.",

    "title": "Milwaukee 48-22-3079 6-In-One Combination Wire Stripping and Reaming Pliers for Electricians",
    "description": "Size:PACKAs an electrician or general contractor, there are more than enough tools out there that you need in your kit. Simplify the process by purchasing some multi tools that can perform multiple functions. When it comes to wire stripping, the Milwaukee 48-22-3079 is more than enough. Use its onboard template to strip most standard sized bare or stranded wires. When they\u2019re stripped, use the center console to plug those wires in and form perfect loops to attach to grounding screws or other areas. You\u2019re not limited to electrical wire work with this, either. If you need to shorten screws or bolts, you can fit them into the other side of the center console to cut them down to size. You can even use the forged tip of this tool to ream out piping between one half and one inch in width. Alternatively, you can use that same tip to punch out outlet boxes. It\u2019s sturdy enough to handle hundreds on the jobsite, while lightweight enough so you can do it in relative comfort. Why have six separate tools on hand when you can keep one that does the job better? With Milwaukee, you can achieve heightened productivity.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nMilwaukee Electric Tool introduces the new 6 IN 1 Combination Pliers.
