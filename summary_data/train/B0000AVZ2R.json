I would recommend this call to anyone getting started or the seasoned veteran. I do wish it had an instructional video; however, youtube has plenty of \"how to\" videos posted. This will not be the last Lynch Box Call I purchase. I got my call before scheduled, which was during the christmas rush. Very Pleased!!!",
