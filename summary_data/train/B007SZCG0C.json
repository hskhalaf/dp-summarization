Don't waste your money, plenty of other products out there for way less that do the same/better job. I'm done with this product...",

I started shedding a ton of hair in my mid-20's (I'm in my mid 30's now), and this shampoo is the first thing I've found that made a noticeable difference.

After the 1st use of the shampoo, only used on my hairline, I totally saw a difference. I\u2019m not exactly sure how this works but I love it. Now I don\u2019t have to feel insecure about random bald spots in my hair line. Very satisfied and amazed.",

Then, the smell. It smells medicinal, which isn\u2019t entirely bad, but it\u2019s not the delightful experience of other shampoos. I\u2019m used to using sulfate-free shampoos and not getting the sudsy, squeaky clean feeling, but this went even farther. I don\u2019t feel clean. I was tempted to use my other shampoo. My hair feels thicker, but mostly because it\u2019s still goopy from the shampoo. It\u2019s not a winner for me.",

Only one press worth of shampoo will lather perfectly well. I am a guy with short hair. So that\u2019s enough quantity for me. If you have longer hair, you might need a little more.

I color my hair and it has stripped the color in just 10 days. I would not recommend this shampoo if you color. Extremely disappointing for the price. I had better results from Keranique which is much cheaper.",

It lathers well, which is so important for me to feel like it\u2019s cleaning my hair well. As my hair dried naturally I did notice a lift in my natural curls and more volume.

The shampoo has an ingredient that makes your hair dry. Dry hair is fluffier and gives the illusion of fuller and thicker hair. 2) Unnatural hair loss. People who have thinning hair due to sickness or vitamin deficiencies may get a growth boost from the shampoo's ingredients. Of course any number of cheaper shampoos would probably accomplish the same thing.",
