      "text": "I hate those earbuds that wedge into your ears like earplugs. I dislike that sensation entirely, but regular earbuds just don't stay in my ears well, especially when jogging or working out. It's weird how one little soft rubber piece makes a world of difference! The sound from these is just fine. If you are looking for noise-cancelling earphones, I hope you have a rearview mirror on while you run. They work great, with no discernible static or interference and the controls work the same as my regular Samsung earphones. I also splurged a few extra dollars and bought a pack of replacement covers with the same soft rubber additions in case needed. Love these!",

These earphones have a bud just slightly indented, to keep them in place, but they dont't cause discomfort! Even the active attachment is so soft you can't even feel it, and fits right in the outer ear curves! My boyfriend got a pair as soon as I showed him mine, and we are both happy campers. We've been using these daily for 3 months for meetings, and I run with them, also do cycling.",

There are \"OEM\" samsung earphone on amazon and ebay, but I bought SEVEN of them from the same/different sellers. ALL of them either didn't work, or are knock offs. This one although is $15, it works and the sound quality is better, they also have extra earphone covers. Would recommend",

Durability still needs some improvement seems little cheap but i think itd last atleast 1 year.But overall I love the product",

They are extremely comfortable in the ear and I just wish they had lasted a bit longer, but what can you do?",

They're incredibly comfortable and come with a huge variety of different sized earbud covers to fill all ear types. Would definitely purchase again!
