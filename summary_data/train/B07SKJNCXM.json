It sounded like the mids and highs were cranked up way too high. I tried using the app to change EQ settings but nothing helped. Back they go I guess. The Liberty 2's are still my favorite model and what I am sticking with for now.",

My point is that this shouldn't be an issue. Would you wear glasses where you could on see out of one eye at a time? They should get the basics right and then focus on extras",

I tried the first pair i purchased, and at the beginning it seemed to be good but afterwards it was disappointing. I've ordered a replacement. I hope it works out. I'll update accordingly. Update: same issue. not what i expected from Anker. I still like their other products.",

Also, as a jazz lover, finding earbuds that do NOT boost bass is nearly impossible. (I\u2019d like to hear all the instruments on that Coltrane solo, please.) These earbuds deliver a full, rich sound, cancel out surrounding sound very well, and have phenomenal battery life. Totally happy with them.",

None had the pristine accuracy of audio reproduction or the comfortable fit... none. Without naming competitors, just let me say that the Liberty Air 2 earbuds will beat others costing twice or three times as much. Lastly, a word about customer support at Anker... it is outstanding.

You have to pair them to each other (which they do automatically) and then pair *one* to your phone. very nonintuitive.

Some issues I've encountered so far has to deal with touch sensors and connection. They don't always work like you think they should, possibly due to user error.

      "text": "Pros: Small and protable Long range Great sound Good app Cons: Case is flimsy Overall these have been a great set of wireless earbuds. They have exceptional sound and after tuning them with the available app the Sound was even better. The Bluetooth connectivity has been extremely solid with good range from my devices. My only complaint is that the case is a bit flimsy, as the top is easily opened luckily the magnets that hold the buds in place are pretty strong.",

      "text": "they sound great, better than the previous generation. However, in my experience they are a bit flaky pairing with my Google Pixel 2. I get drop outs sometimes, or it is simply very slow to pair and I have to fumble with the controls. With the previous generation of this soundcore headset, the pairing was so fast that when I took it out of the case and lifted it to my ear, pairing would be complete by the time I had it inserted. So at that level I consider these a step backwards. What good are Bluetooth headsets that you can't pair with, no matter how good they sound?",

Sound quality is superb, and though noise cancellation is passive by sealing your ear canal, it makes for an incredibly private listening experience. Syncing them to my Note 9 was a snap and the SoundID app provides some very interesting and effective adjustments. Wired and Qi charging worked well, and battery life is great. The quick-charge feature is a big deal for me, giving my flat-dead earbuds an extra 2-3 hours of listening in just a few minutes of charging. As an avid Android user, having inexpensive non-Apple buds that can hang side-by-side with AirPod Pros has been a real treat!",
