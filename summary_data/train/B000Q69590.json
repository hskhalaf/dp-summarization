Today though, it seems you can only find thin, disposable, easily punctured, junk. I want you all to know this is not the case with this pan. This pan is very durable. See the picture below of me standing on the thing. I will also tell you that I weigh 240 lbs.... Tool trucks only seem to sell Lisle and Blitz pans, which are thinner and less durable. Buy this pan with confidence because it will last you a very long time if you take care of it properly",

I've never had a drain pan that I didn't need to pick up and pour out, and this one has no provision for that step. And speaking of that spout... a tethered cap is one of those things that looks great on paper. In the real world, it has to either be removed or held aside or it flops in front of whatever you're pouring out, and makes a splattered mess. Just one more thing that makes pouring unnecessarily awkward.",
