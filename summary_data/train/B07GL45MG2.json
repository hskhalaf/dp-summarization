The material is durable, not flimsy, and indicates that it is made from great quality. It is not bulky which makes it easy to carry around. The equipment comes in a protective zipped case. They provide disposable blades for the scalpel too, which was an added bonus! Definitely would buy again in the future. The company responds to questions and concerns very quickly and helped me with an issue immediately. I\u2019d give this 10 stars if I could :)",

      "text": "This suture kit is great, it comes with tools that work really well, and a decent amount of sutures to work with. It also comes with some blades and a blade holder, not sure what they are for but it is pretty cool. I used up all the spaces pretty quickly. I will say that the texture of the \"skin\" obviously is very unlike what normal skin feels like, which is fine, but it also is like a bit gummy, so the sutures can easily come out, and once you make the holes and take the sutures out, you cant really re-do it. But otherwise this kit is great.",
