I am starting with a 25watt to see how long it will take to recharge. I have been using a UPS at home for backup in case the power goes out but this is a MUCH better option.",

The AC output on the unit was not working, but the seller (Telesport) was quick to replace the unit for me with no hassle.

I did really well for the bottom dollar pricing I paid for it. Also, change the battery performance type to li-pro etc. Some of the new models have gone threw upgrades.

Even with my CPAP heating set to off and not using the water reservoir, it only lasted 2 nights. The unit is easy to use and good for home emergencies. I'm buying a second one so I can take both on my longer camping trips.",
