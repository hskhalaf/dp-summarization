It was never a deep satisfying uninterrupted sleep. On this mattress, after only a single night. The complete lack of any soreness, pain or pressure. I had my first enjoyable uninterrupted painfree night for a long time. The benefits are obvious but the motivation of the energy and freedom from worry. Unparralled speed of recovery which continues all day. The foam supports all over the spinal cord and you sink into the total foamy support structure. Which helps the painful spots.",

When my son needed a guest bed for his loft we decided to search for something comfortable, yet budget friendly. Needless to say, he has been sleeping on it since:) This bed has been comfortable since the moment we received it (after the 48-72 hour waiting period). The memory foam is firm/sturdy, yet plush, and appears to retain it's shape nicely. It is thick and also comes with a removable cover - which can almost replace a standard mattress pad. My teenager spends a lot of time in bed and has slept soundly ever since - highly recommend!",

So be very careful when you open it. Otherwise, this mattress is so comfy. I got this to replace my son's bed that was basically falling apart, but now, its the hit of the house. Eveyone wants to nap/sleep in my son's bed because its so comfortable. Good buy!",
