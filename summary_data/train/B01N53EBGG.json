However, I'm 36 and I started having a period every two weeks, which is not cool. I did some research and it's likely the Dong Quai. It affects your hormones, mainly estrogen, so if you have breast cancer or are at high risk for breast cancer or if you have any other other condition, like endometriosis, that can be adversely affected by an increase in estrogen, stay away. I stopped taking it about a week ago and I can already tell my cycle is normalizing and my moodiness is back, Ugh!",
