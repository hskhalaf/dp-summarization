It is smaller than your ordinary keyboard, but large enough not to press two keys at a time. The trackpad (or \"mouse\") is as good as any PC laptop on the market. I use it to control my Raspberry Pi 3 (Model B) and it works perfectly by just pluggin in the USB receiver, no need to download additional software or drivers. The only CON on this keyboard is that I couldn't find where to store the USB receiver on the keyboard (the hole near the batteries that Logitech puts on its mouses).",

The whole thing feels very cheaply made so I'm really not surprised, but frustrated none the less. I'm extra salty because it decided to die a few weeks after my return date.

If I was going to be farther than 20 feet, I'd want a usb extender cable, to bring the wireless receiver closer. It's fine, but sometimes (rarely) I will get minor lag at that range.

It slides off your lap so easy. I've dropped it so many times. It's light but it also feels cheap to me. It just feels like a hollow plastic shell, which is what it is but I feel like it would be better if it were a little heavier and the materials were stronger and didn't feel so plastic-y.",

So.. as you scroll down a web page all of a sudden you zoom in instead of scrolling. It makes the touch pad unusable for someone who does a lot of scrolling. There is not option to tell the keyboard not to send zoom/pinch events. In my opinion, that makes the product defective and not worth trying to use.",

Even connected it to other PC's I have and I experienced the same random lag.

He said it has drastically improved his quality of life so i'm taking that as a thumbs up for compatibility. he did not say anything about if the mouse part works, so i can't confirm that.",

On our lazy days we'd rock-paper-scissors to see who would get up and type whatever we wanted to watch next. I bought this for his birthday and he loves it! I love it! Now we can stay lazy and no one has to get up to type stuff! It's wonderful. Also, when switches from his TV to his computer monitor he doesn't have to worry about untangling the wired keyboard to move it in front of his monitor.",

Obviously its small layout makes it difficult for any extended use, but my only actual complaint is that there's no way to turn on Fn lock.

      "text": "As any Logitech build quality is on par with their other products. I've had no issues with connectivity or keys not functioning that I've experienced with other wireless products. I currently use this about 10 feet from the computer it's plugged into. My only real complaint is it is a bit smaller than I expected and a bit hard to type on until you get used to it. But for a quick keyboard to access a HTPC it has worked out well. Would only recommend for applications of occasional or very light use or maybe even travel. But would not recommend for everyday use and I don't think that is even the intention of the keyboard.",
