After several attempts to make this work (and I really wanted it to work), I decided to get a mulching mower blade and use the lawn mower to grind and blow the leaves to one edge of the yard.

Make no mistake, you will have to put in some sweat to use this and the amount of effort does rival raking. It will save your arms, however, and I find pushing a little easier.

We called support 3 times one said the wheelers needed to be changed: this did not work finally we were told that unfortunately that it was put together At the company backwards- this was s huge ordeal but we did get it turned around hope it will work like it is sussose to . So not even sure it will work great\u2019 They should have sent us antiher one that was factory correct\u2019 to save us much time and frustration to use it and see it does only ok. Dissappointed",

It's much less effort to just rake than use this. I wish I'd gone another route and maybe paid extra for a pull-behind model.

Raking is still needed but the sweeper makes it much easier because it collects large amounts of leaves quickly. The bag is small and needs dumping constantly when there is a ton of leaves. I am pleased with it.",

The kids actually thought it was fun to push around. Of course we were also using it to make them a leaf pile for jumping. Didn't take long to put together with basic tools.Haven't tried with wet leaves but I wouldn't have great expectations.",

When tipping backwards to empty the bin, some leaves always get stuck in the rake portion, so it doesn't empty completely. Get the green plastic \"mitts\" that they up-sell with this sweeper. They work very well, in general, and are the perfect size to empty the bin on the last stretch. Next is to see if this will pick up all the maple seeds next spring.... I'll keep you posted.",
