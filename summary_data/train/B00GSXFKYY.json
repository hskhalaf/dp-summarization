Until I received my measuring cups. I was impressed with the weight before I even opened the box. Cheaper low quality M-cups are made from thinner metal & softer metals and/or the handles are tack welded and eventually break. These are made from stainless steel, the handles are the cup come from one mold, and they even stack beautifully because of the small nipple in the front. I've used them and ran them through the wash. I'm very impressed and highly recommend these M-Cups.",

The handles have a very good feel - the little thumb depression on the top with the corresponding bump underneath gives you a good sturdy grip. And since the cups and handles are all one piece, no rivets to worry about (to come loose or collect icky stuff). The top edges of the cups are just slightly curved out, making it easy to level your measurements. And those edges are smooth, no burrs, no little questionable places. These are the best measuring cups I have ever owned.",

I paid $20 for a 4 piece metal set at a local store. I really wanted a 3/4 cup, but couldn't find any that weren't made of plastic. I saw these and thought I'd give them a try.
