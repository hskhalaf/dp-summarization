Also I'm not one of those perfect-digital sound gurus, I just want some tunes playing. This thing was perfect, and cheap! No, it's not going to light up a concert hall or your entire 6,000 sq. ft. house but if you're looking for something to carry around and produce some sound in a room or at the beach or whatever, this is defniitely worth your cash.",

So the reality is that they are just a pair of battery operated speakers if you are looking to do stereo. Otherwise if mono is cool with you then you should like these due to the loudness v size as well as their rather remarkable battery life.",
