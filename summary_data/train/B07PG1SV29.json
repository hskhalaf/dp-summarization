So I got ready to install it and then had to go to Lowes and get the metal plate that goes under it. I think most people need the little plate thing and so it should either come with it or include some sort of alert that you need to get one. Otherwise, it looks fine and works fine so far, but it has only been installed for three weeks so we will report if we have problems.",

If you're like me\u2014looking for an inexpensive faucet because you know you have to pay for installation\u2014just wait and keep saving your pennies for a faucet of better quality. At least then if you have to pay the plumber too, it won't be wasted money.",

I wanted to return it or send it back for a replacement but I had already had it for the past 30 days. It was a small leak so calcium build up eventually filled the pinhole, however if I ever get a water softener, which I wanted to, the leak is likely to come right back.",
