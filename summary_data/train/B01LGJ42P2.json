      "text": "If you are looking for true wireless earphones then these are not the option to go with. The sound quality is pretty poor, the setup is a pain, they go out of sync with each other very often and to top that all off if you wear them for more than a few minutes your ears will likely start hurting. If you are looking for true wireless earphones definitely avoid these.",

      "text": "Decent sounding headphones for the price! Easy to pair and get going straight away. Decent range and haven't heard any cut offs. I bought some memory foam earbuds to replace the standard silicon ones that come with it for a little more comfortable fit, little better bass and slight better noise cancellation from the outside world. They are a little uncomfortable after a couple of hours in your ear. Battery life seems fairly decent, and I did forget to turn them off too, a lot better than some of the others on the market. Solid purchase, after looking around for 'true wireless' headphones, I'd say these are worth a buy for the time being.",
