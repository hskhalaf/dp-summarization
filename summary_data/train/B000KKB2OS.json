After setting these up, there were a lot fewer complaints from the scouts. Setting them up out in the open might pose a little bit more of a challenge. I would recommend purchasing some para-cord for suspending the net. This keeps the bugs out and you can get a better nights sleep. That is the best benefit and the whole purpose for purchasing.

And i love that it is very elastic that it could stretch beyond the given dimensions that are on the bag.

      "text": "I purchased this net for KEOWA Scout Camp @ TMR, GNYC Summer 2015. . The netting is larger and longer than standard netting and easily fit over a 6 foot cot and covered my son without a single insect/bug getting in!! It provided plenty of room for sleeping. Only suggestion to the manufacturer is to make the connection of the net to the six metal rings (for connecting the netting to the tent frame) a bit more sturdy -- maybe use a thin line of paracord that will work much better.... Over all very satisfied with purchase. AB",

The mosquitoes can just fly underneath the net. It is very thin and flimsy. The ties it comes with are no more then thick pieces of thread/string. It is not a very well made product in my opinion. I am returning it for a refund.",

I've since thrown the net to the side and have not used it.",

      "text": "I bought this net hoping to string it up over my camping hammock. The picture on the packaging is slightly misleading, because the top part of the netting is more of a square shape as opposed to a rectangle. That made it difficult to hang up over a hammock, and I ended up attaching the net to one end and tucking the other end under my feet. Now granted, this isn't advertised as hammock bug net, so I can't give it a completely horrible review. It kept the bugs off, but I'll probably just save this for other uses, rather than a camping trip again.",

Overall the net is easy to set up and quite strong. I plan to use it again!",
