Solid zippers and larger/holds more than it looks like. The stitching is all great and it will hold up to abuse well. I put all my stuff for showering, makeup, shoes, clothes, and there is still extra room. It has enough pockets to separate things but not too many where it\u2019s a chore to keep it organized. Would also be great as a school backpack, or sports bag. (No pockets for specific sports equipment tho - bats or soccer balls, etc.)",
