      "text": "So I bought this a while ago - and have had time to use the product for a while now. I loved it at first, but all the weighted beads have since shifted to two spots on the outside. Because of this, the actual blanket doesn't feel like it has any weight, just the two corners where it now pools. Now, I've tried to lift the blanket and spread it all back out... that lasts for a solid 30 minutes before it's all pooling in the same spots again. Otherwise, the blanket was good, but sadly this was a huge turn-off for me considering the blanket wasn't cheap.",
