      "title": "Decent value for casual garage use",
      "text": "Bought this set as the old connector I used to fill car tires was wearing out. For $12, it's a good set for messing around in the garage and occasional use, but it doesn't seem like a heavy duty set (but what do you expect for $12?). The tire pressure gauge that came in the pack was not the one in the picture when ordered, and it actually read a 2-3 pounds under what my 'good' pressure gauge showed. I was really buying the connectors, and not the gauge, so that didn't bother me, but be aware of it if purchasing.",

Usually you'll see the thread on stuff like this is chewed up, or some of the stuff will look like it missed the de-bur process in the machine shop. All the stuff in this kit looked clean, everything I've used so far threaded fine, haven't had any issues. Definitely recommend picking this up if you need to expand usage of your compressor on the cheap.",
