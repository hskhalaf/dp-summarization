Happy with our purchase, now our RV doesn't rock and roll! Easy to determine the height needed, just measure from the ground up to your king pin. Sturdy legs, easy to adjust coupler to fit needed height, then tighten the chain through the legs when you get your height set and legs set.",

I can say it has helped TREMENDOUSLY!! Winds have to gust over 25 before I even know it\u2019s blowing! And even then the shaking it\u2019s at minium! I feel my toddlers bouncing less as well!
