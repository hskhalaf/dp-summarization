I actually thought I had ordered a california King by accident (I didn\u2019t). So these would be great if you had a very deep comforter. But for my average mattress, the fitted sheet hangs off a couple of inches so not tight and snug. The top sheet so big that i have to tuck it way under the mattress.",
