When they arrived the sole seemed thinner than it had in the past but I didn't think much about it. However, a few weeks ago at approximately the 3 month mark I noticed the rubber at the toe was separating from the leather. So despite the soles being fine I'll need a new pair of sneakers soon. But because of this pair of sneakers lasted so short a time I think I'm going to switch brands.",

      "text": "Nike shoes always seem to run on the narrow side, and I have yet to find any available in a wide width in any style I'd even wear. Overall, they are a decent shoe.
