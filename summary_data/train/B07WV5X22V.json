It did take some time for him to get the hang of using it, though. It takes quite a bit of coordination so I made him learn in a space where I knew he couldn't damage anything. That being said, he is very happy with it.",

Once you get the hang of riding them, they are quite fun and engaging to ride; you cannot just zone out and mindlessly ride. Surprisingly, there is true resistance through the whole pedaling rotation, leading to an even better workout. So it's not like you can mud your way through a push and the top of the rotation. (I did not get the resistance add-on) I HIGHLY recommend this. It's just a fun ass workout. Enjoy the videos!",

It needs very little space, takes no time at all to set up and you don't have to do anything to your bike to use it. It takes a little practice to get going but if you can ride a bike, you can ride rollers! I have mine set up between my bed and the wall so getting started is easier. The Cycleops is the best indoor fitness item I've ever purchased.",
