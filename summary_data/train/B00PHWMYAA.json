This thing is amazing. It's sturdy so she can grab on it to stand up and sit down, it holds all of her toys plus shampoo, body wash and bubbles. Plus it is easy to take out and sit on the floor if the adults don't want it in the shower while they are. I highly recommend.",

It fits plenty of toys, drains really well, and can fit any part of the tub. It IS non-slip, but it's not perfect, so if your baby tries to use it to pull themselves up, they CAN fall - but if you're watching them & you hold it in place it's fine. It's also nice, because it keeps my son from getting too close and hitting his head on the faucet or drain plug. I highly recommend this!",

This also is great because it\u2019s like a barrier between my daughter and her access to the bath water and handle. She can stand at it and grab her toys but it keeps her from touching the handle and eventually being able to turn it up hotter.

I had purchased many previous ones before and the last one was made of chrome and rusted in no time. The one before that was made of white plastic tubing but that rusted eventually too. Recently I bought another one similar to that but the fit was so poor and it was so cheap it arrived bent and deformed. I gave this 4 stars because it is made of plastic and I suspect it will mildew very soon. But maybe it can be cleaned, right? It does give a sturdy grip to all my products my hubby and I use!",

My only negative (but it's not enough to take away a star) is that you can't use the separators on both sides. When you slide the connections together, one side is going to be a tad smaller than the other. The smaller side will hold the blue separators well, but the outer side will be too big to hold the other separator. Frankly I could care less about that second separator because my problem of having a shower caddy that always rust and never fits quite right, has been solved.",

As an added bonus my daughter likes to put her toys in and out while she bathes so it's like a whole other toy for her. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the soap dish is hard to attach but that could just be me.",

He pours the water through it and watches the waterfall effect as it goes through the holes. He literally played with it for 30 minutes, and cried when we made him get out of the tub.

This handy caddy extends across the tub with Xtra Grip handles for added stability. The caddy holds toys at your child's level so they can grab what they want and even help clean up when bath time is over. Adjustable dividers allow you to customize storage for toys and shampoo. And as an added (major!) bonus, place the caddy between your little one and the bathtub spout to help protect against bumps and burns. When bath time is over, just slide the caddy to the back of the tub so it's out of the way for showers. With multiple drain holes, everything will dry quickly, helping prevent mildew. Safety and organization: exactly what you need for smooth sailing during the bathtime routine.",
