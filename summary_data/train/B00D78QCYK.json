I only paid $66 including shipping. My monitor doesn't have blemishes or scratches. In fact,e I could not find any defects.. I love the 22 inch screen with its vivid color and resolution. Thus, save some money and buy a refurbished ViewSonic monitor.",

Connected to my mac via VGA cable and an adapter (not included), the sound is ported over by an included stereo jack. But even with the volume turned up high (on the computer AND the monitor) the sound was barely louder than a set of ear buds, and just as tinny. If you need sound as well as picture from this monitor, look elsewhere.",

      "text": "Even when using an HDMI cable with this monitor there is still some very noticeable fuzziness to everything on the screen. None of the lines seem very crisp nor are the colors very strong even after tampering with the settings for almost an hour. After a week of use there is already a dead pixel in one of the monitors and after speaking with Viewsonic they will not fix it unless 3 pixels are dead. I would not recommend buying this monitor.",
