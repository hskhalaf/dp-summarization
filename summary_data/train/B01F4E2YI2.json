Gee, time to take it apart already to do a repair. After patching up the poorly done tape job connecting the LED to the battery and supergluing some components down, it works fine. No way to see if it's full charge, falls out of the electrical socket too easily. But considering there are tasers out there that near $1000, it's generally excusable.",

The odds of me using this stun gun are so small, and I refuse to use it on myself, that I can't give a complete accurate review on how effective it is. But it is a stun gun and comes with an advertisement of several million volts so after about 10 seconds of deep consideration I rated it 5 stars.",

The fact that you must be extremely close for this device to potentially work, may deter the user from using it since no one wants to be that close to an intruder/harmful person.

      "text": "Perfect self protection and flashlight combination. Clearly, it's a stun gun, but the fact that it's also a flashlight make it great for any Realtor out there showing houses. Hopefully, this will never be needed as a stun gun, but if it is necessary, then you have it. It could buy you enough time to get out of a bad situation.",

    "description": "The VIPERTEK VTS-880 mini stun gun really packs a punch! Just test firing this unit into the air is often enough to stop an attacker. As the bright electric current pulsates between the test prongs and creates an intimidating electrical sound, an attacker with any sense at all will be stopped in his tracks. If the sight and sound doesn't stop him, a jolt from this stun gun certainly will bring an attacker down! When an attacker is touched by the stun gun it will disrupt the message the brain sends to the voluntary muscles. Simply touching an attacker will deliver a high voltage shock causing loss of balance and muscle control, confusion, and disorientation bringing him to his knees and making him incapable of further aggressive activity.
