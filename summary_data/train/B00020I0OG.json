Not sure if it is the capsules that are rancid or the product itself. Before ingesting the capsules, I suggest smelling inside your bottle to make sure they're okay. I am steering clear of Solaray Copper until they get this problem remedied. Thank goodness for Amazon's terrific return/refund policy!",
