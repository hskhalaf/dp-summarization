      "text": "I have used two of these for about 5 years now. They both still work very well. I camp in my van in freezing conditions and putting this under a normal comforter means I don't have to heat the van and I'm still totally comfortable all night. be careful of other blankets that shut off after a short time, you'll wake up freezing! The only downside to not having a timer of course is that if you leave this blanket plugged in it will eventually drain your battery. But I use a separate battery for these blankets to avoid that.",

I bought this for possible power outages as it's a lower energy alternative than running a normal 120-volt a/c blanket through a power inverter. The normal 120-volt electric blanket would have used about 16.7 amps at 12 volts..this 12-volt blanket will use only 4 amps. A portion of that difference is due to the blanket being directly plugged into the power source and not wasting 2.5 amps to run the inverter. I plugged this 12 volt electric blanket in and after 2,3 minutes it was becoming nice and warm. Also, it appears to be very well-made.",
