      "text": "I do high intensity interval training and bought these specifically for hanging moves (monkey bars, pull-ups, etc) so I would rip the palm of my hand. THEY WORK GREAT! I had better grip and no tears and a bonus is they give you more hand strength, so much that I was able to do my first set of unassisted pull-ups. I suggested them to a friend who bought and liked them too. Only downside is they are a little tight on a few fingers, but if I bought a bigger size it would be too loose overall. But not that big of a deal. I'm 6'2\" and have size Large- otherwise they are just what I needed.",

The wrist wrap is great as well, gives great support on those pull ups. Going to purchase one for my girlfriend as well as she\u2019s also just started getting into crossfit. Highly recommend these cross training gloves. 5 Stars for this Awesome workout gear.",

The rubber part of the glove is sticky enough to maintain grip but not so sticky to cause issues. The gloves are easy enough to put on and take off. Having the back and thumbs be free helps in being able to adjust my grip as appropriate and makes the hans overall not as sweaty. Definitely recommend these gloves.",

So far they've held up for pulling exercises on the cable column, dumbbell workouts, and various bar workouts. I honestly didn't expect them to hold up because the grip feels less than my other gloves but they work well. The rower is fine if you stick to general rowing. Once I started doing different strokes the gloves got in my way a little. Other than that, they're great!",

These game highly recommended by one of my favorite Youtubers, and I love them! They\u2019re not constricting at all, and I love how breathable they are. I have an average sized palm for a female, but have narrow fingers. My ring size is 4.5-6, so I was concerned about the fit, but they\u2019re perfect! I bought size small.",

When I used battle ropes, I couldn't even hold onto the rope. Absolutely not worth the purchase.",
