      "text": "Fantastic shoes! Purchased specifically for a trip to Ecuador where it was forecasted to rain every day. I'm happy to report that for both walking around town (including cobblestone streets) and for serious hiking (Cotopaxi and Cajas) these shoes provided much better support than athletic shoes and were waterproof as advertised. At first, if you're not used to real hiking shoes they don't feel ultra-comfortable like sneakers do but the rigid sole keeps your feet from getting exhausted on days where you do a lot of walking over uneven terrain. I typically walk 8,000 steps/day and during this trip I averaged 17,000 steps/day and my feet were fine.",

I wear them as my daily shoe and for walks and short hikes. But they don\u2019t offer the same support and after 6 months and the soles feel mushy. On top of that some of the stitching has given way around the toe box. I\u2019m not overly hard on my shoes and the Ahnus always held up. Sad that Teva still offers some of the Ahnus for women but not men.",
