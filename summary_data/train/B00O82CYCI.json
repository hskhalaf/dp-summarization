They are elegant, very sturdy, and have a small footprint (i.e., they don't disrupt the flow down the hallway because they only come out a few inches.) They even came with hardware to screw them into the wall. I am thrilled with how they look and keep us organized and only wish I had done something like this sooner!",

One of the bins was slightly bent, likely happened enroute, but I was able to fix it by bending it back with my hand. I love this so much, I may just buy more for the kids' rooms and mud room.
