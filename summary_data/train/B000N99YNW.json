Their brilliance in boot-making can also be seen in the hiker\u2019s A-grade waterproofing, super-precise fit, and overflowing amounts of comfort. That said, the gear, with all its trail-worthy characteristics, is not without a few faults. Indeed, some questioned its width, while some lambasted its cumbersome weight. Nevertheless, the Danner Explorer is an excellent choice for those who find its strengths quite empowering in their adventures.",

It seems that either my feet are changing size periodically, or these shoes are. Sometimes, I can barely get my feet into them. And when they are tight like that, they hurt. Finally after about 3-4 weeks, they might be breaking-in. Recently, they've been more comfortable. But I still don't think they're completely broken-in yet. I'm sure once they're completely broken-in, they'll be great. I would suggest getting them in the size that you actually wear. I probably would have avoided a lot of pain if I had gotten these in my actual size.",

The fie of the Danner explorer as mentioned is small and come with no insoles the laces are too long the one sole is offset not straight.
