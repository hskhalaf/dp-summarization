      "text": "I have alopecia (lost all my eyebrows) and decided to get dark brown micro-bladed eyebrows - Turned into a nightmare! I now need to cover up the top half of brows which were tattooed way too high on my forehead, and draw on my former \"real\" eyebrows below. After trying dozens of other so-called tattoo concealer creams and pencils, I had almost given up hope of ever finding a realistic looking concealer or one that would last more than an hour. Then I found \"Make Up For Ever\"! It matches my skin perfectly, provides the best matte coverage, stays on well without becoming patchy and lasts a long time before becoming slightly transparent and needing to be touched up.",
