Motherboard alarms sounds long, repeated \"beep\" during P.O.S.T.. Unplug speaker jack, computer boots normally. Plug in different speakers, computer boots normal. Cheap speakers and I should have known better. Not worth the postage to return them. Save yourself the trouble, time and possible costly repairs. Avoid this model.",

Have bought logitech in the past with no problems, hence why I didn't hesitate to purchase these speakers. Definitely disappointed in this product",

I can't speak to their long-term durability, since I've only had them since early this year, but I've never found a bad Logitech product yet.

They put the power cord (yes these speakers require 120 volts) and the USB cord on different speakers. If they had of put the power cord and USB cord on the same speaker you could be allot more versatile in the speaker. So rather than having to have only one speaker close to the back of the computer you have to have both speakers close to the computer to plug them in...makes no sense to me.",

Like the metal grills vs speakers with cloth grills. The sound is a decent mix of treble and bass ... good for not having any treble or bass adjustment. No static at all on the set I received ... clear sound output.",

      "text": "Very good choice for a reliable speakers, especially it is from Logitech (comparing to those equivalents in this price range). Of course, I can't say it can beat any Bose desktop speakers around $100, but you definitely won't complain to its sound for PC multimedia use everyday. Be careful: The power strip is linked to the left channel speaker, and the 3.5mm audio strip is linked to the right channel speaker. Check your desktop / laptop and wall-mount power supply position. Package: Very simple. No color-print box. But the product is acceptable.",

For me, even at low volume, the quality seems kinda muffled and hard to hear. This can be solved by tinkering around with your volume mixer and such.
