Note: WASH (soapy water) AND DRY THESE THOROUGHLY PRIOR TO USE to remove tarnish. Just to be sure (because the black residue still appeared on the towel even after washing), I would suggest taking time to line the plates with baking sheets/wax paper. I did so by using the plate itself to measure a circle, fold it twice, snip the closed corner, open it up, then make a slit to the center hole. In addition to putting my mind at ease that I wasn\u2019t poisoning my guest, doing this made clean up easier too.",
