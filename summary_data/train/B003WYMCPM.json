I bought it for the absolutely frigid winters in Southern California (I walk to work at about midnight) and the jacket keeps me toasty and visible. Haven't had any rain yet to test that function, but the material shouldn't have any problem handling the about monsoon type downpours we get here every other day. Honestly though, happy with the jacket.",

I've worn it in single-digit temps with a hoodie and have been toasty; I've worn it single layer in 45 degree damp/rainy weather and have been equally happy. Highly reflective for visibility, knit cuffs keep wind out. As other reviewers have said, the only thing lacking is a HOOD. I have requested this feature to the manufacturer.",

Sadly, this coat had the side zippers and everything, which is also hard to fine... but it had to go back. I don't know what idiot designed a rain coat with no hood but they should be smacked.",
