Besides the fact that they're fantastically pink, they work well for me on those nights when I'm having a hard time sleeping due to either city noise/husbands snoring. I also think it's important to note that these didn't cause me ear pain from wearing them, apparently women have smaller ear canals then men, so these are specifically formulated for smaller ears. I know you're not supposed to re-use ear plugs, but I can usually get almost a weeks worth use out of one pair.",
