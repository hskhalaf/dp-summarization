      "text": "I have big feet and wasn't sure about these, but they are comfortable and look cute with casual summer outfits when sandals just aren't practical. I wear them with peds, and the way the sneakers fit, the peds are completely covered. As with most Keds, there is definitely room for improvement when it comes to cushy insoles, so I may add some after market insoles to make these more comfortable to walk in for longer distances.",

Even brides wear them on the dance floor, they just change into a comfortable white sneaker afterwards.",

They are great for her daily workout on a recumbent exercise bike, the shoes help protect her feet from the pedal straps and provide a good grip. They're E-Z on and off, appear to be holding up well and they're Mom Approved.",

Very disappointed, threw out the box & receipt and found out the fit was big when I wore it one day. So I figured they would not take it back. Very disappointed & stuck.",

First time for this style, do think I like the slip ons with the zipper in front better, but these will do just fine. I have a \"no shoes\" rule in the house, so these slip ons make life easier. Keds run true to size, for me, so easy to order.",
