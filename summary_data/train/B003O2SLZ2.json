      "text": "I have been purchasing Keen Presidio shoes for nearly a decade and I have always been able to wear them comfortably right out of the box. This latest purchase was a major disappointment. I couldn't even get the shoe on my foot. I loosened the laces and I still couldn't get it on. The shoe seems more narrow and shorter. I checked the box and my order to make sure I hadn't ordered the wrong size. Nope. It was the exact same shoe I have always ordered in the past. I am not sure why Keen changed this shoe. I have returned the shoes and will now start a search for a new comfortable shoe. Again, what a disappointment.",

      "text": "I bought a few pairs of shoes to try just before a 2-week trip that would require a lot of walking. This (Presidio) is the only pair that accommodated my bunion -- and it also accommodated my custom orthotic insert. (I find it comfortable on the foot that does not have a bunion, as well; it's not too loose.) I find the included insert to have more arch support than most shoes, even without the custom orthotic. I wore these shoes almost daily for two weeks with a variety of terrain -- sidewalk, cobblestones, rocky trails, and dirt roads. Kept up like a champ, and I was comfortable. Would love in another color or two.",

The design is clunky in appearance and heavy weight (more boot-like imo), but if you're looking for a great winter and/or hiking shoe that can withstand the elements (with deep tread soles for traction) you won't be disappointed. Based on reviews, I ordered a 1/2 size up and am glad I did. IF you have wide feet, you'll appreciate the bit of extra length with plenty of room in the toe area. I can wear thick socks comfortably and my custom Orthotic insoles (for those who need/use them) also fit perfectly! Hope this review was helpful.",

Update: I was pretty happy with this pair of shoes for about three days, and then I realized that they were not comfortable for longer stretches at all. They look and feel like my old Presidios, but there is something very strange about the footbed. Ouch!",

    "description": "A waterproof take on the sporty oxford, with a leather-and-mesh mix for breathability and versatility. The cushioned footbed and supportive midsole combine for heel-to-toe comfort. CARE INSTRUCTIONs: if you're wearing your KEENs daily, they won't always be scuff and dirt-free. To treat day to day wear and tear, especially on lighter color leathers, we recommend using a leather cleaner and conditioner, found at most footwear dealers and/or shoe repair shops. Tough stains can be treated with a mixture of water and a little vinegar on a damp cloth\n\n\n\nPresidio Casual Shoe A contemporary women's update of the classic oxford, the Keen Women's Presidio Casual Shoe provides the sporty good looks of a lace-up with comfort and support your feet will appreciate. Ideal for running errands or enjoying weekend adventures, the Presidio features a durable and water-resistant nubuck leather upper in a variety of tones to complement a casual wardrobe. It also boasts a Keen Metatomical footbed for instant comfort as well as patented toe protection and breathable linings.\n\nFeatures * Sporty oxford-style shoe for casual wear\n * Water-resistant nubuck leather upper\n * Lace-up front for a custom fit\n * Removable metatomical dual density EVA footbed for arch support\n * Non-marking rubber outsole\n\nSpecs * Weight: 11.99oz / 340.52g\n * Upper: Water resistant leather\n * Lining: Leather\n\n Sporty oxford-style shoe is great for casual wear.

View larger.\n\nCLASSIC SPORTY STYLE\n The Presidio has a sporty, borrowed-from-the-boys design with feminine touches like tonal stitching accents and a low-profile silhouette. This versatile shoe gives you a break from heels and complements jeans, yoga pants, and khakis. A lace-up front with metal eyelets makes for a custom fit.\n\nWATER-RESISTANT UPPER AND LEATHER LININGS\n This shoe is durable and easy to wear, thanks to a water-resistant nubuck leather upper that goes the distance. And to help keep feet dry and comfortable as you move through your day, the Presidio has breathable leather linings.\n\nKEEN METATOMICAL FOOTBED FOR CONTOURED SUPPORT\n For comfort and support during every adventure, the Presidio features a removable dual-density Keen Metatomical EVA footbed that provides arch support by hugging the natural contours of your foot.\n\nPATENTED TOE PROTECTION\n Because you never know what might cross your path, the Presidio includes Keen.Protect, patented toe protection that wraps up and over the outsole for thorough coverage of the entire toe bed.\n\nRUBBER OUTSOLE FOR GREAT TRACTION\n Whether you're navigating city streets, hitting the shops, or enjoying outdoor adventures, you'll appreciate the Presidio's non-marking rubber outsole. It delivers a steady step on a variety of terrain and won't leave black marks on floors.\n\nKEEN: A STORY OF HYBRID INNOVATION\n Keen began in 2003 with an inspired sandal design that combined comfort and toe protection. This radical design departure for sandals spawned the overriding Keen philosophy of hybrid innovation--striving to create new possibilities and to discover and implement original ideas.\n\n Keen products put an emphasis on the joys of play. At the same time, Keen believes in the value of working hard to give back to the community. To that end, the company has partnered with non-profit organizations around the world to help get youth into the outdoors, protect land for its environmental and recreational value, and to give bikes to kids in need.\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\n Keen Women's Presidio Casual Shoe.\n\n\n\nFrom beaches to mountains to city streets, Keen believes the outdoors is anyplace without a ceiling. Keen believes in living a HybridLife, which means being part of a greater community that is full of people who create possibilities, play in the outdoors and care for the world around them.\n\nSee more",
