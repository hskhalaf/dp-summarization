I am a bit disappointed that the soles do not have the razor siping that all my Newports have had. That may make them a bit more slippery on wet surfaces but I have not confirmed that yet.",

He would probably go with a 9 instead. After wearing a while my husband said the slightly larger size isn\u2019t really an issue. They are easy to get in and out of and tighten up a little bit if needed. He said they are warmer to wear than his Teva sandals since the toe is closed and there is more material. But this closeness also makes the sandals more sturdy and provides better footing than other sandals. He highly recommends these.",

Most sandals leave hot spots without socks, but these didn\u2019t do this at all. Even after getting them wet, they performed great. I walked a loose gravel path, and didn\u2019t have the usual slipping around and instability that most sandals do when walking on unstable surfaces. The base is solid and the contour of the shoe kept my foot sitting solid in the mold of the shoe. Overall these are the best sandals that I have ever owned.",

I hadn\u2019t noticed that they were closed toe with a black rubber covering the front of the sandals but I\u2019ll get used to that one thing I don\u2019t like about them. They have been made to a high standard and the stitching is top notch and consistent and straight throughout the sandals. The soles are no scuff and no slip. They are easy on and easy off with just enough stretching to accommodate that action. I\u2019ve worn them for a few days now and I\u2019m happy with how they fit my feet.
