I changed nozzles as recommended elsewhere, and the mist was much better. I also decreased the flow of water to the fan, and that improved the quality of the mist even more. I suggest that three smaller nozzles be added to each assembly kit so the customer will have that option Also suggest manual be rewritten. Some sentences weren't clear, and important measurements (such as maximum water pressure) need to be addressed in units we use, such as pounds per square inch.",

This year, I decided to purchase this one instead and early on, I am MJCH happier with it than the others. The assembly is very similar but it went much smoother.
