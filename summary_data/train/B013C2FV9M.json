Also, the legs have enough wiggle room when swaddled so that my concerns are put at ease regarding hip displasia which can occur when blanket swaddling too tightly. On the flip side, I am not worried that the swaddle will come undone as my baby sleeps as it could with blanket swaddling when done too loosely, since the velcro holds everything together nicely. Happy with my purchase!",

Like in other reviews I agree that the velcro is a bit sharp and is very strong, so be careful when swaddling your little one.

We used these till our baby was about 12 pounds and these were perfect to keep her contained, sleeping longer and manageable.

We've had them for a week or so and can't imagine that we'll be able to use them for more than another couple of weeks. They're far more reasonably priced than the competition, but with the sizing the way it is, I still think we would have been better off paying 2-3x the price for Halo.",

They come in several cute patterns, and can be made of thicker material (good for colder nights) or lighter cotton (great for daytime). For unskilled swaddlers this is a ifeline, and for tehe skilled ones these can be used over a blanket swaddle underneath. I can't recommend this more to anyone who wants to keep their infants swaddled and cute. I wish they make more patterns.",
