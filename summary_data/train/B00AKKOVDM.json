I got a matching tray so that solves the problem of resting drinks and glasses on the table.",

Ive sprayed tons of lemon pledge on it and it seems to make it worse. Im not trying to just soak it in fabreeze so fingers crossed. I purchased it two months ago and its still as smelly as day one.

Hollow inside and cannot use for storage. As others said it won\u2019t support drinks as top is bumpy due to the natural weaving. A glass top would be gorgeous but expensive. I use a large serving tray permanently on top and it works perfectly holding drinks. I love it because it\u2019s so different than other coffee tables. Highly recommend if you are okay with the gray tones.",

It's built much sturdier and heavier than I expected and the the bottom is lined with some heavy duty fabric. The weave is very tight and strong, nothing loose to worry about.

A previous poster mentioned a strong smell and if I sit super close to it, I can smell an odor. It's not horrible though. Just wish the picture color had been more close to the actual product.
