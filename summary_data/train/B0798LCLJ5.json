You will have to disable your 5G or rename it just to get it to connect! Second no dimming support! Seriously?

Probably because there is some additional step that Ecobee needs to take that Amazon products (like Echo Dots) do not, the Alexa commands are hit and miss and not a reliable option. Why I ever decided to buy the Switch+ (knowing this about the Ecobee4) is beyond me now. So, know that this product has extremely poor Alexa integration. With three of these around my house, I can safely say that no one should buy it for Alexa use. The motion detection and light control are really the only positives here.",

Maybe other ecobee products are good. This isn't one of them.",

The sound/volume is fine - not quiet but not loud (just as I\u2019d expect). Price is a little steep but this actually really works well for this household. Installation was fairly easy - no different then swapping out any other light switch. I had no issues with getting the app to see the switch (iPhone). Great product - may get another.",
