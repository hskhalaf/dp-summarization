      "text": "This is a fun, fast paced game, with nice surprises. I really like games that rely on a combination of skill, strategy, and luck. That combination creates a nice \"democratic\" equalizing of success among the players. That means that adults don't have a great advantage over children, yet its fun for both. The surprises of the \"attack,\" when the machine vomits up an unpredictable amount of cards, become great moments of laughter and levity. I find those experiences help create nice \"bonding\" moments. I'd say this game is fun for the whole family; unless a person is very competitive (because the luck, and unpredictability involved in this game might frustrate those people).",

Shuffler was made of hard plastic and came with trial batteries, the uno cards were crisp and thick just as they should be. How the game is played was a little confusing but even more confusing was how to control the shuffler. It threw cards out in every direction and each time I found myself on the floor looking for the cards. We have since stopped using the shuffler and play regular UNO as of now",

It does not appear the attack module won't work without the cover in place. I also wish they would have a kept a uniform point total for the special cards. We changed that part of the game, saying all special cards are worth 20 points. It made the game go faster.",

It adds to the enjoyment and changes the pace unexpectedly. Again, this makes the game of Uno a little more interesting and makes for more tension at the game table.

It does require batteries, so purchase some in advance of receiving the game. It's easy to set-up, but make sure you follow the instructions to put the cards in properly or they will not fly out in the attack mode. The students enjoyed the game, and as much as I dislike UNO, watching them get excited was exciting for me. :0",
