Though we were skeptical because it was a no-name TV and inexpensive, we purchased, anyhow. Without going into great detail, (it was expressed in other reviews) this is a fine TV that fits our needs. We are not gamers, and could care less about high fidelity audio. The audio of this unit is perfect for us. Thank you oCosmo and Amazon. I notice that the price has gone up since we bought (when the TV is available). Not surprised",

Had to return the first one because the top of the frame/case was separated from the LED screen, causing a strip of backlight to shine through at the top of the screen. I'm waiting for the replacement to arrive, and I'll update my review accordingly. Edit: Second TV is free of screen/case problems. Sound is a slight issue with the new one (it wasn't a problem with the first defective one), as there's a static/tinniness at high volumes. Will definitely be getting some speakers to mitigate the problem. Other than that, good picture, good TV, probably the best available for $280+tax.",

I would estimate we use this for 5-10 hours a day (I know, I know). I love how the HDMI hookups (there are 3) are on the side making it way to switch between gaming systems and Blu-ray players. I use a sound bar with this TV so I can not comment on the sound as I have never used it,",

I do not have a game console hooked up to this TV, so keep searching for reviews if that's its intended purpose. The cons are typical for this price point: it does not handle black as well as my nicer monitors, and you will notice when there is no active input the black screen is blotchy. Also, oCosmo is clearly trying to create some brand recognition so you will be treated to their logo for a second or two upon power-up to compensate for the extremely competitive price. Neither of these are reason enough to avoid this otherwise perfectly functional TV.",

The power cord is not long and is not detachable which meant I had to get a bit more creative then prior TV to run it in the wall.

Wherever there is a good WiFi signal, the Roku stick we have plugged in the back enables us to watch whatever we want.",

It's a little hard to plug and unplug devices since it is very thin/close to the wall, but that's no issue at all. Would absolutely buy again. One note: Sound quality is only slightly better than what you'd expect, so go for a sound bar as well if you feel like that would be important to you.",

Works great with xbox one as well, and just incase any of yall where wondering how to hook up xbox one Kinect to turn your tv when you turn xbox on, use the Sony code. it works. only wish they had bigger sets so I could move this on into my bedroom and put a new one in the living room. great buy, get one.",

It is not in Harmony's database, so I had to teach mine most of the remote functions. I'm not going to comment on the picture, because I honestly probably wouldn't know good from terrible. I will say that it looks just fine to me, and the speakers seem OK for a bedroom environment. I would not use them for a family room set. The real thing here is the price AND the 3 HDMI inputs. I was unable to find a similarly spec'd set for even $200 more.",

The TV comes with a lot of connection formats for external equipment. The picture quality was excellent considering the price. I see people comment on the sound quality but it sounds good especially for a teen. I just purchase her a oCOSMO sound bar and it not only sounds goods her remote has control for it. Perfect all around television, and for the price you can't beat it. I would purchase again.",
