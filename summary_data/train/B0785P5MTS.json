Unfortunately my cat does not like this new formula, and I also noticed that the kernels were larger than previous. I'm trying to mix this with the original to see if my cat will eat it, but so far she is separating out the old from the new. So just a heads up to consumers about this formula change. Thanks!",

As more and more people are learning, grain free pet food is suspected of causing heart problems in dogs and cats. The culprit in this cat food is two different forms of peas in the top five ingredients. Peas prevent your cat from being able to produce taurine, necessary for heart health, and can cause serious heart disease. Unfortunately the two versions of this cat food (regular and grain free) come in bags so similar it\u2019s easy to confuse them, as I apparently did.",
