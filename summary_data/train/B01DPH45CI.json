I purchased another mattress because the sagging was just too ridiculous for my son to sleep on for the next couple years. Disappointing buy.",

While firm enough not to leave indentations, it is soft enough to be comfortable. The mattress is 6\" high and fits perfectly in a toddler bed. I like that it has a 10 year limited warranty. My little ones using this mattress are two 25-pound doggies. They use the toddler side, which is softer than the infant side, and they seem very happy to snuggle up together on it.",
