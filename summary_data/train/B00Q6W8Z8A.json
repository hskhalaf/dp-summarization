They fit very well. I hand wash both of them pretty often (after 3-4 wears) in warm water and just a little laundry soap (yes the water is murky most prominently after the first wash but it's improved with each subsequent wash. ) These pjs are black so of course the color will bleed out into the water! There has been no obvious fade after 4 washes. I have observed no mistakes in the stitching. I'm very pleased with this purchase!",

Very cool to sleep in as I am very hot nature'ed. I have another set from different store that are very thin and almost transparent and would be for sleeping only .

Many people complained about having buttons on the \u201cwomen\u2019s side\u201d, which I think is absurd and it didn\u2019t bother me a bit. The one drawback on them is a big one. Even after months of having them and multiple washes, they still stain sheets. The dye has continued to run from them after no less than 10 washes. This is a major downside and because of this, I will be getting rid of them. They have ruined a set of nice white sheets. Perhaps I will get something similar down the road in a colour that will not run.",

I read reviews that the dye on darker colors bleeds onto sheets and other cloth so I ordered Silver.
