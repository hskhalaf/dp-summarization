I went looking for a replacement and you may be thinking the Vitamix is a bit over the top. I can assure you, it is not. I love using it, love learning new recipes with it and love just seeing it sit on my counter. The Vitamix can help you make just about anything and it even has its own cleaning cycle so you just add soapy water and sit back. I love this blender and highly recommend it.",

When you start blending, even if you start low, the ingredients explode all over the blender which means you either have to stope and scrape things down or stop and swirl and start again. This is a bit frustrating when trying to quickly make a smoothie. The other thing I was a bit disappointed in was that it\u2019s advertised as self cleaning but it\u2019s really not. You still have to use a sponge even after rinsing and using soap and water for the self cleaning.",
