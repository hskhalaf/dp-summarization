I started off using very little and worked my way up to about 1/4 of a scoop. It calls to use more but my puppy is very small and I didn\u2019t want to overwhelm her small portions of food. She has no problem eating and seems to like it fine. We only give it to her in the morning with wet food. I will continue to use it as I feel it will benefit her health in the long run.",
