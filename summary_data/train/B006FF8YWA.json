When my child steps onto it, the beam end lifts off the floor a bit. I had some rubber shelving \"paper\" so I cut a strip of it to place under the beam (on the carpet) with 1 inch overage on each side and that does prevent slippage of beam. It is not as sturdy as wood, but our 4 year old beginner is enjoying her home practice sessions, and the price was very reasonable for our budget.",

Do to the price we haven't bought a second one yet but most likely will in the near future.",

The bottoms on each beam are different colors, but that doesn't matter, as I was more concered about the quality. I would definetly recommend this beam for your gymnast to practice at home.",

      "text": "We bought this beam for my daughter's third birthday. She began in a recreational gymnastics class a few months ago and loves it. We were looking for something similar to the actual beams used at her gym but practical for use and storage in a small apartment. This beam not only met but exceeded my expectations. It is very durable with quality construction, light weight, and takes up a small space. For a three year old just starting in gymnastics for recreation this beam is the perfect size and quality. She is able to safely practice her beam skills at home without needing a professional gym set up. We love it!",
