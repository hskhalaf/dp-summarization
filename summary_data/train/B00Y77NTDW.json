Do I think the Zombies are coming?..No. However, the factory edge is sharp enough to shave with and if the blade will hold an edge this will make a great addition to the pickup truck, the tackle box, or the camping/hunting/fishing gear. Easily could be secured to a backpack or vest. I would not recommend this for anyone who might look at this as a toy.",

I'm thinking of getting some leather strips to re-wrap the handles, for a little hand protection, which would be way cooler on zombie killing axes, anyway.",
