      "text": "This trimmer is great, a real workhorse. Lightweight and very easy to handle, yet cuts through brush up to 1/2\" diameter easily. I've used it multiple times almost non-stop for 2 hrs with the 4 Ah battery, and it still had a charge left every time. i've included before and after photos of extensive clearing of stubborn thorny weeds/brush \u2014 it made quick work of it. At the end of the first use it was making some straining/whining noises, so I sprayed it with silicone-formula WD-40 up and down the blades while it was running, and that completely solved the problem. Now I spray it after every extended use.",

This unit is much better than an electrical one and the battery lasts for a full day's work, light to moderate trimming. It is as heavy as the old electrical cord unit but infinitely less cumbersome. The cutting is adequate and no jamming. However we do not attempt to cut any thick stems such as hollies. It is used on taxus and the like and only for excess seasonal growth. We have a trimmer which also works well and can use the same battery. Overall this seems to work quite well and seems reasonably sturdy.",

This trimmer's rotating handle is comfortable, easy to use, the blades are sharp, and the 2.0 Ah battery lasted long enough to trim a tree and 25 feet of hedges as well as rip through some nuisance shrubs with >1\" stalks that keep coming back along my garage.

I've had their lawnmower for a few years, which has been fantastically reliable, so I bought the tool without a battery and saved money (Yeah!). The battery makes it a bit heavy for me but my fit, young, single sons say it's light so take that as opinion rather than fact. I love being able to twist the direction of the 'blade' which makes it very responsive especially on a tricky little hedge I have that came with the house, and which I hate to the toenails of my soul. Reliable, good size, powerful enough for home garden maintenence and flexible.",

I've personally never used it, but since buying it for him, I've never had to do any more outdoor chores. He loves this, and I love him for using it.

Very light weight, eats up very little battery on my 4ah, and most impressively has the rotating handle which is a game changing feature.

I used the small Greenworks battery with only two bars worked for two hours and still didn't run out of juice. Very nice! It is ready to go straight from the box so don't worry about setting aside time to put it together. Also, I love the rotating handle. Those Yew bushes got a very nice shave yesterday.",

These are beautifully designed and although they aren\u2019t as powerful as gasoline operated devices, you don\u2019t have fuel the mix or engines to crank. Although I have an extra battery, one battery charge usually lasts long enough to do the job I want. A major advantage is the fact that they are so light that you don\u2019t wear yourself out holding a heavy device.",

I felt a little obligated but all in all I have to tell you they are a lot of fun to use. They work extremely well, it is lightweight, the battery power is awesome and actually I think I do a better job than the landscaper did, LOL.",

This is the worse delivery I have ever had from Amazon. On the other side, the device looks ok and when I put a battery in it, it functions correctly so far. I will have to fully test it before I can truly rate the device for quality. I have purchased several items from Greenworks and I love them, so I am planning to purchase more, but the shipping is starting to scare me.",

This one is much lighter and much more maneuverable. The rotating handle is a great addition, and I love the 24 inch length. These shears are really sharp and do a fantastic job. The noise is not bad, so I am able to do trimming without ear protection. Highly recommended.",

It turns easily and stays firmly in place as well. It isn't too heavy either. I can recommend this tool without reservation.",
