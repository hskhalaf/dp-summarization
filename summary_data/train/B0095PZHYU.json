My only complaint is that there are too few choices for exercise. Adding common everyday chores such as vacuuming and mowing would be helpful. Since I manually sync with the Fitbit application a few times a day, instead of using the all day sync option, a short battery life is not an issue. One battery charge lasts me about a week.",

So I would highly recommend the Fitbit One At first I really like my Fitbit One, but after seven months the button no longer works. When I push the button it does NOT show miles, floors or anything but the amount of steps I have taken. Disappointing for the amount of money I spent on this product.",

I use it to my advantage when I show my wife my weekly average number of steps and have offered to buy her one so we can compare.

The tracking of stairs climbed is an added bonus over the Flex, and I like being able to read the status on the device. All and all, this one is a keeper!!",

    "title": "Fitbit One Wireless Activity Plus Sleep Tracker, Burgundy",
    "description": "Color:BurgundyFitness means being active, sleeping well, and eating smarter \u2013 and the Fitbit One helps you do all three. During the day, it tracks your steps, distance, calories burned, and stairs climbed. Come nightfall, it measures your sleep cycle to help you see how to sleep better; and it can even wake you in the morning without waking your partner. Your stats upload wirelessly via computer or select mobile devices (like the iPhone 4S). Powered by your stats, you can set goals, and track progress. Stay motivated by earning badges or connecting with friends for support or friendly competitions. Log food, work-outs and more. Bring greater fitness into your life \u2013 seamlessly, socially, 24 hours a day.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nKeep it Clean: Regularly clean your band and wrist\u2014especially after working out or sweating. Rinse the band with water or wipe it with a small amount of rubbing alcohol. Do NOT use hand soap, body soap, dish soap, hand sanitizers, cleaning wipes or household cleaners which could get trapped beneath the band and irritate skin. Always dry the band well before putting it back on. Keep it Dry: While Fitbit devices are water resistant*, it\u2019s not good for your skin to wear a wet band for long periods of time. If your elastomer band gets wet\u2014like after sweating or showering\u2014rinse and dry it thoroughly before putting it back on your wrist. Be sure your skin is dry before you put your band back on. Don\u2019t Wear It Too Tight: Make sure your band isn\u2019t too tight. Wear the band loosely enough that it can move back and forth on your wrist. If you use Fitbit products with Purepulse Heart Rate tracking, for better heart rate readings during exercise, we suggest wearing the band so it\u2019s secure, but not too tight, and wearing the band higher on your wrist (about 2-3 finger widths above your wrist bone). Lower the band on your wrist and loosen it after exercise. Give Your Wrist a Rest: Prolonged rubbing and pressure may irritate the skin, so give your wrist a break by removing the band for an hour after extended wear.\n\nBUYING GUIDE\nMove it up: Since blood increases further up your arm, wear your tracker higher on your wrist to improve the heart rate signal during workouts. Start by moving the device up to three finger widths above your wrist bone, then experiment with slightly lower placement. Keep it secure: The less your tracker moves during exercise, the more chance you have of maintaining a heart rate signal throughout the activity. Do not wear the band too tightly, as this can restrict blood flow and goes against our wear and care guidelines. Hold steady for ten seconds: High intensity exercises or activities that cause you to keep your wrist bent (like push-ups) or move your arms vigorously (like dance) may interfere with heart rate signals. If you stop seeing a signal during these types of activities, hold your wrist steady for ten seconds during breaks to get your reading.\n\nSee more",
