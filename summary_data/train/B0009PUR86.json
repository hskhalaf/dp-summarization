Since most people buy the generic blue color sold at most stores. Only downside is there's no carry bag at all. So i'm going to have to get a carry bag or tote for it. A recommendation is with any porcelain coted dinnerware always buy a set of cheap washcloths. Store one between each dish in a firmly fitting container unless you want them to get all marked up clanking around in the bags. I know this from our last set they got all chipped up during travels. so live and learn.",

The bowls had grit between the metal and the enamel and this causes bumps and bubbles in the top surface that forms cracks, and chips the enamel.
