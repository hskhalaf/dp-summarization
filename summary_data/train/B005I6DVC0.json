This has a 12 zoom and the pictures have come out clear enough to have them framed and hung at our home.",

Also the flash takes a long time to charge up so it is easy to miss the perfect shot. However you know when it is on because you have to manually flip it up, making it easier to not accidently take pictures of gallery subject matter that restricts the use of a flash. I think I will figure out the features eventually as with all electronics instructions leave unanswered questions.",

Very good photo quality compared to other instant \"point and shoot\" digital \"small\" cameras. Uses cheep SD cards instead of some expensive variation. Creates good photos inside and out with very little in the way of training or camera savvy knowledge. Competitive price Con: Slow to charge Flash, est. 15 sec. after I flipped up the flash hood. I understand that it may be under powered and eat up AA batteries. But they are cheep. Used it for over an hour on the weekend. Still same batteries so far but based on the flash I would guess they won't last.",

If you plan to get this camera pack lots of AA batteries. I plan to keep the camera although I'm not happy with its performance when taking multiple shots with the flash on and supplement it with a better performing model.",

I used it for everything and used my regular video camera as backup only. Guess it just got old. It was great while it lasted. Now, I'm shopping for a newer model Canon.

Battery life for a point and shoot is probably average. The more you use it in one setting the quicker the batteries wear out. I turn it off when I can between pictures.

I still have more to learn about all of its capabilities, but so far I have not been lost in tech-speak. I was slightly surprised how fast it burned thru batteries, so I'm with-holding judgement in that area for now just incase it was simply a poor batch of batteries that I got ahold of. I was very impressed with the audio recording capabilities, it had a nice range. The price is fair. I have not found anything that it advertises to be to be anything less then as stated.",

What I like the most about this camera, is that you can take your pics using a few other options in addition to the fully automatic mode; just as the very expensive cameras can do it, so that you can control the camera to do what you want it to do. This was a great buy and I recommend this product to everybody!",

Its compact size makes it convenient to carry around everywhere to capture those special moments that can happen anytime! Sporting a stylish design, it comes in two great colors: Black and Red. 14.1 Megapixels deliver stunning image detail and enable you to make beautiful large prints. 12x Optical Zoom lets you get close to distant subjects, while the 28mm wide-angle capability makes this camera great for photographing large groups of people and scenic landscapes. Advanced technologies, such as Intelligent IS and Smart AUTO, make it easy and effortless to capture gorgeous still images and HD video. It all makes the PowerShot SX150 IS the perfect camera to capture the good times, wherever you might be.\n\nPrecision Canon Optics\n\n12x Optical Zoom with 28mm Wide-Angle Lens\nThe PowerShot SX150 IS features a powerful Genuine Canon 12x Zoom Lens that delivers outstanding optical performance and versatility. With precision engineering and decades of leadership in optical technologies, Canon has created a bright, wide-angle lens that provides an extraordinary 12x zoom range. The lens starts at 28mm wide-angle and extends to 336mm telephoto (35mm equivalent), giving you tremendous coverage and reach. The telephoto end lets you capture subjects from a considerable distance, while the 28mm wide-angle makes it easy to shoot sweeping landscapes, large groups of people and tall buildings. Moreover, this superlative lens incorporates innovative designs that enable it to fit the compact profile of the PowerShot SX150 IS and perform at high speed with low power consumption.\n\n\nOptical Image Stabilizer\nHandheld shooting can often lead to camera shake, making photos and videos blurry. Canon\u2019s Optical Image Stabilizer is a sophisticated system that uses lens-shift technology to correct for unwanted camera movement. It makes handheld photography more practical in more shooting situations, providing excellent image quality in many difficult situations: outdoors at dusk, inside without a flash, and even at the telephoto end of the zoom range without a tripod. For still photos, it enables shooting at slower shutter speeds, accommodating more low-light shooting situations than ever before without having to boost ISO sensitivity. With camera shake and vibration reduced, you get a sharper, steadier image. And because it is an optical system, there is none of the image degradation typical with electronic image stabilizers.\n\n\nPowerful Performance for Better Images\n\n14.1 Megapixel Sensor\nA 14.1 Megapixel sensor delivers beautiful photos with fine detail and brilliant color. The high resolution ensures superb image quality even when cropping or making very large prints.\n\nCanon DIGIC 4 Image Processor\nCanon DIGIC Image Processors have set the standard for functionality and performance since their groundbreaking introduction in 1999. With each successive generation, DIGIC processors have brought elevated performance and powerful new features to PowerShot digital cameras. The DIGIC 4 processor has ushered in a new level of picture quality and accelerated processing, making possible features such as high-speed continuous shooting, Full HD video and Face Detection Self-timer. New, more powerful noise reduction algorithms also provide improved low-light capture.\n\n\nA Smarter Camera Means Better Photos and Videos\n\nSmart AUTO\nThe PowerShot SX150 IS features Smart AUTO \u2013 sophisticated Canon technology that makes getting that great shot as simple as pressing the shutter button. Smart AUTO automatically detects scenes by assessing various factors in both the background and the subject. Detected scenes are analyzed using 32 predefined shooting situations. The camera then makes optimal settings to ensure the best possible image capture, whether you\u2019re shooting stills or video. Smart AUTO also includes Advanced Subject Detection, which allows the camera to detect and track non-human moving subjects like animals and vehicles. With Smart AUTO, all you have to do is frame your shot and capture away.\n\n\nShooting Modes/Special Scene Modes\n\n\nSmart AUTO\nThe camera automatically selects the best shooting settings for optimal quality based on subjects and environmental factors to provide point-and-shoot simplicity.\nKids & Pets Reduced focusing time freezes fast-moving subjects, so you won't miss those special shots. Portrait \nThe camera sets a large aperture, focusing the subject and artistically blurring the background to make your subject \u201cpop.\u201d\nManual \nYou have complete contrl of exposure, selecting both aperture and shutter speed manually. \nLow Light For high quality image capture in an amazing range of dimly-lit situations.\nToy Camera Effect Simulates photos taken with \"toy\" or pinhole cameras, darkening the image at the edges to create a vignette effect.\nPoster Effect Poster Effect combines several similar shades into one color, turning subtle gradations into eye-catching, scene-popping contrasts.\nBeach Beach Get clear shots of people at a sunny beach without darkened faces.\nFireworks Grab brilliant images of skyrocketing fireworks.\nAperture-Priority \nYou set the aperture, controlling depth-of-field. The camera automatically selects the shutter speed. \nProgram Access advanced exposure compensation features while shooting mostly automatically.\nFisheye Effect Add a classic photo distortion without a fisheye lens.\nShutter-priority You select the shutter speed to stop or blur action, and the camera finds the appropriate aperture. With slow exposure times, Canon's noise reduction system activates to ensure low image noise.\nMonochrome Choose from three single-tone effects: Black-and-White, Sepia, or Blue.\nColor Accent Choose to retain a single color in your image while other colors turn monochrome.\nFoliage Capture brilliant shots of autumn foliage, greenery and blossoms.\nLandscape Increases depth-of-field for sharp and sweeping landscape shots. \nMovie Digest Records a video clip before capturing a still image and then combines one day\u2019s worth of clips into a video.\nSmart Shutter The camera automatically takes the photo when people smile, wink, or get into frame.\nDiscreet Mode Disables flash, AF assist beam, and all camera sounds with one mode dial setting \u2014 so you can capture images in quiet areas.\nMiniature Effect for Movies & Stills Emphasizes perspectives for a miniature effect by blurring upper and bottom portions of the image.\nSuper Vivid Super Vivid intensifies existing hues, saturating the scene with bright colors.\n\nColor Swap Select a color and replace it with a color you specify for special effects.\nSnow Shoot clear snow scenes without darkened subjects or an unnatural bluish tint.\niFrame Movie The Apple\u00ae movie format, iFrame, makes it easier and quicker to import and upload videos while retaining high image quality.\nMovie \nRecord video in stereo sound. Unwanted scenes can be deleted in playback mode. Easy Mode \nIn Easy mode, shooting is simple and relaxed\u2014the camera handles all the settings automatically.\n\n\nTurn Any Moment into an HD Video Memory\n\nCanon HD Video Advantage\nThe PowerShot SX150 IS lets you record spectacularly detailed 720p HD video at 30* frames per second with clear stereo sound. Imagine the fun and excitement of being able to shoot high definition video whenever you want, then downloading the videos to your computer to watch or share with family and friends. \n*Actual frame rate is 29.97 fps.\n\nDedicated Movie Button, Wind Filter and Optical Zoom While Shooting\nIt\u2019s never been easier to shoot videos with a PowerShot digital camera. The PowerShot SX150 IS has a dedicated movie button that lets you start and stop recording instantly. There is no need to go through layers of menus or operate switches or dials to switch to and from video recording mode. The camera is always ready to shoot stills or video whenever you want. The PowerShot SX150 IS also incorporates an electronic wind filter, which suppresses wind noise that can muffle or distort the sound. And unlike less sophisticated point-and-shoot cameras, the PowerShot SX150 IS lets you use the full 12x range of optical zoom when you\u2019re shooting a video without sacrificing HD video resolution.\n\niFrame Movie Support\nWith the PowerShot SX150 IS, you can also shoot video in the Apple iFrame format, which is a computer-friendly standard that speeds up importing and editing of videos. It keeps file sizes small, making it more convenient to upload or e-mail high-quality videos. The iFrame format enjoys native support in compatible Mac and Windows video applications, making it unnecessary to perform time-consuming and often quality-degrading conversions.\n\n\nA Steady Image Is a Beautiful Image\n\nIntelligent IS\nThe latest advance in Canon Optical Image Stabilization technology, Intelligent IS analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation. For stills, the system automatically selects among Normal, Panning, Macro (Hybrid) and Tripod IS modes. When shooting video, the system automatically selects among Dynamic, Powered, Macro and Tripod IS modes. With Intelligent IS, you can concentrate on image capture, letting the camera make the most effective IS settings to assure the steadiest possible image. \n\nNormal\nCorrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills. Panning\nPanning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement. Hybrid\nCorrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting. Dynamic\nEffective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking. Powered\nCompensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified. Tripod\nWhen tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed. \n\nSee the Image in a Big Screen\n\nLarge 3.0-inch LCD\nThe camera's high-resolution (230,000 dots) 3.0-inch LCD gives you the big picture, whether you're shooting, reviewing or showing off your images. This high-resolution screen offers a crisp, clear picture to make shooting, playback and using the camera's menu functions especially convenient. Clear and bright, it also features Night Display for easy viewing in low light.\n\n\nPower on the Go\n\nAA Battery Powered\nRecharging batteries can often be an inconvenience, especially when traveling in foreign countries. With the PowerShot SX150 IS, you\u2019ll never need special power adapters or chargers because it\u2019s powered by two AA batteries that are widely available around the world. \n\n\nEasier, More Enjoyable Photography\n\nFace Detection Technology\nSpecial Scene Modes\nBest Image Selection\n\nWhat\u2019s in the Box\n\u2022 PowerShot SX150 IS Body\n\u2022 2 AA-size Alkaline Batteries \n\u2022 Wrist Strap WS-800\n\u2022 USB Interface Cable IFC-400PCU\n\u2022 Digital Camera Solution CD-ROM",
