You do not get the most recent update from syncing with the app. When you update on the computer it allows you to turn off all the vibrating/beeping functions that could happen during your swing. Also this app allows you to do some minimal fitness tracking. Once I had this update I fell in love with the watch.",

In terms of golfing, it found my course quickly and is far more user friendly than other GPS items I have used. The score keeping feature is nice and puts it above the competition.
