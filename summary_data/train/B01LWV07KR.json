      "text": "There is NO cinch-strap as shown in several of the seller's pictures and it barely holds a bike water bottle (see my photos). Otherwise, it is a nice small bag (it just fits my folding umbrella). Included is an L-shaped (and padded) nylon piece that velcros to the inside front and inside bottom of the bag in an attempt to keep the bag upright, and not scrunched, which adds a little weight. I am able to put my Abus bike lock inside the main compartment (but not in the full length side compartment) as well as my mini bike pump (fits on an angle), bike tools, extra inner tube, gloves, and a few other small items.",

The interior compartment is more like 12x5x5. I needed this to carry books. Don't buy this if you need much more than beach towel and sun blocking the primary compartment, to give you an idea of the dimensions. I gave three stars because it is made of water resistant material, has reflective sides, arrived on time and like does everything else it claims, but it's not as large as it portends to be. I don't think it's a matter of intentional misleading, so much as a metric/imperial conversion matter.",

I can comfortably fit a rain poncho, snacks and lunch. the side pockets are great for car keys, wallet and Colorado supplies. The bag it made with thick material and is stiff enough to hold it's shape. For what it costs, I couldn't be happier with it. It is exactly what I needed. Great bargain.",
