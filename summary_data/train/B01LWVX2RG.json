They're lighter, the analog sticks are so loose, no stiffness at all, they just flop around, and they all die on me within a few months. There must be different manufacturers involved here. EDIT; By die I mean they quit holding a charge for more than like 30 minutes. I have a wal-mart one that I bought when my PS4 that is a year and a half old and it's analog sticks are still nice and stiff, it still holds a 5+ hour charge, meanwhile I've gone through four of these and have no intention of ever buying another one.",

In games where the left stick movement is very sensitive, certain directions will cause the character to shuffle their feet repeatedly because the controller's signal constantly shows a strong/weak press alternating. My first controller, this issue was when pressing around 1 o' clock on the analog, the second one is when I press straight to the left. I've never had so many problems with a game system's controller. Even my 360 controllers which have stick drift don't become as unplayable as these ps4 controllers do.",

Lightweight, great response time, love the LEDs that change colors , touchpad is also good and triggers are responsive enough for feedback. Now I switched back to PC gaming and this is great. I'm running it with \"DS4Windows\" which is a 3rd party app to make the DS4 controller work on Windows. It's great! you can use it either wired or wireless and charge from PC with the micro-usb cable it comes with. I played WWE 2k18, NBA2k18, COD: WWII, and South Park with it. So far- great! Highly recommend if you use controllers for PC gaming.",

(As an old-school mouse-&-keyboard gamer, the DS4's gyro-based aiming beats the $#@! out of those little sticks & pads.) Looking forward to trying it in PC driving scenarios, esp. the buggy races in \"Dying Light: The Following,\" and vehicles in \"Star Wars Battlefront II.\"",

      "text": "At some point in the last few years sony slightly redesigned their DS4 controller. This is my second time buying these newer ones. I found a few good things about it, and a bad thing as well. Pros: L2/R2 buttons/ springs were redesigned and now don't break as easy. It's now slighty easier to take apart now for repairs. There's a cool new light bar on the touch pad. (Some may find it annoying though) Cons: Just like many others have said....The left analog stick wears out way faster than the last gen DS4 controllers.",

A minor inconvenience, since I can just charge it with the cord from my original controller, but I can't charge both at the same time unless I buy another micro USB cable (my phone charges with USB-C, so I don't really have extras laying around).",

Unfortunately for me this issue didn't develop until after it was outside or the return window. So I'm stuck with a paperweight. I gave it one star because when it was right out of the box it worked as advertised. It is unfortunate because I really liked this controller.",

I should have returned it right away. Edit: I'm updating my review to be fair. The sticking of the pad buttons has gone away with time and it is solid and on par with the controller that came with my PS4.",

Happy to report the quality is good and since it's Sony any firmware updates etc.are good to go. A tad pricey overall in my humble opinion but best deal I could find for new, name-brand product.
