      "text": "This is an incredible helmet which is very versatile because the face shield can be removed if one wants to use goggles. I especially love the neck gator. It came promptly and well packaged. But I had to send it back because I needed a carbon fiber helmet just like this and ordered this one which was my error. Anyone would love to have this helmet if they didn't have neck issues and still want to snowmobile. So ordering the carbon fiber one which weighs about two pounds is the trick.",

      "text": "I have 3 of these. The fit is great. The heated shield works though I haven't had a super cold day to really test it yet. The shield itself has a nice glossy outside but the inner layer seems like a different grade of plastic and is very easy to scratch. It's also not the clearest material I've seen for a shield. The built in sunglasses are pretty useless as they capture internal humidity when stowed and are iced over when needed.",

      "text": "I just took this out riding in single digit weather with a Klim arctic balaclava and it kept me perfectly warm. The only problem I have with this helmet is that the heated shield fogs up almost immediately if it\u2019s not plugged in on a cold day. I also noticed that when I shut the vents the inner drop down visor also iced up and was unusable. I will need to purchase a tinted heated shield ($120) to solve this issue. Overall it\u2019s a very warm, comfortable to wear, and light weight helmet that fits true to size.",

Good job 509....",

      "text": "This is a great helmet! I went on a 200 mile ride in very cold wore out conditions and never had the helmet fog up. The helmet provides a little more air to the mouth piece even with the vents shut so in really cold weather (-10F or colder) it can be cold wear a thin balaclava and that takes care on that. This helmet also has a wind protector neck piece that drapes down to your jacket. My neck has never been cold wearing this helmet. I hope someone finds value out of this review. Best wishes and ride hard.",

However it is colder than my previous helmets especially if you are a standup rider and are not behind a windshield. I have the updated version but it is still breezy. My other helmets allowed me to keep my baclava under my chin and not over my mouth and nose. Not this one, have to keep it pulled all the way up to the shield and you can still feel the wind. if it's not super cold it's a fantastic helmet. I'll continue to wear it",
