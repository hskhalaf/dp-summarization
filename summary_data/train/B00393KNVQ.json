      "text": "I cannot say enough good things about this mount. They could not make it any easier to hang a TV on the wall. Make sure you check that your TV is \"VESA mountable\"!! Aside from the horizontal arms, the mount allows you adjust the tv clockwise/counter-clockwise and allows you to pitch it forward for higher mounting. It also includes some cable management brackets (thought they are on the cheap side). One slight oddity was that the two horizontal arm segments are different lengths. So when the arms are both folded in completely, the tv bracket is NOT centered on the wall-mounting bracket. That bothered me for some reason, but the other points FAR outweighed any irritation there.",

To actually center your TV on a specific spot the mount base plate must be attached approximately 3\" left or right of the desired center line. Not a major issue but one that must be considered.",

Unlike other mounts, this one is has an incredibly thin profile. This allows the TV to sit very close to the wall but also extend out a couple feet if you need it. The mounting bolts are adequate if you are mounting to block or into studs. However, if you are mounting to a traditional drywall surface, I suggest buying some heavy duty drywall studs if the vertical mounting arm does not happen to line up with a wall stud.",

Not ideal, but it works in our apartment where we don't have room to re-center our furniture around the TV location. I'm very satisfied with the mount and would certainly recommend this to others.",

On the tilt feature there was a screw that was already stripped out and won't tighten, just spins. For that reason the tv stays in a tilted angle and can't be changed. OK because it is mounted higher and needed to be tilted anyways, but I would be upset if I didn't need it tilted. Overall a decent mount. I've purchases better mounts on amazon, yet more expensive.",

First, the tilt setting can only be adjusted with a wrench, so changing the tilt is not too convenient. Second, the cable management covers are flimsy and don't work well if you have a lot of cables going to the TV. Overall, however, you can't beat it for the price.",
