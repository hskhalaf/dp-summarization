We typically only wear Vivobarefoot shoes, but at the time couldn't afford to shell out for their tennis shoes. I wish I would have taken a picture before we threw them out! I mean, totally destroyed. And he's not even someone who is hard on shoes! So, for how much he loved them (and how affordable), we're into lasting products. Would much rather save for quality. We do now, we have switched back to only buying Vivo's and Softstar Shoes (and amazing handmade, barefoot shoe company out of Oregon). Would not recommend these, just save for better quality!",

No arch support and the soles are pretty thin, making them very light and comfortable to wear. But no way I'd want to trail run with them unless the trail were paved or had wood chips to soften the landing. A trail of rocks and roots will hurt your feet after a short while. But they're great \"around the house\" shoes, as well as great general workout shoes, and I also wear them in the water and kayaking. Gotten compliments on their look, too. So overall great unless you want to actually use them for their named purpose.",

Sometimes I don't want to feel every rock on the trail or every crack in the sidewalk. I'd give it a solid 5 stars if they offerd it in adult colors.",

I'm typically size 9 or 9.5 depending on the shoe, and a 9 in these fits perfectly (with socks).",

      "text": "This is just my second pair of minimalist running shoes, but I do prefer them to my previous pair. They wear like gloves, but a rocky trail feels like a foot massage rather than a painful ordeal. I can't speak to the durability of the shoes since I've only taken them out on a handful of runs so far, but they appear to be well-made. I find myself looking forward to the next run. In the opinion of this minimalist noob, they're awesome. Edit: Well, now that I've owned these for a bit I have to revise my review. Like other reviewers, my shoes have begun to rip--in the same place as all the others.",

Now, my husband says there are 3 other nurses or techs who are wearing them, too. My husband has totally flat feet and I thought these would be bad for him, but it's just the opposite.

Absolute best and most minimal non-toe-shoes I've found on the market. In fact I find the sole to be more minimal than many models of Vibrams. First time I put these on: they hurt on gravel in a way I'd never experienced with Vibrams! My feet had to toughen up further.",

I use it for ladderwork, short runs (7 min/mile or less) on the treadmill, jump rope,and heavy bag work as the university gym frowns upon bare feet. I wouldnt recommend the bag work for kicks, as the sole has so much traction it impedes the twisting of the planted foot.",
