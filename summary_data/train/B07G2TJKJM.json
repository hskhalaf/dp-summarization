I've tried other cellulite creams where I can't stand the smell and it lingers on all day. The smell on this one seems to fade away within 30 minutes. My only wish is that it came in a larger container. Still giving it 5 stars because it works for me. Cellulite has faded from my thighs and my skin looks smoother.",
