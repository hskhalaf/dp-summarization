The back portion is too narrow and the seat portion is a bit too small on all corners..(probably because my seat has curved barrier on the sides) I find myself always rearranging it because it always slides off the seat. This will probably work on a 'flat' seat but if not, look elsewhere. Needs the title and description changed as this is obviously NOT universal fitment approved.",

I didn\u2019t want to risk staining my new seats but also didn\u2019t want the cheap stretchy material covers that go around the entire front and back. These seemed like a good alternative. They are very easy to install and cover the seat completely. They are durable and don\u2019t move around a lot. Great protection for spills and messes. For the price it can\u2019t be beat.

Nice quality, no odor, sturdy, doesn't slide on the leather seats. A great bargain! The only thing I wish they'd include were seat head rest covers. My dog slobbers far and wide. I need something that covers every conceivable surface including the headliner.",
