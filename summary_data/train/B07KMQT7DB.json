I tried powering off/on the monitor and using the monitor to no effect. The only consistent way I've found is to reboot the machine. On the positive side, the image is great and it's nice to have all of the real estate.",

Only drawback was the shipping time, took a while to arrive, but when it did.. it was GLORIOUS. Assuming this is due to the fact that Fed Ex or UPS didn't deliver it. It was delivered by a freight company and I had to schedule a time for them to come deliver it. The box is THAT big.",

After reading up on the current curved monitors available I decided on this one. It has fit every need that I have and the setup is easy. One recommendation: make sure that you have an extra person to help you when you get ready to set it on the desk as it is awkward to carry for just one person.",
