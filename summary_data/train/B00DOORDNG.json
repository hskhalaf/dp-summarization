I think that the ease and convience make up for the cost since I do not have the time or space to juice all of the ingredients needed to create 6 juices a day for 3 days in a row.",

I love all veggies, but this just wan't satisfying. Good variety juices for the day, but I would never do three days of this again. Eh. The taste was something I dreaded looking forward to. I nearly wanted to starve instead. I have done my own juicing for years. I would endure this for a one day only. I think its a tad overpriced too.",

That's how good real juices are - THEY EXPIRE QUICKLY. All of the reviews talking about the too soon expiration date... Then go and buy your processed juices from the store, and good luck with that! :) I've had Suja before, and all of the juices are pretty good. I am excited to start this to reset my mind before Xmas!!",

I've always hated celery, but recently got to a point where I could stand it. Celery is in almost every juice in this cleanse, and that is all that those juices taste like. All said and done, I ended up wasting a lot of money on a bunch of juice that ultimately ended up being poured down the drain.",

    "description": "Suja\u2019s NEW 3-Day Cleanse includes 7 juices plus a hearty breakfast each day, front-loading your calories to reduce feelings of hunger to help you get through the program successfully. Shortly before starting, we recommend eliminating caffeine, dairy, alcohol, red meats and sweets and increasing your intake of fruit, veggies and whole grains, making your transition into the program much easier! customer will receive 21, 12 ounce bottles\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\n\n\nWhat to Expect from Suja\u2019s 3-Day Fresh Start  Going from fish tacos to juice? Be gentle. Start eating light, plant-based foods and hit pause on highly oily, fatty, sugary, or processed foods a few days before you begin. Expect 18 juices, 6 per day all packed with organic planty goodness. What will they taste like? Blend up some fresh celery, cucumber and kale and you might get an idea. And don\u2019t expect sugar \u2013 because we didn\u2019t add any. Will you be hungry? Yes. Yes, you will. But if you need to cheat a little, we won\u2019t tell \u2013 just keep it light, like veggies (yup, can\u2019t have enough) and nuts. Plus, drink lots of water. Why, again, are you doing this? Plants have power and you should, too. We\u2019ve bottled the best of them so you can chug celery to aid in digestion (everybody poops), beets to improve blood flow (also helps with skin radiance) and cayenne to jump start your metabolism (yes, please). \n\nFrom Cold-Pressed Kale to Collards to Cucumbers to Carrots, we\u2019ve got you covered Curious how we make green chard chuggable? Simple is not our middle name. Bryan, our totally hipster head chef, works up concoctions using the highest quality fruits and vegetables that contain vital nutrients your body needs (and wants), like amino acids, antioxidants, proteins & omegas. Then basically the entire office taste-tests until we fall into a \u201cwe\u2019re not worthy\u201d appreciation of the winning creation. Because we\u2019re just a bunch of plant-obsessed people who believe filling your body with clean, organic fruits and veggies increases the chances of having a long, fun-filled life (oh, and also vibrant health and well-being). Now go on \u2013 drink plants and feel their power.\n\n\n\n\nOrganic Organic produce is grown without the use of pesticides, synthetic fertilizers, sewage sludge, genetically modified organisms, ionizing radiation or bioengineering.\n\nNon-GMO GMOs, or \u201cgenetically modified organisms,\u201d are plants or animals that have been genetically modified or artificially engineered. The Non-GMO Project believes that consumers in North America should have access to clearly labeled Non-GMO food and products.\n\nCold-Pressured Cold Pressure, also known as High Pressure Processing (HPP), is used instead of high heat, to extends shelf life and help maintain essential vitamins, minerals and enzymes.\n\n\n\n\nWith a wide range of Cold-Pressed, Organic offerings, Suja has a juice for every lifestyle We believe living food makes us feel more alive and if you have to remember to eat your vegetables, you haven\u2019t tasted ours! \n\n\n\n\nAbout the Startup Describe your product in 3 words.\n\nOrganic. Cold-Pressed. Non-GMO.\n\nHow did you come up with the idea for this product?\n\nSuja\u2019s story all began from a shared dream to help people everywhere transform their lives through conscious nutrition. Co-Founder Annie Lawless had been juicing her entire life and from a young age had been aware that what you put in your body affects how you look and more importantly, how you feel. Her friend Eric Ethans had a background as a raw food chef and spent his entire life researching and pairing ingredients to create healthy, delicious meals. The two met in San Diego and bonded over their mutual love of delivering convenient nutrition through foods and beverages that also tasted good. They were frustrated by the lack of pure, organic products on grocery store shelves and decided to create their own juices at home. Meanwhile, James Brennan, a leading hospitality visionary, award-winning restaurateur and one of San Diego\u2019s most successful entrepreneurs, met Eric and was instantly hooked on his homemade juice. Enter Jeff Church, a Harvard MBA and successful social entrepreneur, known for his role as founder and CEO of Nika Water, a social enterprise that donates 100 percent of its profits to clean water projects and poverty alleviation around the world. The rest is history: Co-founders Annie, Eric, James and Jeff came together to form Suja Juice as we know it today, with a mission to get the best quality organic and Non-GMO juice into as many hands as possible. \n\nWhat makes your product special?\n\nAt Suja, we believe that best-quality, clean juice is a grocery not a luxury. We\u2019re talking cold-pressed, always organic, never (ever) GMO, chemical-free, filler-free, gluten-free, preservative-free, juice without the junk. Because if it\u2019s not all of those things, it\u2019s not worth it. \n\nWhat has been the best part of your startup experience?\n\nSuja is on a mission to get an organic juice into as many hands as possible. Only 4% of US food sales is of organic products and yet in a recent poll, 45% of the US population reported actively trying to add organic foods and beverages to their diets. Since launching in 2012, Suja has sourced over 75 million pounds of organic produce. And ranked #1 in Inc. Magazine\u2019s 500 Fastest Growing Food & Beverage Companies as well as Forbes #2 Most Promising Companies, Suja is well on its way to democratizing organics.",
