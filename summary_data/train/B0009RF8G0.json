Bought this and within a few days her bottom healed and has kept her skin rash free for the 2 months since we started using this on her.

The consistency of the cream is thin and creamy which is KOVE because a little goes a long way. This tub lasts me several months and I use it after each diaper change. The smell is subtle but nice and the cor is a light brown.",
