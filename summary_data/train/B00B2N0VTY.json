      "text": "Purchased this faucet and the sensor didn\u2019t work when we had it installed in March 2019. Paid the plumber to come back twice to replace the electronic control and then the whole unit later. Now, less than a year later, the sensor failed again on the second faucet. It looks like we will be paying a plumber for a third replacement. If you\u2019re looking to put your plumber\u2019s kids through college, buy this faucet. If that\u2019s not how you hoped to spend your hard earned money, I\u2019d strongly recommend that you do not buy this product.",

Easiest to tap power from the dishwasher NOT garbage disposal as that\u2019s on a switch. Learn from my mistake. LOL!",

This faucet is fantastic when it works, but I have had to replace the solenoid twice in less than 2 years of use. The first one broke within three months. I am currently waiting to receive the second solenoid from Kohler but its is on backorder (because so many of them break?) so until I receive it and get it installed I just have a very expensive manual faucet.",

One comment, the spray function is extremely strong. When I use it, I get small drops of water all around the sink area from rebounding water. If I use it to rinse off a set of dinner dishes, I have to wipe up the water around the sink with a paper towel. This is both a good thing and a bad thing. The spray is more powerful than my old facet and thus gets more food of the dishes, but I now have to do a little more clean up... after my clean up.",

    "title": "KOHLER K-72218-VS Sensate Touchless Kitchen Faucet, Vibrant Stainless",
    "description": "Style:Standard Touchless| Color:Vibrant StainlessTake touchless to a whole new level of convenience. The Sensate touchless faucet frees your hands so you can speed through cooking and cleanup tasks while enjoying a cleaner, more hygienic kitchen environment. Sensate's intuitive Response(TM) technology is in tune with your every move: a simple wave of your hand or an object such as a pan or utensil turns it on or off. The faucet's sensor is precision designed to provide reliable operation every time and to prevent false activations when you're working in the sink area. DockNetik(TM), KOHLER's new docking system, secures the pull down sprayhead to the spout using magnetic force.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\nview larger view larger view larger view larger view larger view larger CONVENIENCE IN TECHNOLOGY\nThe Response technology of the Sensate touchless kitchen faucet responds to your movements, leaving you to wonder how you ever prepped, cleaned and cooked without it. Tackling daily kitchen tasks often leaves your hands messy, full or even both. KOHLER has simplified and streamlined the kitchen faucet to make your time in the kitchen more efficient. Delivering convenient and hygienic control, this intuitive faucet reduces the threat of cross-contamination. Sensate has many convenient features such as an automatic shutoff safeguard to make cleanup easier. \n\nKEEP YOUR KITCHEN CLEANER\nThe Sensate kitchen faucet frees your hands so that you can flow through your kitchen tasks, like messy food prep, without pausing to turn the faucet handle on and off. And you don\u2019t have to worry about spreading the mess and germs to the rest of the kitchen. \n\nThe state-of-art sensor responds in 20 milliseconds. Simple wave your hand or a pot or pan through the sensor window for reliable on/off operation. The window begins at the underside of the spout and extends six inches toward the base. Simply wave your hand through the beam to activate the water. If you need to change the water temperature, simply adjust the handle while the faucet is in use. \n\nSPRAYHEAD FEATURES\nSensate features DockNetik, our new magnetic docking system that securely locks the sprayhead in place. With spray and stream capabilities, the dual-function sprayhead makes tough kitchen tasks light work. The braided nylon hose prevents kinks and tangles, and the swiveling ball joint ensures smooth operation with minimal effort. \n\nDESIGNED FOR BEAUTY AND POWER\nThe fusion of sleek design and workhorse functionality allows you to accomplish kitchen tasks more cleanly and easily. Sensate's signature aesthetic element is the black bonnet - an unexpected touch that adds a subtle detail to its design. A finished-matched bonnet is also available. The strategically placed activation area makes use precise and natural. An LED light near the base of the faucet alerts you that the Sensate is operational and ready to go. And in the event of a power loss, the faucet can be operated manually. \n\nKEY FEATURES\n * Touchless Operation: convenient and hygienic control with Response technology \n * State-of-Art Sensor: responds to motion in 20 milliseconds\n * Battery-Free: AC power means no batteries to replace \n * Secure Magnetic Docking: sprayhead securely locks in place \n * Lasting Finish: resists corrosion and wear \n * Durable Ceramic Valves: a lifetime of exceptional performance\n * Easy Clean: wipes clean with a wet cloth\n * Auto Shutoff: automatic shutoff safeguard\n * ProMotion Technology: connects the sprayhead hose to the sprayhead with a swivel joint for effortless maneuverability\n * MasterClean Sprayface: flexible nozzles for an easy-to-clean surface that resists mineral buildup and wipes clean with a wet cloth\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nTake touchless to a whole new level of convenience. The Sensate touchless faucet frees your hands so you can speed through cooking and cleanup tasks while enjoying a cleaner, more hygienic kitchen environment.
