      "text": "I loved this stackable milk dispenser/container! It\u2019s not only colorful, but also very practical and neat to use. My husband and I liked the fact that it can be split into 3 servings and the 3 containers have their own individual lid which prevents accidental spill of formula milk. Very convenient and lightweight as well! You can snack it in your diaper bag without worrying abt the spill and the space. The only thing that I didn\u2019t like abt is the quantity of the dispenser/container. I wish instead of three, they made it four. Overall, a great buy!",

It does fit well for pouring into dr browns bottles, I was worried about that since they have a slender opening. Would buy these again.",

Truly the best formula dispenser due to the funnel shaped top makes dumping formula out easy without having to shake to get everything out.
