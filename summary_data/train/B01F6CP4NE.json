The ratchet worked well (after I read the instructions on releasing it :) The not as good: The length of the webbing where one can place the hanging grips was shorter than I expected. The obstacles only went 2/3 of the distance between the trees in our yard. Also, it took some serious work to get the carabiner's through the opening in the webbing, at least the first time.

This ninja line has 2 layers of webbing throughout the entire line that are sewn together with spaces left for the 'biners to slide through. The ratchet is strong enough to easily tension the line in a few seconds. We had it out of the box and up to use in 20 minutes. The most difficult part was getting the 'biners through the pockets. We found it much easier to do with a lot of slack in the line. There are 5 extra pockets to add more stuff. We added a rope ladder, the spinning wheel and a climbing rope.",
