All in all, my wife loved them and wore them immediately to Xmas dinner. Good quality pearls for being on a budget.",

The descriptive details given on this necklace made it seems as if it was beautiful and a real steal. Well it was neither. Rather this necklace was dull and boring. It looked very inexpensive.It had no real luster or shine and it was very old looking. It did have some weight to it; but that's it. If you are looking for something without spark then this is for you; however if you want something that sparkles and brings a smile to your face, then go with something else. Remember you get what you pay for.",

The ad shows list price of $1,659 and price of $495. So sale price of $199 appears to be too good to be true for AAA Akoya pearls and list price is just an inflated marketing ploy. Another reviewer of similar pearls from seller said cert. of authenticity done by seller instead of independent appraiser so lowered rating by one star. But l am on tight budget and still feel like l got a good deal for good quality pearl necklace.",
