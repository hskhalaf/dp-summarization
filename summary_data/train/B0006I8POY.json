      "text": "My 6 year old decided he would ask Santa for a model battleship to build for Christmas which was odd and I really read reviews looking for a simple one and this seemed to be as easy as I was going to find. I figured it would be a project for him to do with his grandfather, to my surprise, he did most of it himself. It came out great, like some previous reviews a read when I got it, some of the bigger pieces are a little warped but we made it work. Overall it was great!",

No propellers at all, and the single large rudder is incorrect. The Curtiss Seahawk aircraft are badly sculpted. Okay as a ship kit for newer young modelers. I first built it some 50 years ago as a kid. Nothing has changed, except the historical data sheet added for the USS Missouri. It is a good stepping stone for young modelers, on their way to buildong better models.",

Basically, all the parts are very small, so you have to be very careful not to break the delicate plastics. The ship model length is approximately twenty inches long, and the detail of the kit is extremely basic; thus if you want further details I would recommend to buy the 1/350 scale from other manufacturers such as Taniya. I hope in the future Revell will develop a bigger model kit of this historical battleship as the Trumpeter has recently released a 1/200 USS Missouri. When I have the budget, I'll definitely purchase the 1/200 one.",

I wouldn't purchase this product again but model kits are not my cup of tea .",

He wanted a model, as pictured, because he was in the So. Pacific and saw the Missouri up close. He was greatly disappointed as am I, I feel I was mislead by your ad. Thelma Temple",
