I noticed about a month ago, that the black paint on the \"T\" key had worn thru and is now a blaring light. Today, one of the other keys just popped offf. It will not snap back in place. For what this case cost, $130 . . .that's $32.50 per month of use I spent. It's just not worth the price I paid. Wish I'd bought the Apple keyboard instead.",

Compared to this it was really flimsy, and had a really poor feel when typing. It also tended to try to fall backwards when in the typing position. This on the other hand, had amazing tactile typing feel and a great backlight. It also is a case, which saves more money compared to the Apple Keyboard which would also need a back case to protect the iPad. I would recommend this to anyone who needs to do serious typing on their iPad Pro.",

I would say that a disadvantage is that because it magnetically connects to the Smart Connector, there are limited angles you can type with the keyboard, and I do have minor software problems once every few weeks (though it is fixed simply by restarting the iPad). Definitely recommend for those on the fence about it!",

For future iterations of this, Logitech should consider a more durable resin or reinforce the thin spots or some similar change.

However you can fold it a different way with the back of iPad over the keyboard. This works better but back of iPad will slide around on top of keyboard.

My case also has one button that is not backlit like it should be (the right arrow key). But other than those two small oddities/drawbacks, this case was exactly what I was looking for.",

It wasn\u2019t until I found this keyboard that I realized the 9.7\u201d iPad had a power adapter and could do the same thing as its larger sibling. Connected easily right out of the box and after about 15 seconds of the iPad automatically downloading the driver, the keyboard lit up and I was typing away. Nice product and not cheap junk like some other keyboards I\u2019ve used. Good keyboard feel and very responsive. Worth the money!",

Logitech solves this issue with a direct keyboard to pin solid connection. The included cover makes adjusting the volume via the buttons easier as well.

It is now April and past Amazon return period. Logitech will only replace with a standard keyboard, not a case, and not back lit. Logitech customer support has requested the same information multiple times, photos, receipts, etc. This is my 2nd Logitech product that has broken and is not replaceable, first was a Logitech remote from Best Buy, it immediately broke and Best Buy nor Logitech warrant universal remotes. I will never buy any product made by Logitech again.",
