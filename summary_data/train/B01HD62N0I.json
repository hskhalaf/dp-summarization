      "verdict": "The Salomon Speedcross 4 is something hordes of fans of the line will be very familiar with. There is still that insane traction on almost all surfaces, but with the added durability in the outsole to match its performance. It is quite light and nimble and comes in a variety of colors that will suit the fashion tastes of just about everyone. The running shoe excels on steep inclines, grass, loose gravel, and almost any slippery surfaces.",
      "pros": [
        "A good number of trail runners and hikers find the Salomon Speedcross 4 to be very comfortable",
        "The traction is a monster on mud, snow, and even in wet conditions, according to a majority of the reviews",
        "It has decent ground feedback, based on the observations of several users",
        "The price is considered by many as well worth the performance and durability",
        "The Quicklace system makes cinching easy and very convenient",
        "The anti-debris mesh readily wards off dirt and trail debris",
        "A handful noted that the outsole of the 4th version of the Speedcross is significantly more durable than the earlier version",
        "Some runners welcomed the more rounded toe box for improved comfort and toe splay",
        "A large number of runners praised the Endofit inner sleeve as it wraps the foot in comfort while the Sensifit overlays provide support and improved precision where fit goes",
        "More than a couple of wear testers were amazed by the responsiveness and nimble ride for such a burly shoe"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "The high stack height and prominent lugs may cause some issues on uneven and rugged terrains",
        "A handful remarked that it does not dry as quickly as they would want it to",
        "Breathability is a bit hampered by the anti-debris mesh, according to a few",
        "Some runners also mentioned that it is a bit smaller and narrower than the past version"

      "text": "These were my first pair of Salomon shoes, I bought them as I was about to do a Tough Mudder race. They were perfect! I went running in them before the race and they were perfect, and during the Tough Mudder they gave me such an advantage over everyone running in normal trainers. They give you so much grip, it's almost impossible to slide about while running on mud. As expected I needed to clean them after the race and they cleaned very easily and are almost brand new again. I'd highly recommend these for running off road/trail.",

I think the new lug pattern, though not that different to the 3, is good. It still grips to a range of surfaces well. I do love the lace garage and quick lace system. All in all I will miss the fit of the speedcross 3 but these will make a fine replacement.",
