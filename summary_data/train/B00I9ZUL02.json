      "title": "Works great for flea control with no \"burn\" on the cat where applied",
      "text": "In the past, we have tried various solutions to control the occasional flea that finds a home on our house cat. Several have actually burned the skin and left a scab. We tried this one, this season, with four monthly applications so far, and no burn issues. Very easy to apply. Do note that instructions do state to apply higher than between the shoulder blades, to apply at the base of the skull. That we did, and no issues. Appears to have a 24 hours full dry time, so if you pet your kitty during that time, avoid the area where applied, or you will have the smell on your hands.",

I can't describe how relieved we were when it worked and worked well. Local flea populations have become completely immune to established topical flea products; Cheristin is the only thing that stopped the mounting infestation and stopped it definitively.

When we would use other brands, they would make most of the fleas gone on the cats but then they would jump off and bite us. There was no sign of any fleas the next day after use. I will say the smell is...not really pleasant. It reminds me of dirt. But I will take it any day over fleas.",
