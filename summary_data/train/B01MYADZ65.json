Going from the full frame Sony to this crop sensor fuji has really sparked my passion for photography again. The lens line up is very impressive in terms of price and quality. It's a cheaper system than the Sony but with much higher usability and quality. What else could you want?",

Multi detection zones are easy to use and makes framing a shot easy too. The auto modes are plentiful and very good results can be obtained by using them without any extra settings. On the bad side some of the controls are a little close together and easy to touch by accident, menus are somewhat crowded and take a bit of getting used to. Spend the time setting up your own personal shortcuts and it really speeds up some of the manual selections.",
