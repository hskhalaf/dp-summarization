Plus you get cat woman, bat woman, and robin from the Lego movie, which I could take or leave. Its all about getting that cat woman. At the time I bought this it was like 16 bucks and the box had some damage but everything inside was perfect. I dont know what the price is now. Still a fun set.",

Catwoman's motorcycle is just an oversized beast but has some pretty unique pieces that come in this neon purple color. Each minifig is fantastic and has a great level of detail, but I'm particularly taken by Batgirl's detail from her mask down to her boots. Great value for the purchase!",
