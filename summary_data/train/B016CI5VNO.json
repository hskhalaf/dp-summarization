      "text": "Nice robe, nothing fancy but soft and very warm with big pockets. It has two belt loops at different heights so you can choose. I am 5'4\" size 8 women's, and got a S/M in this robe. It fits well, plenty big, but the sleeves are kind of short, which is OK but some may not like. It's basically like one of those soft throw blankets you see at discount stores, made into a bathrobe. So not terribly elegant but fine for everyday use. It is VERY warm, sometimes I get too hot in it, and definitely won't be using it in the warmer parts of the year.",

It fits as I expected it to and I've managed to stay warm despite taking the dog out in it every am and every night after getting ready for bed or just waking up. I'm trying to decide what my next color will be. Would love to have one of each and for the price, it's possible.",

Because of other reviewers saying that the robe ran large, I bought the S/M, when I normally would have purchased a large to insure a roomy and luxurious fit. The reviewers were right....this robe seems larger than small/medium, and it fits perfectly. The only thing I would change are side pockets (inner) instead of patch pockets, and the belt loops made smaller. The blue color is deep and gorgeous and the acrylic pile is ultra soft. The quality so far seems good, but it has not yet been washed. It is not quite so long on me as shown on the model, and I am 5'5\". Hopes this helps other potential purchasers.",

She is petite (5'2\") and so the robe goes to her ankles. On a woman of average height, it would hit mid-calf. The colors are fast and do not run. The robe is a very luxurious navy blue, warm, cuddly, and very comfortable. She is hard to please and this was the perfect gift.",
