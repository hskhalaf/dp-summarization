Little boys like the fun looking colors and enjoy wearing these crocs. Crocs is generally a very good company, and these didn't disappoint me. They lasted a few years of being constantly worn before the back part of one broke off. This is a nice pair of water shoes for little / toddler boys. They are very durable and comfortable and will hold up to active boys who wear them tons. These are also waterproof, so they can be worn for any water activities, as well as the pool or beach.",

They were only worn a few times during those few months, but one day the button fell off (the one with the logo on it that holds the strap on). I was able to reattach it, but it was never the same and would fall off at will after that. We had to put these guys in early retirement.",

My only beef with these (and ALL Crocs) is that they let in dirt, water and whatever else you walk in. And kids are definitely going to walk through the puddle, and not around. So we don't let her walk in the yard with them or on rainy days. Otherwise these are great, and hold up so well. Since they span 2 sizes, they last longer than her other shoes. And they're still in great condition to be passed down to the next sibling.",
