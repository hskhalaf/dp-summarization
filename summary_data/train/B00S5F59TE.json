My mother has Alzheimers and has stopped eating solid food, the only thing she accepts is milk and we stir in a tablet (which we pulverize and mix with a bit of warm water before stirring into milk). Unfortunately my mother will not accept Ensure or Boost or anything like that but the Survival tablet stirred into the milk works fantastic, also you can compress one tablet with 240 calories into less liquid even just 2 - 3 oz, which is more likely to be finished rather than a 8 oz of Ensure which has 220 calories.",

I hope that this is something that they can modify, because otherwise it's a great product. I have a family member with some serious gluten intolerance issues, so I chose these with that in mind, and would certainly buy again.

Note: This is truly for *emergency*. 12 tabs is 30 carbs, which is one meal for me (at 100 carbs a day). A typical male eats about 300 grams of carbohydrates a day.",

Life saver that helps me buy time to get me where I need to go while I stop hunger until I get home or a place where I can eat what I actually want. Hunger stops almost immediately after eating the tablet and lasts for around 3-4 hours if you are lying down. Around 1-2 hours if you are out and about. This would be great for an emergency situation! As tested.",
