I love that I can rest my palm on it. 3. Anker. The buttons take too much pressure, which puts strain on my hands. Otherwise great, especially for the price. 4. LB1.

This might be good for someone with large hands but if you have small hands this is not the right mouse for you trust me.",

My first finger fits perfectly while the second finger sometimes slips slightly below the right click. Overall, it is a must-have replacement for traditional mouse or for people who are not gamers.

I've been leaving it turned on since with my other wireless mice that works fine, but I'll try turning it off when not using it (when I remember!) to see if that helps prolong battery life.

My computer is about 3 feet from that part of the desk and wireless was very spotty. It would drop off a lot and cause issues. Had to use a USB extender to get the dongle closer to my keyboard, which seems like a waste so I returned and got a better wireless angled mouse.",

This may not be an issue with people with long fingers but anyone with shorter fingers is going to have issues.

One swipe on the wheel is enough to result in the web page (or app you're using) to erratically spazz up and down.

      "text": "Anker always surprises me with their quality customer service. I had an issue with my first vertical mouse and they sent a replacement immediately. The mouse itself is terrific, really, but I have very big hands and lower right pad of my hand ends up on the mouse pad with this vertical mouse. That's not going to work for this kind of device where you really need to be doing full lower arm movement to achieve its promise. It's not a flaw of the mouse itself, just the fact that no device like this will fit everyone, so I'm back to claw-gripping my other mouse.",

      "text": "I've used this mouse for a few days now and its terrible. Feels cheap overall. Left and right mouse buttons hit one another. Theres no grip to stop it from sliding. So I'm desperately gripping it tightly. The angle is just a bit off forcing me to forcing my wrist to angle out instead of inward as it natural wants to go. I wish the thumb buttons were arched for easy press instead of being just out of reach. I like ankor products but this is the worst I've purchased by them so far. The return charges 6$. While looking around this mouse looks the same as many others on Amazon and for a cheaper price.",
