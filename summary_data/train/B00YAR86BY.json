This second one, was purchased in November, so lasted a little under 7 months. Sorry, but when I spend $80 on a toothbrush, I expect a little more. In the interim 2 1/2 years between the 2 Phillips products, I had a Water Pik toothbrush which lasted the entire 2 1/2 years and did the job just as well and cost less.

Leaves a little bit of a bad taste in your mouth, but the 1 diamond brush head provided can help with that. Really like that the brush heads don't have any holes/slits that like the oral-b brush heads do, so no collecting gunk.

Perhaps Philips needs to invest more on a quality product with better quality control than just asking for a high price and substandard product.

I bought this one at twice the price to replace the bad one, and am happy to say this one is fantastic, strong pressure, clean teeth. I think Sonicare shouldn't even be offering the sub-par version, as a non- electric toothbrush would work as well or better. Shame on Sonicare, for even having crappy products in their arsenal.",

The other just recently stopped working: The motor is running, but the toothbrush head no longer vibrates to clean teeth. It's not even been a year since purchase. I didn't do anything unusual to the toothbrush, but did change the head several times. This shouldn't cause it to break, but I suspect that's what happened. Waiting to see how long the second toothbrush lasts.",
