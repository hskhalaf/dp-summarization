Also take with serpatose. I totally didn't spell that word right. But it's another supplement that works by breaking up the hard gunk in the cyst. Both are miracle products. Also tea tree oil ontop of the cyst helps alot too. Hope this helps any other woman out there that suffers with these god awful painful bumps.",
