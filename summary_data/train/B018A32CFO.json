My guess is that this fan was returned by another customer and a quality check was not performed. Not happy. My advice would be to check that all parts are accounted for before beginning installation.",

Quality of construction not as good as I am used to with Hampton Bay. On highest speed, fan rotation slow compared to Hampton Bay fans I was replacing. Installation was straight forward, though getting the light-kit on is tricky because the housing above the light-kit where all the wires are is a bit small. Fan runs quiet.
