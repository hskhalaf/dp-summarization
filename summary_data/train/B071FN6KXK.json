She loves the drawing the best, math is her second favorite, third is the tangram game.

She really loves to interact with the iPad and I must admit, while I am an electronics skeptic for little ones, I have a hard time arguing with her iPad use when she is learning tangibly.

On the numbers, he soon began subtracting/adding really fast in order get the correct answer by modifying his previous answer instead of starting all over from scratch.
