And it IS adequate for that purpose though could improve in the following ways: A head mounted sensor would enable finer control over the body mounted sensors. The Blockly language is not well featured, and could benefit from more advanced control and sensor integration; kids appreciate more freedom and power. Lego attachment points don't provide much means of accessory control. Head range of motion is the only way to move attachments independently of the body, but motion is fairly limited and set angles cannot be sustained. Some additional tweaks to software and firmware might make this much more enticing.",
