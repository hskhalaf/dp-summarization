I like it because it is relatively inexpensive but is light and performs well. This camera is made for lenses with built-in motors, so the body is light. But it accepts older Nikon lenses with some loss of functionality. It has the live view and magnification for focusing, the screen tilts and turns, and it has a 1-sec delay option to reduce mirror slap vibration. I have a remote shutter release with timer and let it shoot all night. Not the most sensitive, but you can't beat it for the money.",

There are a lot of features to help you out -- possibly more than you will need. Whatever your style and preference, I predict you will be able to customize the settings on this camera to suit and benefit you. One feature that is a big help is the self-cleaning image sensor. The 12.3 MP resolution (vs 6.1 MP on the D40), if coupled with a quality lens -- will give you amazingly detailed pictures.",

The whole thing has often left existing DSLR owners a little lost - 'why isn't there a direct replacement for my camera?' - but has undoubtedly meant there are many more attractive, accessible cameras on the market just waiting to entice first-time DSLR owners. \n\nAnd its into this maelstrom of DSLR proliferation that Nikon launches its latest baby DSLR, the D5000. The name will come as no surprise to anyone within earshot of the rumor mill but the camera itself may present some more surprises. Having confused many people but made huge ground with its simplified D40 and D60 range, it appears Nikon has again decided that simply replacing models isn't the best way to address the market. So here we have a camera that genuinely seems to sit above the D60 (rather than continuing in parallel until the stock runs out), and below the D90. Like the baby Nikons, the D5000 doesn't have an autofocus motor built into the body but does gain a tilt-and-swivel LCD, as a series of leaked images that have made their way around the internet would have you expect. \n\nThe idea of an upper-entry-level DSLR (for want of a better term), that sits below the 'enthusiast' grade D90 (with its twin control dials, big battery and pentaprism viewfinder), is hardly a radical one - the Canon 500D and Olympus E-620 seem to cater to a similar market. So what does this new Nikon have to offer either the tech-savvy first-time DSLR buyer, or the owner of an older entry-level model wanting newer features but unwilling to slavishly follow the manufacturer's 'upgrade path'? \n\nNikon D5000 Key Features  * 12.9 megapixel DX-format CMOS sensor (effective pixels: 12.3 million) \n * 2.7\" tilt and swivel LCD monitor (230,000 dots) \n * Movie capture at up to 1280 x 720 (720p) 24 fps with mono sound \n * Live View with contrast-detect AF, face detection and subject tracking \n * Image sensor cleaning (sensor shake) \n * 11 AF points (with 3D tracking) \n * IS0 200-3200 range (100-6400 expanded) \n * 4 frames per second continuous shooting (buffer: 7 RAW, 25 JPEG fine, 100 JPEG Normal) \n * Expeed image processing engine \n * Extensive in-camera retouching including raw development and straightening \n * Connector for optional GPS unit (fits on hot shoe) \n * New battery with increased capacity \n * 72 thumbnail and calendar view in playback \n\nNikon D5000 vs D60: Key Differences \n\nThe D5000 could easily be seen as a D60 with a tilting screen added, and most of a D90 stuffed into it. As such it offers quite a few feature improvements over its little brother:  * 12.3 MP CMOS sensor (D60: 10.2 MP CCD) \n * Tilt/swivel screen \n * Live View with contrast detect AF \n * Movie Mode \n * Wider ISO range \n * 11 point AF system with 3D tracking (D60: 3 point AF) \n * Control of Active D-Lighting intensity \n * Automatic correction of lateral chromatic aberration \n * Choice of JPEG quality in RAW+JPEG shooting \n * Extra retouching options \n * More scene modes \n * Faster continuous shooting \n * Bracketing \n\n>Read more at dpreview.com",
