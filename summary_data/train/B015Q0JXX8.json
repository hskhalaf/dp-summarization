Fireplace does get hot on screen. Keep little ones and pets away. To me seems very strong worth the money. Like in years to come it still be solid like is today. The backing is wood and not cardboard. The cabinets are deep but the unit doesnt sit very far off the wall. So very slim with alot room inside.",

It was a little difficult to put together, you definitely need two people. The horizontal shelves are in three small pieces, not one long one, so that increases the difficulty level with regard to getting everything lined up properly. It was a challenge getting the screws into the back of the heating unit as they are a little hard to reach. Being ambidextrous and wearing a visor light helps a great deal with this step. All in all, it's a good product for the money.",

It wasn't too difficult to put together but if you're like me and just start building without looking through the entire book, you'll be surprised to find that you build it from the bottom, up. That's right, you're building it upside down and once you're done you have to flip it right side up. So don't build in a tight area. Some of the edges didn't line up the cleanest, and one of the shelf supports cracked slightly but even so it's still pretty durable. The space heater also puts off a considerable amount of heat.

I know that I had it for a long time but I wasn't planning on replacement it works fine but and I can't find anything else like it. I will have to replace with 2 separate items to do the same as one which is a bit costly..",

The price was amazing, which is why I liked it so much. As others have said, try to have a LOT of space to put this together. It does take time, but if you give yourself some room, it will be easy. They did a great job of labeling each piece. Simple!",
