Cleaning would be much easier if the edges were not so sharp. Again must handle with care. Removal of the plate covering the coil is delicate. Must squeeze the coils to slide the plate thru. No instructions are included for setup. Overall we are happy with it but gave satisfactory rating due to the instructions, assembly and sharp edges.",
