I knocked it down one star because it's difficult to open/close and the paper has adhesive on one edge and doesn't tear cleanly. The unit does loosen up with use, making it easier to open and close. So, your kids should be able to use it independently after it has been used for a while. Until then, you'll likely have to help. The paper is about the same size as a standard square Post-It Note. The kit only comes with 25 sheets, so you'll need to add more paper soon. I plan to try replacing with a Post-It pad.",

There are some that come with it, but if you're going to be someplace for a while, or if a lot of kids will want turns, you'll want the extra post-its.",
