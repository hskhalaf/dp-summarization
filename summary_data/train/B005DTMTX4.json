This arrived quickly and in pristine condition ... carefully packaged, complete with a cloth cover for the pan. I've used it once to make custard. Turned out great BUT I realize the ceramic insert does such a good job of keeping the heat down, that it took me longer to make than I'm used to (took longer to thicken as ceramic doesn't get as hot as steel). Having said that, this is a great buy and I'm so glad I found it. Will do wonders for ensuring I don't ruin sauces by overheating. Love it. Well worth the purchase.",
