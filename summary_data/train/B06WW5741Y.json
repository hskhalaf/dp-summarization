But it wasn\u2019t clear that they needed to go together but once we figured it out everything made sense and it went together perfectly. And before you say \u201cwell that\u2019s common sense\u201d we were just trying to follow the instructions I feel like they could\u2019ve been revamped a little bit because were not dumb people and it took us a moment to figure it out.",

However, if you don't have patience to assemble furniture, let alone by yourself, think twice about purchasing this unassembled. Installing the crisscross wires underneath the table was a little tricky. I suggest screwing the bolts in ALL by hand before using the tools included to tighten them all in. It took me a little under an hour to assemble but I was pretty content in the end. I love the clean white finish of the table with the accents of wood and black wire. My 2nd biggest draw back, however, was how short it was. But, it's super cute!",

The Eiffel wireframe design makes it so you can't directly tuck chairs underneath but you know what you're signing up for given the design so again, knee bumps and all, there is no need to dock points, the table is well built and perfectly suits our needs. You'd be hard pressed to find anything like this for this price point anywhere else. A great buy.",

I have two chairs at the table and although the picture shows four, I think it would be a little crowded.",
