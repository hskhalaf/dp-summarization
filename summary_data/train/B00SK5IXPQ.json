I also always make a full pot (5 cups) as this is what the instructions state, in the past the water was plenty hot. For the price of this coffee maker it should have worked longer than just one year, I am not a happy customer at this point.",

      "text": "I bought this coffee maker based on a Cook\u2019s Illustrated review, but it has never lived up to expectations. The thermal carafe is not only awkward to use, its design prevents easy dispensing of all of the coffee in the pot - you literally have to remove the lid and turn it completely upside down to have a chance of getting that last half cup. And as for the claim that it will keep your coffee piping hot for several hours.....nope. Maybe 1/2 hour, tops. The final straw was when the unit completely failed less than 4 months after purchase - the \u201con\u201d button no longer does anything. Very disappointing.",

You have to get a towel inside the pot in order to dry it. I think the pot is made from Aluminum. When the coffee stays in the pot for I'm guessing more than 4 hours the coffee turns a nasty milky mud brown and the taste reflects the color. Keep your cheap Mr. Coffee maker. .",

It will keep the coffee at a decent temperature for an hour or so which is usually good enough for the 2.5 mugs I get out to it.",

Also, I strongly recommend that you fill the pot with hot water and then emptying before brewing. Since it does not have a \"hot\" plate you must pre-warm the thermos to guarantee you get hot coffee.

It has a couple of flaws (like an awkward pot) but that isn\u2019t really important. What is important is the quality of the coffee it produces. Be sure to use the special intermittent drip function.

I kept trying different beans and grinding my own to get the desired quality but, the coffee was still just ok. I recently had the best coffee ever at a friend\u2019s and it was brewed in a Mr. Coffee, I was shocked! I did think the carafe kept the coffee warm for the relatively short time I needed it to. I liked the fact that there was no warmer, they are typically too hot and change the coffee\u2019s flavor. Liked the feature that lets you dampen the grounds before the brewing.",

My boyfriend did some research and there was a test where they tested more thank 20 coffee makers and this one was rated the highest, so we went for it. The coffee is very flavorful and at the perfect temperature for us. I only gave 4 stars because it is a little bit inconvenient that you have to unscrew the carafe lid to place the filter part on top then place it in the machine to brew. But other than that, it's so easy to use with just one switch to brew and turn off. I like that over too many technical features. Would recommend!",

As other reviews mention (reviews that I chose to ignore), the thermal-pot traps some of the coffee so it cannot be poured -- it must be shaken out. Even with the lid removed and the pot inverted, it must be shaken to get the last of the coffee out. This is best done over the sink, so you may watch your quality joe go down the drain. What a shame, because the machine really does make a delicious brew.",

Doing a pour- over with a kid on your hip at 6am isn't my favorite thing though, so I had to get something more automatic for work days. The coffee quality is great, but as many have said you can't pour the damn carafe without the lid on it. This is especially annoying because once the lid is on the spout pours verrry slowly, annoying when you are using it to fill the machine with 25oz of water.",

It\u2019s not the biggest deal but the design basically leaves liquid in the pot when washing. Need to air dry entirely or shove a washcloth in to soak everything up.
