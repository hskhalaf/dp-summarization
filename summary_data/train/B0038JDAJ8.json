It may still very well be natural rubber and paints etc, but we're not taking any chances with it, now that it's not Made in France Kudos to Amazon for refunding the full amount without the hassle of returning it",

Thus, barely 2 months into owning Sophie, we found that my son chewed off pieces of rubber on his playpen and in his mouth. The broken pieces came off Sophie's exposed right ear and horns. The photos show the damage caused by my 10 month old son. Unfortunately, I did not return it within the 90 day time limit. Lesson learned. On the plus side, the toy is cute, easy to hold and comes in nice packaging. Unfortunately, I expected the toy to last at least 6 months.",

It was a handy little thing and my son loved teething on it and it helped with his dexterity. Fast forward to this year and wr are expecting twins so I decided to purchase another one. Originally I bought the large Sophie but I disliked it and returned it for this. I think this is a great teether!",

      "title": "Best Teether - Easier to Clean than the regular Sophie Giraffe",
      "text": "This teether does not make the squeaking noise like the regular Vulli Sophie Giraffe but the teether ring parts are great and it is so much easier to wash than the Sophie Giraffe (which requires you to cover a hole/not get water in). This teether has no holes, so won't get/hold water in it....so much easier to wash! I love this teether and now regularly buy it to include with all baby shower gifts I give.",

He can hold the handles easily and I can attach it to rings if I want to take it with us. I did put it in my mouth once to hold it and the rubber taste is not pleasant, but it has really helped my son with his teething and he doesn't seem to mind the taste. We've tried all kinds of teethers and this is a winner!",

I'd never seen the real Sophie in person and I didn't want to spend a ton of money on her, but now I wish I did. This mini one is cute, but it's TINY. And it's hard. And boring. I'll pretend that I like it just so I don't have to face my own disappointment every time my daughter shows zero interest in Mini Sophie.",
