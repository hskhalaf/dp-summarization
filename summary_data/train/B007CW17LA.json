Gave 5 stars for durability & water resistance but time will tell with these 2 ratings. On a lanai so won't be subjected to direct sun or rain. Good quality outdoor material. Would recommend based on Quality, Style & Price I paid. Large selection of colors & prints. However some options are much higher priced than what I ordered & I feel $40 for 2 is too high for size of pillow. Support isn't super firm but good for lumbar in chairs I put them on.",
