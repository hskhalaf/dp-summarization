Not a lot of innovation, but still: * A decent video quality, much better than my older one, bandwidth permitted. * Much more conveniently attaches to Laptops' screens. * Much more compact; also comes with a small, pretty hard case. * The eyelid can be closed -- and rotated vertically -- to avoid damage or dust. * Cheap (online) On the down side, Microsoft has a software, which unsurprisingly interacts well only with Messenger; it still works, of course, with others, say Skype. And their driver with mandatory software is about ~100MB and takes ages to install.",
