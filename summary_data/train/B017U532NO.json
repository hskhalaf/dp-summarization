So anything can happen once a company ships out a piece of furniture. That being said I ordered 2 of the might stands and they both came in great condition and I had no issues putting it together didn\u2019t take me long at all. Had a drink put on my music and put it together no problem did both at once it was so easy. Plus they are very nice quality and feel pretty sturdy for a flower pot or a small decor. Happy with it happy with price !",

Returned, issued a replacement 2nd one. The 2nd one arrived and came from a different Chinese factory that didn't use the same parts and was of lesser quality (example- top of the first table is printed on both sides. Top of replacement is cheaply made and only printed on one side, just plain wood on other side). Disappointing experience overall and a hassle.",

With the first one we put together, there were holes that you were supposed to thread screws into and two of the four holes did not have the metal threads inside the holes. So, the screws had nothing to attach to. We ended up having to jerry rig a solution that is not very attractive. For the second table we bought, it was missing parts needed to put it together and once again we are having to figure out how to make it work. This is unacceptable. This company needs to employ a quality control department because there obviously isn't one in place. Will not purchase this brand again.",
