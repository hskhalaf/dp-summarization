These pull-ons have put an end to nighttime accidents and are so comfortable that she insists on wearing them during the day as well. Recently while waiting for a new shipment of Tranquility briefs, she had to use nighttime Depends. Besides being much less absorbent, according to Mother the Depends don't \"stay put\" nearly as well when she sits and stands. What a pleasure to eliminate one of the many frustrations of aging.",

Tear-away side seams allow for easy removal. The soft, cloth-like inside layer of the diaper is gentle against your skin.

Kufguards (inner leg cuffs) channel fluids into the core, helping to contain high volume urge episodes and bowel incontinence. Available in six sizes (X-Small, Small, Medium, Large, X-Large (XL), 2X-Large (XXL)). Blue leg elastic indicates the Premium OverNight product compared to the Premium DayTime product for all sizes except the X-Small and Small.
