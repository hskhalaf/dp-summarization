      "text": "Overall, this show is a great wet weather solution for an active life. However, it has a number of small, niggly (yet eminently fixable, were Columbia to take some time) issues: 1. The neck of the shoe flexes as the toe leaves the ground, meaning that any small stones are easily flicked into the footbed. It\u2019s a deeply annoying issue. 2. Due to the fabric mesh/rubber-coated outer, she shoe will become easily stained. Removing muddy stains from uncoated fabric is relatively straightforward, but removing said stains from the fabric covered by the rubber adornments is impossible.",

While they are comfortable enough and fit as expected I bought them as they claimed to be waterproof but after a few weeks that was not the case.

The shoes are really comfy, he says, offering good support at the front and back, and a good fit round the toes. The sole is also very cushioned and has plenty of grip. The shoe has a waterproof-breathable, seam-sealed construction, meaning no water gets inside. This makes them great for hiking. The shoes are also extremely lightweight, with a mesh upper that stops your feet getting sweaty.",

The colours are a little jazzy for my tastes but overall they're decent enough.",
