The remote ads a nice touch being able to click on Netflix, hulu, and Amazon Prime right away. All In all, I am extremely pleased, and would highly recommend to anyone looking to upgrade.

In the set up if you have cable you can assign it and your remote that came with the tv will work the cable box. I just wished the alexa part could change the channel. overall it is a great tv",
