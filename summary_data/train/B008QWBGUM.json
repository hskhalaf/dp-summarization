Very sturdy and made out of good material it really doesn\u2019t feel cheap at all. I also put my lunch box which is small into it. Looks nice and holds up to the quality of dickies products. Def a must buy for students or people traveling and working.",

      "text": "It's a slightly different material than what I was expecting (i wanted something i could put patches and pins on, but iron on patches won't adhere to this material), and the straps keep coming undone (slipping through the plastic at the bottom of the strap), but it is very pretty. I'm probably going to have to see if the manufacturer or extra warranty covers the strap thing but i do really like the backpack other than the fact that it's hard to wear with the straps constantly coming undone. I didn't see anyone else complain of this though, so it's probably (unfortunately for me) just an isolated incident.",
