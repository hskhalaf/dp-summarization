Pros: Nice design/color Quality Zipper Decent Size Cons: The inside fabric liner of this sleeping bag is terrible. The fabric is rough and it's also used on the exterior of the sleeping bag (near the opening as a decorative liner). I used this camping over the weekend and unfortunately the area I was camping at had a lot of weed sticker burrs. The burrs would get stuck on my dogs, they would walk on the sleeping bag and it got stuck all over the liner fabric. I spent an hour each day trying to remove it from the fabric.",

She needed a warmer and longer sleeping bag than the sleeping bags offered for little kids. This works great for her, keeps her warm and will be great if she ever goes camping. It is easy to roll up and store; although it is a little challenging for her to do it. The coloring in the picture shoes a very light grey interior; I would say it is a bit darker grey than the picture shows, other than that it is a great sleeping bag for the price!",

Fiberlock construction prevents insulation from shifting to keep you warm and increase durability, while the Thermolock draft tube along the length of the zipper prevents heat loss. Roll Control fasteners lock the bag in place for easier rolling when it's time to pack up, and the QuickCord no-tie closure keeps everything cinched tight.
