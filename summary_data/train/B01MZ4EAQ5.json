I see these for $99+ all the time on other sites or in the retail stores (if you can ever find them). The material is extremely well made. It's warm and the fit is perfect. I am 5' 8\", 150lbs and this just right for me. The design is unique and I get a lot of compliments/questions about it.",

It filled my mid layer need perfectly, as worn with 180 Merino base, and shell. I run hot and had to ditch my primaloft lightweight mid for a wool sweater, which worked but was a bit bulky. I can recommend this product.",
