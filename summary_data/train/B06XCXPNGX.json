The case the set come in is also exceptional and would be excellent if the intent is as a gift. The glasses are perfect in size to hold a 21\u20442\" ice ball if so desired and and are quite heavy /robust. The decanter and the stopper are very clear and as robust as the glasses with this set. For the price this is a very good deal and needs to be considered if one is looking for a high quality crystal decanter for spirits (Bourbon in my case).",

There is obviously some thought put into the packaging to make sure it all comes in one piece. It also was delivered pretty quickly after ordering. I would definitely order from this company again in the future and would recommend this decanter if you are looking. It is heavy glass, which I am pleased with, and it seems it will last.",
