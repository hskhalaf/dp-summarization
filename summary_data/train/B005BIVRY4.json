Although these are consistently sized, go by the list European sizes because the US sizes do not correspond to other manufacturers. For example, I normally wear a US size 8-1/2, but the European size 41 that fits me perfectly is supposedly a US size 7-1/2.",

I have been wearing Ecco World Class for six years and no one makes a better golf shoe (IMO). The Ecco Lux is about a half size bigger than their World Class shoe.",

But I tried that and they were way to big. After reading some reviews I went with EU size 41. Fit is perfect. I like them so much I purchase a pair of white ones too. They are wider than most golf shoes I have purchased so the heel slides a bit if I don't wear thicker socks.",

Amazon is the best.......",
