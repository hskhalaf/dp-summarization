The rubber connected at the toe started to peel back a bit after a couple weeks, the heels broke down very quickly (I will admit that I tend to slip on my shoes and this definitely breaks down the heels faster, but these performed worse compared to other shoes I have done that to), and the mesh got some small holes where it meets the rubber. Not a horrible shoe, but ASIC definitely makes better products than this.",

I purchased a pair of these for $39.99 from an Amazon Fulfilled seller (6pm LLC which is one of their main shoe sellers). Great fit (I always get running shoes a half size up from dress shoes). Comfortable for long periods of walking. Great also for running - they are pretty low profile soles so they are a more 'minimalist' style than most Asics (these guys love huge, padded, foamy soles).

While I love the fit of these shoes, the soles feel firm and don't give nearly as much cushioning as the Excel33. My old man knees ache a bit when wearing these, but not with my previous Asics.
