      "text": "I'm not sure why this product gets such great reviews. Seems more efforts are put into fancy packaging than into the function of the knife. I find it very difficult to cut crusty artisan breads. The knife bounces around on the crust and is therefore dangerous. I've used very inexpensive bread knives that did a better job, and plan to return to them. Customer service was very responsive to an initial contact, and automatically sent an unrequited replacement. Now I have two knives I don't want to use, and would want to give to anyone I know.",

Hurry up, go buy them. This one is super sharp and cuts really smoothly. I use it for bread (obviously) but also for Tofu. If you cut through the Tofu with a slight sawing motion until you're halfway through, then saw in the other direction, it leaves PERFECT marks that look like muscle layers in fish. I mean, it isn't really that important for the tofu to have these but it does make for some pretty presentation when it is cooked up. I love these knives.",

I really wanted to live this knife. I just don\u2019t. I\u2019m disappointed I wasted my money. Also, the wood on handle doesn\u2019t feel nice and smooth.

Included in the box are little extras: a cleaning cloth, an instruction booklet, and a key chain with the Dalstrong logo. It is obvious that considerable thought and care has been given to the product and its presentation. This knife and all that comes with it bespeaks quality.
