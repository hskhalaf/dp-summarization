It mixes super easy with water, and it makes for a super yummy treat if mixed with Almond Milk (unsweetened) and a tbs of almond butter. That\u2019s dessert right there! I love it in my oatmeal in the mornings too! The thing is, it can be used as a full in meal replacement. It keeps your body going through the toughest workouts and there are absolutely NO bloating or digestive side effects. I am in love!",

      "text": "Wow they managed to make a protein powder that tastes great and isn\u2019t insanely expensive! No chalky texture is a huge plus! Very impressed and will purchase again. Side note: the serving scoop is VERY large. Larger than I\u2019ve ever seen in any protein powder. Basically, it\u2019s a large serving. Not negative but an interesting difference compared to other brands.",

I use an appetite control chew with it and drink lots of water. When I do eat, i eat fruits and veggies and the occasional chicken or fish. I'll update in a month or two with results",

With TrueFit, I'm drinking this shake down like it's chocolate milk as it's so smooth with no lumps after mixing it well. I'm sold and will be purchasing more when I run out of my first supply.",
