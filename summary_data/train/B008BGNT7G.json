      "text": "We originally bought the Summer Infant potty that looks like a mini toilet -- so cute and my son loves the flushing noise, BUT the opening just isn't big enough for him to do his business without making a mess. And the splash guard for boys always falls into the potty while he's using it (gross). We just bough the Joovy Loo and the opening is much bigger -- just wish it looked the same as the Summer Infant and made cue flushing sounds... that said, still 5-stars do to the size, modern design, easy cleaning and overall functionality. (But seriously Joovy, please add a flush handle :)",

After opening it and having my daughter sit on it and with her wiggly bottom on it, I can say that it's very sturdy, the shape of it makes it so that it's steady and also there's a weight to it that makes it stay down. Obviously if you tip it over it will probably tip with some pressure, but to me it's very stable and we like it thus far.",

Her feet dont quite touch the floor but I sit in front of her and she can put her feet on my leg. Easy to pack around. Did I say easy to clean????

Also the bottom had a nonslip grip and it doesn't budge. I think we'll be ordering a second for sitters home. Joovy hasn't disappointed in any of their items we've purchased.",

We understand that teaching your child to go is your number one priority, but cleaning up afterwards is a very close second. This is why the loo has a completely sealed inner bowl and has been designed with only two parts that fit cleanly together with no nooks or crannies for spill overs to get trapped. The loo's bright white color and ultra smooth finish ensures clean up is a snap. Its non slip base offers stability during use and the integrated splash shield prevents spills. The large capacity bowl has plenty of fill space and is easy to lift out and empty with our no touch grab handle. The loo was designed in America at a world renowned industrial design university and uses smooth ergonomic forms to ideally fit your child without limiting their comfort. The design is simple and uncomplicated so you and your child can focus on the task at hand. Joovy feels that potty time is serious business. Our sensible design focuses on reinforcing the ultimate transition to an adult seat and makes sure that clean up is easy.",
