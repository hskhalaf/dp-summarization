This thing is so warped, that is impossible. Also, the LEDs are a joke. They somehow manage to be both blinding, and too dim to do any good. Do not recommend.",

The mirror is somewhat warped, so your reflection is a bit distorted the closer you get to the edges, but it's sufficient for the job. The only real complaint I have is the light, which is next to useless. It illuminates the surface, meaning it doesn't shine outward to light up your face.

Every other mirror that I've seen will ultimately lose it's fog proof coating and then you have to replace the mirror. This was designed with a great solution for mounting and the engineering behind keeping the mirror fogproof is great! The included squeegee is handy as well.

      "text": "Great Product. I would like to suggest 2 simple changes to the manufacture. 1. Place a small pin hole on the bottom so the water will drip out very slowly. Will prevent you from dumping it after every use. 2. Put a timer on the led light. Will save batteries for the people like me that forget to turn it off. I would suggest this mirror to anyone I know though. Love it! I use it every day! Works like it should. I would upgrade my review to 5 starts if it had the upgrades I listed above. If you thinking about buying this product. Its worth every penny! Hope this review helps!!",

Others required constant re-application of non fogging sprays to get them to remain functional. Other's are small and impossible to see your entire face. This product provides a solution to all of those problems! I fill it with hot water from my shower head in about 5 seconds, place it on its mount and turn on the light. I get the most comfortable shave ever right in the shower...no separate mess. Do yourself a favor and buy this mirror!!",

For me, in a relatively dark shower, the LEDs illuminate my face only when I get about 2 inches or less from the mirror. Any farther back, and they simply glare in my eyes, causing my pupils to contract, making my reflection appear darker! Also, the light is a very cold, harsh white. The only way a person would get a reflection as shown in the illustrating photo is to be in an already brightly lit room, thus negating the need for the LEDs.",

The best I can describe it is looking into a very shiny surface... you see your reflection, but not nearly good enough to accurately shave. I had already installed it so I decided to not go through the trouble of taking it down... but less than 2 months later, it fell down on its own and broke into several pieces. Oh well... $40 wasted. I\u2019 m writing this review so you can keep your $40... hopefully this saves you from some frustration.",

Lastly, I sticked it to my bathroom shower tiles and it is currently sticking up very well and firm. Overall I am really contempt and satisfied.",

As now the lighting in our new bath room is not directly from the shower unit, this mirror is really nice with the added lighting and bigger mirror surface. The fogfree feature works great too. My husband is very happy to receive and use it and had commented on one improvement that this can have to make it perfect: In his old fogless mirror, in the unit for the warm water, it has a hole so that after shower the water can slowly leak out if you forget to empty the water before you end shower, so that next time you don't have to splash cold water out.",
