One big problem is that Fitbit Flex 2 does not pair with the Samsung Galaxy S9. This is a known issue and Fitbit tech team has no projected fix posted in their online users forum. In fact they declare the issue resolved. I guess that means they've resolved not to establish the ability to pair this device with your S9 Android OS phone.

I discussed this issue with FitBit, and they kindly sent me a replacement. However, the replacement never vibrated.
