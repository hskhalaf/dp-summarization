      "text": "I really like these earphones. They fit onto the ear, rather than inside as earbuds do. They do take bit of getting used to, with a bit of judicious jiggling to get them in the right place, but once you've found the spot they feel comfortable and sound great. They have a pretty unusual modern / arty / industrial look to them which you'll either love or hate - I love them. And at a knock down price to boot!",

Would like me to see the person who\u2019ve actually could wear them, reckon the bums was about 12 mm in dia. Would have been better with much smaller bus and foam pads to increase the if needed that. As for sound and comfort I am only guessing as they should be spot on for B&A",

My biggest complaint however, is that they appear only to support the old SBC codec, which is not the best for audio quality or latency, since newer bluetooth devices support AAC, or AptX, even AptX-LL (for Low Latency)... so the audio quality is probably not the best that Bluetooth can offer.",
