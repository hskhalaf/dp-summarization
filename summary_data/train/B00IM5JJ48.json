All the other reviews looked good so I was hoping the bag would be real but sadly it is not and you cannot return because it\u2019s sold by a separate vendor from amazon. The \u201cMichael Kors\u201d lettering on the outside is much higher than shown in the picture and the \u201cMichael kors\u201d on the zip pocket inside is in embroidered in gold instead of engraved on leather. Overall the bag appears to be decent quality but this doesn\u2019t make up for the fact that it\u2019s very expensive and not real. VERY disappointed.",
