Some of the wicker was out of place or too narrow, but we could slide it around and make it look okay. The stools are sturdy, and the cushions are comfy and velcro so they don\u2019t slide off. We needed an inexpensive bar top for our patio until we can upgrade to a custom build, and this fit the bill.",
