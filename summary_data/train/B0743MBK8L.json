The club set is light so I don't have a problem picking them up and walking around with them. Not every size club is included but quite enough to play on any course. I have a slow swing so the graphite shafts work well for me.",

I don\u2019t think it matters much for a beginner and maybe later 4 or 7 separate irons are needed : 4 thru 9. I have only used the 7/8 iron because we needed a 7 iron for class. We are practicing using the pitching wedge and putter right now. Price is great too, $199! I\u2019m glad to have a bag which covers the clubs and have club covers too. I\u2019m happy with this purchase.",
