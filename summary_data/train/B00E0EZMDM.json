They are coming apart, and for some reason, one of them had a white powder coat of paint on the surface that has gradually come off and covered the bean bags in residue. Also, the bags are falling apart. One of them had to be sewed back up within the first two weeks of use. The one cool aspect about this set is the velcro that allows the two boards to stay together with the bags inside. It makes it nice for storage and transportation. Recommend spending a bit more and get a better quality version, or just make your own (which is what we are going to do)",

The bags appeared to be decent (they didn't break after 4 games), but each time we threw, a poof of white dust came out of the bags when they landed on the board. Returned them.",
