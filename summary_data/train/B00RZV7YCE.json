Few features worth noting: (1) the zippers are really quality; (2) the extra top zip-pouch is extremely convenient for stashing phone, boarding pass, wallet, etc. It even has a mini-pouch within the pouch, and a clip for keys! (3) Finally, the rolled up size is crazy-small! I included a pic next to an iPhone 7 (NOT plus) so you can see. I almost bought the Sea to Summit one, but I\u2019m glad I went with Osprey.",

I bought this backpack because on EasyJet you cannot bring a personal item in addition to a carryon bag, so whatever daypack I bring has to fit inside my carryon backpack. With that said, this is ideal for that situation because it weighs about an ounce and folds up into a small pouch that is actually an interior pocket in the bag. Cons, the material is very transparent and you can see exactly what is inside the bag when you are looking at it.",

Packs extremely small, fits jackets, towels, cameras and everything needed for a day out. The little packable pouch serves as a 3rd closeable pocket inside the 2nd pocket. Good for feeling a little more secure in areas you're worried about sneaky pick pockets. Only small downside is the thin shoulder straps. I have two messed up collar bones so it was even more uncomfortable but a full day of carrying it around full of camera gear and souvenirs really cuts into the shoulders.",

The thing I don't understand is why didn't Osprey put an identical water bottle holder on the opposite side from the existing one. Sure, it would add just a little bit of more weight and bulk, but it would be small. But the benefits of this additional water bottle holder would be to balance out the pack, and it's useful for other items like an umbrella, keys, etc. Great pack otherwise.",

Also, there is minimal organization/compartments, but it works great as a day bag or stuff bag when I am traveling. The bag material itself should definitely last (within reason), no concerns there. Again, this bag is designed to be super portable, if you need something with more structure, support, or organization then look elsewhere.",

I kept it squared away in my cargo pocket and when the time came all I had to do was take it out of its own bag and fill it with stuff!",

I've used it for lots of day trips where before I used bigger and heavier packs.",

The side pocket to hold a water bottle worked well as did the small zipper compartment. I was impressed.",

Extra zippered pocket at top was great for easy retrieval of small items. One more outer zipper pocket/pouch would be great to separate additional items needing quick access to. Water bottle pocket is not so great. It was easy to reach to the water bottle without removing pack but bottles fell out easily when removing pack. Especially larger 1 liter bottles. Pack stuffs down really small for packing. If I could not find another pack like this wit hthe additional pocket and better water bottle holder I would buy this again.",

Great to attach to my pack to keep trash or extra snacks. So lightweight!!",

It is vulnerable to even routine travel experiences in an urban setting. Too bad, because it is otherwise quite comfortable and ergonomic. I would recommend this bag for only light use.",
