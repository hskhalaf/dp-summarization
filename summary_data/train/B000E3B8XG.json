I was using smaller trays this year with humidity domes to reduce the amount of watering I had to do. But when I water I spray the whole system down, sometimes even the thermostat gets a rinse. I used half the mat to heat seeds and the other half to keep the seedlings warm while I started another batch of seeds. The only problem with a mat this large is if you want to run two different temperatures you are talking about a lot of space.",

Hydro farms sells theirs for about $34, pretty pricey. You can use a plug in lamp dimmers such as the Lutron ones found here on Amazon for about $9. They are 300 watt rated which is way more than sufficient. Nice product but save some $$ and get your own regulator.",
