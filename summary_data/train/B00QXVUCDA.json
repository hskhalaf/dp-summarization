Both adults and kids can grip this well. YouTube has some good videos for beginners. I don't think I would recommend for little tikes.

    "description": "If you\u2019re looking for the BEST bamboo kendama on the market, buy the Kotaro Kendama brand. Made of laminated bamboo parts, Kotaro Kendamas are designed for high level kendama play. \n\nWith enough practice, you\u2019ll be doing all your favorite tricks like Oozara (big cup), Kozara (small cup), Chuuzara (base cup) and Rousoku (candle). Use grips like the Sara (or Pen) Grip, the Ken Grip, the Tama Grip or the Rousoku Grip. \n\nThe deluxe Kotaro Kendama model comes with a bamboo ball (the tama or dama), a pre-strung length of string, and the Ken, or handle with three cups. Also comes with one extra string! They were historically a Japanese skill toy. \n\nImprove your hand eye coordination, speed up your reflexes and improve your balancing techniques. As you learn how to use the kendama better and better, you\u2019ll build skills like patience and focus and enter the magical state of flow. Named After Fuma Kotaro, the Japanese ninja. Some people mistakenly call them cadoma, cadama, kentama, kandamas, kindamas and kondoma or kondomas. \n\nWhat else makes the Kotaro Kendama better? \n\nBamboo seems like wood, but it\u2019s actually a grass! It grows back extremely quickly, so it\u2019s very sustainable. \n\nManufactured in Asia by a toy company that has been in business making bamboo and wooden toys for 14 years. \n\nExtremely sweet looking and stable handle. Nice, deep and perfectly angled cups. \n\nLaser engraved logo. \n\nAges 12 and up.",
