I make several kinds of chocolate dipped foods during the holidays...pretzels, etc. the smaller melters were such a hassle and I kept having to stop dipping to melt more chocolate. This melter holds at least 2, 8oz bags of chocolate and melts it quickly. Clean up is a breeze. It\u2019s a real time saver and I\u2019m really happy with it. I may not use it often, but when I do it really does the trick.",

Guests loved it & It was easy to clean up. Holds approx 2 8oz bags of chips + a bit of cream mixed in. The only complaint I have with it is there is no top. This could be purposeful for an unknown reason, but I thought it would stay warmer & look nicer on the counter when using if it had one. Would recommend & I bet kids would love it :) (would also like to know if it is OK to melt cheese.... going to try it)",

I wanted a small warming pot that could stay plugged in on the table to serve chili con queso and keep it warm. This worked well but would have been PERFECT if it had a lid. That way it would have stayed warm without having to be reheated from time to time. I like the non breakable insert; it cleans up very easily and the whole thing is small enough to store away without taking up much room.",
