Finally, get all of the intensity of a liquid eyeliner, without any of the running, smudging, or raccoon-eye effect associated with traditional pencil waterliners. Lash Liner glides on and quickly dries down for all-day performance. Lash Liner\u2019s Hybrid Fluid-Gel formula contains clay binding ingredients for a richer texture than a standard liquid liner. This unique formulation is designed to stand up to watery eyes. This super-pigmented formula will set in as little as 15 seconds for transfer-resistant, long wear. Lash Liner\u2019s soft-tip applicator is custom designed to hold the perfect amount of formula, so you can instantly intensify any eye look with extreme precision and ease.",
