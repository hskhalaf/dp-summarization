I was so impressed with the convenience and light weight of the smaller version of this lock, that I purchased the 880 model with great confidence. My bike was stolen the second day I used this lock. I am positive that I locked it properly. The bike rack it was locked to was intact. I have no explanations. All I can say is that for New York, get the hardened chain with heavy mini lock like those by Kryptonite or OnGuard. At the very least a combination of strong mini U-locks.",

Bike theft is pretty high where we live, hoping this chain will do the job. As of now it is working out great, the length is perfect and we were not concerned with weight of the chain since he uses the bike for short rides around the island and getting to work.",

It's lighter in weight than the other competitors but still very strong and sturdy. This is a plus when you have to throw it in your backpack on your trip. The sleeve stays in place too so it doesn't scratch up your bike. Overall it's a really great chain with a level 8 security rating.",

The locking mechanism is high quality and smooth to operate this has replaced a kryptonite chain( same size ) which the lock was vey poor quality, sticky, impossible to open and close, even with a lot of patience and care.
