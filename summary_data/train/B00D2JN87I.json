UPDATE- I just changed the batteries on this because it\u2019s 2 AA and if course you have to buy them because they are the most common and I don\u2019t have them in hand...for 35$ I would think it would have better batteries...change the batteries and NOTHING. I\u2019m SO annoyed because we ordered this for our road trip tomorrow...babies first trip and now this of course doesn\u2019t work. Don\u2019t waste your money! It\u2019s tiny and doesn\u2019t play very loud. It\u2019s over priced and over hyped. Will NOT recommend.",

So in a the wee hours of the morning, a desperate, sleep deprived mom orderer this and has been using it ever since. I usually try to only use it at bed time so they associate the sound with bed time. It really helps my girls calm down and fall asleep. I love it!!!",

My only complaint, more of a wish maybe, is that it had a continuous mode, rather than a 30 minute shut off. I'd pay good money for one that didn't stop abruptly. I've gotten remarkably good at reseting it right before the 30 minute mark, but night time would be better if it would just keep going.",

Shushing is by far the best noise to help a baby sleep but it needs to be able to go louder when you have a crying baby that any one who has been around kids would know babies are LOUD.

The speaker is located on the bottom so it's not very audible when you orientate and place it on what you'd think to be its base. 3.)

Its shape makes it prone to rolling and easy to fall off things. We went through two before giving up on buying more since they arent exactly cheap.

I do have two items for feedback. 1) I wished there was more timer options. It only has a 15 and 30 min option but a 1, 2, or indefinite options would make this 5 stars. 2) It would be nice to have a flat spot on the top so that the top can be stood up so that the speaker fires up. Today the speaker side is flat and to stand it up the speaker would be face down and gets very muffled.",

It's like something broke and it does quick 1 second shush's instead of the long 5-6 second shushes. It's pretty useless now. I use my phone for shushing. Also, the only way to sit this down without it rolling around is on the speaker, which doesn't make much sense. I can't turn this own sit it on the couch without it rolling off. Maybe rethink the design to where you can put the shusher down while it's shushing. Send me a replacement, thanks!",
