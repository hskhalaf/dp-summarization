The bold holding the cot together collapsed underneath my 3 year old child. My son is a small 33 pound child, who slept on the cot no more than 5 days in a one year period. The product was defective, and regalo would not replace or refund the product. Really poor customer service here... won't be purchasing from them again!",

Not a big deal, I decided to order a new one from amazon but this time in pink. It'seems awful. The middle part is highly then the rest of the cot. Not only is it very uncomfortable but I would think it would mess up my daughter'so back eventually, and I am definitely not going to let it happen. Returning it right away and seeing if I can find a blue at Walmart again. If not, they I will be looking for another brand.",

It must be rather comfy, I'm also having a hard time keeping my lab off of it. which is why I intend to buy a second one Thankfully it came with an easily removable and easily washable sheet. Seems to be made to last. So far I have no complaints.",

My daughter has brought these for the kids to sleep in when they are staying in motels, camping, visiting relatives and friends overnight. We got a water proof pad and toddler bed sheets, which are very nice because the bottom sheet has elastic all around, and the top sheet is \"fitted\" on the bottom, so the sheets stay on the cot.",

Folds up small and is easy to pack away. I did fold up a bulky blanket on top of it to make it more cushy for her, but it probably wasn't needed.",

I put a twin side comforter, folded in thirds, on top of it for some cushion and comfort. She loves it! The instructions say no standing on it, so I have to keep reminding her not too. Although, the cot seems stable enough for her weight to not tip over (29 lbs).",

The sheet ripped pretty soon after purchase, but a regular crib sheet works pretty well, and is probably a little softer. This could probably even be an awesome,dog bed once she gets too big for it.",
