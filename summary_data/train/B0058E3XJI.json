It has a nice brown tone, NO orange at all which is great for someone so pale like myself! And it has a pleasant smell! Make sure you leave it on for 3+ hours after you tan before taking a shower tho!",

If you are someone who tans multiple times per week, I can see how it would appear as if you were darker. Once the bronzer is washed away, I have the same level of tan as I did with a drugstore lotion.

The first go round I didn\u2019t know you had to rub it in so I got white and tan patches everywhere! No big deal lol But my second third time tanning I made sureTo apply it properly and you can\u2019t even tell that I made the mistake the first time because it\u2019s all even now it does leave stains on your hands if you\u2019re not able to wash them immediately. All in all this product is pretty awesome smells amazing that works great!",

Make sure to rub it in all the way and you wont have that problem. It gave my skin that nice extra bronze boost without being obvious or orange. I would recommend this accelerator to anyone.",

I am already able to see a significant difference. I am as dark as if I had been in the sun all summer. I will be purchasing again in the future.",

My only complaint is the bronzer does get streaky and splotchy if you don\u2019t rub it in enough so be careful. It also tends to look a little orange so i prefer to alternate between this lotion and a non-bronzer lotion to make it look more natural and less like a spray tan. It smells like every generic tanning lotion, nothing special or bad either. I probably will try a different lotion for my next purchase but this one is good for now.",

I do not recommend using if you have an event within 1-3 days in case you do not apply evenly.

First off it smells really good which is a plus, and it moisturizes your skin when you put it on. I lathered it all over myself and in about 30 mins I managed to get 5 shades darker. I would definitely recommend reapplying if you decide to go in the water because it does come off.",

However I have to say I did not have any bronzer stains or streaks on me or clothes. So only thing is you have to keep topping up your tan to keep the bronzers even. I personally would not buy this again and will stick to products to use in the tanning bed that are bronzer free.",
