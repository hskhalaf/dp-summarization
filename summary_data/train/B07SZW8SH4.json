I tried reaching Cobra but due to COVID they state on their website \"No refunds and no exchanges\"! False alarms are getting more frequent and the sound for the alarms are getting tinny/ crackly as if the speaker is starting to break. I can live with that problem, but how can I use the device without it being mounted on the windshield?! Customer support is Horrible. Good thing I made the purchase using a credit card that protects me in those situations.",

I've never been able to detect a laser radar gun with it. Display is nice. Cant recommend since half of the features do not work.",

It has a very handy button on the cigarette lighter plug along with and additional usb outlet. You can easily mute and mark to block false signals. Went on a long road trip and it saved me a few times! Had an older Cobra before and it was constantly going off. This one has the gps built in and can easily mark false signals and quiet them automatically. Love it and will definitely be looking for a future upgraded model!",

The unit has true 360 degree detection, and picks up the signal before any meaningful data is available to the patrol; allowing you to slow down and avoid trouble. The unit is user friendly and fits in your vehicle easily. I give this unit 5 stars; and it can pay for itself with one detection.",
