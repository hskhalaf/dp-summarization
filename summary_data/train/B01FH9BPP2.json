I've got three and counting. CONS: 1) None. But if you're looking for black-tie, this ain't it. The cork gives it a casual look, but you already knew that.",

This shoe proves to be the answer to all my poorass feet's needs. No, really, seriously folks. You won't be disappointed. But take note and order a size up. I normally wear an 8.5, I ordered a 9W. It is PERFECT! Getting ready to order another in a beige or black color.",

As noted in other reviews, they do run slightly small. I wear a solid 5.5. The size 6 I ordered is a perfect fit.",

I've worn them for the last 5 hours straight and they feel like air. Sooooooo comfy and so flattering, too! Just wish they had a tan color. Def getting black now.

These wedges are fabulous in the under foot cushioning as well as pitch. I have fibromyalgia and metarsalgia and occasionally plantar fasciitis and I can wear these comfortably. The construction is excellent and the coral is a soft coral in nubuck leather. The heel offers a hook and loop closure or in other words a Velcro closure. There is nothing I'd change. Love the heel height and cork wrapped heel. Comfortable, easy elevation for not so great feet. What more could I ask for? Highly recommended!",

I got these in a size 9. They are too small. Not just a little small, but my heel slightly hangs over the back and my toes are to the edge of the shoe in front. The shoe also feels a little snug. I advise if you\u2019re going to get these, order 1 full size up.",

If you wear narrow width shoes, I recommend the regular sizes here. If you normally wear regular width, order the wide! If you normally wear wide width shoes, forget these and find a different sandal!",
