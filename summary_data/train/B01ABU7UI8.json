On the upsides, the phone has a very good built in quality. Mine has suffered a few major impacts and the screen is unsullied.

      "text": "Probably will be my first and my last Windows phone. After updates it becomes a useless slab of plastic. It would've been better with Android than a horrible Windows OS and I use Windows as my main. I expected better for \u00a3170 which is actually a disappointing price for a cheaply built device. Having an OS that fails miserably and I regret not getting a refund the moment I even turned on the phone. Either Microsoft should step up their game at a smooth OS or just quit the mobile market as it isn't even worth trying to get into. Not worth getting even more than 2 stars. Horrible phone, horrible OS and just generally horrible mobile platform.",
