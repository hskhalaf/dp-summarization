Most handheld steamers drip water everywhere so was kinda expecting this to do the same but boy, was I wrong! MIRACLE! This steamer had powerful steam coming out to do a very efficient job getting rid of the wrinkles but it DOES NOT drip (just a few drops but nothing major). I use the attached brush and worked well on my clothes. Highly recommended and definitely happy I took a chance so now now you don't! :)",

Don\u2019t think it would do a thick wedding dress very well or quickly. But for everyday clothing at home: def will do the job. See my vid",

I hung the garments, stretched them, and held the steamer 2 inches from the fabric, but still the results were not effective or even satisfactory.

It was nice they were so responsive, but it still should work for longer than a month. Bumping from a one star to four star rating because of their helpfulness! I loved this steamer until it stopped working after a month. Now the green light just blinks, it doesn't heat, and I cant return it because the return policy was only 30 days. I was truly hoping this would last, but it seems not.",

It also prevents lines/ridges from the steamer holes when you hold it against the fabric. Overall it's a great little steamer and works really good.",

Small foot print is a HUGE plus~~ The steam won't last as long as my full size, but her, there's always a trade off.

We're very happy with it and would definitely recommend it. The price is very reasonable. I would rate more than 5 stars.",

After hanging new curtains, I used this attached to an extra long extension cord and was able to easily steam curtain panels in two different rooms. The water chamber is simple to fill and reinstall. Overall, highly recommend! It seems a little bulky to take traveling but cannot speak to that personally.",

It's very quick to heat up and I like that I could use this as an iron as well. The attachments make this product stand out because I can use the attachments for different effects such as lint removal, crease removal, and dust removal. Automatic safety shut off is a big positive because it gives me the sense of mind that if I ever forgot to turn this device off, it would turn itself off. I wish it came with some sort of carrying bag though.",

With this steamer, I just plug it in and turn it on. In the time it takes me to brush my teeth, it\u2019s heated and ready to go! I just hang my garment and steam it quickly, then turn it off, unplug it, and set it where my cat can\u2019t reach. Much faster and more convenient than a traditional iron.",

When I saw this steamer, it changed my world. It heats up in no time. And the steam is \u201con demand\u201d when you pull the trigger. It sounds like it sprays water on the heat element to make steam. It is pretty compact, and would fit into a carry on bag relatively easily.",
