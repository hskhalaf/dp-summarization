It competently replaced the inexpensive but wonderful program \"Bento 4\" which Apple simply/cruelly discontinued. Imported other older dropped AppleWorks database files also. Beware that Apple does neither understands \"history\" nor a consumer's need to maintain business and personal files/records for more than 1 year. I live in constant fear that FileMaker will also suddenly disappear.",

Unbelievable! Simple databases like 1Password work fine on multiple platforms using Dropbox but not Filemaker. It seems they don't want FileMaker apps to be easily shared.",

So the learning curve really has not changed. After using both Access and Filemaker for the last decade or so it is my personal opinion that Filemaker seems a bit easier to learn to develop for. My only minor complaint is that the interface still looks a little tired. All in all this is great software though and is highly recommended.",
