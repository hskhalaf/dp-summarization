I use it in my van for winter camping and it is better than nothing, but its a far cry from being \"toasty\" warm. 5-31-17 I've used it multiple times in my van, runs off of my house battery unit. It does make it nicer when van camping on Colorado passes at 10,000+'. It's not \"hot\" but is warm. 3-3-18 Still working. I have it under the mattress cover. Still keeping us comfortable during 0 degree weather in the van. Not \u201chot\u201d or \u201ctoasty \u201c warm, but is comfortable with a good top blanket. Consumes roughly 35% of my house battery per 8 hours.",

We have a howling moon rooftop tent and we leave it the blanket up in the tent. When it's cold outside we just plug it into the outlet I ran up to the roof rack. So far so good",

I've slept in the back of my suv with this thing underneath me at a truck stop one frozen night - it was in the low 20s - and I was toasty with a down throw on top. You obviously can't leave it on all night unless you want to wake up to a dead battery but an hour is plenty anyway. I feel like most people will use this as a lap blanket on a road trip but if you're doing some van or truck sleeping this blanket is really useful.",

Just make sure you take care of it - don't let it bunch, keep it dry, don't pile things on top of it (whether it's on or not), and if you're letting kids use it, monitor how long it's on them - especially for road trips (you can unplug the blanket once the car warms up).",

I have used it for long trips and shorter trips and have had several people use it when we went out as a group. It is so nice. I would love it to have multiple settings for the heat but it is just toasty warm and that is fine. After getting in an ice cold vehicle this heats up quickly and takes the chill off. I used it when I had a terrible cold and it really helped keep me warm during the trip.",

It worked wonderfully, not too hot, warmed quickly enough, big enough to keep me warm when I sat in the car waiting. We were VERY happy with it. We brought it again this season and it is no longer working. I was going to buy it again, but I think I will try another brand.",
