It\u2019s quiet and leaves the room feeling fresh and the air cleaner. I like the option of 30 minutes or leaving on all the time. You can tell it\u2019s running by the slight ozone smell, but it\u2019s not overpowering like other units. It\u2019s also compact and the blue light lets you know it\u2019s working. I\u2019m suffering from cancer and these units help me breath the fresh air better. I highly recommend these units.",

After buying it, I did come across some articles about health concerns about using these, even when used in unoccupied rooms. The articles seemed to be based more on people running them constantly or using industrial strength machines. I am not overly concerned about using it for 30 minutes or less and letting the room air out before going back into it, per the manufacturer's instructions. I will probably err on the side of caution and not use it every day like I had originally planned, though.",

      "text": "Update from my initial one star review. After posting the review below, the company shipped me a replacement unit free of charge. It was unexpected and much appreciated. The replacement unit has worked great, and I recommend the product on its own merits and the great customer service. Bought this item in mid-March 2019. It was great, and I would've given it 5 stars, but it stopped working a week ago. Deader than dirt.",
