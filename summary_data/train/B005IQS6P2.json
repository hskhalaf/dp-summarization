Would highly recommend to anyone for light bouncing to energize your lymph system or to get your cells moving! Light enough to carry from room-to-room. Instructions say two people needed to unfold. I ended up taking to my Physical Therapist's office - 4 of us ladies couldn't do it. We asked a guy to help & even he had a little trouble before he was able to get it unfolded & locked into place. Not going to ever try to fold up <smile>!",

I know the assembly instructions insists you need two or more people to put it together but I live alone and I continued at my own risk. I assembled this rebounder alone in an hour. The only part you need concern yourself with is extending the trampoline's \"catch\". There is a concern that this part might spring and snap back while you are extending it resulting in injury or death. If you decide to assemble alone this will be up to you because the instructions insist otherwise.",

      "text": "I have had this product for less than 3 months and the straps that hold the mat over stretched and broke today. I am less than 120 lbs and that is the maximum weight that has ever been on the trampoline for normal rebounding. Although it says it can be used outdoors, I suspect it was exposure to the summer sun that rotted the straps....but in less than 3 months? Really pleased to update my review and report that Stamina products just called and were very accommodating and are replacing my mat free of charge!",
