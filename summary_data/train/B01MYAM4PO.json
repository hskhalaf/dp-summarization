These are sooooo comfortable. Ordered size 7 which is my size. Thought they were too tight ( here we go again - return) When I managed to get them on. Just stuff your feet in. Bliss - have had them on for 7 hours, standing most of time. No swelling. Hammer toes no cramp. Now have four Pairs. Different styles.",

The right shoe is half a size bigger than the left. No problem for me of course, my right foot is naturally slightly bigger than my left. The label inside the shoes are both size 3s so it was a labelling issue. I would advise anyone buying to check the shoes first to make sure they match before trying them on.",

Because I have a wide foot I tend to purchase footwear a size bigger meaning that the width is ok but the shoe is slightly longer which does not effect my walking. Due to Arthritis I decided I needed a pair of slip on shoes in order to avoid tying up shoe laces. I must say I am very happy with this purchase. These trainers are extremely light, fairly easy to put on and extremely comfortable. I definitely recommend them to anyone looking for light comfortable trainers.",

They are so soft to walk on its like wearing slippers!",
