I recommend this screen as a great solution and I also am impressed with the vendors. Rebecca has provided great customer service; had we needed assistance with our order she was there to help.

They state it can be installed in just 5 minutes, which might be true if I were an octopus but I managed to get the job completed in about 30 minutes. I would buy this product again just to see if I can install the second one in just 5 minutes. :-)",

The hook and loop seems to be of good quality and I expect the adhesive to last a while. The most impressive thing about this item is not the screen itself, but the customer service. Two magnets on my door did not close all the way so I sent a picture to the folks asking their advice. The responded that day and sent me a new screen that I received within a week. Customer service is alive and well!",

I\u2019m a competent DIY-er, but no matter how I positioned the screen, it did not snap back together consistently. In fact, most of the time it did not. The wag of a passing tail or light breeze blowing keeps the magnets far enough apart that they don\u2019t reconnect without manual help... which kinda defeats the purpose. Also, they send you exactly enough Velcro to do the job, so either install perfectly the first time, or realize that every reposition leaves a little more glue behind.",

Especially since it\u2019s starting to get nice where we are. I have no complaints about this product, when installed correctly the magnets snap back closed after exiting. But it did take a couple times to install to get this right. The tacs that this came with aren\u2019t very durable, we\u2019ve had it up about a week and one side has lost 3 or 4 tacs, we aren\u2019t rough with it at all. So definitely going to get something stronger to hold. But other than that I am happy with this purchase and would recommend it.",

Apparently they had paid attention to my complaints because the new screen was modified (or the first one was just sub-par--I'm not sure which), it fit the door very nicely, the length was shorter so there were more magnets and not as long a gap at the top, the sewing followed the seams--not perfectly, but close enough, so that there are only the very tiniest of gaps. It closes better. Good company. I'm pleased and feel that I got my money's worth.",

MAKE SURE to leave the recommended space at the bottom, because if the bottom edge touches the floor, it will drag and may not close all the way to the end. There are many small magnets all along the two edges that meet, so whichever part opens also closes quickly. And with the magnets being small, it doesn't require any effort to open--usually we just walk right through, without using our hands, and it immediately closes behind us. Great value, great quality!",

The only thing is I wish the screen was made of a more durable material, as it started ripping at the bottom seam where the magnets connect. I'm sure my dogs had a lot to do with it, but it could have lasted longer than two weeks. Regardless, we're still using our ripped screen until I can get a replacement one. :)",
