Unfortunately, one of the heel seams seemed to lay differently or to protrude where it shouldn't and ended up being too uncomfortable for him to contemplate keeping these boots. He never even got to try them outside where it was cold! I don't know if it was just this pair or if there is something different about this design, but it was not a keeper.",

The stretchy side panel doesn't extend far down and is cut quite narrow -- there doesn't seem to be enough elastic to allow the instep & upper heel to separate easily.

      "text": "Made in Vietnam, not Australia like they used to be. I owned pairs of 500s, but stopped buying them after a defective pair. The soles crumbled. I contacted Blundstone, they offered to replace them. It never received a replacement. I needed a sturdy pair of boots for work, figured I'd try them out again. They're warm alright, but the internal seams around the ankle are uncomfortable. The Vietnam manufacturing is real disappointment, I would like to support a non communist factory. It wasn't clearly stated on Amazon. They are on the bulky side vs the classic 500s",

I was disappointed to hear or should I say read about the change. My old ones were made in Tasmania but the sole fell off after several years of wear. I am hanging onto them after hearing the news about Blunnies. I did have to take out the sheep fleece insole in order for them to fit. I wear a size 5 but because of insole they were too tight.",
