This is the real deal, even if it's pricey. One of our cats was peeing outside the box every single day. The smell, the mess and endless cleaning were really stressing me out. I sprayed down the whole area with R&R, then used it regularly for a couple of days. It took the smell away and she's suddenly stopped peeing there. No pee outside the box since we started using it. I wish I'd gotten it sooner.",

I\u2019ve used a few different brands aimed at removing pet stains and smells over the years and they\u2019ve all been okay. I used this spray a couple weeks ago and really like it! I wasn\u2019t removing a stain but needed to remove a smell from a small section of my rug. The spray actually smells nice which isn\u2019t something I thought I\u2019d ever say about a product like this. It\u2019s a strong scent but after a few hours, I didn\u2019t smell it or the original offensive odor any more. I plan on repurchasing when I run out.",

It has a slight smell when you first spray it, but it doesn't last long. The pup is not going in the same places at all, its all pretty random at this point. After 4 days, she knows going outside its where to go, but sometimes she gets the order wrong....she pees, then goes to the door. Well, she is only 8 weeks old.",

      "text": "I was very optimistic about this product after reading so many wonderful reviews. I did not have anywhere close to the same results as fellow consumers. The scent from this product was so strong that it made it hard to breath when using it I\u2019m close quarters. I was fine with that If it eliminated the urine odor, it did not. It definitely decreased the smell by making it but the odor still lingered for sure. I followed directions and reapplied several times with no success. So basically my carpet still stinks and I\u2019m out $20 after finishing the entire bottle.",

I believed it to be a urine smell from the previous owners animal. the smell was particularly offensive after leaving the car in the hot sun to cook with the windows up. I applied this product and used a drill brush attachment to work it down into the fabric and cushion. It has been a week of sitting in the hot sun and i have not smelled the original putrid smell since the application. The scent of this product is pleasant and not overpowering.",

This is the only cleaner that truly gets out the stain so it\u2019s like it was never there . I love the smell it\u2019s not overpowering and doesn\u2019t smell like normal cleaners that use harsh chemicals. My only wish was that it was less expensive as I go through it quicker than I wish I did . However , Nothing works as amazing, so .. I will continue to buy forever .",

      "text": "I\u2019ve had cats for my entire life and unfortunately every now and again you get one that feels the urge to pee in the house. The smell is unmistakeable and completely overwhelming. This product is the only thing I\u2019ve ever used that completely eliminates the smell. You have to use a decent amount of it, but if you follow the steps it says to do it works like magic. I\u2019m not sure how it will work as a deterrent to them not peeing again, but it definitely worked to get the ammonia smell completely gone in one use. Would highly recommend this product.",
