But it works very well as an accent piece in an entryway or back door area and is really quite lovely when properly decorated. As other reviewers indicated, the color is definitely darker than the stock photos, but that is actually part of the reason I ordered it. It matches the dark wood furniture in the rest of the room very well.",

But, after screwing/twisting on the legs to sit the item in an upright position, I had the assistance of my adult son.

It appears to be a matter of luck whether your table will arrive damaged or not; I was lucky and it came in perfect shape. Assembly involves just screwing on the legs and takes only minutes. The table can be used with or without the bottom shelf; I like it both ways and may change the look from time to time. Shipping is expensive but it's worth it to get just the right piece.

The right end corner was bruised and Little indented, not sure though shipping or just made like that. The two doors do not level, both has spaces up or down. The paint is not polished well as the picture shows, it's more a dull finish. If looked from distance, it serves the purpose in the foyer.",

Minor and inconsequential stain difference on the back edge, that will never be seen. The wood is solid. The construction is simple. All the parts are well made and good quality.

A very nice looking piece of furniture and I liked it very much until last week (March 2015) when I discovered the front, right leg had split up the center. The item has been sitting in the same location since it was purchased and has never been moved. Now I'm concerned for its stability and it doesn't look very nice with a large crack running up the leg. It's obviously either a defective piece of furniture or made of a very inferior wood if it cracks after less than 7 months. I really think Coaster Home Furnishings should replace this item for me if they are a reputable and honest company.",

I was able to find a lovely mirror at the local HomeGoods that matched it perfectly, too. A GREAT buy. So glad I got it.",
