I absolutely LOVE it......I will even keep my purse in it and just take my purse out if I have after work drinks or dinner. Have had for over a month and have used it for 2 airplane trips and everyday office use and it still looks brand new. I will update if anything changes.",

Because if you stuff em with rocks, and carry them around for a few days, by the time you are ready for your trip, your freshly loaded backpack containing clothes, shoes, tablet, toiletries, underroos, and kitchen sink, will be soooo much lighter. Your plane ride will be a joyous occasion, like a TWA commercial from the 60s. Just be sure to clean out all the rocks, otherwise TSA may offer a curious look. Seems well made, and will update this review once I have it for six months. Wished it had better padding in the pocket area to protect the electronics.",

      "text": "Love the bag and all it\u2019s features that it offered. Bought it for a backpacking trip to Europe. Was a little disappointed when I was ready to put it on my carry on handle and there was no flap in the back as advertised and shown in the pictures to put it there. So I constantly had to keep the bag either in my hand or on my back. Had to buy luggage straps to help with this issue. Besides that, the bag is very good and holds a lot.",

      "text": "This is just about a stitch for stitch copy of a Swissgear SA1753, with an extra pocket in the middle section and a slightly different configuration at the top. That different design at the top makes a great deal of difference in the durability of the bag. I had the Swissgear bag for almost 4 years, but had a couple bits of the stitching come out early on... easily repaired. This bag has had no movement on the stitching, despite regularly carrying 4 laptops with power supplies, etc. totaling 37 lbs. The fabric has been more durable and better overall quality. It's also slightly cheaper. This is the rare case of the copy improving on the original.",

But this backpack has met all my expectations with plenty of compartments and zippers that are smooth and easy to manipulate. It's comfortable on my back while carrying my 15\" MacBook Pro along with all my gadgets and other accessories. Overall, the design, functionality, and price were very attractive to me.",
