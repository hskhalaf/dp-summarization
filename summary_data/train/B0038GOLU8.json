I got it professionally installed and it's even and looks much more expensive than I paid for it. I also swagged it off center and the chain was long enough for the project. I cut maybe 12 inches off the chain since it was very long. You're going to love it! Go for it. It's a nice dark grey color shines brownish because of the light color and the hardware is a brown color that reminds me of espresso wood which goes well with my decor. Very contemporary.",

We used 3 -100watt bulbs. the bottom \"difuser\" makes it a very pretty soft light. The shade is as dark as the picture. It has kind of a greenish/tan linen look when the lights are off with black trim. When lights are on it looks more beige. There is a seam but isn't that noticeable. The chain was plenty long, at 6 ft. Our ceilings are over 12 ft and it hangs perfectly right above the table.",

Having a swag lamp really adds to the midcentury look of a room, and this fit in nicely without smelling like moth balls. It's classic, modern, and functional. Perfect light for over the dining table! I ended up also purchasing a swag kit and wired it in to plug in and hang. There is already overhead lighting in the room, but needed more direct lighting over the table. This is a large lamp, Worth the $",

I was wanting the oil rubbed bronze to match rest of decor. Even thou it is black it could still work - it will depend on how the light shines thru the shade and the color it sends off. If it produces a gray cast then it will have to go back. Also, this appeared to be an open-box item; plastic bags were tied not sealed.

      "text": "I bought this light to hang over the table in our eat-in kitchen. I was originally pleased with the look of it. Unfortunately the light filter on the bottom of the drum is made of plastic. After using the light for a bit, I noticed that the plastic light filter was beginning to warp and melt/ dimple in the center where the hardware gets hot from continued use. Now the filter droops down and hangs all lopsided under the drum shade. It is a source of constant irritation!",

    "description": "One of Kenroy Home largest and most sought-after families, the Margot collection features clean and crisp designs that add a modern and engaging look to living rooms, dining areas, foyers and more. Designed with a consistent look across the collection, Margot's flagship design feature is an over-scaled and modernly inspired drum shade. With a modern design and sphere-shaped accents, each expertly crafted frame is finished with a modern and glistening brushed steel, bringing a modern twist to a French cottage dining room or a contemporary living room. No matter the style or the space, bring a touch of sophistication and illumination with the Margot 3 light pendant.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\n\n\nElegant lighting for almost any room of the home (view larger). A stylish spin on the traditional drum-style lampshade, Kenroy Home's Margot three-light pendant with its oil-rubbed bronze finish merges all things classic and contemporary for an ultra-modern look that works just about anywhere. The unit's 22-inch-diameter bronze gold metallic fabric shade evokes the distinguished textiles found in the world's finest hotels, restaurants, and penthouses, with elegant trimming completing the mid-century-inspired design. Furthermore, the shade's white interior serves as a natural deflector, allowing light from within to illuminate a room without diminishing its strength. \n\nIdeal for living rooms, dens, offices, bedrooms, and other living spaces, the unit's ceiling-mounted design works especially well in high-traffic areas with limited floor space, and it pairs handsomely with other fixtures from the distinguished Margot collection (sold separately), available in both oil rubbed bronze and brushed steel. Its 6 feet of matching chain and 10-foot cord length accommodate varying ceiling height applications. The pendant requires three 100-watt (M) bulbs (not included), and it includes optional white acrylic diffuser for softly muted light.\n\nABOUT KENROY HOME\nFor over 50 years, Kenroy Home has been synonymous with refined design, quality, and value.
