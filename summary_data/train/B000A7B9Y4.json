The software included is not nearly as handy as the Camedia software I've used in the past. And although I haven't had any photos commercially printed, the color and the quality of the prints I have done at home is not what I expected. The pictures tend to be pretty grainy and I have had to do a lot of editing. Overall, it is very easy to use. I hope that with continued use the problems I'm having will be resovled.",

      "text": "While the picture quality for this level of camera is OK, the build quality and durability leave much to be desired. Very much a \"flimsy plastic construction\" scenario. Also, the menu system and options very limited, even at this price point. You'd be better spending an extra $50 or $60 and getting a more capable model. Canon owns the market in this price range and for good reason: they make capable, dependable cameras. Bottom line: Look elsewhere.",

      "text": "The good news: Pictures are excellent. The bad news: to reiterate what others say, it eats batteries - and getting rechargeables does not solve the problem. I went on vacation with 2 10-packs of batteries, and used 10-12 batteries (vacation was 10 days, took 300 pictures - the 512MB card holds over 400). The second flaw is the lack of a viewfinder - in bright sun, you just can't see the LCD screen. Also, a note for the bifocal crowd - I have to take off my glasses to be able to see the screen well. I got the comparably-priced Canon Powershot A430 (1 less megapixel) for one of my children, and it seems like a better choice.",
