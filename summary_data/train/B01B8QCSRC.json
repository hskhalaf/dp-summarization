Pro: Great value - huge container, low price compared to more expensive, BOR-ing clay masks Con: Dries the hell out of my skin (and I have normal skin). BUT PRO: makes me get off my lazy arse and moisturize the way one should after a mask. Con: Kind of difficult to come off - must wash skin multiple times, phantom foams Just buy it, if nothing else you'll get a good giggle.",

While it looks like you\u2019re getting a lot, the part where the product is, is significantly by an inch less. It seems like a waste of plastic. That being said this mask has helped keep my black heads at bay. I recommend leaving plenty of space around eyes, nose, and mouth because after 10-15 minutes the foam expands so much it gets into areas you don\u2019t want. I got about 10 1/2 separate masks.",

It's a fun product but the sensation is just too irritating for me and the results are not spectacular enough to put up with that sensation.",

It removes easily enough with warm water and a cloth (I like a muslin cloth for masks). Leaves face feeling very clean and refreshed.",

When I take it off I can tell the oil (and I have a considerably extra amount of sebum in my skin) has been taken out. My face is tighter and brighter.
