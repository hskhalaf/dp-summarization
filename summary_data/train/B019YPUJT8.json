Four stars only because I feel it is a little pricey for what it is, an undershirt. Update 5-31-15. This shirt really has performed well. I updated to 5 stars as it has been used heavily for wearing under work clothes. It's been through several washes and is still tight and fits nicely with no irritation. Update 3-13-16. I like this shirt so much I have bought 4 more because I wear them so much. Still holding up extremely well and isn't discoloring or getting loose.",

My husband likes to wear these under his work shirts for a little compression and to keep his shirts looking neat. We are in Texas and this is \"heat gear\" it truly keeps him cooler on those 100+ days. They are well made with durable stitching and they come out of the wash just like new. Great to wear as just a t-shirt or as an undershirt. The v-neck is nice because it is not visible under a business casual polo shirt.",

I don't know if someone was having an off-day when they made this one or what, but there were threads sticking out in multiple places. On top of that, the fit was not great. It just seems to be an overall compression fit instead of targeting specific areas. Also the softness could have been better. I think part of the problem is that the seams that run in front of the shoulders are too abrasive. This has me thinking twice about buying any more UA shirts... especially at the prices they charge.",

      "text": "I've been buying these for a few years now and recently I've noticed a change in the material. My older shirts say \"Made in El Salvador\" these shirts are perfect and well worth the money IMO. However, the newer shirts I've been receiving say \"Made in Mexico\" and the material is clearly different. The newer material is a downgrade and I fear they will not last as long as my older shirts. The fit is also slightly different. I am not a fan of the new shirts, they certainly are not worth $25... They need to lower the price, I cannot justify paying $25 for a lesser quality material.",
