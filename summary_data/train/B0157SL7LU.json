      "text": "My 8-year old niece just learned to ride a bike. I knew if she fell over or crashed, she'd be okay as long as there weren't scrapes and blood. She didn't need those super hard-shell pads, just something to protect her palms if she crashed. And crash she did a few times while wearing them, with no injury. They are comfortable and easy to get off and on. Totally worth the price since she was able to get up and dust off without injury as she was learning to make that sharp, downhill left turn (it took two crashes before she figured it out).",

They are super thin slippery spandex on top which is not a big deal especially if you don't need them for warmth but the underside has only thin padding, worst of all it is slippery. Especially the thumbs from that spandex. I need to have good grip on my handlebars so can't risk wearing these thin gloves. They are good looking but not worth a broken collar bone.
