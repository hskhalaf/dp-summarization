When it comes to sizing, I wear a 9 in all boots and all dress shoes and stuck to my size. I did not size down like others suggested. Thankfully they fit perfect! Like a glove.",

After inspecting them tonight I realized there is no registered trademark on the heel tag, the soles are different than advertised here and definitely do not match the Ugg site.

Other than that, I really like them and the fact that they can be worn folded over or up high. They're easy to get on and off. I guess the only thing is they're really flat with no arch support.
