I appreciate the cautions of others because it made me take extra care to follow directions. I also watched the video that was on the Amazon website. I put the sofa together alone in about an hour while my grandson was napping. I live on the first floor, so I didn't have trouble with stairs. The sofa is a little less deep than I anticipated, but it is very comfortable and fits well in my apartment. It does have a little chemical odor, but it is fading after only a few hours. For the money spent, this is a good purchase.",

Extremely disappointed in this product is an understatement. Serta should be ashamed of themselves.

If you're looking for a decent piece of furniture to hold you over for a few years until you can afford a great sectional, this is the way to go.

      "text": "This is an attractive, comfortable, and very easy-to-assemble piece of furniture, a welcome addition to my living room. A couple of parts were missing, what I gather to be spacers for installation of the center legs. The supplier was to send the missing part but instead sent legs without the spacers. When I inquired again, Amazon took 20% off the price and said that's all they could do unless I wanted to return it for a refund. I chose to keep the love seat and so far it has been just fine. I did take off one star because of the missing part and the inability to correct such a seemingly simple problem.",

In the box there was a flyer with a service number on it through truecustomersupport.com or 18553722315. They told me over the phone that they do not service this product. This makes no sense to me and is extremely frustrating. Would not purchase again.",

The cushions are just too strong and bumpy so just throws any person out or makes you slip down with slippery leather. Although sofa is wide, no one can really sit in the center.
