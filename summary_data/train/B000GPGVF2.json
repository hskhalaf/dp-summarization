The chocolate seemed a little thick but I stirred it with a spoon. Turned it off and burped the machine and seemed to work fine. I added one more bag (2 lbs) and burped it again. This machine holds max 6lbs of chocolate. Worked perfectly. The party was for 100 people and the 6lbs was enough. It was a success and received lots of compliments on the flavor of the chocolate.",

It does take 4 pounds to run the machine, so there is a cost factor each time you use it, and it is doubtful you will actually use all four pounds. It seems a bit wasteful with the need for 4 lbs to really get it going, perhaps we just didn't have enough people at the party to make it seems worthwhile for 4 pounds. However, the machine itself is great, and worked very well. Everyone enjoyed it and the Sephra chocolate is very tasty.",

When I added the first package of chocolate the fountain was a little loud and didn\u2019t flow well. I added the second package of chocolate and a little vegetable oil and the chocolate flowed beautifully. It looked like the fountains that I see at expensive catered events. It was a huge hit at the party. I routinely stirred the chocolate that was in the base and it lasted for hours. Can\u2019t wait to use it again.",

      "text": "I HAVE ONLY ONE WORD TO SAY ABOUTTHIS PRODUCT \"EXCELLENT\". I used it at a party and it was the best thing ever made!!! I used strawberries, marshmallows, and pretzels and it was the talk of the night. I did not have to eat it up in the microwave....I just poured it in the bowl and let it heat up. Super easy to use and BEAUTIFUL to look at!!!! Easy to clean up. I used 2 bags of the Sephra chocolate and it ran for the entire party. My friends 16 year old daughter actually maintained it all night. If you are thinking about getting this product DONT THINK TWICE....I was pleasantly surprised and you will be to.....",

      "text": "I purchased this for a high school graduation party after all the rentable ones were not available. It was a huge hit at the party! For dipping we provided cubed pound cake, strawberries and cut bananas, thick pretzel sticks, marshmallows and cookies. I would definitely recommend using 4 bags of the Sephra dark chocolate (which was very tasty) in order for the fountain to flow copiously. We used 3 and it wasn't enough. The reason for the 4-star is because cleaning this thing is messy and time-consuming. The unit is solid and totally quiet. We can't wait to use it again!",

      "text": "I was nervous about ordering this fountain at first cause some reviews were one star. However, the fountain came and it's easy to assemble and they have instructions and troubleshooting if you need any help. Mine had to be burped and leveled and then it worked flawlessly, and you can't even here it when it's on. I bought eight pounds of the Sephra chocolate but only used 6 pounds for about 100 guests. This is really a great investment for future parties too. Also cleaning isn't as hard as people say, if you just clean it right after in hot, soapy water it'll be so easy. Very impressed with the quality of this product!",

Don't cut corners on the chocolate you use. I ordered the Sephra Belgium chocolate and everyone was asking what kind I used it was so tasty. I also ordered bamboo sticks separately. They worked well for a large party instead of the limited amount of fondue forks that come with the fountain. Can't wait to try cheese fondue next!",
