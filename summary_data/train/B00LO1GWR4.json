The friendly swede fire starter has an excellent striker too, with a built in bottle opener to help celebrate after you build your fire! Just be sure to wipe the striker off with alcohol and scrape the side opposite from the flint bar free of paint or oil before you go in the woods. When you scrape the magnesium bar for fire starting keep your pile of shavings directly under your tinder. Enjoy the outdoors!",

This product comes with very substantial magnesium blocks you scrape shavings from to start even soggy tinder. You must scrape the black finish off the portion of the mag block you're scraping AND remove the black coating from a side of the steel scraper too, or it won't spark. These come coated to avoid oxidization of both the mag block and the scraping tool so, if you try to use it without wearing away the coatings, you're just rubbing painted surfaces together.

This kit great for groups who need multiple strikers or if you have several bug out bags that you want to equip similarly. Either way, I recommend it for anyone who needs to start a fire in a pinch.",
