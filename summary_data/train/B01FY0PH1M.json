Thankfully I work where I can get industrial strength epoxy to repair the now over 75% of the tread pads that have come undone. I used Loctite Tak Pak and haven't had a single pad come loose since. I would imagine a good crazy/super glue would work also.",

One star removed: the grips on these sound like cleats when walking on a hard surface like a department store or in the tiled office at work. Kind of embarrassing walking around sounding like you\u2019re stepping on bubble wrap. These were definitely designed for the backwoods trails (and they are in fact marketed as such, so I shouldn\u2019t complain)",

I like the cushioning of this sole for rocky trails and the traction for steep, slippery slopes. I agree the tread design could be more reliable. I don't know if it's style or skimping on an expensive material, but they really shouldn't glue little bits of tread on like that, they are going to be prone to peeling off.

The souls after 3 runs dont even look like they have been on rocky mountains. The colors are vibrant and even better when the kid thinks they look cool. I would recommend these one on amazon since we need them other places on line for a much higher price.",

      "text": "I like wearing bigger shoes so i always go 1/2 size bigger, i just like the room more for some reason. This is another asics so i knew it would fit like my old ones and it does, so if you own any asics just get the same size. Yet again they are very well made and i hope to use them until they wear down.",

This shoe features our impact-specific gel cushioning system for an incredibly comfortable ride.\n\nIn 1949, Mr. Kihachiro Onitsuka began his athletic footwear company (Onitsuka Co., Ltd.) by manufacturing basketball shoes out of his living room in Kobe, Japan. He chose the name ASICS for his company in 1977, based on a famous Latin phrase \"Anima Sana In Corpore Sano,\" which, when translated, expresses the ancient ideal of \"A Sound Mind in a Sound Body.\" Taking the acronym of this phrase, ASICS was founded on the belief that the best way to create a healthy and happy lifestyle is to promote total health and fitness. Today, ASICS offers a full line of performance-driven athletic shoes and technical active sports apparel and accessories dedicated to bringing harmony to the body and soul.",
