Granted, it's on a smaller aluminum tank so that's part of the problem, but my Dad has a GPI (silver pump) on a larger steel tank and it's so quiet you can barely hear it over his truck rumbling. I can't say that's a fair comparison since one is a large steel tank and one is small aluminum but I do believe GPI is a quieter pump. Other than that, this pump runs like a top and does the job I need it to do.",

I imagine with a short hose and filter you might get close to 10GPM. If you want more flow than that the 20GPM model is only $80 more. Use this one in my truck now for the transfer tank. and ordered a 1/2 hp 25GPM for the 100' system ..... but then I paid $600 for that pump. Pretty descent for a $240 pump. With all the pumps expect them to flow a little slower than the maximum rated capacity.",
