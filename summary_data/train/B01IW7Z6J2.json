It was funny, I liked running over everything with my car and unlocking all the characters and vehicles. You can literally \"steal\" any vehicle including cars, mopeds, skateboards and segways. I didn't like that you could buy extras with the studs you earned through playing but had to turn them on each time you started the game, I didn't realize that at first and so wasn't getting some of the bonuses I thought I was. Also, the game took forever to load up.",

(we had not touched it, it was working fine and then all of a sudden for no reason would not go any further). very upsetting, now the game is useless.",
