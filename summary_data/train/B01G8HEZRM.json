If you do drop your MacBook with this, expect it to be a sacrificial case as hardshell cases would just fracture. The bottom plate is straightforward to install, but be aware of the lid plate and watch where it clips on. I had mine upside down...

One of the bottom corners is missing so that's a bit of a bummer especially since that's a significant exposed corner and the point it to be pretty but also protect my laptop! All in all, not bad it is very much like the picture!",

I do have easy access to all ports, and it does have slits for ventilation. Overall I think it will protect from scuffs and scratches, but not falls or drops.",

If you wanted a case that showcases the apple logo, this one won't really do it. The apple logo only shows through if your screen brightness is all the way up and if you are like me and hardly ever have your screen brightness to full power, then the apple logo will rarely be seen. The material itself is smooth and nice to the touch. I can't speak to the durability or lasting power of the case itself since I've only had my case on my macbook for a few days.",

Then one fatal day my lap top fell out of my hand and hit the floor, i picked it up and to surprise there was a CRACK in the top of my mac. But it's cute so whatever you know.",

Having read the reviews before I purchased it I was concerned about the small minority of reviews that said it offer no protection or cracked. I found it to be protection enough. I just don't drop my laptop period. If it does fall this might offer some amount of protection but bottom line is this is for looks which are great but not protection. It does protect the outer surface of the laptop from scuffs and liquids.",

And occasionally, I have to snap the case back into place because for some reason it moves. And also, the little black parts on the bottom that hold it from sliding on surfaces keep coming off, so I took off two stars for all those reasons. But still, it's very pretty especially with the apple sign glowing in the front.",
