After 20 years of wearing different styles of Merrell shoes, they have all served me well: proper fit, comfortable, and durable. All the models I have bought do not have metal in the soles, and as someone who is always traveling by air, this is an important characteristic. As I am always walking through tough urban terrain, I apply additional waterproofing spray, and it helps maintain both appearance and useful life.",
