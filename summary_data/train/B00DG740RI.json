Once secured, it did a great job removing hair. It\u2019s just a pain in the butt cleaning once the top is taped on. If this didn\u2019t do such a good job removing hair, it would have been returned because of the top snapping off.",

Then it will stop working, and best of luck dealing with Panasonic to fix - they won't. First it'll take a month to get customer service to respond - with the only advice being to enter their chat function.

The battery holds a charge for a very long time, all the attachments work perfectly, especially the foot pumice stone. Its very easy to clean and the light is very bright so you don't miss any hairs using the epilator. Highly recommend it. My favorite Christmas gift!!!",

    "title": "Panasonic ES-ED90-P Wet/Dry Epilator and Shaver, with Six Attachments including Pedicure Buffer for Foot Care, Red",
    "description": "Style:6 AttachmentsA convenient, time-saving alternative to the time and cost of waxing, the Panasonic ES-ED90-P hair remover system is a shaver, epilator and pedicure buffer in one for complete at-home hair removal for women. It includes six snap-on attachment heads for safe, unwanted hair removal on arms, legs, underarms and bikini areas plus an added pedicure buffer attachment for foot care. A high-performance, dual-speed motor drive makes the hair removal process more comfortable and personalized. The Shaver Head smoothly lifts, holds and cuts hair at the base with stainless-steel, hypo-allergenic blades and foil for added protection on sensitive skin, and a built-in pop-up trimmer captures long or stray hairs anywhere on the body and shapes the bikini area. The Panasonic epilator\u2019s Bikini Comb attachment quickly snaps on to the shaver head to neatly and gently trim the bikini area. The dual-disc Epilator Head pivots 30\u00b0 forward, 30\u00b0 backwards to conform more naturally to individual body contours. Inside, 48 precision rotary tweezers provide wider skin coverage, ideal for hair removal on legs and arms. A compact Gentle Epilator Head cleanly and safely removes hair from softer, more sensitive areas like underarms and bikini areas, and you can snap on the Gentle Epilator Cap to lift and remove thinner, shorter hairs without irritation. For the feet, a Pedicure Buffer cleanly removes dry, callous skin. The Panasonic ES-ED90-P women\u2019s electric shaver and epilator also includes a built-in LED light to reveal hard-to-see hairs for thorough shaving and epilation. This versatile shaver/epilator is wet dry convenient and can be used in the bath or shower with foam or gel, or used dry anytime. Cleanup is quick and simple. Just rinse Panasonic epilator under warm running water. For travel, an included travel pouch holds shaver/epilator and attachments. To help maintain the level of comfort and satisfaction you demand from your Panasonic Shaver and Epilator hair removal system, the high-performance inner blade and outer foil should be replaced once every one to two years with genuine, easy-to-install Panasonic replacement accessories: Outer Foil (WES9753P), Inner Blade (WES9752P), Outer Foil/Inner Blade Combo (WES9759P).",
