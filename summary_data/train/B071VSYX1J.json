I'm sure for the experienced hardcore runner these would not be what you want but for someone like me who's just doing the occasional run these are absolutely spot on.",

These shoes actually looked a lot better than I expected them too, not that it mattered because I took them through the abuse of a Spartan Race about a week after I got them.
