It now costs as much to ship back as buying a new one...pretty bad for 1 weeks use so beware...I would not purchase again especially from Amazon. If you purchase locally at a big box at least they would give you your money back without charging you for shipping the defective back Worst Amazon purchase since 1999",

It is bright, and being a laser, goes quite far (hopefully not too far to cause problems in the air). We had seen the product in action at a campsite in Florida. One issue of concern is that it doesn't turn off with first light. It is quite bright outside before it turns off for the day. The other thing is that we were not expecting a pattern of squares to show up in its cycle of projection. We deal with it for the rest of the display--quite beautiful. But wish the squares weren't so prominent.",
