      "text": "BEST PRESENT EVER! My 1 year old niece absolutely loved this. There are different setting dials to choose from and the hands and feet when pressed have different things. Her favorite was sliding the toggle switch to the right and it played the buzzy bee song. Her favorite color right now is pink so it\u2019s quite perfect and you can turn it off anytime if your child just wants to cuddle with it. Sometimes it\u2019s on a sensor with movement so if you want quiet time or putting your little one down, make sure you put it in the off position or it will spontaneously play. This is a great purchase.",

It has also been small enough and easy enough to tote around. We use it frequently as a distraction while I change her now (rolls over) quality is great. Easy to push hand buttons that my baby can push them. Wings make noises for her too. You will like this toy.",

It plays a lot of little songs and the light flashes off and on to keep the little ones entertained. I hope I can wait till Christmas to give it to them, haha!",
