It looked sturdy and semi-pro when I got it and really enjoyed using it, but it let me down suddenly. Any measuring device is only as good as its accuracy and reliability, and this one failed me. I will spend more but will buy something of high quality. Adequate tire pressures are a serious safety requirement (especially in motorcycles, as winter approaches and temps fluctuate / traction is challenged) so buying cheap is irresponsible.",

I like the \"bleed-off\" valve...my normal practice is to slightly overinflate, then bleed pressure down to the desired figure. This makes that very easy to accomplish. Gauge appears durable, and is well-protected against setting down too hard, or small distance drops, by the \"tire\" cushioning the dial.

I then used my Dynaplug micro-inflator to pump up the tire in a matter of seconds. Both great purchases.",

Using a standard gauge was difficult but this new design made it so easy! Works great on our cars too!! I highly recommend it.",

      "text": "I bought it because none of the other tire gauges we own (three of them) would fit between the valve stem and the rear axle of our 2006 Kawasaki Ninja. This device fits fine and I especially like the ability to bleed air from the tire with the gauge. My only complaint about the device is I wish the stem turned 90 degrees instead of 45 degrees but that is a minor thing and only matters when reading the motorcycle tire.",
