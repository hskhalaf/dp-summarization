No way of cleaning it unless you unscrew the whole thing which is ridiculous, so this was a solution for now. At least I know it will catch the hair and I like how it has some weight to it. It sits right inside the drain enclosure over the existing drain cover and doesn't move. I would definitely buy this again.",

But I'd recommend the company install a plastic/rubber lining underneath to keep the stopper in place.",

The lip is also large, so any hair that did get caught stuck on the edge instead of washing onto the top. If your shower is flat and has totally smooth tile, this will probably work fine. But it there is any unevenness or sloping toward the drain, this will most likely do very little to catch hair.",

One week after receipt, these gizmos appear to be catching the hair in two drains. OK so far. This product is offered in a set of two reducing the price approximately $5.00. Don't be stupid like me and buy two at regular price. I'd buy them again. Happy bathing!",
