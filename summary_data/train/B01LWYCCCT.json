But if you need really accurate 45 degree cuts - such as for making picture frames - this in not the saw for you. Manufacturer tolerances are sloppy, not tight... when setting the saw to 45 degrees, it's supposed to snap into that angle and stay there - this saw sort of does that, but with a fair bit of play at the 45 degree setting.",

The sawdust/chip bag, on the other hand, never stays secure enough so I end up with a work table full of sawdust.",

Which is to say he knows about using saws. He mounted this saw on a sturdy table and began cutting up old 2 x 4s for firewood. The saw sparked and then burned up the brushes after 5 hours. We will be contacting the warranty company now. I will update this review, if possible, to report our experience with the warranty.",

B&Ds own website says to order parts off the diagram and when the diagram link is pressed it says \u201cnot available\u201d. Any other parts website does not list this saw. The part in question is the blade bolt and it immediately snapped when I tried to remove it for the first time. Admittedly I tried to turn it the wrong way but it sure snapped off easily. Hopefully parts availability will improve but until then I\u2019d stay away.",
