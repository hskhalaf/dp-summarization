These are all plastic but are more durable than the torches that use the real bamboo strip webbing at the base of the torch light. The flickering light is also brighter than five-LED torches I purchased from a non-Amazon online vendor.",

We are planning on digging little holes to bury them down into the ground better because they do not want to stand up completely straight. Other than that, these are really cool lights and are perfect accent lighting light a path to our pool/tiki bar area.",

The misleading part is I ordered the old style and got the new improved style which as it turns out really doesn't matter as they flicker the same. I wanted the color black and got chocolate brown, but at night you can't tell the difference. Now the bad, the older version lights came with very sturdy metal stakes and poles. Now they are cheaply made with plastic stakes and poles. All most impossible to put in the ground so beware.Newhouse needs to go back to metal.",

They sent me three replacements--none of them worked for more than an hour--same strobe light effect. The torches look realistic but the solar panels are inferior and so are the electronics. I've seen solar torches that are realistic that actually burn for 4-6 hours. The positive reviews about this product are not believable.",

The plastic stake is pretty useless. I zip tied them to my fence posts. I don't recommend putting these up w/o fastening them to a fence post.... wind would surely blow them over if just driven into the ground alone. Overall happy with the purchase.",

This is my second year with these and they still look like new even in the hot GA sun.",

My parents used to have similar torches around their pool years ago and the lights would stay on almost all night. That is what I was expecting.",
