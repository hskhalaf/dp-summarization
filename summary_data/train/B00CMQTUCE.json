My only real complaint with it (and it might be a Kinect issue) is that it isn't real responsive to your movements. Such as the climbing game will often fail as you reach up outside of the view of the Kinect and it can't see you grab the handholds or the bowling game sometimes gets confused and you can't grab the ball or it goes wild when you throw it.",

The shooting game and tennis are prime examples of where it really cannot keep track of what two people are doing at once. There are annoying delays that throw you off in tennis and the shooting reticule jumps all over. The game itself is fun, but the technology isn't there yet for it to be anything more than meh.",
