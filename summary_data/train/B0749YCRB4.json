      "text": "This Easton S150 29 inch bat is not very good. It is the least expensive USA bat and it shows. The weight is very poorly distributed and as such, swing balance gets thrown off. It weighs significantly more (~3oz or ~100g) than it\u2019s claimed 19oz too, which is a big difference when you consider that these bats are being used by small kids. The build seems solid, despite there being stickers on the barrel whose adhesive could not be removed, and the grip is nice, but this bat falls short of expectations, even when judging this against other lower end USA bats. I decided to return this bat. See my Little League Baseball List for bat options.",
