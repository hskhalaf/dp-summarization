Not your typical ugly hiking shoe. And surprisingly it is water proof and very easy to clean. I love them!",

These boots had very minimal support, and a surprisingly narrow toe box, especially for a Merrell. My feet aren't wide by any stretch, but these cramped my toes so badly they became numb. Overall, they look great, rugged but stylish, but just didn't hold up in terms of comfort. Will be returning these.",
