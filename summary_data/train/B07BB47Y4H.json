I do love the shower gel, bum bum cream and the glow oil but I will not be purchasing this scrub again.",

It smells amazing I have the lotion and the Chapstick so I just figured that this will be a good product to for me. I like the body scrub idea but it completely dries out my skin so bad to the point that I'm ashy all over. So I will use this product but probably just once a week.",

It isn\u2019t all that exfoliating and I couldn\u2019t notice a difference in my skin after using it as a mask. It is a bright concentrated yellow color that will stain your white shower floor so make sure to wash it down the drain immediately.",

It also left a lot of brown grains and bright orange splotches in the shower if I didn\u2019t rinse them. I was also still orange when I got out of the shower in some places. I wouldn\u2019t buy again, but will try to use this since it wasn\u2019t cheap!",
