When contacting their customer service I was told that even though it was covered under warranty, I'd have to pay for return shipping. I consider this a bit of a 'hidden cost' because of how quickly it failed, and because of a manufacturer defect I needed to pay more on top of the initial price I paid. Of course maybe I just got really unlucky and got a lemon, but if you also get a defective one prepare to pay return shipping even if it's under warranty but over 30 days.",

There are some pre-programmed hotkeys like for calculator, email, etc but they don't seem to work reliably. The keys are not to loud but the sound of the keys are reflected off the metal case and amplifies the sound. O-Rings are probably the only hope of getting rid of the metallic clang as the keys bottom out. Space bar is the worst offender. No instructions, but the LED controls are marked (kind of). All in all the keyboard is slightly below average. Loud, metallic keypresses, inconstant LED lighting and hotkeys that don't work.",

I'm leaning to return it based on that as I can get past the additional echo noise... It gets one star for the built and construction and another one for the backlit controls without software. It loses 2 because of the echo, and 1 because their website/access to documentation and instructions is confusing.",

I just disable the keyboard when i turn off my computer so its not a big deal tho. Another complaint is that The keyboard itself did not come with the commands for changing the light.

You have to hold down the function key on the right side of the keyboard and use the F2-F4 buttons to adjust volume. Would prefer something I can operate one-handed while gaming (either push button on top or the use of F9-F11).",

I had to explain that \"no, the keys on your keyboard stick because a dog peed on the keyboard and I ran it under a faucet and never expected to use it again.\" It goes without saying that this keyboard is a HUGE step up from a non-mechanical keyboard with sticky keys from dried dog pee.

The reason this happens is character 's' is Dvorak layout maps to ':' colon character in Qwerty layout. Worthy of mention is the fact that without modifier key presses the Dvorak keyboard layout works just fine. I have to return an otherwise great product since my productivity has gone down.",

      "text": "It seems ridiculous to rhapsodize over a keyboard, but this product justifies it. It's stylish with its blue back-light and aluminum trim, very well-made, and the key travel, resistance and feedback are all perfect. But it's the click that's got me - that sound from 25 years ago that evokes my first IBM PC and that seems to make every word I type seem so important. It's a wonderful piece of nostalgia, but also a far more pleasant, comfortable and satisfying experience to use than any other keyboard I've owned.",

I am an apple user, so it's a little tricky to get used to the slightly different keys, but it was a very quick transition.",
