For me, I was a bit disappointed to find the back is like a piece of foam, which makes it difficult to wipe off. Surely, it does not slip and slide, but I need to clean it, too. I thought of returning it, but I have since decided to take it to a farm warehouse, where it will work beautifully, and use it there instead of in the house.",

The old ones finally wore out and we are glad we got this larger replacement. Nice trip-free edges and super comfortable. Interestingly, under normal usage it tends to \u201cwalk\u201d a bit on the floor as foot pressure is apparently sufficiently transmitter to the underside. This happens also with area rugs placed over carpets or hard floors. A suitable \u201cfriction pad\u201d designed to minimize this effect will probably do the trick. But we haven\u2019t tried that because the movement is minor and we easily push it back into position.",

Part of it is that the surface material is pretty stiff, so you don't sink in the way you would with a more flexible material on top. I also wish it were thicker. I have found that if I double it on itself it has the amount of squish I expect/need. Not idea, but since it's so long, if you are using it for standing in place (such as at a standing desk) folding it over on itself isn't a bad solution.",

OFTEN causing one to trip ... 2 . some reviews state these mats \"stay \" in place ... this is NOT my experience at all . They most certainly can and do move frequently and are difficult to slide back into desired place using your foot . You MUST readjust position by hand . I would not purchase these mats again nor do I recommend them primarily because of tripping hazzard .",
