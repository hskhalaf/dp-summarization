However, on the Canon RP with the lens adaptor, it makes a great light weight walk-around combination. While it would be really cool to have a pancake lens like this with an RF mount, it is still reasonably small, even with the adaptor. Based on the photos of the RF 35, it looks to be about the same length as the 40mm with the adaptor.",

It weighs about as much as the nifty fifty, yet feels a million-times more solid. It also focuses much quieter, though it is electronic so manual only works when you half-press the shutter button.

I've used it on my crop sensor cameras like the 60D. It works great there, but is more like a 64mm focal length equivalent.

I usually just leave this lens on my T4i because it is compact, convenient and the image quality is superb! It is also FANTASTIC for shooting video (on Manual focus mode). Follow focuses would be difficult to attach I would think but if you have a single focus shot set up this looks amazing. I recommend to Everyone who is not happy with their combo lens images!",

While the Canon 50mm 1.8 is a great lens, I do prefer this one over the 50mm. This is the cheapest and sharpest lens on the market. I highly recommend.",

I tried the 50mm but felt that it produced too close of an image for certain situations. The 40 has eased that issue while still producing a great low light lens. The motor is different for the auto focus then those canon has produced before, but I do not feel noise is an issue at all. I hope to post a few photos taken with the lens in the coming weeks.",

The focusing ring is at the edge of the lense, so if you have large fingers, make sure it doesn't show in your picture. The image qaulity is very sharp.
