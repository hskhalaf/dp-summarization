This brand has the one the highest quality products out there, with bioavailability you could never find at walmart. Synthetic vitamins and minerals are being sold in almost all drug stores. Megafood's vitamins and minerals actually come from food, rather than synthetically made crap you would find in centrum or other walmart brands. Thanks Megafood for making us products that we are lacking very much today.",
