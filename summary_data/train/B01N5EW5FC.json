The pieces are individually wrapped in felt making for a smooth playing surface. The silk screen raised graphics prevent smoot sliding of cards but that is fine fire the price. Looks great. This was definitely a fair deal for under $50. I do wish it was available for prime though since I had to order a different table top to make it in time for my poker night. They both ended up arriving the same day though and this was the better table top at half the price.",

I would have paid another $20-25 to have a better solution, but at this price point, it's still a good buy and I would recommend it for casual casino nights.
