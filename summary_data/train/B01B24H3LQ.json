      "text": "Of the many items suggested in the \"hip kit\" for after hip replacement surgery, this one was the biggest surprise! I thought oh well, I'll get it, and probably not use it, but It has proven to be the most useful tool. The larger hook side helps with getting undies and pants on when you cannot bend, and also is a great tool to pick up things, or grab shoes. The smaller hook has proven invaluable in assisting with getting shoes on, as even with elastic laces they need the back pulled up, or tongue pulled out. Anyone with mobility issues, or facing hip or knee surgery should definitely purchase one!",

The stick is thoroughly and smoothly sanded. I love the fact that it's made in America! I would definitely buy again. I'm very pleased with this item.",

Its slightly larger diameter, it has a reinforcing metal ferule at both ends of the stick, the hook is vinyl coated so its less likely to scratch your skin, and the compound bent wire thing on the opposite end is a little stronger looking. However, be careful pushing hard on it because the compound bent wire thing is offset from the centerline of the stick, so it will bend sideways unless you're careful.",
