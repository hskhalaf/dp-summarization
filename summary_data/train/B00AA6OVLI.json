      "text": "The ViviTab Smart is a bargain in terms of Windows 8 tablets, yet in spite of it's atom processor, it has the horsepower to perform all of the tasks of my daily computing needs (internet, word processing, spreadsheet). It is lightweight, has a bright display, and the ability to add an micro SD card for additional storage is a big plus. In addition, the battery life is much longer than the tablets with the core i5 processors. Since it has 32 bit architecture it can run my older programs that will not run on the new 64 bit machines. In summary, I am very satisfied and would definitely recommend this tablet to the average user.",

      "text": "Great product for the price. The only issue with this tablet is that this specific one was made for the European market. The main instructions came in Italian and the charger also came with an option for the 'Old World' style outlet plug. The only other languages available were English, French, and a few other Slavic languages. No option for Spanish? I guess there's an app for that.. So we'll see. Working good so far. I like the fact that it takes the new XC type of micro SD card. That makes for quicker access to info. Just getting used to the windows version. Like it!!",

It has a precise good quality build, but it's not as nicely made as an ipad. It is also slower to launch an app, but once loaded, multitasking is a breeze! Being a full-fledged Win8, not RT, it can do anything a normal PC can which means total flexibility. Battery holds about 3 days of regular use and charges fast. Sites like dhgate offer nice options to get a keyboard/case for this tablet for about 30 $. Overall I'm content and satisfied with this tablet which became an upgrade from ipad 1 for me.",

It has windows 8 as does my desktop computer, and they work very well together. I created a home-group, and can now share everything including the desktop's dvd drive. Finally I added a 64 gig micro SD card and now have twice the space. I am not a gamer so I don't know how well it would hold up under gaming conditions. It plays videos and music effortlessly, and the battery last most of the day if in constant use.",

The battery life is about 8 hours with normal use. Recharging is relatively quick. Do wish it had a longer recharging cord. The price is definitely affordable, especially for what you get. Headphone sound is definitely much better than the sound from the tablet's speakers. But, that is not a big factor for me since I use headphones most of the time anyway. Do go for the Bluetooth keyboard and mouse especially for set ups.",

Cons: Asus Live Update software: keeps telling me that 2 updates are available, even though I have installed them and rebooted multiple times. No way to verify if I have actually installed the updates. The Windows button (on the bottom edge of the screen) has stopped working for me a few times. A hard reset fixed that. Eats too much battery in sleep. Switching to airplane mode helps a bit. But I really recommend to fully shut down when you are not using it, if you want to save the battery: it boots up very quickly (under 30 sec).",

It is fast enough for everything I do, like surfing the web, banking, email, streaming movies and light gaming. Oh, yeah and shopping on Amazon!

I find this ironic that the problem exists while at the same time the company is praising its state-of-the-art sound technology. The tablet is still usable with a set of headphones. I have a Bose headphone, and with this work-around the sound is terrific. Terry A. French frenchterry@yahoo.com",
