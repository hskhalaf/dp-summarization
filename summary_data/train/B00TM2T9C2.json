Zero learning curve and I didn't require assistance from someone else to assemble my purchases which is a blessing. This isn't an item that is ideal for heavy duty jobs especially with hard woods or for fixing/creating predrilled holes. Slight misalignment of holes as is typical for boxed furniture pieces wasn't a problem. If any major issues existed with the holes, you would need to employ a drill first.",

The direction switch is a little hard to use (needs 2 hands), so I filed a groove down the center of it to give it more grip. That worked well. I would be happy to buy this one again.",
