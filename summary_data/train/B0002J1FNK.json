Recently, one of them was exhibiting some unusual signs that prompted a visit to the vet where bloodworm was done and confirmed that she had Lyme disease (and a high level in her bloodstream). The vet told me that there have been several cases at their practice where Frontline has failed to protect dogs from ticks and Lyme disease. Currently, my dog is on her 30 day antibiotics, and when I go back for follow up tests, I will be finding out which flea and tick control brand they recommend. Use at your own risk!",

I have 3 pets that go out in the yard for at least part of the day. I will not treat the yard bc that kills butterflies, dragon flies and lightening bugs. If you've been struggling with flea control, you know that they mutated to be resistant, and I recommend every 3 weeks treatment from July to killing frost, or tolerate fleas. But you won't have ticks if used every 4 weeks as directed. Collars are useless and excoriate their necks.",

I used 2 doses over the following 2 months and throughout, started finding fleas on her. I thought perhaps they'd just gotten on her from playing with another dog, and the Frontline would eventually kill them. Not the case. Yesterday I found 5 fleas while grooming her. I switched to an oral med and threw out the final 4 doses of the Frontline. Waste of money.",

Spending the summers in the Northwoods of Wisconsin make it essential I treat him to avoid ticks.....it is lyme disease country. Tried another brand first and had to race to the vet due to his reaction. Have used this with no reaction at all. Some people have commented that they believe Frontline has lost some of its effectiveness; I have not found this to be true...and trust me, in bear country we have more ticks than mosquitoes.",

I ordered the frontline and put it on her as soon as the driver dropped it at the door. A day later and she is scratching significantly less and I haven't seen one on her since. It has been 3 weeks since that time. I would definitly recommend this product to keep your dog safe from fleas, ticks and the diseases they carry.",

I believe this latest purchase of Frontline Plus for dogs has the same issue!!! How are we as consumers able to tell if it is fake and a defective product?",
