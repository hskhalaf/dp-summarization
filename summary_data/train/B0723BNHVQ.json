Pretty sturdy piece and no damage to the piece whatsoever. An added bonus is that it was super easy to build.",

I'm assuming this is due to the gap between the leg supports and the top of the bench. That's right, the top of the bench does not touch the legs! There's about a half-inch gap. This seems to be a design flaw, since all the bolts fit perfectly. TL;DR: I'm waiting for this thing to collapse under me, and I'm 200 lbs.",

Tools are included (however you will be happier if you have your own 10 mm wrench). The wood is nicely finished. Directions are good if not great. I used the wrong screws the first time THOUGH THIS WAS NOT THE DIRECTIONS' FAULT. The assembled bench looks attractive. For a plant stand it is sturdy but I would not sit on it myself.",

It's the perfect size for my narrow entry, and deep enough for me to sit on while putting on shoes. NOTE, I'm a petite woman with size 6 shoes. This bench is 17 3/4\" tall and the seat is 11 1/4\" deep, so a non-petite person may find this bench too low to the ground, and too narrow to comfortably sit on or store shoes. My shoes fit perfectly on the shelves, 3 pairs of tennis/walking shoes per shelf. Given the smaller size, I believe this is a great bench for kids to use! Very happy with my purchase.",
