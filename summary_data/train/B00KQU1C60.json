The package it arrived in was dirty, tattered and ragged as well as having been re-taped to hold its contents inside. There was NO padding inside the box to protect the unit from the abuse the box received. Not surprisingly the unit was badly damaged with several bent and broken cross pieces. Again, it's not surprising the damage this thing incurred as the quality of the stainless steel is about as thin as possible. Its thickness is somewhat greater than a soda can. Add to that, the cheap plastic hinges hardly appear built for the Long haul.",

Comes completely assembled and only requires taking out of the box, removing the plastic it is wrapped in and loosening the twist tie that holds it secure while shipping...you are set. All that needs to be done is the expansion. :) The rack is very sturdy. Does not require too much space for the amount of clothing it will hold. Thanks to the designers and thanks to Amazon for getting it to me a week before the expected delivery date!",

I left my clothes on the rack outside in a windstorm and the rack was thrown down with such force it broke two of the plastic hinges. When I mentioned this to the Manufacturer they sent me out two replacement hinges even though this accident was my fault. I am a very happy customer!",

You can hang them from the various slats on the wings or the bottom middle section. Both wings can be raised higher, especially if you have a longer shirts that's hung off a hanger on the side. It folds flat and is fairly slim. It is still bit bulky, but that doesn't bother me. There's a shoe formations on the bottom. I haven't really used this feature.",

I dry some pretty heavy sweaters and I worry about them holding that kind of weight over the long term. But so far, so good :-)",

This one is both less expensive and more durable than anything we've ever owned. It's light-weight, but it's designed to so that the pressure is distributed across the metal and hard plastic parts. There's no single part that's vulnerable to breakage. Our daughter frequently knocks it over, but it has never broken or even shown signs of wear.",
