      "text": "After much research before buying a mid-range projector this model seemed the best. My main criteria was ability to watch UHD but after failing to install Sky UHD channels we called the BENQ helpline to discover the one that was delivered had out of date Firmware installed that did not allow UHD! BENQ have (so far) been great and organised collection and an engineer to reinstall the correct firmware and we are hoping to get it back and working properly within 2 weeks. Irritating that we are without it for another few weeks but from what we saw before return picture is very good already so looking forward to what it will be like when functioning as it should",

So amazon had to step in. My review was removed from Projection Center and now they're back to all five stars :) I wonder if I should purchase it from a physical store instead..",
