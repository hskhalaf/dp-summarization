For each photo taken, you have 10 seconds of audio recording, right after taking the photo, to describe what you've just taken a picture of. Another one that has it is the FujiFilm FinePix S9000, with up to 30 seconds of audio recording for each image. In both cases, the audio file takes the same sequence number as the photo it is attached to. I have no idea why all manufacturers insist on NOT maintaining such a useful and practical feature in other models. To me, it is extremely useful and I use it all the time, during my travels.",

It is not an easy camera to learn to use properly. Some of the instruction booklet is difficult for an older, technically chalenged person to understand, yet there are issues that I've had with the camera that seem simple but are not addressed in the book. Also, because of the delay in the shutter, this is not a good camera for action photos or catching a momentary occurance. That said, it's better than what other similar cameras seem.",

I think the battery life is just fine. The video quality just amazed me.Its super awesome...and even the voices are recorded perfectly.

I also have a newer model (ZS5) from Panasonic, which has more pixels, HD video, more features, better LCD, but it is obvious that the picture quality of ZS1 is superior. Even if it is an old model, I am not sure that current models in this class make better pictures. (Of course you shall not compare its picture quality to high end compacts or a DSLR.)",

      "text": "I have owned many pocket cameras over the last 15 years. When I have serious photographic projects I use a single lens reflex digital camera made by Nikon. For casual use I have tried at least four small pocket cameras but none of them would satisfy. The Panasonic Lumix DMC - CS1 offers features of more expensive SLRs but without the bulk. Even the annoying delay between pressing the shutter key and taking the picture has been minimized in this camera. Don't get me wrong it can't shoot as quickly as a good SLR but for a serious camera that fits in your pocket is unbeatable.",

    "description": "Color:BlackFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nThe Panasonic DMC-ZS1 is a members of the new ZS-Series, the successor to the acclaimed LUMIX TZ-Series and one of Panasonic\u2019s newest ultimate compact and powerful digital cameras. The ZS1 features a 25mm ultra-wide angle, 12x powerful optical zoom, plus a 10.1-megapixel CCD, a standard iA mode (no Face Recognition) for still image recording and a 2.7-inch, 230,000-dot Intelligent LCD. \n\nNew this year to the ZS-Series, iA mode is also available in Movie Mode. It automatically selects the most suitable Scene mode and helps to correct handshake, focus and brightness problems - making iA mode your one-stop solution to capture beautiful still and motion images. Face Detection automatically detects a face in the frame and adjusts focus, exposure, contrast, and skin complexion so it turns out perfectly. Intelligent Exposure continually checks the ambient light level and adjusts the exposure setting as conditions change to prevent blown highlights and blocked shadows. And Intelligent Scene Selector automatically switches between Normal, Portrait, Macro, Scenery, and Low Light modes according to the situation to optimize visual quality. \n\nThe imaging power of Lumix has further evolved with the Venus Engine HD, which boasts two CPUs to provide approx. 2.4x processing capability and support for AVCHD Lite and HDMI output. It integrates all the advanced functions and camera operations with high performance and low-power consumption. In image processing, luminance noise and chromatic noise are reduced separately before and after signal processing. This is further refined by separating noise two-dimensionally into high-frequency and low-frequency noise. The circuits then effectively reduce only the low-frequency noise to minimize the unwanted noise and help produce beautiful, sharp still and motion images. \n\nPlayback with the ZS1 is also easy. Simply insert the camera\u2019s SD memory card into the VIERA HDTV\u2019s Image Viewer SD card slot for a photo slideshow. Alternatively, connect the camera via an optional HDMI mini cable, the DMW-HDC2, to a VIERA Link-equipped Panasonic VIERA HDTV and use the television\u2019s remote control to run mixed slideshows of photos and videos.",
