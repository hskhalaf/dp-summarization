I was afraid they wouldnt fit since Im a bigger girl with thick legs and also 6\u201d2 so my legs are very long as well. But they fit perfectly! Surprising they were even a bit loose before lacing. Im usually a size nine but I always order up with boots. Got a size ten, and they are very roomy. I love these so much! Definitely reccomend!",

With all the reviews from women saying the boot fit them I decided to give these a try. Big mistake. What I received was a heel that someone apparently sewed a garbage bag to. Even lacing the boots as tight as they go I can still shove my entire arm inside of the boot. I will definitely be returning these. Waste of $30.",

I ordered a size 9 in black and they\u2019re perfect. I love how adjustable they are. Can be worn casually or dressy.

Not what I wanted. It's not worth the hassle of sending them back since they were inexpensive, fit well, and I'll more than likely wear them, but the listing should definitely be changed to reflect that Premiere Tan is a suede like material, not distressed leather-type.",
