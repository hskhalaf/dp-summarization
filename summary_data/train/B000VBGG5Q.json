This unit is also rechargeable. The advise from a fire-fighter friend is that you don't need to have the most expensive extinquisher but having the cheapest unit that might break before you get a chance to use it is not a good idea. This unit is the perfect solution.",

      "text": "It arrived. I hope I don't have to use it. The pros: The gauge is easy to read It comes with a sign you can hang to indicate where the fire extinguisher is It comes with a wall mounting bracket It is red It pretty much looks exactly like a fire extinguisher The cons: The handle is a little cheap, but my guess is that for the one time I might need it it won't matter as long as it goes off... I guess I'll update this if I ever need to use it",

We had a kitchen fire and if it had not been for the purchase of one of these, the fire might have gotten out of control. Now, It's a must. I have fire extinguishers for the kitchen, family room, and an upstairs room with computer equipment. We also have fire alarms in various places.",
