It is substantial and very chic, but what's inside is disappointing.",

That stuff is my go to for the just-a-bit-of-balm days and I figured its pretty, balmy shine would diffuse the otherwise artificial Arabian Knights loudness... I was right. Together they created a nice, berry-tinted, glowing shine that I am incredibly happy with.",

It is a little drying, but I've found that liptsticks with any staying power whatsoever are like that. This is definitely not a gloss, and swiping something a little more moisturizing on before adding this doesn't hurt the staying power or color payoff. This one survived cocktail, appetizers, and birthday dinner for me this year, and still looked great on the flip side.",

Easy to reapply to a darker shade if desired. Not to mention it was the color used in the second 50 Shades of Grey. Sexy, adult, romantic color and a quality lipstick. Highly recommend.

I don't like giving less than the high reviews. Overall it's a great lipstick in the way of feeling moisturizing and smoothly going on, but as for it being darker know. It's more of a pinkish red as my photo shows. I decided to keep it since I need a new good lipstick this more basic color anyways.",

      "text": "I got the color Arabian nights. The seller was great shipped in a timely manner and everything but the product itself was somewhat meh. The color is very buildable which is a plus but not really moisturizing. I have to use in conjunction with my lip balm so it doesn\u2019t dry out my lips which doesn\u2019t really bother me because I prefer a more sheer application. I do have to say that the more you build it the thicker is is and it is slightly more moisturizing. All in all I was expecting more from ILIA; however, I will continue to try more colors of this lip product in the future.",

With a name like arabian nights, i was hoping for a berry plum. It's not an over powering ruby with one or two swipes and you don't need a lot to get the moisture. The color doesn't stain or last that long. It's just a little pricey on the regular though. I tried this one for half price. Happy i did, it is one of the cleanest lippies you will find, being smoother than others that are pricier. So you decide.",

However, this color did not come out a nice berry tone on me. It was more pinky and not really the look I was going for. The formula is moisturizing but also doesn't stay on very long. I definitely don't think this is worth the price as you can get drugstore lipsticks which are just as nice but longer lasting.",

I will certainly repurchase.",
