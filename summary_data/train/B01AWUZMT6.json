I have been a diabetic for over 10 years, and my mother for more than 30 years, and neither of us find this a good tool.",

Its an amazing invention, we're so happy that I also bought one for my mom who have type 2 DM. Thank you.",

Now while that all may seem to be insignificant to some people, when you are dealing with a skittish dog things like a quieter snap and suction to get blood to the surface are huge deals to me.

I really feel it did not cause less pain then the Delica One touch lancet. The Delica lancets are small and can't fit. I would try the Walgreens Lancets. The Butterfly touch lancets caused more pain then the tiniboy lancets per my son. He enjoyed decorating the device with the letter stickers and themes. That was his favorite part.",

She likes to use the Genteel on areas other than her fingers. It was easy for her to learn. I would highly recommend this for anyone who has to check their blood glucose and wants it to be painless.

I use \"micro\" sized test strips and there is more than enough sample in just seconds. I felt comfortable trying out different testing sites and tips, and that helped me customize how I use it. Very easy! Reliable!",

The vaccum is so useful, nothing like getting the perfect drop. I'll be honest, I ordered this in white and it came in purple, but not such a big deal, I was just excited to use it. I will always recommend to my diabetic friends.",

We returned this device along with all of the lancets we purchased to go another route. I guess the moral of this story is that not one size fits all. I am sure this is a great device for most of the customers out there, just not us.",
