No residue, they don't dry out, they're soft and gentle, I can TOUCH MY EYES WITH THEM, comfortable to use on entire face if you're lazy or traveling. YOU CANNOT GET BETTER. end of.",

They easily and gently take off eye makeup, including long wear mascara and eyeliner, without a lot of rubbing, quickly and cleanly. Where some micellars have a distinctively oily aftermath, these do not, so I don\u2019t have to wipe or wash again to get residue off. The pads have two distinct sides where one side has texture to help with removal. I hold one these on my use for a few seconds and then gently wipe downward. Most everything comes off in the first swipe. I haven\u2019t had any eye irritation with these at all.",

I am used to Lancome which honestly is the gold standard for removing anything, even the red lip stain from all over my 5 year olds face lol. This doesn't work as well as that but Lancome doesn't travel well either so I think this is a good back up choice for when I am travelling or just plain out of cotton pads. I like it and if I didn't use water proof mascara I might just switch full time to it. It is certainly more affordable.",

I use one pad for both eyes (one side each) and am amazed by how much black is on the pad after washing with a facial cleanser. I haven't tried the oil-free version, but these don't feel at all oily to me, so I don't see the need to switch. I absolutely LOVE these!",
