For my surprise, the size was even smaller than I was preparing myself and the packaging, well... glue dots on a cheap base. I was buying as a gift, so smart decision to have it ship to me instead of directly for the person. The package looks really that you spend not over $10 for the whole kit. - I didn\u2019t open the bottles, but the candle smells nice! - I don\u2019t really know if it worthy the money, but I\u2019ll try to give a better look to it before giving as a gift.",
