Great grip, good arch support, very light, and you can not beat that BOA system! You can not feel the wires unless you over tighten it which then your foot would be in pain just like if you were to do it with laces. Totally would buy again and might even pick up the tan ones!",

The bizarre and tacky-seeming lacing cable is downright saved by the 'BOA' emblem on the knob, which suddenly makes it totally fine. The caveat is - I will try to explain this - that same knob where the tightening/loosening of cables is done, will not be super fun if you like to curl both ankles together and do 'drumming' with your foot while seated, like architects or violin players, etc. because the knob goes straight into your ankle and you don't expect it. So, don't do that! lol Overall excellent!",

I have also been a big fan of Under Armour running shoes so I expected these hiking shoes to be fantastic - and they delivered....almost. I made the mistake of assuming that sizing would run true across all the brand's shoes, which was a mistake. My men's 11.5 are just a wee bit too tight in the toes - not enough to send them back, but next time I'll make the jump to a 12. Other than that they are fantastic - and I would highly recommend them!",

It's easy to adjust and hold your foot firmly on the shoe. I'm very happy with my purchase.",
