The only difference i have noticed between this one and past ones I have owned, is that it won\u2019t click on to a cart so it has to be set in the bottom part (basket) leaving very little room for groceries. Overall, I am very happy with the purchase.",

For example, in one click, you can \"flatten\" it for travel, but we leave it ready to go out the door and haven't transported it in the car. The infant insert will hold a little one from 4 to 30 pounds, which is nice. The tires are rubber and very sturdy but smooth riding for my grandson. This is the best jogging stroller we've ever had. We especially appreciate the quality and when the time comes to stow it away, we will appreciate the storage size.",
