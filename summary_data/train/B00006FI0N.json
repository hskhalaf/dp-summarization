The program uses this cool \"IP Caller ID\" thing (not their terms), but it traces the intrusion source geographically, plots it on a map, then gives you the Provider's name to report the attack. So far, it traced attacks to L.A., NJ, and China. I must say the piece of mind this product provides is certainly worth the free post-rebate pricetag. It did bring my available resources from ~85% to about 63-58%. I have broadband, so it's not a killer, but I refrain from running the virus-blocker, doing manual scans instead.
