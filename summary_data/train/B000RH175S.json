If you use the top flat sheet, I imagine this particular problem would be lessened (we choose not to use the flat sheet). They get two stars instead of one because they seem to be at least mildly durable (minus the pilling) and would probably be great for a guest room.",

      "text": "At first I thought these sheets would work. I'm sensitive to cotton so silk sheets are the only ones I've used in the last five years. When my favorite silk sheets ripped, I didn't want to pay that much for a replacement set. Enter satin. I washed them and they washed beautifully. I put them on my bed and the first night was ok. The second night they started slipping off. Every morning, I put the bottom sheet back on. I found myself waking up at night twisted in too much fabric. Bottom line, the sheets don't stay on the bed. Back to silk. Sigh.",

While the fitted sheet appears deep pocketed, it won't stay put for more than a few days without adjusting. - Slippery sleeping surface. It sounds silly, but the slickness of these sheets make it hard to keep your body and pillows to stay where you put them.",
