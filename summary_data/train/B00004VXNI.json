Very powerful. You can pick up even farther out with the RF knob that comes with it. We have a hustler white antenna with it. Tuned it with an srw or SWR meter. This thing works so well it's better than my bigger CB in my big truck. I'm thinking of picking up another one of these to put in my pickup truck. Again very impressed. Plan on buying another one.",

When the switch is on PA it will send all CB transmissions out to the PA speaker, my solution is to turn the squelch all the way up to prevent unwanted sound coming out of the PA. 2. The CB to PA switch itself acts up. Sometimes I have to wiggle it in order to use the PA speaker. Not a big deal considering the overall price of the unit. I can still yell at people in traffic.",

The mic in the picture that comes with it is really small too which makes the CB seam bigger. With a speaker that will fit in the housing, it has to be small. If the bottom, where the speaker is located is not blocked, it helps. Unless you want a expensive galaxy or something, this CB is okay. The small size is nice and it's not complicated. If I'm talking to someone in the range of about 2.5 miles, the sound is pretty clear.",

In PA mode you can control how loud the sound comes out. Also if you have it tuned to a station on the CB, it'll play everything through the loud speaker.

I dropped the firestick it came with and ran a new cable to a Wilson flex antenna. Im not a radio guy but I had it peaked and tuned and I am glad I got the unit with the gain control as it does seem to bring that distant signal in just enough to make it out.",
