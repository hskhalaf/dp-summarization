I'm not going all-in on rating due to the fact the canopy arrived with a sewing defect. They wouldn't replace parts but are sending a total replacement that I will swap out the canopy. I will update my ratings if it arrives and is 100% sewn. The top feels heavy otherwise and the tent is attractive when set up.",
