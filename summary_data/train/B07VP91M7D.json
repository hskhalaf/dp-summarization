Disappointing. For \u00a3160 I exepected better from this company and now I will have to search for a new pair.

I also find that I need to take them out of my ears occasionally while running due to them trapping sweat in my ear...not pleasant.",

The only downfall is the absence of the repeat/shuffle option on the Jaybird app. I still don\u2019t understand why this hasn\u2019t been resolved yet as it is a key feature for any music player. If they can come up with an update which adds these features, I\u2019d probably say they are the BEST earphones on the market. I\u2019ll highly recommend this product.",
