The wrist band that comes with the phone is super convenient, I thought it was tacky at first but I tried it and I\u2019ve yet to drop my phone. The only thing I\u2019ve noticed.... I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s due to the case or the water pressure, but the phone doesn\u2019t register my touch on the screen when I try to tap or slide it. But I just do what I have to do before I go under. I highly recommend this case!",

The price is reasonable and it cheaper than spending money on a new phone.Overall I think it a great product and highly recommend it.",

Bottom line, if you never need to remove your iPhone 6 from this case, then it could be good for you, too bad the design does not allow for trouble-free reassembly.",

In order for someone to understand me I had to put them on speaker phone and talk directly into the microphone. Unless the company can find a way to prevent this from happening with their case I would go with a different brand case. Now I\u2019m stuck with this case and I had to order a different brand to protect my phone. I guess live and learn.",

My previous Lifetime case\u2019s covers were made out of plastic that were sturdier than the rubber. I was able to unscrew the cover for the ear jack that seemed more secure.",

I lost the one that I just lucked out to find that fit and have bought tons of cords to try and replace it. I now continue my search but in the meantime have to open the case every night....a major hassle. It would be perfect if the hole could be a bit bigger",

The case itself was very durable and saved my phone from the many drops to the ground and kept my phone safe in water. However, the earphone jack isn't big enough to plug in a chord so that was inconvenient. The fingerprint worked but it often took more than one try. I also got complaints about people saying I was muffled and hard to hear.",
