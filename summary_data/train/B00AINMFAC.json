He used to be limited to cold showers as any type of heat on his body would cause a painful reaction especially on his beard and groin. He still avoids hot showers due to bad reactions but has been able to take warm showers for years since I introduced him to this product. It hasn't cured him, as he still needs to occasionally use the product and avoid very hot things, but it has definitely increased his quality of life (no more cold winter showers!). The first bottle lasted about 2 years before he needed more.",

Expensive shampoo I had been using made hair feel and look great but left too much residue on my scalp. The new combo...Nizoral followed with a bit of Humectress... does the trick of a more thorough and clean dandruff shampoo and great feeling hair. In fact, even better. Beats the expense of a prescription and so far, even better results. Easy to get here on Amazon. Highly recommend.",

No matter what I tried- psoriasis shampoos and gels, natural home remedies, supplements or any other techniques to reduce my itching and flaking, this is the first product that helped remove the \u201cskin\u201d residue that usually stays stuck in my hair. The itch is still mild, but I have only washed my hair once with the shampoo. The scent is very light, almost has an Irish Spring smell to it with a little menthol, but honestly it\u2019s not as bad as other have described.",

You have to make sure you work it into the scalp really good and let it sit for a few minutes before rinsing.
