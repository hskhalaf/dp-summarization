The stand in the back is a little tough to pry out and it seems a little flimsy (not entirely sturdy). Otherwise, I am very happy with this purchase.",

It doesn't cover the camera, but it still kind of bothers me that it's not centered.",

With typical kid use it has proven itself time and time again. One negative, the rubber flaps that cover the charger area and volume buttons eventually tore off. They lasted 6-8 months and with it being used with kids I am not surprised. Will still be purchasing a second one for the newest addition to our Apple family.",

      "text": "the rubber part of the three layers is alittle lose and sometimes comes detached, but it's easy to push back on and doesn't effect usage very much. this is the second case i bought for an additional iPad i bought and i've been ever happy with both. it's cheap, it works, and it comes in many different colors. i will definitely buy a third one if i buy another iPad.",
