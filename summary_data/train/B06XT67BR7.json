I use this for work as a dual monitor set up on each side of my desk. My Acer monitor with similar design with difference fork mount rock solid. The Samsung stands wobbles when I type and had to bolster the stand by placing something under the bevel to keep it from wobbling. Probably ok if your sitting back using it to play games with a wireless controller but if you are typing you might want to get one with a better stand.",

Samsung was happy to send a new power supply. That is making me wait... I may update this review when I can actually take an on the monitor on. Anyone know of a Versa mount for this monitor?",
