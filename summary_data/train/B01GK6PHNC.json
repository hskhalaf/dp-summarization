I had a great experience with the very first version of the Gemini and it's cushion. This version is far worse and irritates your back ankle if you're not careful. The original Gemini shoe was very good for distance running. This one is far from it. I guess it's okay if you're just trying to lift weights at the gym, but you'll need socks that can protect the back of your ankle.",
