I had to get a stand for it so it would vent better but it works fine. for the money I recommend it. =============== Update : =============== Bought modem on 11/11/2013 by 03/23/2015 the Modem has a flashing light on the power and the router no longer works. Since its 1 year and 4 months its now out of warranty. Changed rating from 4 star to 1 start because I had plenty of other routers that are still working after a year. I will not buy another Router from WD.",

Got it to work with two WD bridges, and the connection is not as reliable as I hoped: after a power outage, they don't seem to connect properly, and I had to reset the bridges every time, even though I tried connecting both manually (WPA key) or through WPS. It turns out the solution (after a lot of Google searching) is to set the router's 5GHz channel to 40. After this change, the connection to the bridges persists.",
