I am female, nearing 70, and had no problem putting it on and tweaking the sides to ensure that there weren't any gaps where the screens meet in the middle. I purchased the white screen to match my new white single french door. This is a personal thing for me, but I wish the magnets were also white instead of black. I was so tempted to try to spray paint them white, through the seam material, but that was temporary moment of Should I, Would I, Could I? NOT!",

Also my door is metal and attracts the magnets. The upper area is small so you have to go through it carefully. Pros: the magnets attach great and the installation was a breeze. I used the tacks and it\u2019s set. The glue is strong so I suspect it will peel off the paint from the frame if I remove it.",

It seemed to be more sturdy than the first one I put on the second floor window (38\" wide). They also sent me a replacement so I can try on my other window. Will update again when I have time to put it up. Just hate those flies!!",

So this is not a long term solution at all. I think what happens is that the material weathers and deteriorates on the edges first, and that causes the magnets to fall out. The when they dont stay together straight the mesh gets worn as it flexes and that breaks apart.",

It was easy to install, fits perfectly. If you line it up just right for your door, the magnets are perfectly flush to make it look really nice. We got this to use for leaving the door open for the dogs and they understood how it works instantly. Easy to clean too since the dogs make the bottom dirty. Keeps the bugs out! We'll see how it hold up over the next season. Wish I would have ordered this sooner.",

It holds so well, that I've not removed them.",

      "text": "Every year I have to buy a new screen. This one seems the sturdiest. The Velcro and glue strip are wider and very sturdy. I think I might be able to keep this one for a few years, time will tell. It also gives you a little more material, so you don't have to stretch it to make it fit. I found this to be a problem with other screens.",

Measurements were spot on buuut it needed a little more slack to work properly. We also had to staple the outside up instead of just the sticky/Velcro for it to stay. Otherwise great! The netting is sturdy and product is well made material.",
