When I recieved it, I tested it with distilled water and it seemed dead on, yet my salinity readings in my aquarium seemed way too high from what I anticipated them being. So I purchsed the calibration test fluid and it showed the refractometer needed a definate adjustment. Once I adjusted the refractometer, my aquarium salinity read 1.026 as expected. I had it independently tested also and the refractometer now reads dead on with the verified test. Now that it's calibrated I love it!",

The water was at what I expected it should be. This refractor should last a good number of years. It is heavy and easy to read in any light. I would recommend this product to anyone that has a marine aquarium. I will update later to see if the refractor will keep its calibration.",
