It is thick but not too thick for all of my shoes, comfortable, stays on my feet, and at the end of a long day of miles of walking in Europe everything still smelled fresh!

      "text": "Love these socks! I've tried \"no-show\" socks before and they always slip down. These ones NEVER slip down. I wear them every day. I will say they are a little tight and can get uncomfortable by the end of the day, but I think that's necessary in order to keep them from slipping down. I am taking off one star because the toe is starting to rip. If the toe were a thicker fabric or reinforced to avoid ripping, these would be 5 stars.",
