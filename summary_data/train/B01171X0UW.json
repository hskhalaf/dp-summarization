Definitely worth the price and a must have for a Go Pro owner.",

I would rate the attachments the same quality as the original GoPro, aka pretty decent but not as good as the newer official GoPro stuff (like for Hero 4, Hero 5, etc). Some of the more fringe accessories (float, mini-tripod, selfie stick, straps) are pretty low quality, but again for the price I can't complain.

For someone who's really unsure as to which attachment to get, this massive kit will offer peace of mind in that it is cheap and you can try out many different attachments. I personally find myself using the chest mount a lot for fishing and the head mount for hiking. The selfie stick has come in handy as well as the giant yellow floating handle for days at the swimming hole. I still have pieces I have not used, there is so many!",

The entire package fits in a nice zippered case to keep things together. The items are well-make and provide strong security.

But it's still very good quality. I'd buy this again - most like the suction cup, clamp, selfie stick (not something I'd buy separately but this one is good quality also), mini tripod. I wouldn't have use for the wrist strap, floating handle, or head strap, but they are made well, and would work great if you do.",

My other gripe (but what do you want for the low price?) is the quality of the case: it is fine on the outside, but inside it has very flimsy foam which does not match any of the accessories, you have to find your own creative way of using (or not) the foam dividers...

The clip connector is robust and secures to straps. The other connectors offer several mountable options, though they could be stronger.

      "title": "So many accessories!",
      "text": "So I was looking for gopro accessories and most of them are very expensive and don\u2019t come with that many accessories. I was looking at reviews on this product and the reviews are pretty good. I ended up purchasing this because of the price and the amount of accessories it has. It is an extremely good value for the price! Everything works as it should. No issues whatsoever with any of the accessories. They seem to be of good quality, but only time will tell. Give it a try, it\u2019s less than $20 for a crazy amount of accessories!",

I was grabbing something and heard it crash into the driveway and seen my gopro laying on the ground. the head mount and chest mount seem sturdy as well as the other mounts. my only complaint is the suction cup and tripod are garbage .",

I stabilized the contraption by inserting enough sponge in the area between the bottom of the strap bracket and the top of the helmet. I can keep updating my review if I get to use other accessories.",

The body holster is good for a small/medium person....a big,big person can hang it up. Use the suction cup holder in a car, never outside a car.
