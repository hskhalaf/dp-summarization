      "text": "We recently acauired an unplanned fish so I needed a cheap filter for a 10 gallon fish tank quick. I also wanted one that was relatively quiet. This one was the cheapest and it had relatively good reviews, so I decided to try it, and I'm glad I did! After plugging it in, it made noise for a few seconds, but then went completely silent. It took only a few minutes more to clear up the water. Finally, the water flow was strong enough to circulate the whole tank without being so strong it pushed the fish around. I would recommend.

My only complain is that the disposable filter is suppose to last a month but that might be the case for a fish tank, but for a turtle, after only 10 days the filter is already brown with turtle waist and the water flow is almost nonexistent. The disposable filters cost 7.5 dollars for a 12 pack which means that a hole year of filters will run for 15 dollars. Pretty cheap considering the fact that other pets have very hight maintenance.",

Sure enough I came home today and my he had been sucked into the filter and killed, his fins ripped to bits. Seriously DO NOT BUY THIS.

They are more powerful than standard back-of-the-tank filters, are much less likely to become clogged, and since it is a single piece, much easier to clean. It can hang at an adjustable level, making it ideal for both aquariums and turtle/newt setups. I have them in use for turtles as well as standard aquariums, and am thrilled. Obviously, in the turtle tanks there is more of a trickling, waterfall effect, so it is louder but not unpleasant. Definitely worth purchasing!",

I hadn't bought one for some time and I see they have somewhat changed the design of how they hang on the tank. Not sure how I like the new design. It works fine. Maybe even better than the old.

We tried it again, replacing the filter cartridge and cleaning the filter and the same thing happened again. I guess that's what happens when you cheap out.",

I am currently setting up my 55 gallon for an Oscar and will be using whisper filters in it as well. They will be two of the bigger ones. will review those once i get it all set up and let you know.Also filter bags are available locally for me and live in a very small town so a good be you can find them local as well as plenty on amazon.",

Recently, a fish of mine got stuck in between the pinch point of the filter and glass, which is tight, and he died. If you don\u2019t have any particularly small fish that could either get sucked into the intake vents or get stuck between the filter and glass, I would recommend this product highly.",
