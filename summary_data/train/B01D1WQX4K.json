ALSO: these are tiny candleabra bulbs, yes, the tiny ones, again, VERY misleading. When searching for future products, I will make sure I do not choose anything from this company; just an overall bad experience.",

It gives off plenty of light so I can see my clothes from one end of the closet to the other. I love the warm glow of the light bulb and the shade. I also like the fact that it has a pull down off and on switch. It was very easy to install.",
