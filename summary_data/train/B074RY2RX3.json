The bag is deep enough for a couple of outfits and has all of the smaller compartments for toiletries, Kindle, snacks, or whatever one needs to take. Being a diaper bag it has an insulated bottle holder for my water bottle, and a side compartment for wipes, which I use for sanitary wipes. It's narrow enough not to be bulky and has both a handle and shoulder strap and, of course is stylish.",

Love having the wipes available from the outside, it can fit my wallet, phone, water bottle, thermos, formula, multiple diapers, multiple outfits - everything I need in the smallest bag possible. My only complaint is that it has a funky plastic smell to it, but after a week the smell is fading and almost gone. Highly recommend. A good price too! Hoping it holds up well over time!",

I\u2019m really glad my husband and I searched on amazon for this diaper bag instead of settling for one in store. This has so much space, is comfortable on the shoulder, and so much more!
