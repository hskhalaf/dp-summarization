Once outside temp gets to around 38-40F the fan shuts off even with the thermostat at the lowest settings. That will not be an issue for most, but I like my room COLD. I added a switch to selectively bypass the adjustable thermostat if I so choose...which for me, is always. The product works well and is fairly quiet. I am happy with it.",

If the current temperature is hovering around the designated temperature setting you have set (for example, 80 degree temperature setting), the device will constantly turn on and off every few seconds.

      "text": "This is a QUIET fan with useful functions. One interesting feature is the ability to pull OUTSIDE air IN with one fan while pushing ROOM air OUT with the other. And vice versa. (For US it also seems to function perfectly when inverted. This was necessary to reach a just-a-few-inches-too-far-away outlet.) It is quieter than the dual window fan we had for several years previously. (a WindDance) The larger diameter fans move more air but without being noisier. My wish would be for the individual fans to have at least a BIT of airflow steering adjustability-maybe pivots top and bottom?",

If you set it to the same temperature it is outside, say 65, it will pop on and off every ten or fifteen seconds. It may even shut off, turn on to high (it always goes to high first), then to low, then off again in the span of 10-15. I do not recommend this product. I wish I had bought the cheaper model.",

My only complaint is the touchy thermostat, which turns the fans all on or all off - there's no slow mode or happy medium, which causes the fans to strobe on and off. This can be distracting for sleeping, and I never use the feature, just setting the fans to low or high as needed. Otherwise, I highly recommend them.",
