After a few months some of the plastic parts started to squeak/rub a little but it wasn't too much of an issue, even though it was annoying. Unfortunately the problem got worse and now, while I can use them at my desk when sitting still, I can't walk around in the things because they squeak so annoyingly.

They also sound good on the PC and smartphone. And the design is also nice, got a lot of compliments. Was tired with the standard black headphones so I chose silver. I can wear them outside without feeling (too) geeky. They are comfortable in every aspect, minus the fact that my ears sometimes get sweaty while wearing them outside (but that happens with any over-years). I had to choose between these and Audio-Technica ATH-MSR7, and I'm very happy with my decision.",

I've compared it alongside a pair of Bose QC 25s. While the Bose has really (really!) good noise isolation, the audio quality of the MDR-1Rs are still noticeably superior. I was skeptical when I first bought the product, being on the verge of returning it due to no volume control function for iOS devices (or any devices in that manner), and having never bought any Sony headphones before, the Sony MDR-1Rs definitely gave me a great impression of the company's audio products. Would recommend to anyone with a little extra pocket money to spare.",

Perfect for DJing too if like me you like to monitor enclosed and the cups provide really good isolation.
