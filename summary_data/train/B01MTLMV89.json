      "text": "So I had been streaming for a while and the mic was picking up every single sound. (hold on, read more) I was furious and returned them for a new pair and it did the same thing! Well guys, it was an operator error. My OBS software had been using my webcam mic the whole time. I set it to the HyperX Cloud headset mic and oh...my god....no more loud kids in the background. No more picking up my keyboard typing...it was finally silent! Only my voice could be heard! I'm extremely happy with this headset. It's cozy (even with glasses), the sound is crisp and clear, and the mic is just the best!",

      "text": "The quality of the audio and comfort of the set doesn't mean much when the sound is constantly clipping and static-y due to the delicate volume adjuster on the cord. Touch it ever so slightly, or say move you body just a smidgen and you'll brush against the chest high volume wheel that isn't weighted against anything. A millimeter of movement is enough to lower the volume, which would be annoying enough, but it causes the sound to be uneven and clip out of one ear, leaving the other playing at near full volume. I've had these less than 2 months, gentle use.",

But right from the beginning the inline volume control was touchy and would cause static if it moved at all (e.g. from brushing against my shirt). It's only gotten worse over time, to the point where the other night I ripped the headset off in frustration and just used the default input/output on my laptop because I couldn't hear the other people I was gaming with. I'm surprised Wirecutter still recommends this as their top pick. My advice: Stay away, far away. This was a waste of money.",

Other headsets tend to get uncomfortable and hurt the top of my head after only a short while. Also, I wear glasses and was worried that these would get uncomfortable because of that however I've got no complaints. Totally would recommend these to anyone looking for a solid headset.",

I have all settings correct on all voice programs that I use (Discord, TeamSpeak etc), I can hear everyone else, they can't hear me. I plug in another headset and they hear me fine. So, bad mic. Not good considering the price and it's only been 6 weeks. I will give it a few weeks here and either update to 5 stars if the manufacturer honors the warranty and corrects the problem in a suitable way, or 1 star if I have an $80 paperweight.",

      "text": "Sound quality is reasonable for what you pay for. Not worse than competitors, but not much better. However, the inline audio control leaves much to be desired. The volume wheel creates scratchy feedback when used, and some positions of the wheel mute either one earcup or the other. The mute switch for the microphone will not mute audio input, but will only make it quieter. Further, regardless of whether the microphone is muted or not, there is a great amount of bleedthrough when using the mic--if in a voice call, other members of the call will hear the user's audio output. Attempting to exchange the product for a second one under Kingston's warranty did not solve the issue.",

The volume control is convenient and easy to use and the headphones themselves are comfortable for hours of use. They do not provide noise cancellation, but when I play a brown noise track they are very effective at blocking out talking even right next to me. Perfect for working in a noisy cube farm. I don't have need for the mic much, but listeners said that my voice was clear the one time I tried it. I like that the mic is removable. The carrying case is very convenient too and has an outside pocket.",

I've worn it for several hours with no discomfort, and there is no slipping/falling off of my head, like my other headphones and headsets tend to do. Great job, Kingston. You guys made a pretty darn good headset that was affordable.",

(that way you can just replace that cable if it dies) 2. The Mute button were on the headset itself (and not on the dangling cord). But for what I paid for this thing, I'm still happy with it.",

I was not aware when I purchased these that they did not support side town ( which is the ability to hear your own voice ), which is the reason for my four star review. The packaging is incredible, quality is obvious, I would certainly buy these again. If you need to side tone, they must be coming out with a model which supports it in the near future. Just be aware the feature does not exist in this particular set.",

Plus it seems to have good sound quality (both mic and earphones) from what he's say and what I've observed myself the short time I used it. Since I don't own it and haven't used it more than a few minutes, its difficult for me to say its better/worse than any other headsets at this price hence the 4 stars. But at the $75-80 price range its currently set at on Amazon, I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better headset.",

It is very comfortable and doesn't slide around on your head or loosen up as you wear it. It is constructed well and feels very durable in your hands. There are better ones out there but you'll have to pay out the nose for those. Hands down this is the best PC gaming headset under $100, and personally I think it could beat some of the more expensive ones.",
