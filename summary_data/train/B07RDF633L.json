Similarly, the magnet intended to hold the bits in is so weak it can't do the job properly. You're better off spending a little more for higher quality items",

The bits have a magnet at the bottom to stay into the handle of the tool, but if there was one at the top of the bits too, my specific job would have actually been much easier and I have seen cheaper and less quality tools with that capability and I think it's a must for opening up computers at least.",
