I installed one on the right side and left the Kicker tweeter on the left side to compare. Played some rap, rock and acoustical music and my attention kept turning towards the the Fosgate tweeter. It sounded more natural and clearer. Took the Kicker tweeter out and put the Fosgate tweeter in and was satisfied with the sound quality. I highly recommend these if you want something that sounds natural and clear. I used the -4db input on the crossover if anybody wants to know.",

These are 60 RMS and I don't have an amp on them and they sound amazing (had to adjust the treble down actually). The system will get a full upgrade with amps, but these will probably stay as part of the upgrade! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
