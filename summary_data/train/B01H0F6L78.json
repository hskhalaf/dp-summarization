If left for a few days on plastic containers, I have to scrub a little to get the markings off, but glass is a breeze! I don't recommend these for containers that will have condensation..I've accidentally wiped the hot pink on my shirt too many times already. Haven't used the stencil yet, but for the price this is a fantastic set of wine glass markers!",
