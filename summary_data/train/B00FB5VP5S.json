However, parts of it are a source of frustration. The swing really isn't deep enough for a critter to swing in it, and the strings that are supposed to hold the swing up don't stay put. Likewise, the big slide doesn't stay put either. My daughter likes the treehouse but it really needs improvements. For the price, I expected better design.",

The slide works well for the animals. My son-in law ended up gluing the swing ropes to the swing, as they keep coming off. tree top swivels and comes off occasionally.",

They should make it so that once you put it together it stays together. A few loose pieces would be understandable, but with so many to the point it falls apart while the child is playing...it's a waste. We don't even use it with the older kids because of this :( And those \"filler\" pieces are nothing but choking hazards. Less is sometimes more.",

It looks like she will have a lot of fun playing with the critters and all of the small play pieces that came in the set. We originally looked at just the treehouse but immediately decided that it was worthless without the critters and all of their pieces. The idea is the imaginative play that comes from the critters with all of their pieces in the treehouse.",
