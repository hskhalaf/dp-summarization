It is easy to clean; the top and sides look like stainless, but shows no fingerprints. It works great as a countertop because it is compact, and has a lovely plain front. No big logos. Be sure and understand the interior size of this oven, because some cups or plates may not fit. But this was exactly what I needed. Nice looking, strong power and compact.",

Maybe it's time to spark up the old relationship.",

LG will reimburse, if I buy another one, but I'm looking at getting another brand. I can't recommend this product. As a matter of fact, I would just stay away.",
