The only thing I'd prefer would be a longer gauntlet length - if you're a new skier/snowboarder, or just someone who tends to crash a lot, you will end up with some cold wrists if you wear these for a day. The gauntlet just isn't long enough to really cover everything. Otherwise very happy with them.",

I initially was interested in the touch screen capabilities, but that when away once I got a Bluetooth headset. They work okay on a touch screen. The touch definitely registers, but it is hard to target. For gross-level actions that don't require precision, they are fine. I'd recommend buying one size up from what you think. They seem to run a bit small.",

It's nothing personal, but that's just what the highly versatile, bestselling Burton Profile Glove is: warm and weatherproof. Screen Grab sweetens the deal, offering easy surfing with any touchscreen device.\n\n * Screen Grab Toughgrip Palm for Total Touchscreen Control\n * DRYRIDE 2-Layer Fabric\n * Thermacore Insulation\n * Brushed Microfiber Fixed Lining\n * Ergonomic Pre-Curved Fit\n * Removable Wrist Leash",
