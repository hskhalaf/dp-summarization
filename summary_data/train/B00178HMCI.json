After trying numerous times to have the two pieces match up and test opening the door, we finally decided that it didn't want to work and put it away. Hopefully, this particular set of door chimes were just defective. Waiting for a response from the manufacturer for a replacement.",

First, when they go off you think, \"Bloody hell, the Luftwaffe are coming in for another run.\" There is no volume control at all, full volume all the time. I found a way around this by taping a small piece of cardboard over the emitter. Second, the adhesive on these things is wimpy. One stayed up relatively well, but the other fell back off the door within a half hour of installing it (proper method - thoroughly scrubbing the area with alcohol and allowing it to dry completely.)",

You will know when someone enters or leaves the house or room you are monitoring. I can't emphasize how better we feel knowing these are now in place. The price is nothing compared to the confident feeling you get knowing they are in place. Easy to setup and use and they come with everything you need to get started.",

No comment on that but I think that these are inexpensive enough to save you money if you are looking to pass inspection without spending a lot of money. They work well and are loud.

It\u2019s on my front door screen so that when I am in the back of my house I would be alerted if someone opened the door since the screen does not have a lock and one would not be easily put on. Seems to be sticking well with just the adhesive tape that came in the package. A perfect alarm for the cost and for my needs. I would recommend this product.",
