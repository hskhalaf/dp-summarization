Aesthetically, we wish the 2 plain kinds of tiles had been given a design like the other 3 kinds, but this is a great game. We bought a second drawstring bag to put tiles in after play, and that helps with a more smooth flow of the game. We also enjoy playing \"blind\" sometimes by shielding our boards from view - especially when playing with only two people.",

There is much to compromise or risk with choices, depending on what other players are doing. It is an engaging game that lasts a short time and the visual design is beautiful.

It's also quickly taught to friends who might be visiting. The second thing that stands out is that it is \"casually\" competitive. One reviewer described it akin to \"multi-player solitaire,\" and there is a sense that while there is competition, and some cross-player strategy, there's no \"cut throat\" sense when playing; no sending the other player back to Start, or bankrupting them, or stealing their cards, etc. This makes for inner-family play a bit more relaxed!",

A collecting items but with statistics calculation and strategy mixed in along with pure fun. And the look! All these colorful tiles with quality player cards. Love it so much I ordered the collection tiles and the joker tiles to make the game even more unique. Buy without reserve.",

It also plays very well with just two people, unlike some \"2-4\" player games that are really only fun when you get 4 people to play. Very pleased.",

HIGHLY recommend this game for people who enjoy Monopoly/Scrabble/Uno and other low-lift games as well as for people who like significantly more strategization (e.g. Carcasonne, Setllers of Catan, Killer Bunnies... and maybe anyone who buys all the games that win French and German gaming awards each year. ;) ).",

We've only played the base game so far, but I'm also anxious to try the variation where where the board is empty and you can pick where you put each type of tile.

The second time we played went much faster; by that point, too, we had strategies and understood what would actually matter.

There are not a lot of rules to remember...the kids didn\u2019t have any trouble!",

Add to that the hint of luck and heap of strategy required to win, and this is truly a great game. It\u2019s also aesthetically beautiful, adding to the joy of playing. Highly recommend!",

This game is as fun to play as it is to look at, and the tacticle sensation of the resin tiles is a pleasing thing that you can't experience with a phone app. As an added bonus, the price on Amazon a little more than half the price in retail stores.

    "description": "Azul was designed by the world famous, award winning game author Michael Riesling. Azul captures the beautiful aesthetics of Moorish art in a contemporary board game. Players compete as artisans decorating the walls of the royal Palace of Dvora. By carefully drafting the correct Quantity and style of tiles, the most clever of artisans plan ahead to maximize the beauty of their work (not to mention their scores!) while ensuring they wasted no supplies in the process. Introduced by the moors, \"azulejos\" (originally white and blue ceramic tiles) were fully embraced by the Portuguese, when their King Manuel I, on a visit to the Alhambra Palace in Southern Spain, was mesmerized by the stunning beauty of the Moorish decorative tiles. The King, awestruck by the interior beauty of the Alhambra, immediately ordered that his own Palace in Portugal be decorated with similar wall tiles. As a tile laying artist, you have been challenged to embellish the walls of the royal Palace of Dvora.",
