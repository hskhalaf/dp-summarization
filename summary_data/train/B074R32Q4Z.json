This resin is much thicker than any other brand of resin i've had but it works the best. The bubbles are minimized greatly and the casting is amazing when finished. I will be buying from here again. I do wish the sizes were larger but both half gallons mixed together makes one full gallon of resin I bought this a second time now and it really it the prettiest resin i've ever used it has a sheen to it that's so beautiful",

For context: I used it for casting smaller objects. It felt really thick from the start and bubbles took to it very easily. At no point was it clear but instead had a haze. It hardened fine but was not as self leveling as I like and again had a terrible haze. If you're using this for painting or mixing pigment maybe these issues wouldn't matter. For casting when a crystal clear finish is expected I would highly suggest avoiding this product.",

I\u2019ve ordered the gallon kit twice now, and both times the product arrived in perfect condition. Each bottle has a screw on cap, a foil seal under the cap, and for added security, the caps are taped on. Although this is a somewhat pricey medium to play with, the results are well worth it and highly addictive.",

The resin is easy to pour and to mix. I have been using Art N Glow resin because it is the first resin I've bought that has cured as advertised, and I have been very satisfied with the results. My purchase also came with a discount coupon for my next order, which is the extra touch that caused me to leave this review. I am very likely to purchase this item again in the future.",
