I have some form of dermatitis on my face and this soap calms it and helps. It also does really well at getting rid of odor in the armpits, which in all honesty most soaps arent fully able to for me. The only things I wish were better about it is the price for how small the bars are. 1 bar typically only lasts me about a month or so, and once you get over half way through the bar the soap gets really \"gooey\" and kind of sticky and turns into a glob.",

It lathers nicely and smells decent at best. A mix of tea tree and peppermint/mint. It's pretty strong, sometimes overbearing. It gets me clean, but seems to not help with my break outs which is way I use charcoal soaps. So far this one is the middle of the pack. The best one I've used is by Dr. Squatch, but they are mostly glycerin and don't last long. That and very expensive.",

This soap smells amazing, has great lather and does not dry my skin at all. The only flaw is the sharp corners that aren\u2019t comfortable on the skin until they wear down a bit.

I didn't even used a scrubber, yet it only lasts 9 baths. It is extremely small for such a great price.
