And I am happy. I can't think of anything I don't like about them. The bag (case) is really nice. I keep them in it. The laces take time to tie, so they wouldn't make a good shoe for short triathlons. But other than that, I like 'em a lot. I bought a 48, they feel the same size as Sidis 47, for what it is worth. Love the retro laces verses all the stupid clasps that other shoes have.",

I change shoes several times a day, and these actually have to be unlaced to put on or take off, even after they're broken in. Might not seem like much time, but it adds up. Having said that, these are probably the most comfortable, and best performing, cycling shoes I've ever owned in almost 20 years of riding road bikes. Is the added comfort worth the hassle of the laces? I guess so. Depends on how many times you have to put them on each day...",

Edit to my earlier review: BUT, the little heel pad that screws in to the bottom of the shoe has about worn out, quite understandably from scraping it when I clip-out and my shoe hits the road surface. I called GIRO and they want $25 for this little part of the shoe. C'mon, GIRO, do you really want to alienate your loyal customers by charging what seems to me to be such an absurd price for a simple little replacement part that I would guess you buy in bulk for a fraction of what you want for a replacement? GIRO, please comment.",

    "title": "Giro Empire Acc Mens Cycling Shoes",
    "description": "One glance at Giro's Empire ACC Shoes, and you'll see they're different. Rather than the ubiquitous buckle/strap combo, Giro's outfitted them with something decidedly old-fashioned -- laces. That's about where the old-fashioned nature stops, though. The uppers are a single piece of Evofiber microfiber, which is highly breathable, but is also perforated for additional airflow. Those uppers are attached to an ultra-stiff Easton EC90 ACC Carbon Sole. This sole is among the stiffest available, and due to high grade of carbon fiber used in its construction, is also one of the slimmest, producing a stack height of just 6. 5mm. Between the uppers and the sole sits Giro's lauded SuperNatural FitKit, the long name for its user-tunable footbed. These insoles have swappable arch support so you can tune the fit of your shoes precisely to your feet.",
