These are the first black ones I have perchased and they are extremely cute! They are just as expected in style and comfort. I usually wear between a 6 1/2 and a 7. I bought the 7 they do seem a bit smaller than my last pair. They are a bit too tight and are slightly uncomfortable, Yet from previous perchases I believe they will stretch to a more comfortable size. Quality and style are great though!",

      "text": "I am normally a 7, sometimes 7.5 depending on the brand. I ordered a 7.5 based on reviews. They were fitting ok with gym ankle socks on, and with no socks, my heels slipped out, and I knew this material would eventually stretch. So returned for the 7. They came and I've been wearing for about 3wks now: The were snug in a good way with socks, and fit great without. As suspected, they have already stretched a bit but still perfect. They are so cozy and I love them!",

They have changed these since my first purchase and not for the better. They look and feel cheap and the fit is not anywhere near the same. These were promptly returned.",

At first I thought it was too loose but was able to tighten it and they were so darn warm and comfortable! I mostly wore these around the house and a few times outside. They are fine for making errands or walking short distances but aren't great if you plan on being in them outdoors for long periods of time. The sole isn't as great so it's not comfortable for walking outside on hard concrete floors but they are ideal indoors.",

My wife reports that they remain comfortable. The slippers have not stretched out of shape. Overall these are good slippers made with quality materials. Buy with confidence.",
