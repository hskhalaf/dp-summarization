She cant use it at all as way too painful on her suffering body, and as much as I use it and even sleep on it at the max temperature, it is just like a long heating pad with the extra discomfort of the crystals. It does not help my pain levels. I was soooo hopeful due to the great reviews, and just glad i didn't purchase a big size straight away. I am happy it works so well for some people, but wonder how many people are also not helped at all, and don't post reviews. :( :(",

If you haven't tried one before, heads up, this is not a soft mat, this mat is filled with heating cords and is only as soft as the outer cover. With this being said, it is still easy enough to relax on and is enjoyable enough to use every day.",
