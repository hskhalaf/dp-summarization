To correct another reviewer, there are Velcro strips attached at the bottom of each piece, and it comes with 4 wider Velcro strips that are unattached and span the distance from one Velcro strip on one piece to another Velcro strip on the other piece, thereby connecting them. When all pieces are velcro'ed together, the set is stable and does not slide.",
