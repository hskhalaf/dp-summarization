      "text": "The laptop arrived pretty fast with amazon prime. Overall the laptop is great, it can handle any game on ultra with great frame rates. The only issue i have with it is that the fans aren't great as they get pretty loud when gaming, it's fine if you wear headphones but i still wish the cooling was better. Seller - 10/10 Laptop Design - 10/10 Laptop Performance - 10/10 Laptop Cooling/fans - 6/10 Overall - 8.5/10 I recommend this laptop because I bought it for \u00a3880 which is pretty good for a laptop with a GTX 1060",

Its understandable with the hardware that the fans kick in pretty loud when gaming, but most gamers have headsets, so this issue is definitely not a deal breaker Laptop has great specs for the price, especially with that 120hz screen, game slook great, hit 100+ GPS on most games at high settings, cpu can occasionally be a bottleneck on some new aaa and early access titles, but that a steal for shy of 900 pounds.",
