Main defect in the set is the fact that the \"16oz shaker\" is way too small to be of any use and it doesn't seal with the \"28oz shaker\" either. Also, the description of the jigger did not specify a measurement size. Comments by other buyers stated they had received a 1oz jigger. I received a rather unexpected 1 1/4 oz jigger. All of the other pieces in the set are of expected quality for the cost.",

I haven't use anything else from the set and I probably wont... but its really good for the price. Cons: In making anything with shaker full of ice - the shaker gets too cold",
