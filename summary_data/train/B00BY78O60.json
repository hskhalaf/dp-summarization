I was aware that the picture and product description did not match, but I expected the product listing to be accurate. We did receive some of the products in the picture that weren't in the listing. This is a beautiful gift if you are willing to be surprised by the contents. However, I had searched for a gift that would meet the tastes of my gift recipients and that didn't happen. I feel that a contents may vary disclosure should have been included. If so, this item would warrant a five rating.",

We tried almost all of the products and here's the result: crackers were dry and stale, chocolates tasted bitter, cookies were tasteless and crumbled to bits, hummos was a tiny individual tub that was watery and said on the label that it was not to be sold individually. The only thing about the gift basket that was remotely good was the container, which was very thin metal but looked okay. VERY disappointed in this gift and would NEVER order from this company in the future.",
