At first I ordered the small but found it didn't quite fill the vehicle car seat to the door so when my dog put her feet on the edge to look out the window, the edge of the car seat would fold over. Though she was secure with the seat belt, (the strap that comes with the pet car seat which you attach to the seat belt and dog's harness), it wasn't much fun for her if she couldn't look out the window. So I returned it for the medium which is perfect. I've washed it once so far and it washed well and was fairly easy to take the cover on and off.",

She is very comfortable in it and can lay down and sleep if she wants. It has a strap to attach to her harness for extra safety. I highly recommend this if you have to do any traveling.",

I used her usual harness, hooked the strap around the seatbelt, and she stayed in it. Trust me when you put the seatbelt through the groove in the back, this thing won't move. I ordered the medium and it fits her well. We are taking an 8 hr road trip up into the Colorado mountains which is why I wanted this. We use it all around town now. She loves being able to look out. Great purchase.",
