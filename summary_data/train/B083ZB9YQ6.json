I purchased the $999 model with 512 gb of storage and a whopping 16gb of memory with an i5 processor. The screen is probably about 280 to 290 nits...with great color saturation. I use linux, android, and web apps and they all work well. I would definitely recommend this machine over any of the others out there. The fan rarely kicks on and the machine is thin, light and does not give off very much heat. If you want a premium chromebook that will handle anything that you throw at it. Look no further.",

      "text": "I use this Chromebook as my everyday machine and I like it very much. I have an ASUS AX router so I am using WiFi 6 for the C436 connection at 1200 Mbps and it's screaming fast. It's lightweight, trim, great screen resolution and the battery lasts all day. I have read some complaints about the keyboard and I don't use the back light feature but the keypad feels fine to me. I love all the RAM (16G) and the i5 quad core processor plus the 512G storage gives me plenty of room for multimedia storage. The sound is also quite good for such a small unit. Bottom line, I have three Chromebooks and this is by far my favorite.",

It does allow a 14\" screen in a 13\" space, but it is too easy to touch the edge of the screen, especially in tablet mode. Otherwise, I can't find anything to complain about.",

The workaround is to turn the keyboard backlight off in the daylight but that is an annoyance. The other flaw is that the laptop is actually uncomfortable to place on your lap because of the hinge design. There are some uncomfortable edges and protrusions that make it so I would only use it on a desktop for extended periods of time.",

This is definitely not a laptop you can setup and forget. It requires constant massaging to get working. We also purchased the much cheaper Chromebook Flip C214 from ASUS, and in comparison, it works like a charm. I recommend you either go for a cheaper model, or upgrade to a MacBook.
