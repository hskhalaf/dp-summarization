When I cleaned the tubing before the first use the tiny brush they included ripped one of the tubes. Then when baby does use it he gets mainly air and frustration. It also leaks and spills everywhere! I threw it in the trash only because burning plastic is not good. Otherwise I would have lit it on fire. We hate hate hate this product. Save your money and your baby\u2019s tummy and do not buy this junk!!!",

It\u2019s been a real sanity saver, especially when both babies are fussy at the same time. Another benefit is that I can hold my babies against my chest when they are eating, which allows closeness and bonding similar to breastfeeding. This is much better than the bottle prop I previously tried using, which would frequently fall out of position. There are a lot of pieces, but it\u2019s not difficult to take apart and clean. I was especially happy that a long, thin brush was included for washing the tubing. I highly recommend this product, especially for parents of multiples.",

She's drinking alot more now, can pace herself, and isn't choking on overflow! It's a bit difficult to put together but not impossible. The suction power depends on positioning and the baby's suction power. For the price, I recommend this for every new mom!",

Yes they do the job for the child but because the tubes r do soft my 8 month old sometimes bends it and puts a kink so she can't get any milk. Annoying. Also the soft tubing is so soft and stretchy that it's a pain to get it apart and together. But it does work. Lol. The lil jumbl brand bottles have a stiffer tubing that my child needs. O and the soft tube always gets hair or fuzzies attached to it. Eww",

At first he just sat and drank but eventually he kept pulling it out of his mouth. He could not pull the tube out of the nipple though, which I am very grateful for. This will not work for every feeding but it will be so helpful for car rides and busy moments when I do not have hands free. So excited!!!",

My only complaint is that the included instructions are pretty unclear and I ultimately ended up using a YouTube video to figure out how to use it the first time.",
