      "text": "I absolutely love this mattress pad!! It fits my king size memory foam mattress perfectly, it doesn't come off the corners like the other mattress pads. It has withstood many washes thru the washing machine and dryer, with no visible differences. And I can attest to the fact that it does block spills from even coming close to the mattress...it blocks them completely. I was a little concerned about spending the money on this cover, it is the most I have ever spent on a mattress pad but it was so worth it and I would buy another one in a heartbeat if I needed a new one!!",

I've had to purchase new covers twice a year bc they fall apart, don't block water, shrink, etc. It's been a challenge finding this cover. I went to department stores, outlet stores and online. I finally came back to my trusted Amazon and decided on this one and I'm happy with it. I wash according to the instructions and it still fits and prevents water leakage, very important when you have little kids and dogs! It's also quiet, while in use; for anyone wondering. It's not like one of those covers that sound like scrunched plastic beneath you. If you're looking for a cover, this is it!",

Also the terry cloth is incredibly rough. Doesnt even seem pleasant to sleep on, returned it. Paid $30 for this thing bought a fluffy serta mattress pad on sale for $35, save your money and look for a better option.",

Had an angry dog pee on the bed once, and this kept the mess on top where it could be removed and the bedding washed. Nothing made it down to the mattress! It's latex (or something similar) covered woven fabric, not plastic sheeting, so it's not hot and sweaty (ours is UNDER a mattress pad and the sheets anyway). This one seems to be of comparable quality to the one it replaced. Fits a deep mattress (ours is 15\" with an extra 3-4\" of foam toppers).",

Only reason I didn't give a 5 star is because it is a little big, but I would recommend this product.",

    "description": "Size:King| Style:Cotton Terry TopSoft, quiet protection this soft, quiet mattress protector is made from quiet, ultra-thin material that is breathable and maintains a comfortable sleeping temperature. The LUCID mattress protector has a cozy Terry fabric top surface that does not change the feel or sound of the mattress while providing excellent top-of-mattress protection against liquids, dust mites and allergens. 100 percent waterproof barrier a thin, quiet polyurethane membrane repels liquids and fluids to protect your mattress and your mattress warranty from stains. Made of safe materials, this protector is safe for children and pets. This liquid-proof barrier has tiny pores that allow air to pass for breathability and a comfortable sleep temperature. Do away with dust mites every night your body sheds millions of skin flakes and loses up to one liter of body fluid through your pores and mouth. Because they survive on dead skin cells and bodily fluids, up to 2 million dust mites can live in your unprotected mattress. Exposure to dust mites has been linked to the development of asthma in young children. Additionally, dust mites have been shown to be a leading cause of allergies and eczema. LUCID mattress protectors cut off the food supply to dust mites, making it impossible for them to survive. Deep pocket design fitted sheet-style mattress protector has a fully-elasticized skirt and deep pockets that keeps the protector tightly in place on mattresses depths up to 22 inches. Easy to put on and take off for laundering, this protector works great on extra-thick memory foam and pillow top mattresses. Machine washable keep your mattress clean and fresh by washing your sleep surface. Machine wash hot water. Tumble dry low. Do not bleach, iron or dry clean.",
