I don't know why people are saying the base is great either. It is heavy but not heavy enough that my 40-pound dog can't tip it over simply by wagging her tail against it.

I'm kinda lazy to return it, because It's heavy and I have to dis-assemble those. So I'm just using it at my kitchen when I'm cooking.

The only way to raise the iPad above the horizontal plane is to raise the telescopic stand itself. Otherwise, the stand is a very well made and sturdy (turning the rectangular base 90 degrees helps keep heavy devices from tipping).",
