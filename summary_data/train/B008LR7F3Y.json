I personally love the style of this piece too, its curvy and soft shape makes it fit in beautifully in the nursery. The shelving is thin like someone mentioned, but there are support brackets and so far I have had no issues. I'm very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend. Sarah (baby due in 1 week!)",

I questioned the durability of the shelf and table bottoms (the flat pieces) and posed a question to the group of people here on Amazon who bought it before and they assured me it is very durable. I put 4 stars still being cautious, but I will up it to 5 stars once it is baby tested! I bought a DaVinci crib too (Jame 4-in-1) and found that to be even easier to put together and very sturdy materials.",

The problem with the first one is that some of the pre-drilled holes did not align properly, making it impossible to assemble. The second one came together fine.

      "text": "I purchased this for our daughter to match an oak crib. The color is true and matches nicely. Our son in law put it together himself when the baby arrived early. I would say this became one of the most important pieces of furniture for the new parents and baby. Our daughter had complications and surgery after the birth. She said the level of the changing table is perfect and saving her much possible discomfort. It is very well constructed with plenty of room for storing baby bath and diaper supplies.",

      "text": "We bought this changing table a few months before the baby was born and my husband was able to easily put it together. A month after she was born, we noticed that the bottom of the right side had broken. Luckily the baby was not on it when we noticed this. We contacted DaVinci and they replaced the piece. A few months later, we were moving the table and the piece broke again. We have also had problems with the Emily dresser as well. We have the Emily crib and love it but will never buy anything else from DaVinci again.",
