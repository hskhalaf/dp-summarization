It\u2019s a yellowish cream color ( definitely more cream than ivory) yet it looked great in my neutral toned room. Length was perfect.

I missed the fact that the corners were not split to allow for rails connecting a footboard, but the generous amount of material allowed me to cut and seam the splits I needed to make it work. It looks great, and no one would guess it didn't come that way. I've paid more for bed skirts that weren't this pretty. Not just the eyelet, but tiny embroidered design throughout make this a much more expensive and attractive addition to my guest bedroom. Thanks!",

It is a little short, about 1 1/2 inches from the floor for my bed, but that is because I have the legs up on a 2X4 to raise my bed up higher :) It is well made and love it with the rest of my bedding.",
