HOLY CRAP. Do yourself a favor and THROW AWAY THE WALL ANCHORS this thing comes with. Don't even bother. Go to Home Depot or Lowe's and buy yourself some actual drywall anchors, otherwise you will HATE YOUR LIFE before this thing ever gets hung up on your wall. If you go out and buy better hardware, installation of this will be a BREEZE. We spent 3 hours learning this lesson the hard way. Please, if you do nothing else, HEED MY WARNING! Buy some good drywall anchors!!!!!",

The only thing we had to get used to is that the glass is a few millimeters think, and there is an distinct reflective shadow of whatever is written when you look at it from a slight angle, which is often. You get used to it and it is a minor irritation. But at least now, the markers erase perfectly with no residue left behind.",

So when I mounted it, I centered the middle mounts directly on a stud and used the drywall anchors at the corners. Seems good enough.

I'd never used the chalk markers and they proved to be a pain to deal with. Hard to erase so not good for work type board use. We turned it into a chalk marker design of our business logo and use it as a display piece but that was not the intent.",

Upon unboxing, the first thing I noticed was a layer of fine glass dust covering the entire surface. I removed it from the box and cleaned the glass with a soft damp cloth hoping for the best. I then discovered several scratches in the glass and a small white chip in the upper right corner. Back in the box it went, and the worst part is that the glass dust irritated my lungs and has caused lingering respiratory issues. Quartet, I expect better!",

The marker that came with the board works better on this board than other brand markers I have tried. It did arrive with a very small area of \"white\" missing from the corner -but for me it was not enough of an issue to bother going through a swap. Very pleased. Seems to be good quality so far. I've been using it for a few months.",
