She\u2019s meowing so loud it\u2019s like she\u2019s in heat although she\u2019s \u201cfixed.\u201d Two days later, haven\u2019t sprayed anything but she still is comfortable and playful.

    "description": "Size:20 mLIs your cat peeing outside the litter box, scratching your furniture and carpet, or hiding on a regular basis? These behaviors may be caused by fear or anxiety. FELIWAY products are a vet recommended, drug free, and clinically proven to help alleviate many of the unwanted behaviors cat owners deal with. FELIWAY Spray provides \u201chappy messages\u201d by mimicking the natural feline reassuring messages (pheromones) to make cats feel calm and comfortable at home. This product has been found to reduce scratching, spraying, and hiding for 90% of cats, and many owners see results within 7 days. Cats are also very sensitive to change, so if you anticipate changes in the home (moving, renovation, recorating, new pets, new family members, etcs.), FELIWAY is very effective in helping your cats remain calm, and adapt to the changes without unwanted behaviors. If you are having issues with spraying (peeing), after cleaning urine-affected areas, spray FELIWAY directly onto the urine marks, as well as onto other prominent objects including furniture, drapes, window frames and doorways. This helps your cat to feel calm, and reduces unwanted behaviors caused by anxiety (like peeing outside the litterbox). This will also help them to stop scratching and hiding as well. Feliway Spray is completley safe for both humans, and your cat - it is odorless and colorless. Spray away the fear, and feel calmer today! Each bottle contains up to 50 sprays.",
