We are redoing our kitchen, so I don't have a stove at the moment or not one that is hooked up ;( anyway. I got the induction burner on Amazon to use in the meantime, but then I realized all my Cuisinart and Calphalon cookware won't work on it. I needed a medium-sized pot and bought this one. I do love it though, and it looks very nice. Cooked dried beans and sausage in it and had no trouble cleaning it to its original shine. Very nice for the price.",

Also when done cooking add some water to bottom of pan and voila its rinse out without scrubbing. So glad I made the switch from teflon to Stainless Steel",

I especially appreciate the glass lid; I like to see what I'm cooking without uncovering it. And it's pretty enough to display. This is the second one I've owned. After five years of great service, I destroyed it through my own inattention. I am so pleased to have the exact same pot again.",

All metal construction allows for use in the oven. A bit difficult to clean as compared to tyflon coated but much better heat tranferance when used on electric element or induction cook tops. Haven't used on open flame, so I can not comment on that. Looks good enought to serve right out of the pot.",

I used the suggested cleaning methods which came with the pan but nothing worked. I returned it and purchased a 1 1/2 quart pot because the size was okay but it developed the same marks as soon as I cooked pasta. I have kept the second one and use it, but the marks remain. I like that they are nice heavy pots and the 3 quart one is perfect. I have no problem with that one. I'm not sure I would purchase Cusinart again.",

Even the worst looking cooked-on grease comes off easily with soap and warm water. I highly recommend all of this cookware set and am glad we bought them.",
