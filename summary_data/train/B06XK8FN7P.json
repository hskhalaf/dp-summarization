Haven't had a single disc break apart, and seem to last just as long as the big box stores. I have cut mild steel, stainless, and aluminum with these with no issues. The little amount of metal near the collet does a great job helping these grip and not spin in place. Highly recommend these!",

      "text": "One of these wheels lasted longer than 10 of the cheaper HF wheels. Installed a complete Stainless exhaust system and many other cuts with one wheel. I think it is best to store in a very dry area, high summer humidity will soften and shorten the life of any fiber cutoff or grinding wheels. I will buy the again if I ever wear out the other 19 wheels.",
