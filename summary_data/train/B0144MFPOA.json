So that means that the filter doesn't work as it should, because the ideal drinking water should be from 0 to 50 ppm. That is the reason why I returned the filer. Don't recommended!",

I know I sound like a salesperson for this product but I am not, this is a rare easy to install product that makes for much safer drinking water.

Easy to install, water taste is much improved, and I like that this model allows us to screw in a new cartridge without disconnecting any lines when the time comes. Also, have had great communication from the Woder company about our order. May 2020 We now own 3 of these for our new home and love them. Greatly improves the taste/quality of our water. Two are on faucets and 1 is on the fridge (used in combination with the fridge filter).",
