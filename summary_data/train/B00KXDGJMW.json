      "text": "This is a superb track shoe for short sprints. The design, fit, and quality were all outstanding. They came with extra laces, 1/4\" metal pyramid spikes, a spike wrench, and a great carrying bag. The bag has an inner zippered pouch for the extra laces, spikes, and wrench. The shoes have 10 spikes and a stiff sole, both of which are designed for sprints of 100m or less. On sprints with a turn, such as the 200, a shoe with a more flexible sole should be used.",

It's small and the bottom of the shoe is very close to the size of the sole of your foot, it fits tight, it's very light, and has traction from hell. I use them in an indoor track and I feel these shoes are actually taking me dangerously fast.",

      "text": "In preparation for the Senior Olympics in Tennessee I purchased the \"Showdown Track Spike Racing Shoes.\" This is a quality track shoe that provides superior traction because of the 10 spike configuration and the rigid bottom. The shoes fits and performs as advertised. About a month before purchasing this shoe I bought the Saucony \"Velocity track spike shoe\" which is also a quality shoe and much less expensive. The Velocity has a 7 spike configuration and the bottom of the shoe has some cushioning. I plan to use the Showdowns for shorter sprints (50M, 100M, 200M, & 400M) and will use the Velocites for the 800M and 1500M races.",

The actual shoe itself is very comfortable to wear and the tongue is nonexistent because the whole shoe just wraps around your foot. The spike plate is also very great and gives great response to your foot striking the ground. The laces are connected to straps which wrap around the bottom of the spike in a way similar to the Nike Flywire but more wide and not a wire at all. All in all a very great spike for a top grade athlete.",

Being older (40+) this is important. Having the shroud provides a level of security also. I have a very wide foot with a narrow heel, and the versatile lacing options catered perfectly. I use them for 60m through to 400m, and LJ. In LJ they felt like being in bare feet, and I'm not sure if it was my time or the shoes, but I started jumping consistently 30cm further. For 400m they keep me up on my toes for the full lap, (not easy at my age).",

    "description": "Saucony Showdown 3 Running Spikes Blink and you'll miss it. The Showdown is a lightweight high-end sprint spike that uses our revolutionary ISOFIT lacing system to morph to your foot for a sock-like feel. ISOFIT Upper The upper of the Showdown 3 is where Saucony have really worked their magic, totally revamping the fit and weight, whilst improving support and comfort! The long awaited introduction of Saucony's ISOFIT technology into their performance track footwear doesn't disappoint. The ISOFIT lockdown system overlaid onto an incredibly lightweight Flexifilm synthetic mesh results in a sock-like fit which hugs to the contours and shape of the foot whilst providing amazing support and lockdown onto the plate. Breathable, supportive, lightweight and comfortable, the fit of the Showdown 3 means that there will be no movement of the foot within the shoe, allowing optimal power output. Midsole To keep the weight of the shoe down, and the runner as light as possible, Saucony have used no additional cushioning technologies in this shoe. So the bulk of the work is done by the upper and the outsole to maintain high levels of performance. 10-Spike Pin Plate Outsole Continuing to utilise an aggressive 10 spike pin plate construction, the Showdown 3 provides unrivalled traction in the world of sprint spikes, promoting maximal power output from the blocks with no chance of slipping and lost momentum. Absolute confidence can be assured with every stride in the Showdown 3, guaranteeing performance to your outright potential. The full length Pebax plate in the Showdown 3 hasn't changed much in configuration and appearance from the seriously successful Showdown 2, though on closer inspection it becomes evident that Saucony have trimmed down on the bulk, without compromising on rigidity and support, considerably reducing the weight of the outsole with no detriment to the spikes performance. Overall this results in a strong and dynamic platform with incredible traction",
