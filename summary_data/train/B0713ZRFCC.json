None of the bolts, including the ones for attaching the motor to the transom are made of stainless steel. I had mine out for the first time a few days ago and then this morning I took it out only to discover that all of the screws and bolts were rusting badly. What a mess! The manufacturer made a fine motor and then scraped to save a couple of dollars by using easily rusting metal for the essential hardware.",

It is just as advertised. It has a higher output than recommended for the motor mount so I will have to put an extension on it because it pulls the mount down, it is that powerful.",
