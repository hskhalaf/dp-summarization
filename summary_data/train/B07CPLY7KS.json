They don't feel like flimsy or cheap plastic, and the clarity is amazing. They are definitely polarized and seem to block out harmful sunlight. I would give 4 stars, honestly, if they were not backed by a lifetime warranty. These glasses most likely won't last more than a year or two, but you can replace them when they break. And they're not too cheaply built. Money back guarantee, you can't go wrong. 4 stars for quality, extra star for warranty.",

Clearly an obvious manufacturing failure but they sold them anyway, boo!",

I use these for biking, mainly as windshield for my eyes, so if the day is not sunny or I bike at later hours, I would prefer to have an alternative in a lighter shade.",
