Streaming, gaming, dling without any issues. The packaging was nice. Everything was included. The interface is not as fancy as others like Trendnet or Linksys. However, because this is for business it has more actual features to adjust. Some I had to look up. This is not for a non techie. You need an understanding of networking or be able to do some googling to look up some settings. This does not do a lot of auto setup for you. You will need to configure 2/3rds of the settings.",

I've tried several and can say definitively that this is the best, most stable multi-WAN router in the consumer price range. It just so happens to also be one of the least expensive. I replaced an Asus unit that cost 3 times as much with this unit and this one is far more stable. The only con is the UI could use some updating. However, that can be said of every router I've used. Network companies need to quit letting network engineers design their UI. I'm excited to setup the syslog feature. I just don't have a server setup for it yet.",

That also makes you wonder how often it 'phones home' with your data. Having said that, I would still buy one again. When you have a question they are very quick to answer.",

The setup wizard was easy and user-friendly, and the signals were quite strong: I can still receive an excellent wifi signal even behind a solid concrete wall, and after switching on turbo mode the signals can get even better. I tried the full load-balancing utility using two identical wan connection, and the speed was somewhere between 1.5x to 2x of the original speed. However, sometimes it will drop to a very low speed, slower than using a single WAN. It may still need some adjustments in the router or adapter configurations.",
