They have a nice sheath that they come with that keeps them together and since they're smallish, I could carry them on my belt if needed. And these came SUPER sharp so perhaps the reviews I saw about them not being sharp was a fluke.",

You're better off making a custom sheath that holds both or if it doesn't bother you just go with it. The knives are still worth the price. Great set!",

The knife pokes through and due to it's sharpness I knew it was going to get worse so I put in for an exchange. The interesting thing about the stitching is that there is two lines of separate stitching and I don't see how that would stop the gut knife from cutting through. Perhaps with a tighter stitching and perhaps something at the bottom of the pocket that would prevent it from pushing through would fix the issue. I will see if the replacement has the same issue.",
