      "text": "This is a great trimmer but the speed with which it goes through line and batteries is pretty crazy. I like how the loading system is design but am concerned it will wear out because it is all plastic. I have 3 6 Amp 60V batteries and I used all three in one day to get around the house. Seems a touch excessive for what I was doing in regards to power usage. I was able to cut through 60 branches with my power saw on a single charge. I do like the electric option as I don't have to deal with 2 cycle gas anymore.",

The rub: As mentioned in previous reviews, the shield is minimal \"at best\". You are covered in grass shortly after you engage in your weed eating routine. Of course DeWalt offers an \"optional\" larger shield that you can purchase separately. Otherwise, safety glasses or a face shield is highly recommended.

The cutting head seems fine to me, other reviews said it needed swapped, only 2 uses so far. 6 ah batteries I was using last about 30-45 minutes of cutting. I also think the shield is just fine, legs get covered in grass but I expect that doing yard work. It's nice not to mix gas and have the vibration in my arms.",

Dewalt does offer a larger cover (refer to you manual for the part number) and it is a game changer. With the new larger cover this tool is a dream to use. It sucks that Dewalt does not ship this with the larger cover, and the last time i checked the only place to order it is from Dewalt. Honestly without the larger string guard I would have returned it",
