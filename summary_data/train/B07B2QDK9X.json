My original batteries only had two prongs, but reviews said these 3-prong ones would still work. Sure enough, these fit my drill, trimmers, and charger and work perfectly. The seller (Sun Power) has also had excellent customer service. When I first received these two batteries, one of them did not work, but I understand that occasionally defects happen. When I contacted them to inquire about a return, they were apologetic and said there was no need to return. They promptly shipped out a replacement without any hassle and it works perfectly.",

As for the weed trimmer edger it doe's not fit at all. For me these batteries are a waste of money.",
