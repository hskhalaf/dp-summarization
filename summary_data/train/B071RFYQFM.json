Do not use GE or EcoSmart LEDs bulbs, as they will either not dim at all or make noise when dimmed. If you plan ahead of time and have a good WiFi signal, this will work great!",

      "text": "Installed 7 WeMo dimmers in a home that was a recently completed renovation. These switches work great and have made the transition to a smart home simple. Pros: -Can still operate without a Wifi connection if necessary - Nice look, can be covered by standard outlet cover - Easy to operate, nice subtle touch of the button - Easy visual for on and off - Connects to Alexa easily for smart control Cons: - Can be difficult to connect to WiFi network in first couple attempts - Reference serial number is only found inside the light (not like the smart switch), so Document which switch is which before going active",

I also love the long press feature that allows you to toggle a different WeMo device by holding the switch for a few seconds. I have a lamp that is difficult to reach, so having this act as the remote light switch really helps. I've had many occasions where I have left the light on accidentally, and it's incredibly easy to open up the app and turn off the light.",

      "text": "Setup of the dimmer was exactly as expected. The instructions were clear and easy to follow. The only grip I have is that the dimmer does not directly integrate with Alexa/Echo like the smart plugs or the regular switch. To use the dimmer with Alexa/Echo you have to connect it via the Wemo \"skill\" which works, but it's a little slower/less responsive then direct integration. Sometimes it can take ~10 seconds for Alexa to turn my lights on since it has to first connect via the app. I can't understand why Alexa can't connect directly to this switch, as Alexa can still only turn it on or off, it cannot control the dimming functions or anything beyond a simple on/off.",

Having said that I have been using Wemo devices from the plug ins, light switches, link, and bulbs in multiple areas in my home and love their products. For anyone gun shy on using the Wemo brand devices; pull the trigger. I have been using these products well over a few years now and they just work. I was extremely excited to see the dimmer switch and will probably be adding at least a few more. I am not the type to give much of anything five stars, but I'm banking on the brand not specifically the device.",

But given the price with common use scenarios , you will still get what you paid for.",
