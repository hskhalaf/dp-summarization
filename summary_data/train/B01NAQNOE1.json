Even though it came rolled up and packaged in a box, there was a crimp in the middle of the calendar (as though it had been bent while rolled up). That means there is a permanent wrinkle across the whole calendar. It looks kind of shoddy.",

      "WET Erase vs. Dry Erase Calendars: Why do we promote Wet Erase markers? Wet Erase most importantly will not ghost or stain! No matter what any company claims - dry erase can stain or \"ghost\" due to the acids in the inks. Wet Erase is also very durable, doesn't fade and will not wipe off accidentally by rubbing against it while writing in other date blocks. Extra SwiftCalendars wet-erase markers are sold on Amazon.",
