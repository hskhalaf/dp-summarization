Really cute and beautiful design and finish (I purchased the aluminum one). Omnidirectional settings could be useful for musicians and conferences. Cons: Have to be pretty close to the mic, which could hurt your back depending on how you're sitting, so consider purchasing a boom arm, or adjusting your seat so that your mouth meets the mic. Could also pick up background noise, such as high-pitched bird chirping. Cable is two feet long. Do I Recommend: Definitely for beginners on a small budget who are thinking of doing videos or podcasts!",

The only con I can see about this mic is that it does not have a mute option on it. If you are looking for a higher end mic I prefer the Blue Yeti, for my purposes it isn't worth another $70+.",

A HUGE plus about this little guy is the fact that it's pretty much built \"like a tank\" sorta speak-- I've dropped this thing off my desk plenty of times and it didn't hurt it one bit (aside from cosmetic; scratches and dents).

I'm sure I can spend hundreds (thousands?) more on higher end equipment, but I'm a beginner and I think this mic at under $100 is a great buy for a novice like me. It's easy to use, makes me sound \"professional\" and is transportable. Very happy!

The quality has been fantastic for gaming, voice communication both personal and business, and live streaming. Great for people wanting to ease into podcasting or other vocal productions. The only real downside is the size but a microphone arm or stand could potentially solve that if it's an issue for you. I did have issues with the rear port for the wire becoming loose. Unsure if it was my own mistake over the years or if it was just due to natural wear. It caused the wire to potentially fall out if moved too much.",

My laptop and desktop occasionally would not recognize it and I would have to keep plugging and unplugging the usb cord until it eventually picked it up. I don't think that's an issue with the microphone but the software I was using. Either way, this was a great purchase and will very likely order another when my current one bites the dust.",

I've been using it for about two years and haven't seen any reason to upgrade to the several-hundred-dollar models, so I think this is your best bet. For what it's worth, it looks rather nice too, so it could make a fine addition to one's gaming or streaming setup.",

Now be warned, this microphone will pick up EVERYTHING, including the ticking of a clock in the background or a fan near you. You can adjust the sensitivity with the mode change, but for a podcaster you will require complete and utter silence to have a clean recording.",
