The nets fold down, but the 6 foot one folds to 4 foot at the widest point. I returned the large one for the 4 foot one and am much happier. The kids are outside playing soccer now!",

Once secured into the ground, the goals basically won't budge unless you are rocketing shots in from point blank, which shouldn't be the case ordinarily, unless you have a team of BU08, which I do.

My daughters set is going strong for well over a month now, but I have had horrible luck with mine. Both times I opened my goals to use them for practice they were broken. I am buying a third set however because I love how they look, store, and function as a training tool. Plus my daughter loves them as well",

However, the way the goals are designed you can easily upgrade the stakes if you need to overtime if they break or wear out. Terrific product, my assistant coach liked them so much he is getting himself a pair.",
