As you can clearly tell the quality difference and lack of OXO logo.

If you miss some avocado bits (which is easy since the slicer is conveniently colored in avocado color), they will dry up and become that much more difficult to clean (a small brush would be useful). I'd say - metal is probably better. BTW, it's great for removing pits!",

Still giving 4 stars because the product itself is very well made and shipped really quickly.",

I really like the seed remover - it saves my fingers from accidentally getting whacked. The only reason it only got four stars is the avocado scooper/cutter piece. If you have smaller avocadoes, you are fine. We get the huge Costco fruits and the slicer is not quite big enough all the time.",

The only metal parts are when you place this slicer over the pit to dig into it and then you pull out the pit. Works well for me.",
