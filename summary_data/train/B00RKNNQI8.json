      "text": "Got this to replace a point-and-shoot Canon that broke and didn't have all the features I needed (e.g. Sports mode, more manual control). So far, this camera has what I'm looking for, albeit bulkier and heavier than a point-and-shoot. If you think you can just throw this in your pocket and it'll hardly be noticeable, think again. Although the lens does retract into the camera, it is not as compact as a point-and-shoot; however, for having all the additional features I like, I was not surprised by the form factor. I don't understand why the flash is retractable and only makes taking nighttime pictures more cumbersome.",

I am an amateur photographer, but many professional photographers have commented on the quality of my photos. After using the SX710 for a year or so, it exceeds my expectations in every way and I when I'm ready for another camera I will look to Canon first.",

I like its relatively high image quality. I don't like the larger dimensions compared to my old camera (it often doesn't fit in a shirt pocket), incompatibility of my old Canon PowerShot battery with the new camera, the poor placement of the on/off button (the lens often extends accidently when changing the battery), and the WiFi.",

    "description": "Style:Base30x Optical Zoom (25\u2013750mm)\n-\n20.3 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor combined with the DIGIC 6 Image Processor\n-\nBuilt-in Wi-Fi allows wireless transferring of images and video to compatible mobile devices\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\nZOOM POWER TO GO\nFor capturing everything from vacation videos to everyday snaps, you'll want the high-zoom, compact-body PowerShot SX710 HS camera by your side. Powerfully advanced yet easy to use, this camera is prepared to handle a variety of situations. The amazing 30x Optical Zoom gives you the versatility you need to take your still images and breathtaking 1080p Full HD video to the next level, with Intelligent IS and Zoom Framing Assist to keep even your highest zoom shots clear and steady. Experience sophisticated video capabilities including 60p/30p/24p and MP4 options, the ability to add background music to your clips in Story Highlights, and advanced Dynamic IS that keeps video steady even when you shoot while running or walking backwards. Built-in Wi-Fi\u00ae and NFC make sharing what you've captured simple. With a 20.3 Megapixel* High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor and DIGIC 6 Image Processor that create the Canon HS SYSTEM for excellent low-light performance, all packed into a slim design, this camera is perfect for travelers, families, and anyone who appreciates superb quality and performance.\n\n* Image processing may cause a decrease in the number of pixels.\n\nBIG ZOOM DELIVER OUTSTANDING VERSATILITY\n30X OPTICAL ZOOM (25\u2013750MM)\nWith the PowerShot SX710 HS camera in hand, you'll be impressed at the zooming capabilities of this slim, compact digital camera. The amazing 30x Optical Zoom gets you just where you want to be: down on the field, high atop a skyscraper, deep into a landscape and much more. The camera's advanced technology helps ensure that images and videos are captured in outstanding quality, with Intelligent IS that chooses the stabilization method that's best for the shooting conditions, so images are virtually shake-free in a wide variety of situations.\n\nINTELLIGENT IS\nIt's easy to capture clear, steady images, even in low light without using a tripod. That's because the camera is equipped with Canon's innovative Intelligent IS. The system automatically analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation \u2013 allowing you to focus on framing and capturing your shot. For stills, the system selects from Normal IS, Panning IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Tripod modes. When shooting video, the system selects from Dynamic IS, Powered IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and active Tripod IS modes.

Plus, with MF Peaking possible thanks to the DIGIC 6 Image Processor, you'll have a pro-level focusing tool at your disposal.\n\nCANON HS SYSTEM\nThe PowerShot SX710 HS camera gives you the power to capture beautifully detailed, naturally lit images even in low light \u2013 reducing the need for flash and the occasionally unwelcome effects it produces. That's because the camera's 20.3 Megapixel* High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor works with the camera's latest generation DIGIC 6 Image Processor to create the Canon HS SYSTEM, specifically engineered for spectacular low-light performance. With the Canon HS SYSTEM, you'll experience excellent tracking performance even in low light, and achieve gorgeous still image quality at ISO speeds up to ISO 3200; beautiful low-light shots are possible with minimal noise and maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas.\n\n*Image processing may cause a decrease in the number of pixels.\n\nSOPHISTICATED VIDEO CAPABILITIES\nFULL HD VIDEO\nThe PowerShot SX710 HS camera is designed to make beautiful, creative video capture easy and fun. Image quality is luminous and lifelike in 1080p Full HD, with selectable frame rates of 60p, 30p and 24p to match the situation and end use. MP4 format, perfect for sharing and mobile devices, is also available. Newly improved Dynamic IS offers 5-axis image stabilization that corrects even the strong camera shake that happens when you shoot while running or walking backward.\n\nSHORT CLIP MOVIE\nNew Short Clip Movie lets you shoot videos of 4 to 6 seconds as easily as capturing a snapshot; then, during playback, you can apply impressive effects including Normal speed, Fast motion, Slow motion and Replay.\n\nCLEAR VIEWING, EASY SHOOTING\n3.0-INCH HIGH RESOLUTION (922,000 DOTS) LCD\nThe large, 3.0-inch high-resolution LCD screen makes it easy to both frame and review your shots. A resolution of 922,000 dots makes even the smallest details clear, and images are viewable even from a wide angle, so showing others what you've captured is easy, too.\n\nSUPER ZOOMING NOW EASIER THAN EVER\nIMPROVED ZOOM FRAMING ASSIST\nThe camera's Zoom Framing Assist function offers a variety of support for capturing excellent long telephoto shots. When you press and hold the Zoom Framing Assist button, the camera will automatically zoom out to include a wider angle of view, enabling you to more easily locate your moving subject. Once you find it, releasing the button returns the lens to its original zoom position, keeping the subject in focus until you're ready to shoot. You can even make zoom adjustments while the button is pressed, with an animated assist frame that makes viewing easy. When the button is released, the lens will return to the adjusted zoom position. Zoom Framing Assist also offers a seek assist function that detects when you're panning (for instance, to search for the ball on a field) and automatically zooms out to help; stop panning, and the zoom returns to its original position. Zoom Framing Assist keeps even a moving subject's face the same size in the frame with a tap to the Zoom Framing Assist function button; the feature is especially useful for capturing the expressions of fast-moving children. The system lets you choose the subject's size: choices include face, upper body, whole body, manual or off, and now AUTO. In AUTO, the camera evaluates camera movement, distance to subject, and the number of faces to automatically zoom in and out to stay focused on subjects and shoot them at the optimal size, even automatically zooming in to find faces when they are too small. Also new, an Auto Zoom feature that makes it easy for others (at a tourist spot, for example) and even children to take a great picture of you: the camera automatically zooms to frame the shot to just the right size. Conveniently, all Zoom Framing Assist functions are also available when shooting video.\n\nRETHINK PHOTOGRAPHY WITH CREATIVE SHOT\nCREATIVE SHOT MODE\nPowerShot digital cameras with Creative Shot mode help turn your images into impressive artistic photos! Rather than randomly applying filters, Creative Shot mode takes advantage of advanced Canon technologies to analyze the individual scene, subject and exposure to apply any of 46 filter options. In addition to the original shot, the camera automatically produces and saves five additional variations of the composition. Filter choices are grouped into Retro, Monochrome, Special and Natural categories to make exploring the world of artistic photography fun and easy, or simply select Auto to access the full range of effects. With Creative Shot mode, the result is stunning artistic photos that are perfect for sharing.\n\nCREATE A SHORT STORY WITH YOUR IMAGES\nSTORY HIGHLIGHTS\nView your still images and video\u2020 as a fun short story with the Story Highlights feature on the new PowerShot SX710 HS camera. You can choose to have the camera create one automatically, creating a short video of approximately three minutes* according to date, event or people, or you can customize your Story Highlights reel for a fun, unique video*. New Story Highlights BGM lets you add background music (choose from three pre-loaded songs) to the clips that Story Highlights automatically generates, for a new level of emotive expression. It's all done in camera, without the need for any additional software. Easily access and enjoy your Story Highlights \u2013 simply press the Story Highlights button to start creating your highlight album. The Story Highlights album can be saved to the camera's memory card for quick replay and also shared with the PowerShot SX710 HS camera's built-in Wi-Fi\u00ae.\n\n\u2020 Videos must be shot in Hybrid Auto or Short Clip. \n* Length of highlight video varies according to the photos and videos added to the Story Highlights album.\n\nCAPTURE PHOTOS AND VIDEO CAREFREE WITH ADVANCED POWERSHOT TECHNOLOGIES\nHYBRID AUTO\nCapture the essence of special days \u2013 vacations, important occasions or any time you're shooting many shots in a day \u2013 using Hybrid Auto on the PowerShot SX710 HS camera. Hybrid Auto records up to four seconds of video every time you shoot a still image, then automatically joins the day's clips and pictures** into a video. The feature also makes sure the \"highlight reel\" is stunningly beautiful by automatically recognizing the scene and optimizing camera settings to capture the highest possible image quality. The resulting 720p HD video is properly exposed, crisp and steady.\n\n** Pictures can be withheld from the resulting video via menu settings.\n\nSMART AUTO\nSmart AUTO on the PowerShot SX710 HS camera makes capturing sharp, bright colorful images and video as simple as pressing the shutter button. By assessing various factors in both the background and the subject, the system recognizes 58 predefined shooting situations and automatically selects the camera settings that will yield the best possible results.
