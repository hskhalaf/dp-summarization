When I take my dog hiking, more often than not I'm carrying my food his food, my water, his water, bowl, lash, poop bags, toys like his personal walking luggage. A 70lb pitbull and husky mix, who is completely capable of carrying his own sh*t, is looking down on me because I'm hiking up the hills too damn slow. Since this backpack, he gets tired when I get tired. Because I am making him carry his own things. Guess your endurance wasn't as good as you thought it wad huh Dog.",

After putting this pack on him and \"giving him a job\" its like there is an invisible wall right next to me and he doesnt ever walk past me and doesn't even try to pull or mark bushes anymore. 6 out of 5 stars.",

I\u2019ve tried this design with other harnesses and my bull dog hates that front strap that sits right behind his legs and it impedes his movement. No time to return backpack trip in two days going to try to use it without the front belly straps. I just wanted what was pictured feel like I got duped and am disappointed.",

I feel like it would help keep it from swaying side to side that way. Also, I would not suggest using the metal hook to attach your leash if your dog likes to pull. We put his harness on underneath and attached it to that instead.",

I purchased this for my service dog since I did not want a traditional service dog vest and I needed something to carry my personal items so I did not have to use a purse. If I could change one thing, it would be the placement of the buckles on the belly. I would have them position more to the side of the dog versus directly underneath, For ease of buckling and for comfort of the dog. I use my seatbelt cover for her belly protection and that seems to work very well.",

We put 2.5lb disc weights in both side pockets (which is appropriate for his weight), and it gives him a \"job\" to do. He's oriented and focused. It's amazing! His pulling has lessened by 75%, and with ongoing training, should resolve completely. He LOVES his backpack. As soon as we take it out he is excited and ready to go! Not to mention he looks so handsome with it on. And he carries his own poop bags :)",

The rings are nice so that we can clip carabiners to the rings so that we can attach other things to the outside of the saddlebags and hang them easily. It's a convenient way to free up space in our backpacks by not having to carry his food and water dishes and dog bags ourselves.",

      "text": "Great pack! Have had it for about 6m now and it looks so small on my 90lb German Shepherd but fits all his essentials, 2 water bottles, collapsible bowl, extra bags, all with plenty of extra room for more. Before purchasing this I saw a few reviews with quality concerns however I can say this pack is very well built and I'm not worried about it falling apart at all, that is unless the land shark sinks his teeth into it not much survives those! Anyway from my experience with my first OneTigris product I have and will buy from them again.",

Before the harness, our dog would walk ahead a lot with some pulling especially when squirrels are present. As soon as the harness is on him, his energy and attitude changes and he's ready to serve. Rarely ever does he pull and he sticks by our side. Bonus: It also make walks a bit shorter and he carries his own food, water, and toys.",

      "text": "Our three-year old German Shepherd weighs 85 lbs. This OneTigris Dog Pack is a perfect size for him. Plenty of room in the side pockets for water bottles, food and treats. Straps are long enough and adjustable; canvas bag has nice, strong stitching. Nitro is still getting used to the weight so he is only wearing it about 20-30 minutes each day. Today was the first day we went for a walk with the pack on. This pack is exactly what I was looking for!",

For the price, I would 100% get another one of these if mine somehow broke. This is going to be her everyday harness now, my favorite! Only downside is the fabric is a bit thick, and with her fur, she can get overheated when it's warm outside.",

This fits nicely on him without putting too much strain on his hind legs. It is recommended to have a dog carry no more than 10% of their body weight and this fits all of our essentials nicely. I took off one star because the bag does slide around a bit, needing occasional re-adjustment, and the straps that go around his belly hang a bit as they are very long. I may end up sewing those back so that they don't get in his way on longer hikes.",
