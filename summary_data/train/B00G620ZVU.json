Given the price, I just bought another pair to swap one in. It seemed better than buying more expensive ones, and I sealed these with silicone, so hopefully it won't happen again.",

Initially, upon opening the package I was impressed with the lights and for the price they do everything you expect (and more). Install went well, but the bolts that hold the lights on the bracket suck and I only got 7 out of the 8 bolts I needed. I was racketing one bolt and it sheered off all of a sudden. So words of advice when you are threading the bolts just be causious on the poor quality of the bolts. I really cannot complain though for you he price.",

I unscrewed it and put in another nut on the bottom, but the same problem has occurred. So I have one perfect straight light and one crooked light on my truck. Would really like some customer service so I can fix this problem. For now, 2 stars.",

Very white light color, a hint more warm white than blue, which Is easier on the eyes and more useful in my opinion. They consume 1.05A at 14V (each) so the power input is slightly less than advertised. No regrets whatsoever, a bargain for the performance you get.",
