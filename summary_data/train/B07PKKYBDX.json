It was very easy to start using right out of the box, and changing languages is only a matter of quickly scrolling from one to another. Each language is transcribed into easily-read text, and the translated language also into voice. The voice is a little mechanical sounding (no surprise) but clear and easily understood. Of the languages I\u2019m familiar with, English, Spanish and Japanese, the translation and pronunciation are very accurate. My wife says the French is also accurate. We\u2019ve been using it for six days so far and very pleased. (Will update if there is anything new to report.)",

The pronunciation is very natural - when you\u2019re talking with someone of a different language through this translator\u2019s 2 way translation, you won\u2019t feel like you\u2019re talking with a machine.

Be adivse that not all of the languages will show up on the list until you connect wifi so don't be alarmed if your language is not on the menu. It will show up as soon as you connect wifi.
