I feel like I have a solid control of the grinder at all times. Cuts like a dream, and is built to last. I found the paddle trigger a little harder to get used to. But after using it more I like it better then a slide switch. I never thought a cordless grinder could be more then just a toy Until I used this one.",

Has a nice handle that screws in and out either side you want, Paddle switch is good to with a safety to prevent accidental activations, like in your bag! ouch. Has a button that allows you to switch discs with no tools. Also came with two grind guards, and they come off, on, and adjust easy with no tools. Very nice.",
