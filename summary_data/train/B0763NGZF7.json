I live in a condo with master keyed locks for our management company, so I didn\u2019t have the option to swap out the lock for something like the August Locks. Was worried this wouldn\u2019t be strong enough but it works great every time. I love having the history on the app even for when the lock is manually locked and unlocked. Great price! I just placed an order for the WiFi adapter so might update after I receive that!",

It worked for locking and unlocking the door with the Sesame. But when I lock/unlock my door with the key, it doesn't turn the knob, which in turn means that the Sesame gets confused and thinks the lock is still locked when it's really unlocked. That's not a fault of Sesame, but I still am not able to use it properly.",

When I discovered a bug that seemed to challenge my phone but not my service folks, Candy House had it resolved within a couple weeks--start to finish. I am impressed. I can do everything I was expecting it to do. I know some would give 4 stars (or less) for there having been a hiccup, but that they were on it so quickly means a lot giving how distant customer service can seem/be these days.",

A company, to be successful, needs 2 things: a good product and good support. All products, even Apple, will occasionally need help. I've had a minor problem recently and within 2 days of posting my problem I was contacted, requesting a little more info. Two days after that my problem was fixed, and I'm back with the lock I wanted. Very happy.",
