I've had some issues with rolling shutters but thats an easy fix during editing.",

The waterproof case is truly waterproof and you can throw this off a cliff and I'm sure it'll survive. The sheer number of accessories you can buy to suit your needs is crazy; things like a bright red floater for water usage, mounting to a surfboard somehow, a skeleton housing for when there's no water danger (for better sound). There are also a lot of mounts to be had so that's awesome. You DO need to get your own memory cards and a way to transfer the data onto a computer.",

Also, for some reason the date and time change frequently and this can be very frustrating when you are trying to sort your videos.",

You could literally spend thousands purchasing all the accessories, it's a crime. Also, this edition (white) did not come with a manual. Luckily if you google a manual you can find it online.",

You get what you pay for. For example, the video wide angle coverage in this white edition at 1080p is NOT as wide as in the Black edition. The still images are not as high a resolution, but that's not a big deal. White does not allow spot metering, white does not allow setting manual white balance. If those are features you want, you got to step up to a more expensive version. Other than that, its a goPro and works as expected.",

Mine went from $200 to $375 just getting what I considered to be necessities. Also have read of some glitches in the firmware. My screen has frozen only once, which fixed with a simple power off/on.

      "text": "The seller sent the item as promised, but the reason I give a 3 star rating is because the camera quality is not all that great. Everyone talks about GoPro bringing this amazing camera, but unless your outdoors in the daylight the picture quality of this camera is very mediocre. I think it's safe to say that my iPhone 6 takes better photos than this GoPro.",

The new GoPro Hero3 series has an easy to ready display which faces you when mounted on the surfboard. The perspective is great and really gives the viewer an idea of what it is like to be on the wave. The video quality is great and there are tons of cool other accessories. I love this camera.",
