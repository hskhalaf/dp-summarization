      "text": "Do not buy: Purchased the ASUS CM-16 a little over a year ago. ISP is Charter / Spectrum. Device has required modem reset every 1-3 days. Spectrum called multiple times, and did two site visits --- signal ok. Also I added signal amplifier, just in case. After research, I found that this modem as well as many others uses the Intel PUMA6 chipset which is known for requiring resets. Suggest you search \"Intel PUMA6\" to find out if the modem you are purchasing has that chipset - many different mfg use it. I purchased one based on another chip and have had solid performance since -- not a single reset. Too late for a return.",

Wireless would work, Ethernet wouldn\u2019t...the list goes on. Haven\u2019t returned it because after that much time invested I wanna see it through. Spectrum finally gave up and asked me to contact ASUS. ASUS spent 5 mins on the phone and said they needed 48 hours to get back to me. 48 hours? It\u2019s 2019, get with it ASUS. UPDATE. 72 hours and nothing. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s never happening.",

Yes, this is more expensive, but totally worth the money! We pay for up to 100 MG/S with Xfinity, but the speed was always around 30-50 with my last router. With this Asus, we stay between 115-120 every time I test it. And I\u2019ve had no vpn issues. I had an issue with the 2G not connecting to some devices, but I called Asus customer service. There was ZERO wait time, and we got everything up and running in a matter of minutes. I\u2019m very happy with this purchase.",
