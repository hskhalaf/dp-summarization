She got 2 sets of letters both large and small upper case along with loads of punctuation marks and plenty of vowels. I barely have enough E\u2019s to do a quote. Wish this company would give double the amount of letters. Other than that beautiful board and you can\u2019t tell a difference between it and a letter folk board at all!!",

When the board arrived there was a bit of sawdust on it, but that vacuumed right off. The wood frame seems unfinished, so if you wants to paint it, it should stick well. I appreciate that the letters were uncut when they arrived. I use a nail clipper to cut them so that they don\u2019t have any scratchy jags. The letters for this board are 1\u201d high, so they are easily visible. This board is excellent quality.",
