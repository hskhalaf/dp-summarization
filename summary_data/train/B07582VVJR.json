Sending back the earbud and or the whole set for replacement would be reasonable for certain companies (Fitbit for example) due to my experience with their customer service. This is NOT in ANY WAY my experience with Jaybird. Please Jaybird, send a case and the broken earbud. After receiving them, I indeed will send you back the case and broken earbud. Maybe a phone call instead of an email requiring you to go into the customer service page. HORRIBLE experience. ZERO stars....",

The battery life is good, too and they are comfortable to wear. You have to look at these things as diamonds and not just leave them anywhere. They are easier to lose than a corded headset. ALWAYS put them in the case, when not in use, I found is the best thing.",

      "text": "Been on the hunt for a new pair of earbuds. These are really awesome with the exception of the sound quality. I highly recommend utilizing the app to adjust your own equalizer preferences. This will allow you to fully customize your sound experience. Without doing so these just sound quite flat. I loved the petite ness of them and the charging case is small as well. Only returning them for lack of acoustic sound. Also I\u2019m comparing these to my Bose.",

Sometimes, the audio would not work at all with say, videos on Facebook, Twitter or other platforms. That\u2019s a deal breaker for me, and likely for most people. Until resolved, I\u2019d say steer clear. Returning these ASAP.",
