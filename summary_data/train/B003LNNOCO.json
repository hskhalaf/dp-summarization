Good sounding unit if it works, garbage electronics and refurbished units are not actually repaired, just resold.",

Unfortunately, last week it up and died after less than 2 years of gentle and relatively infrequent use; no sound, no obvious malfunction, no warning. If you would like a product with a little more longevity, then this may not be the dock for you. July, 2014: I am very happy with this speaker dock. The sound quality is great and volume is strong. I would certainly recommend this product.",

Designed for audiophiles, this speaker is engineered with PureDigital technology and a curved profile to provide tight, precise sound. Unlock additional features using the complementary Fidelio app, which gives you access to custom alarms, equalizer settings, and more.\n\nFIDELIO DS8500 DOCKING SPEAKER:\nOBSESSED WITH SOUND\n * PureDigital sound processing technology offers audio clarity and balance\n * Precisely tuned bass pipes provide deep, tight bass reproduction\n * Midrange driver volume matches acoustic requirements for strong, rich bass\n * Shielding technology blocks mobile phone interference\n * Curved back reduces internal resonance for precise, natural audio reproduction\n\n\n\nPUREDIGITAL PROCESSING FOR UNSURPASSED FIDELITY\nUnlike traditional iPod docks, the DS8500 processes sound digitally. The result is far clearer audio performance. Using PureDigital, the DS8500 collects the digital output of your iPod or iPhone and processes it at each stage of the circuit, resulting in a much higher signal-to-noise ratio. This allows the speaker to reproduce the audio files on your mobile device with greater clarity and fidelity.\n\nThe DS8500 Docking Speaker delivers stunning sound quality and style. View larger.OPTIMIZED DRIVERS ADD PRECISION\nIf a speaker's drivers aren't optimized to match its acoustic requirements, it will produce distorted sound. Fortunately, the DS8500's drivers have been fine-tuned to provide clear performance at all frequencies. High tones are precise and distinct, while low tones come out deep and tight. Bass reproduction is particularly rich: the mid- and low-range drivers have been specially engineered to create crisp, penetrating sound reproduction.\n\nCURVED DESIGN CREATES AN IDEAL ACOUSTIC ENVIRONMENT\nChic and elegant, the DS8500's curved design is not only an eye catcher--it's also an effective structure for acoustics. The concave architecture of the speaker creates an ideal acoustic environment for your music: it dramatically reduces distortion and resonance, resulting in more precise and natural sound.\n\nPROXIMITY SENSOR AND REMOTE CONTROL FOR CONVENIENT OPERATION\nThe speaker also features an intuitive backlit control panel, which is activated using a proximity sensor. When your hand moves close to the speaker, the display illuminates and allows you to operate it. Walk away and the light dims to allot more power to music playback. For added convenience, an easy-to-use remote control is included.\n\nFREE FIDELIO APP UNLOCKS ADDITIONAL FEATURES\nIf you own an iPod touch or iPhone you can unlock even more features for your docking speaker using the complementary Fidelio app. The Philips Fidelio app lets you control your speaker dock's acoustic properties, access 7000+ free internet radio stations, share music you are listening to with friends via facebook and twitter, set alarms to wake to your favorite music, photo or weather conditions and much more using your iPhone or iPod touch.\n\nDOCK ANY IPHONE OR IPOD, EVEN IN ITS CASE\nThe speaker's spring-loaded docking port accommodates any iPhone or iPod, without special adaptors. What's more, it works even when most protective cases are on--just dock your iPhone or iPod as is for fuss-free enjoyment of your music.\n\nCOMPATIBLE WITH MOST IPODS AND IPHONES\nThe DS8500 is compatible with most iPod and iPhone models, including: iPhone, iPhone 4, iPhone 3G, iPhone 3GS, iPod (5th Generation), iPod Classic, iPod mini, iPod Nano (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Generations), iPod Shuffle, and iPod Touch (1st, 2nd, and 3rd Generations).\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\nDS8500 Docking Speaker, AC power cord, matching remote, 3.5-millimeter auxiliary cable, and user manual.\n\n\nFIDELIO DOCKING SPEAKERS: OBSESSED WITH SOUND\nWhatever genre or artist you prefer, the Fidelio docking speakers are designed to let you hear every note of your music for an authentic sound experience.DS1100 Docking Speaker\nMusic and style for your bedroom.DS1110/37 Speaker Dock\nWake up to your favorite iTunes.DS3000 Docking Speaker\nClear audio that fills your space.DS3010 Docking Speaker\nStyle and sound for any room.
