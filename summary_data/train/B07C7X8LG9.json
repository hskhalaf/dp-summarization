      "text": "I really liked the ability of this product to help my 10 year old daughter learn how to code. She's been interested in computers and loves Harry Potter so bringing them together in 1 experience is fantastic. The ability to learn the basics of coding then try your own work out right afterwards is incredibly rewarding for kids. She and all her friends at her birthday party were trying out all the different options with the wand and it made me feel much better than having a bunch of kids starting at iPads the whole time. The ability to both learn and entertain yourself seemingly endlessly is a really wonderful part of this product. Cannot recommend it enough.",

The app that you download to program the wand( I used my Fire Tablet) is really bright colorful and engaging. I was surprised by how easy it was for my kids(ages 4 and 8) to jump right in and start coding. I was so intrigued I tried it myself, I have no coding experience whatsoever and I found the \"instructions\" to be very easy to follow and flowed very nicely.",

The wand is certainly educational, functions very well, and looks fantastic all while providing good groundwork for kids to learn coding. The mini games, challenges, and directions were all very clear. I am so happy with this purchase! I'd reccomend this company and this product to anyone looking for an appropriate \"toy\" for their kids. The wand is exceptionally cool because it appeals to older kids-- even my 30 year old cousin was stocked to try it out!",

Once he built the wand, we downloaded the app, which was just great! Lots of games to play and kept him occupied for ages. Definitely recommend!",

He is a huge fan of Harry Potter and loves technology, so this was an obvious gift for him. In no time at all, he made pumpkins grow, Broomsticks fly and chocolate frogs appear. Brilliant stuff. Great work Kano!",
