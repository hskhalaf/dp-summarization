I used bungee cords instead of the strap that came with the cart to strap the kayak on - it was perfect. Easily got both up the steep gravel drive (one at a time) without having to stop and adjust once. Really saved my back having this handy cart. This will be great portaging through woods or down a sandy beach. Very happy with this sturdy cart.",

I got mine at Home Depot for about $6, but they have something similar on Amazon (, this is a major help since my hands are slippery and the SUP is slippery when I get out of the water and getting home is rough.

It is a bit hard to pull over the thick grass getting the kayak out of our backyard but it's still managable. It rolls very well over the side walks and the rocky area around the dock. I use two straps that I already owned so not sure how well the strap provided works. But so far I'm very happy with this purchase.",

When the cart came it was very easy to assemble but it did not come with any instructions or mounting suggestions. I will need to figure out how to tie my 16 foot old town canoe onto the cart. I think it will do an okay job but I should have gone with a larger one.",

When we take the Kayak off the car we just drop it right on the wheels and off to the water we go. Much easier than trying to carry the kayak to the water. Sturdy and strong. Easy to use.
