      "text": "I bought this hose reel in 2011 for my pool deck. It was still in excellent order when we moved last year. This year it developed a problem and I figured it was a goner. I patiently pulled out the 100ft of hose and found the connection point inside was leaking. I verified it wasn't the hoses or outside connectors. Put it all back together and it is off and working perfectly. I'm a Gardener and have bought many reels over the years. this is the best ever.",

The rolling system is smooth, and the fact that it rotates allows us to keep it in a corner and string the hose through a couple of bushes and pull straight without destroying anything. It does require to be fastened down to work effectively though. A large gardent paver and a few tapcons took care of that.",

Finishing the job is so easy with the \"Slide-Trak Hose Guide\", it coils the hose properly when I turn the crank as fast as I can. The storage compartment is convenient. I ordered it with the storage compartment because it has a shorter lead time for delivery. The swivel base is a little clunky: you have to apply a fair amount of force to make it \"unlock\". I find it just as easy to rotate the entire reel while leaving the swivel locked. Highly recommended!",

This served our purpose well and gave it 4 stars because it didn't swivel well.

You will definately have to secure the winder to the patio floor or some sort of solid mounting surface. You may want to drill a couple of drain holes in the interior tray. Winding the hose back is no problem as there is a 'foot step' to hold the winder down but pulling the hose out, if the winder is not secured, it is not heavy enough to stay put.",

I was shocked at how much these things are; after all it's just a hose reel!!! I found this one and thought it was attractive enough and it seemed to have another feature I wanted which was the swivel and the hose guide system was just perfect so I bought it. The shipping was extremely fast and it came already assembled, which was the bonus for me. I would absolutely recommend this hose reel to anyone and have. I think I have sold 3 others within the neighborhood.",

    "title": "Suncast Resin Swivel Hose Hideaway and Storage Bin with Hose Guide - Durable Outdoor Automatic Hose Storage Reel with Swivel Base, Crank Handle, Lid, Slide Trak Hose Guide, and Storage - 225' Hose Capacity - Mocha and Taupe",
    "description": "This Suncast Hose Reel has 225 feet of hose capacity and a swiveling base for multidirectional winding. The swivel Hose Hideaway takes the hassle out of watering that 1/4-acre lot. The base swivels a full 360 degrees for reeling at any angle. Ground stakes are included for optimal stability. And, the unit comes fully assembled, so you get a handy device right out of the box, rather than another assembly project. Suncast's innovative Smart Trak hose guide tracks the hose neatly onto reel, so there are no tangle-ups to wrestle out. A sturdy resin construction keeps the unit from cracking. And, a patented Easy-Link system ensures a watertight connection between hose-reel and hose. Plus, a large storage bin provides place for garden tools, sprinklers, gloves, nozzles, and other accessories!",
