Paired very quickly very the Wink Hub. Range of dimming is very good. UPDATE 8-31-2016 Despite initial satisfaction at 5 stars, I cannot recommend and will not buy another. 2 similar BR 30 GE bulbs have failed within 6 months of installation. They neither light nor connect. Durability is a question on these bulbs. I have A19 and BAR 38 bulbs from GE that are operating without any problems. The BR 30 bulbs just do not last.",

I use these bulbs in lamps which are difficult to turn off easily. I do not have a Wink Hub, and only use the hub provided with the kit. The dimming function works about 50-75% of the time, but that doesn't matter because its main function of turning off when I arrive home (via the useful Wink Ap robot) works great.",

We purchased the Archer C9 wireless router, and ever since, have had zero issues with the bulbs or the hub. It is working as promised and I am a happy techno geek camper! So, if you are having issues with the starter set, the problem MIGHT be with your router/modem, rather than this set.",

Called customer service and was told there was a software change and not all hubs will communicate with the bulbs until they are updated. Only problem is they said it could be several months before they do the update. Why would they sell this as a package knowing that they have this issue going on? Very disappointed in this package. The separate spot light I bought will work with the hub but it looks like the light is constantly pulsing. Think I'm done with GE products at this point.",

However, what keeps it from being a 5 is 1) the fact that they are so bright and if you dont have some sort of globe or shade over them, it make the room light rather harsh, 2) the Wink app is tenuous at best, and it doesnt seem to take much to lose connectivity and have to reprogram them all over again. They are at this time still the best bulb for using with the Wink. Take a look at the Cree, they are possibly better. Just a little.",

First 4 weeks , it worked like a charm. Worked flawlessly with Alexa, Philips Hue bridge. Then suddenly , it stopped working. Tried resetting, remove and attach,manually pairing it. Nothing worked. Amazon was kind enough to accept returns since the return period had elapsed just 2-3 days before it stopped working. Will stick with Philips bulbs.",
