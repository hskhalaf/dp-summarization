Hubby was careful to read the installation instructions as others had issues with that. All went well. This is my 3rd under cabinet opener. Also have an under cabinet toaster oven & coffee maker.

      "text": "Our old Spacemaker can opener finally opened its last can after at least 20 years. It was a sad day. These undercounter can openers are not easy to find in stores anymore so I ordered from Amazon, and without too much trouble put the new in place of the old. So far this unit has done well. The door on the front was at first a little annoying but we have grown to like the look and found that it is not too much trouble. I can only hope to have as good a service life from this unit as we had with our old one.",

      "text": "Sorry but this model doesn't fit under cabinets with an overhang, the cabinet must be entirely flat underneath. I am replacing an older spacemaker can opener that did fit my cabinet that has an overhang. Now I have to pay shipping to return it. I believe the installation restrictions on this product should be made very clear in the specs, not even a warning on the box. Now I know why the old, white colored models are going for $180 here, not just because they don't make white anymore but because you can install them on more cabinets.",
