What impresses me beyond the aesthetics is that the > sensor has enough sensitivity and dynamic range to capture the birds > without any blur against a fairly dark background and with the sun > in saturation - and that the software balanced all this so well. The size of the camera is a bit large for my hands, but not an issue. If it were lighter in weight that would be nice too. These minuses are tiny in comparison to how amazing the camera is at delivering feelings of delight at some of the images that I am able to capture with it.",

It focuses faster than my Nikons do, is lighter than any of my bodies with the Tamron would be, has a faster frame rate, will do video in 4K and was about $150 cheaper than the Tamron 18-400 lens!

With the one-inch sensor on this camera and up to 400 millimeter lens you still have the digital Zoom capability, maybe not as far-reaching as the Nikon but gives you a well extended super zoom with better image quality in this camera. I find the switches and the sound but especially the quickness of the zoom to auto focus is what makes this a great bridge camera.",

But I think it's more a plus than a concern. The picture quality has been good so far, though I've mostly worked with auto settings as I'm still familiarizing myself with the camera. The only downside I've seen is the battery life is a bit lacking for someone like me who takes quite a lot of shots on amateur photo trips. But I got a couple of spares, and it's not a big deal to swap them out. Really impressed so far, and I'm excited to dive even deeper into its features.",

Should external recording be required the HDMI out is compatible with industry standard recorders. There are a few quirks effecting smooth zooming , audible auto focus noise, and mechanical rattle when turned OFF. It should be noted that when recording with the camera's internal microphone the auto focusing noise will be noticeable.

To get the zoom coverage that this camera gives would involve carrying alot of bulk and alot of weight. There are times when I might need an f1.4 lens with very shallow depth of field, and there are times when there are situations that a DSLR is preferable. But NONE of my DSLR's shoots video at 4K and none of them are as light and small as this one. Pictures that in the past would not have been taken or done very badly with a smartphone are now taken. And they look amazing.",

      "text": "I've only had this camera for a few days, but have used it doing two basketball games at my grandson's school..results were amazing, exposure spot on, action stills in perfect focus. There is a lot to learn with this camera, and I'm excited at all the possibilities this camera offers me, but it will take a little time to master. I reviewed several other digital cameras, but this camera has all the bells and whistles(more than I will probably use ) along with a great zoom, and a quality lens. Absolutely no buyer's remorse. If you are serious about improving you skills, then this is the camera to have.",
