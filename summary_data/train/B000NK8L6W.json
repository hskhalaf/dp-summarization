Liked to have a simple pocket camera like this model camera. :) Got impression on this vintage camera. :) Good camera! I did order another model in different color which I got silver one because another black model got died on me a few days ago. Glad to have it and did test and worked so well!",

I dropped mine from my Harley at 70 miles per hour and shattered it into a million pieces... NO it is NOT shatterproof, doggone it... But, I knew that. Needing a replacement, I immediately bought the identical camera! No question of shopping for a different one. This is IT! And... I promise to actually use the handy dandy wrist strap this time!!!

They are smooth, sharp and the colors are very true to life. I did not expect to use the camera for movies. The quality, however, is so good that I keep taking movies. CONS: Ease of use is only fair since many of the menu functions are too deeply buried. If you enable zoom for movies, you get no warning when it switches to digital zoom. The quality of the digital zoom is very bad. There is no aperture priority.",

The only criticism I have is that extreme distances the zoom becomes somewhat fuzzy....but it only happens at extreme distances, so it can be controlled. I've blown up some of the stills to 8\" x10\" and they still retain a crisp focus. Highly recommend this camera for the price.",

Using a zoom function on Photoshop to compare details, a picture taken with my old Sony Cybershot 5.0 MP got far way more details. Every time I use the no-flash function, even with enough light, the resulting picture is a low quality one. The pets-children function (theoretically, this function allow the camera not to be affected by suddenly movement) is practically useless; very nice product otherwise.

    "title": "Canon PowerShot SD1000 7.1MP Digital Elph Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Black) (OLD MODEL)",
    "description": "Color:BlackCanon PowerShot SD1000 7.1MP Digital Elph Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Black)\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n Canon looked to the very first Elph for inspiration when designing the PowerShot SD1000 Digital Elph, and came up with a quintessential iteration of the icon: slim, clean-lined and fully flat. Inside, the SD1000 Digital Elph looks only to the future: 7.1 megapixels, a 3x optical zoom and advanced DIGIC III ensure top-quality images, while focus is fast and sharp and red-eye is automatically corrected. The large and more colorful LCD screen now has a tough, anti-reflective coating that makes it as durable as it is beautiful. \n\nPowerShot SD1000 Highlights \n\n\n\n1x zoom/3x zoom Slim, stylish 7.1-megapixel digital Elph with 3x optical zoom Great design is just part of the PowerShot SD1000 Digital Elph story. Inside is all the power you need to capture the moments of your life - beautifully. \n\nThe 7.1-megapixel CCD records a wealth of detail - enough to let you enlarge and crop at will. Images are rich and sharp with lifelike depth. The camera's Genuine Canon 3x optical zoom not only gets you in close, but performs with all the clarity and brilliance you'd expect from the world's leader in advanced optics technology. \n\nDIGIC III image processor with improved Face Detection and Red-eye Correction With DIGIC III, you get images of superior quality, the camera functions at top efficiency and battery life is significantly enhanced. What's more, DIGIC III enables Canon's newly improved Face Detection Technology and Red-eye Correction to give you better, more true-to-life people shots. Simply press the Shutter Button halfway down, and the PowerShot SD1000 Digital Elph automatically pinpoints the faces in the scene and chooses the ideal focus point. To keep every face looking bright and natural - without scary red eyes - the camera controls exposure settings and flash, so every shot is just what you were shooting for. \n\nFace Detection AF/AE finds multiple faces in the frame and sets the most suitable focus point, when the shutter button is pressed halfway. And an additional feature, Face Detection FE adjusts the flash, based on a person's face on the screen. Exposure and flash are controlled to ensure proper illumination of both the faces and the overall scene, eliminating the common problem of darkened or overexposed faces. Face Detection in action \n\nRed-eye Correction detects and automatically corrects red-eye during playback for both regular and flash photography. In unusual cases where red-eye is not automatically detected, it can easily be corrected manually during playback mode from the LCD screen. \n\niSAPS Technology is an entirely original scene-recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos, iSAPS works with the fast DIGIC III Image Processor to improve focus speed and accuracy, as well as exposure and white balance. \n\nVivid, high-resolution 2.5-inch PureColor LCD The camera's 2.5-inch LCD screen gives you the big picture, whether you're shooting, reviewing or showing off your images. This extra-durable, high-resolution screen with tough scratch-resistant coating on the anti-reflective, PureColor LCD screen offers a crisp, clear picture to make shooting, playback and using the camera's menu functions especially convenient. Clear and bright, it also features Night Display for easy viewing in low light. \n\nISO 1600 and High ISO Auto to reduce image blur and expand low-light shooting capability The PowerShot SD1000 Digital Elph features new ISO 1600 and High ISO Auto settings that reduce the effects of camera shake and sharpen subjects in low-light situations, giving you greater flexibility for shooting. \n\nFive movie modes including 30 fps VGA, Time Lapse and Fast Frame Rate With a highly flexible movie mode, you can create the movie that's perfect for any application. Select from VGA (640 x 480 pixels) and QVGA (320 x 240 pixels), with frame rates of 30 fps and 15 fps for recording up to 1 hour or 4GB. Also choose from Fast Frame Rate (QVGA; 320 x 240 pixels) recording at 60 fps for up to 1 minute, Compact Movie Mode (QQVGA; 160 x 120 pixels) recording at 15 fps for up to 3 minutes, and Time Lapse (640 x 480) recording at 1 or 2 sec. intervals. The PowerShot SD1000 Digital Elph supports the USB 2.0 Hi-Speed standard, so you'll enjoy the fastest possible data transfer speeds when using a USB 2.0 Hi-Speed compatible computer. \n\nPrint/Share button for easy direct printing and downloading The PowerShot SD1000 Digital Elph's Print/Share button makes direct printing easier than ever. Simply connect the SD1000 Digital Elph to a Canon CP, Selphy or Pixma photo printer or any PictBridge compatible photo printer, press the lighted Print/Share button and print! Also use the Print/Share button to transfer images to a computer (Windows and Macintosh). \n\nPrint your own ID photos in 28 different sizes or use the Movie Print function to output multiple stills from a recorded movie on a single sheet with a Canon Selphy compact photo printer. \n\nDirect photo printers For desktop large-format printing, try one of the direct photo printers that allow you to print without a computer in one of two ways: plug your compatible PowerShot camera into the direct photo printer using the supplied USB interface cable, or simply insert a memory card into the supplied adapter. You can also connect the printer to your computer for more options. Print high-resolution, borderless images as postcards or 8.5 x 11-inch sheets within minutes. \n\nCompact photo printers Compact photo printers let you produce versatile, fun 4 x 6-inch postcards, 4 x 8-inch wide greeting cards or credit-card size prints in just two easy steps: connect and press print. Control the printer right from your camera's LCD screen. You get durable, dye-sublimated prints quickly with or without borders. Assorted paper types let you create mini or credit card size labels. You can even take select compact photo printers to a party or an outdoor picnic using an optional rechargeable battery.",
