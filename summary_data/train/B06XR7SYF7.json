After three solid coats, and correct hourly drying time, There simply wasn't much shine or gloss. It goes on fine (be sure to use precautions when using), the dry time seems to go along with the directions, but the overall affect simply wasn't what I had hoped it would be. Yes, there certainly is shine, but I think you really have to look hard in some excellent light. I wouldn't purchase it again, unless they improved the gloss once it dries.",
