I made some extensions with 1/2 in tubing and solved the problem. The quality is very good and will last a long time.",

I've asked several experienced campers and they all said you just have to stick the legs in the ground and hope for the best. Seriously? I want a tripod where the legs lock. I camp in the desert and the ground is like concrete so I can't just stick them in the ground.",

There is literally about 3\" of space below my 12 dutch, and that's with a shortened chain and no firewood directly below it. Normal? I just started using LODGE and love my ovens and skillets, but I'm questioning the use of this tripod. Am I using it wrong? I'd love to hear feedback. I need this for our camping trip and the TallBoy wouldn't get here by this weekend.",
