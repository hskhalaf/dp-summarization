The other 3 times, having done nothing different - it works and we have enjoyed bowling! This evening after 30-minutes of trying, various error messages, can't read disc and so on - I have given up and come to the conclusion I was duped. Two-hundred dollars wasted. I do not like being ripped off and am posting a warning to not purchase from this seller.",
