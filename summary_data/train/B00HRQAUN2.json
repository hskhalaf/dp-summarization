For the record, Harriet (Tubman) is wearing the blue collar and Ruth (Bader Ginsburg) is sporting the pink one!",

It's held up very well between him always getting wet (if there's water to play in, he finds it), rough housing at the dog park, and recently the beach; it hasn't faded and the color hasn't bled. I wouldn't hesitate to buy again and would highly recommend this collar.",

Somehow he was able to break this with scratching at it. It was tight enough so he couldn't get his mouth on it, but loose enough based on the two-finger method discussed by the manufacturer. I will attempt to fix it with epoxy, but I shouldn't have to. This should have lasted. I guess naming the dog Loki was appropriate. Dog of mischief.",

      "text": "So, I bought this in both XS and Small. One of my dogs has an 11\" neck and the other has a 13\" neck. The small fits my bigger dog fine. Seems nice and sturdy. The XS, though, is more like a cat collar. It is not as wide as the small. I can barely see it on his neck. I'm probably going to send it back. I just don't see how it can stand up to my dogs' rough play. It seems, otherwise, well made and sturdy enough for a cat or, maybe, a calm dog.",

I wanted a martingale collar that also had a quick release clip and this does not. You have to place it over the head rather than clip it around the neck to get on and off which does limit its use with collar accessories and e-collars. I'm a little Leary about using it for a puppy since I like the added safety a release clip has.",

However, it does serve its purpose of preventing her from darting out into traffic and the blush color is so cute. I just wish they designed it to be 2 inches shorter on the smallest setting.
