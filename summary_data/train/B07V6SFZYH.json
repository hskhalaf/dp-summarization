Even though they arent name brand theyre well made. There is a little charging port and button on the tongue area of the shoe that you press to light the shoes up. There are several different flashing modes and color options or you can keep them continuously lit up or turn them off. Theyre a great buy!",

They light up bright and she loves to walk outside at night while wearing them. I like that they're Velcro and stay on. They're made really well, I was nervous when I ordered them because they weren't very expensive and I wasn't expecting great quality, but to my surprise they're actually really great. I'd definitely buy these again and recommend them.",

I'm not sure how long the battery will last if you have them on continually, but the charge lasts about 3 days for us. Comes with a charge cord - mine was a little tight to get into the shoe port, but I just wiggled a little and it went right in. We absolutely LOVE these shoes and I am planning on getting a couple of more pairs in larger sizes!!",
