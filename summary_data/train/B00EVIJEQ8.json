I had to run to the store last minute to try and find some. In my mind that's false advertising.",

It is located so low that at anything other than WOT and 20+mph the rope hits the water and sprays right in the eyes of the rider. My boys were done with these and won't ride them again. I tried different inflation levels of the tubes, different ways of hooking the rope onto it with no lick. I have no idea why it is located in the middle. Maybe this is a way to sell their ball that goes on to the rope to keep it out of the water.",
