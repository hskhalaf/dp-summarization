      "text": "Huge improvements all around over the IS Maxx2 which I found to be uncomfortable on all day rides. This is just better all around, ventilation improved, less prone to fogging, sun visor is more adjustable and not clunky. The chin skirt comes included instead of extra, needed for those who want an extended riding season. Now this package came with the Sena smart 10B INSTALLED. Now I've looked all over and couldn't find these 2 separate items for less. Here they do the hardest part for you and install it into the helmet so all you have to do is charge it, pair it to your phone, and ride. Couldn't ask for anything better in this price range.",

Sent the wrong helmet to me then when I ttied to get it fixed they called me a liar and a thief. Finally returned it and took forever to get my money back. As for the helmet itself, its not bad but the left side where the helmet hinges upward came apart during a ride. There are 3 screws that must have rattled loose so I recomend checking them before taking it for a ride. Otherwise the Bluetooth is nice and the built in tinted visor is amazing.",

The face shield is smooth and so is the sunshield. On all 3 features the helmet has, each position needs a little force but they all lock into position. The air flow is good but I personally would like a little more air coming in. I would rate that, between 1-5, a 3.5",
