I really like the true colors in the pictures and it's ability to take good quality photos in fairly dim light without the use of a flash. I've been using it for close to a year and have found it to be durable and reliable. It is very versatile having both manual and automatic modes, as wells having video capability. It does have one annoying shortcoming...there is no viewfinder. Sometimes it is difficult to see the display well enough in very bright light, ie at the beach, to properly compose a picture. It would be the perfect camera if it had a viewfinder.",

Anyway, I kept the camera and just bought a different one. Otherwise if the batteries would last I liked the way the camera takes pictures.",

It works good, I find the zoom is not that great if your zooming much of a distance at all. It takes pretty nice pictures, my biggest frustration with it is the delway when you push down till when it takes the picture, I find it takes too long to focus, and a lot of times you miss the shot if your trying to take a picture of your child smiling or getting something funny. Pretty good camera, but not worth the money now",

The picture environment selections (Auto, night, portrait, and so on) are excellent, especially the indoor lighting modes. The video mode is especially good, and much improved over my previous PowerShot. I've noticed that I do a little less photo fixing in Adobe Photoshop Elements as the images are clearer and the color seems to be better. I was a little concerned about the lack of an optical viewfinder, but the LCD screen has so far been very good, even in bright daylight.",

I use Alkaline batteries, and I take a lot of pictures,so it seems like I go through a set of batteries at least one per day. I am very pleased with the camera. 10x optical zoom is great.

The batteries don't last as long as my last camera, but that's not a problem if you use rechargeables.

However, this camera takes great, in-focus pictures without needing flash in most settings. I highly recommend this camera.",

    "description": "A big, easy zoom. Everything about the PowerShot SX120 IS is easy. The Smart AUTO feature makes every shot picture perfect. An impressive 10x Optical Zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer keeps you sharp and steady. There\u2019s even an Easy Mode that makes shooting super simple.Just set the Canon PowerShot SX120 IS to Smart AUTO and you're ready for maximum enjoyment from your picture taking every time. It's a relaxing and satisfying way to shoot because you can completely concentrate on your subject, knowing that the camera has the technical details covered. Advanced Canon technology intelligently analyzes your situation and shooting conditions.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n A big, easy zoom. Everything about the PowerShot SX120 IS is easy. The Smart AUTO feature makes every shot picture-perfect. An impressive 10x Optical Zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer keeps you sharp and steady. There\u2019s even an Easy Mode that makes shooting super simple. \n\nPowerShot SX120 Highlights \n\nSmart AUTO detects and analyzes faces, brightness, colors, distance, and movement\nJust set the Canon PowerShot SX120 IS to Smart AUTO and you're ready for maximum enjoyment from your picture taking every time. It's a relaxing and satisfying way to shoot because you can completely concentrate on your subject, knowing that the camera has the technical details covered. Advanced Canon technology intelligently analyzes your situation and shooting conditions. Then it automatically selects an appropriate setting from 18 specially defined settings. So whether you're photographing flowers, a captivating sunset, or your friends at the park, you can be confident that you're getting dramatic, memorable images. \n\nEasy Mode makes capturing images as easy as 1-2-3\nEven if you've never picked up a camera before, with Canon's new Easy Mode you can take inspiring, dramatic pictures that will impress everyone. Once you choose Easy Mode, the PowerShot SX120 IS handles all the details automatically. It automatically sets every camera control, including the flash, to reduce blur and improve image quality. So you get pictures that are bright, clear and natural just by pushing a button. Best of all, you can relax and concentrate on what really counts--your subject. \n\nWith 20 Shooting Modes including 8 Special Scene Modes, you're ready for whatever shot comes your way. \n\n\n\n10x optical zoom in action High-powered 10x optical zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer\nThe PowerShot SX120 IS has a 10x Optical Zoom lens that makes it easy to get the inspiring, emotive close-ups that will make your images lasting keepsakes. This magnificent lens gives you the power to shoot distant subjects with razor-sharp precision and stunning lifelike color. So you can brilliantly capture a bird high atop a tree, a child\u2019s winning goal from across the stadium or a school play from the last row. Plus, thanks to Canon\u2019s highly sophisticated Optical Image Stabilizer Technology, even at maximum zoom, every image is rock steady. \n\nThe PowerShot SX120 IS is equipped with Canon\u2019s acclaimed Optical Image Stabilizer Technology that automatically detects and corrects camera shake--one of the leading causes of fuzzy or blurred shots. Even when zoomed in, you can get the steady, crisp, brilliant images you\u2019ll be proud to shoot and share. And Canon\u2019s Optical Image Stabilizer Technology is convenient to use. It functions perfectly with or without a flash. \n\nDIGIC 4 Image Processor \nWith DIGIC 4, your images boast superior quality, the camera operates at top efficiency and battery life is enhanced. What\u2019s more, the DIGIC 4 Image Processor enables Canon\u2019s Face Detection, Motion Detection Technologies and Red-eye Correction to give you better, more true-to-life people shots. Simply press the shutter button halfway down, and the camera automatically pinpoints the faces in the scene and chooses the ideal focus point. The camera controls exposure settings and flash to keep every face looking bright and natural. The camera also selects and sets the optimal exposure and ISO settings automatically to keep everything looking sharp and clear. Red-eye Correction can be handled in-camera, in two ways. The Red-eye Correction during shooting uses the Face Detection Technology to recognize and remove red-eye from images as they're taken, before the file is written to the memory card. It's also possible to correct red-eye during image playback, using simple settings in the PowerShot SX120 IS menu. \n\niSAPS Technology is an entirely original scene-recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos, iSAPS works with the fast DIGIC 4 Image Processor to improve focus speed and accuracy, as well as exposure and white balance. \n\nDIGIC 4 features Face Detection Technology, giving you the best possible results in any shooting situation. Face Detection AF/AE sets the focus point and exposure for the faces of your subjects. Face Detection FE adjusts the flash to correctly illuminate your subject to provide the best balance between your subject and the overall scene, eliminating the common problems of over and underexposed faces. \n\nFace Detection WB means the camera concentrates upon faces when calculating white balance for the best possible skin tones. Face Select and Track lets you highlight one face among several in a scene, and the camera concentrates on that person, even as they move around the scene. Face Detection Technology is a powerful contributing factor in Canon's Motion Detection Technology. \n\nSimply press the Face Selector Button, then the selected face is double-framed and tracked when the face moves in the frame. \n\nMotion Detection Technology works in the background to instantly evaluate how fast your subject is moving. It automatically selects and sets the optimal exposure and ISO settings to keep everything looking sharp and clear. This feature provides higher ISOs when you need it for action-stopping shutter speeds. But when no movement is detected, it sets lower ISOs for excellent color and detail. \n\nLife doesn\u2019t give you second chances to capture special times. That\u2019s why the PowerShot SX120 IS features an ISO 1600 setting that reduces the effects of camera shake and sharpens subjects in low-light situations, giving you greater shooting flexibility. \n\nRed-eye Correction provides three options for removing red-eye from subjects in flash pictures. \n1) The Red-eye Correction during shooting actually identifies and corrects red-eye in human subjects as pictures are taken. \n2) The PowerShot SX120 IS can be set to automatically detect and correct red-eye during image playback. \n\nLarge 3.0-inch PureColor System LCD\nYou\u2019ll want to have your PowerShot SX120 IS with you wherever you go, and a slim new design makes it easy. Subtly rounded for an easy grip, the camera exudes modern elegance and simplicity. The back panel\u2019s neat, intuitive interface includes a luxuriously big 3.0-inch PureColor System LCD screen. And the PureColor System LCD screen\u2019s quality is as impressive as its size: you\u2019ll get an exceptionally clear, bright view of all your shots, and enjoy a conveniently wide viewing angle for showing off your pictures to friends and family. \n\nAA battery powered camera enables you to easily power up\nConveniently, you don\u2019t need to worry about running out of batteries or having to recharging them. Since AA-size batteries can be purchased at any store, simply get new ones locally--wherever you go, no special power adapters or chargers are needed. \n\nWhat's in the Box  * PowerShot SX120 IS Body \n * AA-size Alkaline Battery (x2) \n * SD Memory Card SDC-32MB \n * Wrist Strap WS-800 \n * Digital Camera Solution CD-ROM \n * USB Interface Cable IFC-400PCU \n * AV Cable AVC-DC400",
