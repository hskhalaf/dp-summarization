And as weird as it sounds, this thing is pretty. It's really black and has almost decorative etching on some of the panels. Definitely less of an eyesore than my previous white monster.",

Even though it prints monochrome (black) it WILL scan photos in color and format as a PDF right to my computer and name the file (img1, img2, etc). Works for me!",

Manual Backing and the list price is $199? I never had a printer with manual backing; didn't know such existed in this modern age. To back the papers, the printer will print the odd numbers of the document. Then I had to reshuffle the papers so that page one is on top. Place the stack in the printer face down with the top facing the inside. Then print the even numbers. I had to convert PDF docs to Word first before printing as manual backing via Adobe Reader was impossible. Extra work, Pure frustration!",

You see, for the cost of about 5 or so ink cartridges, they can have a lazer system instead and toner is available on amazon for $12ish. And, with toner, even if its not being used, it wont dry out like injet system. They were sold on this idea and havnt looked back.

If I do buy the canon again I will make sure it has wifi. I was really surprised how fast it printed. I use lexmart at work and this printer is faster and cartridges are so much cheaper. If you don't need to do color copies, Canon is the one to go for. Recommended by my techie son who has had it for a while and says it never jams- Love it-",
