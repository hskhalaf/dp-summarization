I saw this on sale, bought it on a whim, and have been happy ever since. For lightweight, packable wind and water protection, you can't get any better. Note: It is not designed nor is advertised for all-day deluges (get a Gore Tex equivalent shell that requirement, because this jacket will soak through after a prolonged downpour). Bottom line: I pack this when I go to summer music festivals or hiking/trail running if there is a threat of rain.",

The outer layer feels and looks much better than other light weight, water resistance, jackets (other top brands usually made of cheaper materials with glossy coating to resist water, and often create a rubbing sound). Not this - no glossy coating, no rubbing sound. Arcteryx Squamish is the perfect, light weight, durable, jacket for cross training, hiking, and any other outdoor activities. I have an appreciation for great industrial designs, and the Arcteryx Squamish delivered! This is now my \u201cGo-To\u201d jacket to the fitness center in cold weather, and pretty much all of my outdoor activities.",
