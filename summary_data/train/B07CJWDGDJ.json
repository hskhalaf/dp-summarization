The Hessaire water cooler fan had exterior marring (top/side) and the bottom had been apparently dragged with shearing of plastic housing. This is clearly a used unit sold as new. Three pronged plug was wrapped in the back of the unit, but clearly not protected from possible damage in shipment. Very disappointed with this purchase.",

    "description": "The Hessaire 3,100 CFM Evaporative Cooler is compact in size, pleasing in aesthetics and the performance exceeds coolers of a much larger size. This performance is achieved through expanding air-intake areas to the hi-density XeL50 rigid media. These coolers have 3 media panels instead of a single panel found on most mobile coolers. 3 panels allow more air-intake area and reduce pre-rotation of the air to the prop, which translates into lower static pressure and more efficient air delivery to the prop. The hi-density XeL50 media provides 80% more evaporation surface compared to regular density media. This means higher evaporation efficiency and cooler temperatures.",
