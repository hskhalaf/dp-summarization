I wish they would let you know that right away. When I bought this fridge I thought I was buying a SMETA but instead I got a SMOD. I mean that\u2019s not even a word,SMOD what kind of name is that?Plus I must admit pretty good product support. But in the end I had to figure out the problem myself.Now that I have had the fridge awhile I love it works great",

With one person using ice through out the day the refrigerator can not keep up. We have to make more ice using ice trays. Overall it's almost perfect and looks nice (high end). I never heard of this brand and took a chance and glad I did. It's also very quiet. I love that I ordered online and delivery was no problem. Refrigerator was really well packed for shipping. Love it!",

Ice maker in the top lower drawer. I've never used it......I dont use ice. This refig front door looks very nice since it has no h20/ice machine on the door. Those 2 features break down on many refrig anyhow. I never liked the look of it. Go see my longer review on other Smeta.",
