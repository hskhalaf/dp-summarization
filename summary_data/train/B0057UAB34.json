And note that I said messages not a message. I must remove and then replace the paper a number of times before I can print. I spend more time trying to get the printer to print than it actually takes it to print. Spend more money and get a better printer. This one is a loser.",

They were pictures of documents. Of course Amazon allowed me to return it and find one that filled my needs. Bottom line I would have to say was my own fault. I didn't get the concept of a picture of a document. Other than that problem it was a very good product for the price.",

Having a previous HP printer, I expected high quality, and this printer has definitely met my expectations. The wireless is easy to set up and even features eprint for printing from a tablet or smartphone. The setup took less than 5 minutes. I have been using this printer purely wirelessly. I have scanned, copied, and printed with no problems. I also have printed from one floor below where the printer is located with no problems. One note, it comes with a color and black ink cartridge. This is helpful in setting up the printer. Overall, great buy!",

I have bought several HP printers, in the past, and was not happy with the quality of the plastic use in the manufacture of this one. The mechanism's plastic was very thin and could easily fail. I sent it back and will look at another brand.",

Since it is a new hp All-in-One model, I thought it would be a very good product. I didn't have problems with the installation but after my 4th time printing, the paper jammed. I took it out but after that I couldn't print anymore. Every time I tried to print, the paper jammed. So now I am returning the product as well as the 2 cartridges I bought with that.",
