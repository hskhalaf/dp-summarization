OK - The Sangean does have a flashlight that the Sony lacks... If you're shopping for your first shower radio, this is a good one. If you're looking for a replacement for your ICF-79S, keep looking.",

The flexible wire antenna is understandable for a shower radio, but it's a hassle to set and hold a station. The timer seems useless to me. It simply beeps progressively louder and then doesn't shut the radio off at the end of the cycle. I suppose I need to re-read the manual to find its true purpose. The sound quality is better than similar sized radios. Voice and music have a decent range of tone.",

One complaint (but not too important) is the AM reception. It only has an internal antenna for AM. However, it does have a very long FM antenna that can be removed from the battery compartment. FM and WS reception is excellent. The only other complaint he had was the mounting screws were too small to go into a beam, but he had better ones here to use.

Static on stations I never had an issue with before even w/ much cheaper radios. Very disappointing, I had done a ton of research before purchasing and the product had great reviews, looked & felt sturdy, digital and all but what good is a radio w/out adequate reception? I'm done with waterproofed radio's convinced they're all lousy.",

The battery would continually die. Then I bought this one. I had it 14 years through 4 homes and feel like I needed to write it an obituary. It finally died today. Had great reception. Batter lasted forever - I think I changed it about once a year if that. Tuned in digitally to stations. Lots of presets. Even a flashlight and emergency alarm which I never used but you always had it just in case the world ended first. I just purchased the newer 2013 model with Bluetooth. May it last until 2034.",

It replaced a Sony shower radio, which oddly had the top control membrane buttons break down and died. The controls are fairly simple and easy to understand, even the time setting. It also has a built-in light in case of sudden power failure and a siren thankfully I've never needed. This is also a good radio for camping trips, rain or shine. In my experience Sangean makes excellent radios made of good quality materials and produces good sound.",

The battery life is much stronger than that of prior radios I've owned and when the battery starts to weaken, it cuts off, but can be powered up for a brief time to continue listening to that story the DJ was telling. I've used this radio for more than two years and could not be more satisfied with it.",

I was very happy with them except that the membrane switches on top would eventually crack and let water into the radio and then it would die. They lasted quite a while, but it's a poorly engineered feature. So after reading good Amazon reviews, I bought this Sangean radio and could not be happier with it. There are two things that make it better than the Sony: 1. No membrane switches (and it's totally waterproof) 2. Better sound quality than the Sony. Easier to hear the A.M. news in the shower. If I ever break it, I'll buy another just like it.",

I'd say Sangeon has a great product but perhaps their quality control isn't so great. Update on 12/25/17: I've now had this radio (a replacement, see original comment) since 9/15/12. The radio continues to be my hot tub radio. It has withstood -35F temps in Alaska since purchase. I am impressed with it's longevity, functionality, and sound.",

Sensitive is ok even by leaving the small wire antenna inside the case.
