Genuinely shocked at Apples reliability and attitude to resolving problems with their products. Luckily we had bought this product from Amazon who offered a full refund on the spot thus reinforcing the belief in their brand.",

It\u2019s an obvious design flaw yet they won\u2019t admit it. Am out of warranty now and it would cost me an absolute fortune for a fix that I would have no confidence in working for more than a month or two. Probably my worst buy of all time. Avoid at all costs is my advice.",

Finding documents is not easy, my GMail has always displayed oldest emails first and won't display newest first, there is no right click for quick access eg printers. To find the printer defaults is tiresome. All in all - I would have been better buying something cheaper when I wouldn't have been so disappointed. I won't go on as others seem to love this device.
