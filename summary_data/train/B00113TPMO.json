It seems very solidly made and the readings seem reasonable, given our alcohol intake, and reproducible (within about a 5% range). A suggestion that seems sensible, although not in the instructions and I can't prove its importance, is to take in a moderately deep breath, hold it for 5-10 seconds, breath slowly out and then start to breath into the breathalyzer without stopping your expiration. This would seem to best assure a reproducible measurement of an equilibrated air sample from deep in your lungs and not from the trachea, which could represent fresh air that you have just inspired.",

    "description": "The AlcoMate Premium Breathalyzer features one of the most important innovations in the breathalyzer industry - patented PRISM (Pre-calibrated Replaceable Intelligent Sensor Module) Technology. PRISM Technology provides cutting-edge alcohol sensing using the most rigorous standards of construction, durability and accuracy. Typical breathalyzers must be periodically re-calibrated by the manufacturer in order to maintain accurate readings. This is usually done by physically mailing your breathalyzer to a service center, resulting in wasted downtime. On top of that, the re-calibration procedure itself is unable to restore Day 1 accuracy, because the wear and residue buildup inside the sensor is not addressed. Instead of going through a tedious re-calibration process, PRISM Technology allows you to directly replace your old sensor module with a new one; replacement is quick and easy, and you avoid the pitfalls of mail-back re-calibration. When you decide to invest your hard-earned dollars in a breathalyzer, you can make sure your device is as accurate as Day 1 each time you install a new sensor module, only with PRISM Technology. AlcoMate breath alcohol testers are DOT approved for law enforcement accuracy, US Coast Guard cleared, and are the single-source brand for the US Navy.\n\nMANUFACTURER CONTACT INFORMATION\nsupport@alcomate.net",
