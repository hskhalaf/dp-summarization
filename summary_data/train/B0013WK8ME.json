We let them all have a round of wacking with their wooden stick swords, 2 rounds with a little league bat to burst the candy, and one last with their swords again to fully slay the dragon. Maybe thats morbid... But it was such a good construction that it was able to take such a beating. All the better for our valiant knights to all get a chance to get a few strikes in. They loved it!",

I thought it would be easier to break open than other pinatas we have had in the past, which was important because the age range of the kids at our party was 2-5. However, when they finally managed to break it, it just ripped down the seam from the top where the hanger was and we had to turn it upside down and dump the candy out. Turns out it was made entirely of corrugated cardboard (not paper mache like traditional pinatas)and just covered with tissue. I guess you get what you pay for.",
