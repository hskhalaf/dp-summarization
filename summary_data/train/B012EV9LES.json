It does take longer than the small one, actually I have used it in 2 different microwaves, The first microwave is very old and I don't even know the wattage on it takes 23 minutes on high to fuse. The other microwave is 1100 watts and it takes 17 minutes. Hope this helps others, it took some Experimenting, I really think it depends on your microwave but everything came out beautifully and I would recommend it",
