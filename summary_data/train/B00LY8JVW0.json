This telescope can see Jupiter and it's 4 moons, saturn, mars, and Venus. Not to mention the moon. Also, you can see the andromeda galaxy and the Orion Nebula. Those are just the highlights. You can see much, much more! I highly recommend this thing to everyone who is curious of what's out there.",

They are 6 and 8 and I wanted a balance between being able to actually see things and not being super upset when it inevitably gets knocked over in the dark and smashed. This scope is the perfect balance. When the kids finally saw Saturn's rings and Jupiter's Galilean moons I knew they were hooked. I also appreciated that buying a Meade and not a toy scope would show any serious astronomer that we at least did our homework and weren't taken by the flashy magnification numbers.",

Takes some time to learn which lenses are best for what you want to see. I didn't have the phone attachment at first. The quality and magnification is much better without it. But it's fun to use. Took some nice video of the clouds passing over the moon. I love that this telescope is easy to set up and take off the tripod. We took it camping. We'll look into higher quality lenses next.",

We have been able to see the moon at different phases, we've seen jupiter, mars, and many many stars. We've even bird watched during the day. The views are superb. Great product and great price. Thank you Meade and thank you Amazon for lightening fast delivery.",

The worst of which is that it wobbles. Once you find something to look at, even something big like the moon, if you let go of the telescope, it wobbles out of position. So basically you either have to compensate for the wobble or continue to hold the scope while looking through the lens. Once you do get it to stay still, there is some super cool stuff to look at.
