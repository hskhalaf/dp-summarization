The design is nice but it's more light-duty than the Intex Mariner series; not flimsy or anything, just not nearly as robust as others out there. I bought one thinking it was the same and it's not. Intex dorked up the floor design on the new Mariners and put a rigid floor in so I ordered this in hopes it was the same as their old Mariner 3 (Seahawk III). It is not.",

I purchased the Bestway raft after having to return an Intex raft, that did leak. The Hydroforce raft seems very well made and will be just the right size for me, my wife and two small dogs. I really like how the oars attach. My only issue is with the pressure scale. For me anyway, the directions to make sure I\u2019ve inflated the raft properly seem confusing.",

It's hard to pass up the economical advantage to this purchase compared to spending more on a kayak, where it's heavier, holds less people and can't be stored away as easily. If you're looking for some fun on the water, this has proven to be a well designed and strong boat. We usually have one adult and 2 kids in it.",
