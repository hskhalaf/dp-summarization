I don't know how all these people praise rice cookers like they're foolproof miracle machines. I make far better rice in any nonstick pan with a good enough surface. This seems to stay on cooking mode for too long and it turns the bottom layer of rice into tough plastic. It's also really really lightweight and that makes it feel cheap and that's just a downer. I don't want that when I'm cooking. I've got no use for this thing.",

These 'external' rice cookers are also nice because the steam bucket sits on top of the rice cooker, and not inside - Enclosed rice cookers have an internal basket that intrudes on the main chamber, and because they sit inside they have to handle (Very hot to handle). If you're have trouble with this thing being messy, that's because you're not washing your rice. Starch is forming from rice dust, which forms bubbles that get into the exhaust, pop, and throw mess everywhere. Rinse your rice 3-6 time in cold water before cooking to fix (Just put the rice in a bowl, fill it with water, swish around a bit gently, drain, and repeat).",

      "text": "I had my other Rival 10-Cup Rice Cooker for about 17 years. It finally broke and probably because we had a power surge and not due to the cooker itself. This little guy lasts forever and cooks rice in about 15 minutes or less to perfection. It has gotten banged up, fallen off the counter, stuffed into suitcases, and taken with me while I travel often. I like that I can cook some rice and if I don't use it all, I can just take the container and lid and stuff it in the fridge for tomorrow. Great rice for the next day. This is the best rice cooker out there!",

I'm cooking UB's converted rice in this unit and I can't get away from getting toasted patches around the outside surfaces when it's completed. It's not burned but lightly browned. Will adding more water eliminate this issue? There are no settings to regulate the heat, so that's the only option I can think of that might rectify this issue with my unit. Any comments are welcome.",

They cook just fine and can make enough for several people at once, but the non-stick coating is the problem--it's just not durable. After a while (a year or longer), the coating will begin wearing out and you will see metallic spots showing up even if you are careful to clean it with just paper towels and soft materials that won't scratch the surface.",

My son who was doing dishes didn't remember that as a result, the silver coating on the outside of the inner pot was discolored. Nevertheless, it does not affect the function of this rice cooker.",
