The only problem I had, is that the generator not coming with any oil, I had gas in advance but needed to jump to the gas station to buy 10w-30 oil.",

The only drawback is at first it seemed quiet, but it is a little noisy. We don't really have anything to compare the sound to, but it did get old after a few days (but still very worthwhile!).",

The bad thing is you would think with a portable generator of this quality and expense that the wheels that are supplied would not flat spot over a short time. The wheels are a solid rubber (not inflated) and after the unit sits for much time on them, they flatten terribly. It makes moving the unit VERY difficult. They need better wheels!!!",
