It doesn't seem like THAT MUCH you can do with the yoga wheel, but then again, I'm not that creative with it just yet. The guide has 18 poses it gives you (6 beginner, 6 intermediate, and 6 advanced).",

It is fantastic for a \"restorative\" fish pose and so much more sturdy than using the highest side of a block. Tie your hair up in a bun on top of your crown though or you'll catch and roll over a pony tail.",

      "text": "About a year ago, I began waking every morning with mid-back pain and limited ROM. I tried switching pillows, mattresses, etc., and eventually it got so bad I was taking an Aleve before going to bed. I saw an ad for a much more expensive competitor, which got me to this one -- WOW -- after a few days of use, I no longer wake up with the back pain. No more drugs. It was a little painful to use at first, but it was very clear where the issues were. I just roll that level a few times each evening. Couldn't be happier with this.",

Plexus wheels were lighter and had a thinner softer cushion which actually isn't as comfortable on your back.
