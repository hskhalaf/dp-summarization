The sole is the best part of these shoes -- it provides great grip on even the loosest trail (of which I had plenty!). The shoe is also really comfortable, though it fits large. I am a size 7.5 for regular shoes and 8 for running shoes. I bought these 7.5 and wish I had bought them size 7. Nonetheless, these still worked great even if a tad big. Amazon's price is also amazing! They were being sold on site at the race for $110!",

I followed the reviews but only ordered a 1/2 size down, not a full, because they didn't have anything smaller then 8. Shoes were very comfortable out of the box and fit perfect. The shoe lacing system is a little weird but you get used to it quickly. Very good arch support and nice toe box with no rubbing. Love them! Only flaw is the, otherwise it would get a five, is the slide clip broke second time wearing them. Contacted the seller and he's sending me new laces! Great customer service.",
