In the past, I've found some treats can make one of my dogs slightly ill - he has a sensitive stomach - but these, without fillers or artificial ingredients he has no trouble with at all. I hate to say these are \"people food\" but they basically are: people could eat these if they had to, so in that sense, the dogs are getting something equivalent to \"people food\". Highly recommended.",
