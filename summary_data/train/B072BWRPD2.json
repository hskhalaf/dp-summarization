Although I would recommend something with more support for a long distance trainer, something not as narrow with more cushion like a Brooks Launch or a Hoka One-One. These shoes are extremely light weight and very comfortable. They are a tad narrow in the middle but I expect that from a race shoe and not a typical training shoe. The toebox is nice and roomy considering the sleek design. I can't wait to put these to the true test and set some half marathon PR's this fall!",
