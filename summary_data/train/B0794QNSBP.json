Sony of course only gives the typical scripted response, \"Reset unit and Have it wired by a professional installer\". I have installed 100+ units throughout the years and have never need a \"professional\". Do yourself a favor and buy a different brand.",

I've got one minor issue, which is there r no bass, midrange, or treble settings just the EQ presets. That being said I would most definitely recommend this unit.",
