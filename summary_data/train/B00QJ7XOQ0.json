It tasted much better when mixed with milk, but still very sweet. One positive: it is filling and helps curb appetite. Overall, dissatisfied. Not ideal if one is cutting calories. It is more suitable if one is in a bulking phase of a cut/bulk cycle where you want to consume more calories than your maintenance.",

But at the price, it's hard to complain too much. The best brand i've tried is Optimum Nutrition. It's more expensive but if taste is important to you, i'd highly recommend giving them a try. Plus they have a ton of flavors.",

I\u2019ve been using this protein for the last two months and it has been great, I\u2019ve seen changes and how it had been able to help me progress. The only con I have with it is that the flavor is a little strong especially if you use more than one scoop of protein. I found that one scoop of protein along with 12 ounces of milk is the perfect amount, a little less and the flavor is overpowering and too much the flavor is very weak, but overall love the protein and will continue to using this brand and maybe try a different flavor!",
