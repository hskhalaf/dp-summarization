Sturdy design and lots of small storage compartments. Even comes with 2 refillable ice packs. Would recommend to anyone!",

It looked like it would make my life easier, I could carry my lunch and my necessities to work without having to carry a back pack and a lunch pack. I also wanted it for weekend hiking. I put my lunch into the bottom of the pack and zipped it shut. Halfway through zipping, the zipper broke. I hope it was just a rare defective pack, but since it is online only, I haven't been able to investigate it in person. I sent it back and had no issues with the return. I would like another one, but I'm skeptical about ordering it without testing it first.",

Used it as a day/beach bag. The cooler portion works okay. Not the best & condensation/water leak through the material. Even with zippers completely closed. I'm using it for the second time and the material for the drawstring portion is completely coming apart at the seam. There is a two inch rip along the seam. I've been very gentle with it. It's frustrating.",

All of the pockets are pouch style (no mini organizers like in most standard bags and backpacks) which is a slight bummer. I typically avoid bags that dont have metal clasps and hardware but took a chance and was let down. If they put quality hardware on this bag, it would be five stars and easy to recommend to friends and family. Until then, tread carefully my friends.",

You have to sit the bag upright, then fold the top part down to unzip the bottom part. But it's very roomy with lots of pockets. Does what I need to, and it should last quite awhile.",
