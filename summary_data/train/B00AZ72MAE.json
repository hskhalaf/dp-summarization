The ice pack also sweated a bit, leaving drops of water coming off, so I used a thin cloth to help with that. Definitely prefer ice packs that come with a cover. Only plus is that it's very flexible.

Especially like the outer fabric covering that is not just slick plastic but a nice durable fabric and the edges are bound off nicely with a white edge trimming fabric. Must be an upgrade from the picture. At first, when frozen the pack feels rather hard. I would squish it a little in my hands and it quickly softens and becomes moldable to my hand and wrist. That is where I mostly use it for cold therapy for arthritis at base of thumb.",

      "text": "I bought this heating pad to help out keep my sons food hot for his lunch. The size is perfect and fits very well inside his lunchbox. The problem is that you can only heat it up in the microwave for 30s. If for some reason you try to heat it up a little more, it starts leaking a clear goo - the inside gel. Because of that, it heat's up into a mild temperature, and definitly wont hold up the heat for a long period of time.",

They worked just fine in the first a couple of hours but they leaked like crazy once they were defrosted. Contacted CS and got refunds. Don't get me wrong. I love Amazon but this item is just not worth it. It needs to be redesigned. I would suggest a disposable ice pack over this item.",
