Each character getting their own themed Classic Mode is also really cool. One of my favorite changes is that the challenges aren't totally brutal overall. No \"complete X mode with every character\" stuff.

The digital downloads are nice too though for if you want to navigate to different games without having to get up and switch out your game.",

Everything was imitated with a paper cover and also paper on the game itself. I was actually excited to receive this product (would have gave a 5) but the 1 star is just for my personal experience.",
