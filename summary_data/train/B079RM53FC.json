      "verdict": "The Vionic Bryant was considered reasonably priced for its quality build and comfort. Its arch support also helped to relieve foot pains. Commenters were also pleased that it was easy to put on and remove. Though there were claims that the fit and length were as expected, a few purchasers noted that the trainer ran short and narrow. It was also not as comfortable for some buyers because of chafing and poor cushioning. But in the end, most buyers ended up being delighted with their purchase.",

        "Almost all of the reviewers appreciated the comfort delivered by the Vionic Bryant",

        "Several testers enjoyed the fact that this footgear was easy to put on and remove",
        "Because of the quality build of the shoe, some shoppers thought it was worth the price",
        "A few folks enjoyed how lightweight this model felt on their feet"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "A minority of consumers ranted that the Vionic Bryant ran short and narrow",
        "The underfoot cushioning and arch support were deemed insufficient by several users",

I'll be returning them, but am leery about reordering another pair, for fear I will get some more of the same.",
