It's getting to the point that I put off dentals as long as possible due to problems with anesthesia. I have seem some good improvement using this daily. Product comes with a small measuring spoon. It would be nice if they had a clip on the side of the container for the clip. If you put it inside the bottle (they way the product arrives), it tends to get lost. This is definitely not a replacement for brushing your dog's teeth. I appreciate that it is helping with the tartar.",

My cat unfortunately doesn't have really great genetics when it comes to his teeth and it is practically impossible to try brush his teeth or even think about getting into his mouth. This meant that he started to build up a lot of plaque and eventually had to have 4 teeth extracted. Desperate to keep that from happening again I started to look for alternatives and found this product. Every vet visit since then has been an all-clear and his teeth are looking way better. Would definitely recommend for any cat owners.",

    "description": "ProDen PlaqueOff animal is an easy way for those dog and cat owners to care for their pet's teeth who don't have the patience or inclination to brush their dog or cat's teeth regularly. The product comes in powdered form and it is simply added on a daily basis to dry or wet food. Dogs and cats like the taste of the small amount that is added. Proden plaqueoff animal does not rely on topical application or friction. The product is ingested and works systemically. Additional Information The natural compound in the product comes out through the saliva and works to break down the bacterial biofilm that forms on the teeth and gums. This is how the natural bacteria in the mouth take hold onto the teeth and gums, colonizing and creating the oral problems of plaque and tartar, bad breathe and gingivitis. It does not change the ph of the mouth or kill off the normal levels of bacteria. Proden plaqueoff has been proven to reduce plaque and tartar on the teeth and gums, depending on composition, diet and how long it has been there. It then works to prevent bad breath, plaque and tartar from returning. Patients generally begin to see results over a 2-8 week period, and will see further benefits with continued use. Proden plaqueoff animal is made from a specific strain of selected seaweed harvested from above scandinavia. This seaweed has developed a natural defensive mechanism against bacterial biofilm. The product is made only from this seaweed and has no additives or chemicals added. It is human grade and human tested.",
