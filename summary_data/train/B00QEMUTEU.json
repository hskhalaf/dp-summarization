Within 1 day of using the new wipes my daughter broke out in a horrible blistered and painful diaper rash. I found one last pack of the old ones and the rash immediately started to get better, but you can't get the old formula anymore! Guess I'm switching to a new hypoallergenic brand.

I was using a different brand for sensitive skin but realized they had alcohol which was burning her rash terribly. I bought these wipes and it was night and day, they didnt burn at all. The only downside is that these cost twice as much per wipe compared to the leading brands. The subscribe and save option was the best deal I could find but they keep going out of stock so it just wasn't reliable.",

Also, it says the bags leaking while traveling. The others seem to leak more than these flip-tops. They don't seem to leak in our case anyway.",
