It was somewhat time-consuming to assemble, but everything finally locked into place and it's very sturdy. The color and size works well for my needs. It seems to be real wood with a hard plastic covering. I hope it wears well. I looked everywhere on the product information about care of it but cannot find anything. I suppose it will be OK to clean it with soap and water but not sure. Also not sure whether coasters are needed for hot drinks - probably so.",

The seller did not clarify in the listing whether or not it was solid but when I read the \"questions\" section everyone stated it is in fact solid wood. Also, the color description is quite off. It is more of a light brown color. If you are looking for something that is quality and looks weathered like the photo I advise you to look at something else.",
