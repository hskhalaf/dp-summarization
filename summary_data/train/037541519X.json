He is quite simply the best illustrator of wild life and wild growth alive today in America. His intimate familiarity with the subjects he illustrates is evident in the most cursory review of his books. For the amateur interested in trees and birds, I strongly recommend his books as a guide to identification. His bird book never leaves my car and his Guide to Trees is regularly used in my library. His Hawks in Flight, written and illustrated in collaboration with Pete Dunne, is an American classic.",

Though some would disagree, I'm sure, I find this is an enormous improvement over the Audubon manual, where the photos, of questionable utility, are organized into different sections (fruits, leaves, flowers, etc.). The advantage of that book is that once you make it to the text part, there's more in-depth information. With Sibley's book, everything is on one page. Another issue I have with the book is the editorializing about the value of some trees, ostensibly as street trees. And for some strange reason Sibley expresses admiration for .... Norway Maples (?!). On the other hand, he does give some information on invasives, etc.",
