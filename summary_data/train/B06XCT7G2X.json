These let me do a quick kill-the-sweet-tooth chocolate protein shake in the wee hours without the noise and mess of the blender. I never would've dreamed a stainless wire ball could make that much difference, but it does. These are big and roomy, too. I usually use about 10 oz. milk with protein powder, green powder, and cocoa, plus 3 ice cubes (that don't fully melt, just chill everything down), and when shaken the container is nearly full.",

I decided to order two more and found a color pack that I liked. Package arrived today and I have two totally random colors. I don't even see this color combo as an option to order. Overall, good product but be wary if you want specific colors.",

They don't leak during shaking, they're very easy to clean, and the loop on the lid can be used to hang them from a backpack or coffee mug hook.",

Drop in a couple scoops of protein powder and the little wire mixing ball and shake for about a minute. Shakes are always smooth and don;t have any 'powder bombs' in them. The mouth opening cover has a sort of click to it when you press down hard which really feel like it makes a sturdy seal. So far I have never leaked a drop from the cover or mouth opening while shaking. Definitely recommend these!",

    "title": "BlenderBottle Classic Loop Top Shaker Bottle, 28-Ounce 2-Pack, Colors May Vary",
    "description": "Color:Colors May Vary| Size:28ozThe 2-pack of BlenderBottle Classic 28-Ounce Shaker Cups makes it easy to maintain proper nutrition and hydration on-the-go. While one dishwasher-safe bottle is getting clean, there\u2019s another on hand for mixing protein shakes, smoothies, fiber drinks, and meal replacements. Featuring a patented mixing system, the 316 surgical-grade stainless steel BlenderBall wire whisk (found only in BlenderBottle brand shaker cups) moves freely inside the bottle to smooth out drink mixes and meal ingredients. It\u2019s also a handy kitchen tool for mixing pancake batter, scrambled eggs, and salad dressings. The wide mouth makes it easy to add scoops of powdered mixes, meal ingredients, and liquids, and embossed markings show both ounces and milliliters for easy measuring anywhere (note that markings on the 28-ounce capacity shaker cup only go up to 20 ounces). Bottle contents and liquids are securely contained thanks to a tightly threaded screw-on lid that creates a leakproof seal, and a flip cap that snaps securely shut for shaking and transportation. The convenient loop top makes it easy to carry the bottle and offers a place to attach car keys while at the gym. The BlenderBottle Classic 28-Ounce Shaker Bottle can also be used as a water bottle; the ball can be left inside, as it will never rust, chip, or peel. Includes two, 28-ounce BlenderBottles. BPA and phthalate-free, dishwasher safe. Manufacturer\u2019s limited lifetime warranty.",
