If I remove it from the docking station and carry it to a conference room to plug into a projector, when I hit Func-F8 to switch the display mode, the screen blinks and flashes, and maximizes the magnification such that I cannot even display powerpoint. This may be my company's firewall and other security stuff, but removing the keyboard software fixed it. Also the fingerprint reader response is very, very slow. 20sec or so between putting my finger on the spot and getting the logged in screen.",

The fingerprint log on still works on Vista, however, security for most websites is much tighter now. What I mean is, before to create a fingerprint logon for a website, you just scan at that site's log on screen. The software would recognize this was the actual logon screen and a wizard would come up to help you through setup. All my banking sites are not recognized by the software.",

I would only remove a star because the special intellikeys (assignable keys) are not that well designed: They need to be pressed too hard and the top of the keyboard gives (bends) a little). The volume control keys are particularly bad.",

This advanced desktop set includes the fingerprint reader to eliminate password hassles, and extended battery life to provide longer wireless freedom. \n\n The included wireless optical mouse with tilt wheel technology offers total maneuverability; the entire wheel tilts, acts as a button, and reacts smoothly to your speed. Optical technology refers to the use of an optical sensor to track mouse movement, rather than the traditional use of mechanical parts. As a result, optical mouse products work on most surfaces and offer you better durability, increased speed and accuracy, and consistent performance.\n\n What's in the Box\nKeyboard with attached USB cable, mouse, fingerprint reader, get started guide, setup instructions, CD-ROM, warranty and registration card",
