At the top of the nursing cover is a wire, which most nursing covers have these days so you can see your baby and for oxygen. The wire should be round. Mine came bent in the middle so the wire pops out to a V at the top of the cover. 3. I\u2019ve only used this cover twice. I washed it once before using and the wire is poking out of the fabric at the top of the cover. Do not buy.",
