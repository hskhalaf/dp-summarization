My two boys decided to stick with the plastic sleds since they went slower. I am 6'2\" and 220 lbs and I fit in it nicely. The strap holds it in nicely although I don't think it's necessary since it doesn't seem like it would come out once inflated. The handles on the sides have nice stitching and look like they will hold up for a long time. Overall, I love this. I will use it until my boys get a little older and braver. Maybe I just need to find a somewhat slower hill.",

Reached out for replacement tube, provided correct address via email, they sent to old/incorrect address, waited several weeks for replacement. Got new tube, used a few times in winter 2017, now trying to use for first time today, and new tube had another hole in it near valve as well. Poor quality. Poor worksmanship. Not a good value. For price, I\u2019d expect to last a few years without issue. You\u2019re better off buying new $20-30 tubes every year or two, or the LL Bean tubes for similar price.",

When we finally tried using it, the tube had no ability to slide. It's almost like they used a material that was anti-slip on the underside. While rubber tire tubes are appealing because they seem stronger, this is now our second rubber tire tube and both have been a disappointment. I would stick to the plastic tubes, even though they may not last as long, they are more fun.",
