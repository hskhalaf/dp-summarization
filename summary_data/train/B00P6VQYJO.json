This could be a good thing if you allot enough time, but for my tight schedule it doesn\u2019t quite jive. Also, no skin tingle. Again, this could be a positive if you didn\u2019t like that from other pre-workouts, but I enjoyed it. All around 10/10 I will definitely buy again.",

I'm in college and don't have time to workout more than a few times a week, so when I do, I need to make it count. I tracked my workouts with an Apple Watch both with and without using pre-workout. I was able to squeeze in 2-3 more reps benching and shave about 30 seconds off my 2 mile run without a noticeable difference in fatigue.",

I have tried numerous other pre-workput powders over the years but this is one that I actually do feel lasting energy in their 2 stage delivery method. It has a nice tingle after a few minutes but is not overwhelming and really helps me focus on tasks at hand. The pump is decent from it as well. Overall its a really good product in a market of mediocre caffeine loaded wannabes.",

That is until about half way through my workout and I felt a steady surge of energy and was able to power through. I never get the jitters like a lot of pre-workouts. It has a nice steady release that keeps you going. The only thing I would change is the flavor, but that is personal preference. It does what it says. Nuff said.",
