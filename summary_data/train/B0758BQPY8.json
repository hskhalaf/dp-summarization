I've made: Challah Bread, Cinnamon Rolls & icing. The dough hook made kneading way easier! Big fan so far, like the suction cups on the bottom. Easy clean up bowl & slippery, non-stick on attachments.",

I've made two dozen cookies(beat blade), pizza dough(dough hook), baked French Toast(whisk attachment) and English Muffin bread(dough hook) in two days since delivery! The attachments are dishwasher safe but I prefer to wash by hand and it is a breeze to do so. The suction cups on the bottom keep the machine secure on the counter while in use. It's VERY lightweight and easy to move around. This a good stand mixer for a beginner cook or for simple baking. I couldn't be happier!",

So far worked great for everything from Mixing Meatloaf and pie crust To whipping Cream!! Really like this mixer Thinking of buying one for my daughter and one for my son's girlfriend for next Christmas!!",

Also when using a small amount of stuff - say to make some cookie icing, it doesn't do a good job mixing it. It does cookie dough fine - mixing that is; but it does not eliminate scraping it off the sides of the bowl. Huge disappointment.",

Was gonna return it because of that, but do like the mixer and did not wanna go through the hassle of returning it. That is the reason for the 2 star. We do like the unit even though the splash guard is useless. I mean get what you pay for I guess. So try a different seller if wanting to buy this product for sure. Horrible",
