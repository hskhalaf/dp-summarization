I no longer have to use a baseball batter's swing to get my lure where I want it to go, just a nice gentle toss will do the trick. No unusual noises and the fast retrieval ratio, I got the 7.5 to 1, brings them in fast!",

I'm sure the advancements in technology are causing me a learning curve but I've had to turn on all 4 centrifugal breaks just to keep from birds-nesting at the beginning of the cast. Not totally blaming the reel but from the videos I watched, that made tuning the reel appear effortless, I'm just a little disappointed I'm how difficult it has been.",

I bought this reel to use in place of my Abu Garcis Gen 3 SX reel, that reel is OK but it back lashes more often that I would like. At under $100.00 this reel is a steal.",

The high speed retrieve allows me to maintain tension on the line while landing a fish and maintain a hook set when fishing slow baits (rubber worms and creature baits.) Because of its light weight, I can cast repeatedly without become tired or getting a sore arm.",
