BENQ always seems to deliver in price and quality for that money. My only issue is the menu system takes abit to get use to but doesnt take too long but i do like that there is a HDR button",

I don't know why (probably because the panel is not that good) but if you look it at a normal height (around the 50~75% of the screen) it becomes darksih on the top (some kind of brown/dark-red) and excessively bright on the bottom. This is not that obvious when playing, but with a webpage is always there. I've also tested it with a game (Far Cry 5), and it shows a huge ghosting sometimes (something dark over a bright background).",

Unfortunately, this makes the entire screen very unusable as scenes suffer \"auras\" around areas (see pic). When in non-HDR (\"normal\") mode, the banding goes away. This effect is the same on both HDMI and DisplayPort from multiple PCs. If this is the quality that BenQ strive for, I'll be careful with recommending them in future.",

Definitely noticed a difference from an Acer 4K monitor I bought which I really didn't like the colours so returned. But this one is the bees knees. Speaker isn't the best but does the job when you need it. Then again its just an extra so can't complain. HDR seems to make a slight difference but until games support HDR, I don't think its completely necessary. Then again, when PS5 comes out, I guess I won't have to upgrade my monitor :)",

Haven't had chance to test out any 4k content, but HDR works perfectly on my xbox one S. For anyone reading reviews about 'fake HDR', this can be a little misleading. While other displays, typically TVs offer a greater brightness, this monitor does support true HDR, providing the device connected (in my case, an xbox one) also supports HDR. When HDR is enabled from the monitor and there is no HDR content to display, the monitor uses software to emulate the HDR experience. Speakers are serviceable, but I recommend using headphones or using external speakers.",

Regarding viewing angle, there isn't really much range, but if you're just sat directly in front of the screen you should find it is fine.

The \u2018HDR\u2019 functionality is awful to be polite. It\u2019s like having a sepia filter on; the contrast is turned down and saturation way up. The colours look washed out. Simply put, spend a bit more and get hdr 10. It has a 60hz (60fps) refresh rate, which would be great were it not for the amount of screen noise. After an hour playing an FPS or Fifa, I fealt sick. It just becomes a blurred mess. In summary, don\u2019t be attracted by the low price point. Save up, splash out and get something nice.",

The size is a little overwhelming at first if you're not used to it, but it's worth getting used to, especially for streaming video content. High refresh and FreeSync 2 both perform as expected and have definitely improved my experience with a few FPS titles (e.g. Destiny 2). My only warning is don't buy this monitor if the main feature you're looking for is HDR. The difference between normal and HDR colour modes is underwhelming compared to similarly priced HDR-focused displays.",
