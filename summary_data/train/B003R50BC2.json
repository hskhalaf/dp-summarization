Overall, I love this bag for the convenience of having hands free to carry the skis and poles. And the size is perfect. It's lightweight but seems durable. It doesn't add much weight at all to your gear. We've used it for one season and it's held up well. It may be the best ski boot backpack available. So far, I haven't found a better one.

      "title": "Ripped on first trip",
      "text": "Bought this for my trip out to Colorado. Great design but the bag handle on the top ripped out from the luggage handler. It was gate checked on a regional turbo prop flight. The gate check tag was on this and they lost it. Since the bag then had no tag, they were refusing to give me my bag when I got off the flight. Luckily the pilot intervened and I got my bag. Good design, crappy quality.",
