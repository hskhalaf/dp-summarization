Outdoorsy folks also had better prepare to be smitten by its amazing support system, quick break-in period, and remarkably spacious toe box. That said, this mesmerizingly good-looking hiker might disappoint those who value fit precision in their gear or those who look forward to a footbed that needs no replacing. Overall, while the Oboz Sawtooth II Low\u2019s portfolio contains some misses, it does list qualities that can make hikes safe and enjoyable right from the get-go.",

I have worn Merrell shoes for a decade, with some variation in the fit and wear quality with each new pair. These Oboz shoes fit better and have a more cushioned feel as you step forward. They seem to ventilate as well as the Merrells. I look forward to trying some Oboz ankle high models.",
