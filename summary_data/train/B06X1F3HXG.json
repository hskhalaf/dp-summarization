The only downside is the dust compartment is pretty small so you have to empty it after every use. It\u2019s super easy to empty and clean though.",

You can't seems to stop the schedule once it's set because there is no button on the remote to do it. Yes all these are mentioned in the description, but my point is that there are other robots that do all that and only cost like $30 more. I wish I got a different one...",

It gets under counters, tables, and places that the larger vacuum cannot. It is also really cute to watch. We did a lot of research before this purchase, and this has yet to disappoint.

The cons are that it doesnt have a remote app to control the unit. It comes with a standard remote where you can program times to run and use directional buttons.

It gets stuck on wall corners, chairs, doesn\u2019t sense as well, goes full speed into a wall, etc. the vacuum is okay if you control it the entire time, and if you remove EVERYTHING from the floors hopefully it doesn\u2019t have to get unstuck. I live in a studio apartment so it\u2019s not a lot of room to cover. If you\u2019re looking for a cheap robot vacuum that\u2019ll somehow get the job done and are lazy, get this one. If you have a little more money to spend. Try getting a different one.",

The only thing is you have to make sure any loose cords are out of the way or taped down to the floor because it will stop and get stuck on them. The first time using this, I watched to see which areas needed to be secured. Now there is no issues.",

Stop sensing obstructions after 2 months and would just turn off every time it came across a piece of furniture.
