It required some minor assembly, which was fairly simple. Overall quality is very good. My only detractor (pretty minor) is that the unit can tip if you have the razor removed resulting in it becoming unbalanced. If the base was a bit larger, that issue could be resolved. So I would take off a half star for that, if I could.",

When put together it would wobble from side to side because of the bolt at the bottom of the stand it would push against the padding on the bottom and when you put everything on the stand it would never sit straight and sometimes fall over. But I got this at a discount price from Amazon warehouse deals from a return. So not a deal breaker. But it works fine now.",
