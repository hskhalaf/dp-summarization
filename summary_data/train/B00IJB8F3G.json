My only \"complaint\" is that I can't find a long heavy-duty meat fork to accompany these tongs. When hoisting a 10-pound standing rib roast from a blazing hot grate while searing the meat, short lightweight forks just do not perform.

They hold up very well and seem very rigid and sturdy compared to the big box flimsy tongs. Standard tongs bend with weight and the harder you squeeze to pick up the more you bend them. Not sure if they are dishwasher safe so I've been hand washing them, so just be careful because they do have wood grips and it could potentially swell or warp. Other that that they seem to be working great, I can't want to try these out on some ribs and a big ol brisket. Good buy",
