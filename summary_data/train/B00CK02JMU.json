There ought to be a warning or something as this product is capable of inflicting a very deep cut. I question whether this product is actually made in the USA as claimed. The sharp edges on the metal appear to me to be one example of where the manufacturer skimped on product quality, in addition to its very flimsy and cheap looking construction.",

We use MERV 8 - about a mid rating. All filters, rated inches x inches x one inch thick are less than 1 inch thick. Hence these and others rattle in the filter case when the blower first comes on. No problem, but I wonder why they all describe their filters as one inch thick when there are more like 3/4. Anyway, perfectly satisfied with these - prefer them over the others I've tried.",
