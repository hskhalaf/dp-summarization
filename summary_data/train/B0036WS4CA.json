I'm not sure what other people are saying about only being able to watch Netflix movies in your que because my wife has picked several movies that weren't in the que. We basically have the same availability as with the PS3 that died on us. The unit is not super fast to load a movie but it's far from slow...20 seconds or so? Plenty of options to adjust the audio and video output and it sincs with my Bravia flat screen too. Great player. Glad I bought it.",

I'll update if I have any problems, but so far this player has proven to be excellent. Great picture, excellent sound, and my regular DVDs seem to look better when played on this unit as well.

The only negative was having to purchase the Sony wifi adapter, rather than the ability to use one we already had or buy a cheaper one. We did manage to pick this up on here when it was on sale for less than $100 so that was a big plus.",

Amazon let me return the Samsung and I purchased the Sony BDP-S370 instead. I don't care for the design as much as the Samsung and I miss VUDU which the Sony doesn't have but I do love the fact that it simply works. It plays every DVD in my collection and the streaming functionality is great. If you want a product that won't give you any trouble stick with Sony.",

Since my monitor is only 1080i compatible I can't comment on the Sony's full capability in HD, but what it does with my current monitor is very satisfying. For the money, and now that Oppo seems to be discontinuing all of its mid-priced highly regarded players, I'd say this Sony is the next best thing.",

No upscaling of standard DVDs so I wouldn't recommend it as your only DVD Player but for price and performance playing Blu-Ray discs it's a real value.",

This blue ray player will not let you browse or search Netflix, you have to add the movies to your instant que in order to watch them on the player. My Samsung and XBOX allow you to browse, search and have suggestions was well. I am very dissapointed with Sony. Sony representative told me all Sony Blue Ray players have the same restriction. Returning it and getting the Samsung.",

No, no, no, you need to shell out $75-$80 to buy a Sony-branded USB wifi dongle, probably made in the same factory that made your $20 one but bearing the highly-valued Sony brand name; that kicks this player up (unnecessarily, IMHO) into a significantly higher price bracket.",

I don't have that kind of time or ability to absorb aggravation. I just went out to Wal-Mart, found a LG model on sale for $92 and called it a day.

It does have a few more features then the others but the bottom line is,we buy these for the picture quality. I wish I had spent a little more and gotten another Pionee... BTW, the other 2 plyers were both broken by my grandkids...maybe I should have bought my players for durabillity instead of picture quality.",
