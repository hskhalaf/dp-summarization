There's no way my previous helmets would have stayed on my head to protect me. They were ill fitting; I just assumed all helmets were that way. When trying this helmet on I thought I bought the wrong size. After a couple minutes of adjusting I experienced how a bike helmet should fit. Unlike my other helmets this one slips on and doesn't move. It fits my head perfectly, it's comfortable and it's looks like a million bucks. Luckily I haven't had any bad accidents. Take care of your head with this helmet!",

I will admit i read many reviews and watched too many videos before deciding on the purchase of this particular helmet. It already had outstanding marks from a lot of different editorials in the cycling community and had a lot of features I was looking for(aero, lightweight, adjustability, antimicrobial chinstrap). I hope i never need to use it as protection, but I feel confident that it will be adequate.",

The front left snaps in and out, but the right is loose. Shoddy design, poor quality control, who knows. Lost my business.",
