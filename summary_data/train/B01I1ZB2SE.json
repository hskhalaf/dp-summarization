I super-glued a couple of these magnets to sawed off dowels, (make the dowels short so that their weight doesn't compete with the magnets searching). One of the things I like about using these is that it's possible to use one to find a stud line and just leave it there until you're ready to begin your project. Caution on separating the individual magnets upon receipt ... they are mega, as in hugely powerful - so much so that if you get two of them stuck together, it's a challenge to get them unstuck.",

It was easy to separate them with the dividers and plastic sheathing. If you want a small magnet that can hold some weight, or stay put on a fridge door that's opened frequently, get these. They're between the size of a quarter and silver dollar, if measurements throw you off.",

Overall, a good purchase. I believe this is the safest way of package them Still, (because of their strength,) be careful. After all they are the highest power of neodymium magnets available. By the way, after I purchased these little wonders, I went back and purchased several more!. Enjoy!",

Although the magnets are so darn strong that if the 3m tape stuff isn't strongly adhered to the surface you are using them on, the magnet strength rips them right off.

I was using them inside my aquarium to attach some shelf rock and they were strong enough to hold the rocks but eroded eventually. I read online that neodymium was ideal for use in aquariums but apparently that was not accurate. I think I just need to try a different type of magnet for what I\u2019m looking for. Other than that, they were extremely strong and were able to hold up 2-3 pound rocks. I was very impressed with their performance but I think they\u2019d be better for other uses around the house or whatever. Just watch your fingers because again they\u2019re extremely strong magnets.",
