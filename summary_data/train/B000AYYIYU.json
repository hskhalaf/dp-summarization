Timex 1-yr warranty is not worth time and expense of filing a claim, so I bore the loss on that watch. Two weeks ago, I bought a third version of this same watch. This latest watch was defective upon arrival in that day/date could not be set using the stem. I returned it for a refund.",

You know what Timex, scrap the $30 model and make it $50 and construct something more commensurate with your time-honored brand; shame on you. Better to make something expensive and great than affordable garbage.",

The leather adjustable notch band is a comfortable fit for a 235 lb. gentleman with a size 13 ring size.

The indigo light doesn't seem as bright as it used to be, years back, but it helps a bit. The date feature is barely readable, as the little window is much too small, and you can't really see the whole number. But as long as he can see the time, he's satisfied. A watch with a larger face would be much better for anyone with any vision issues.",

Today I noticed it was about five minutes slow and adjusted it. A few hours later I noticed AGAIN it was five minutes slow. A lot of people have good luck with them but I didn't, I guess that's the crapshoot of a $20 watch. If I were you, I'd just spend the extra $60 and get something that was accurate.",
