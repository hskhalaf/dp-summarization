The Spray Mist is good - it is evenly dispersed mist that shoots 3 feet in front of the mop head - just the right distance amount to get floor wet in front of you to properly clean. I like that it came with an extra bottle and 2 extra cleaning pads. The handle is a little small for my hand it may have been designed for smaller hands - a larger handle would give me more leverage to move it around easier and faster. other than that - it is very well made. I would recommend this mop, but they might think about making the handle more ergonomic.",

Three microfiber heads came with the mop and they stick absolutely securely to the base. And they are machine washable. Sometimes I have trouble keeping the head aligned properly as I mop, but I\u2019m getting the hang of it and it is definitely a plus to have a swivel head. Excellent product.",

So I purchased another, figuring I already had purchased additional mop heads and shouldn't waste all that $$. MISTAKE! This mop again just fell apart after a month of use! Mid-swipe the pole pushed down into the body of the mop and all of the plastic snapped! SO CHEAP!",

I wish I could give it 5 stars, but the only problem is the joint between the handle and mop. This should've been a BALL joint to allow the mop to swivel 360 degrees and stay flat on the floor. Instead, it's a semi-fixed joint that makes it tilt from the side, forcing you to constantly lower it back down and push perfectly back and forth to keep it level. Extra work that could easily be fixed with a better part.",

I have a steam cleaner so this was only used for spot cleaning. I don't think it would last more than a month or two if it were used regularly.",

I first noted that it was extremely thin & flimsy but on first use it worked pretty good. The 2nd time i went to use it, it wouldnt spray. Took the bottle off & saw liquid had seemed in the nozzle. Shook it out, made sure nothing was clogged, resnapped the bottle into place & still nothing. Its basically like a swiffer ends up after a month but only after once use. Itd be cheaper to just buy a new swiffer every month then waste money on this piece of junk.",
