That way, only the fine stuff goes in my filter, as I am using my skimmer line and don't want to clog it. In case you need to add a leaf canister, here's the product link:  The two work together very efficiently. If your vaccuum gets stuck by the stairs, try moving the weight rings. I think I found the perfect place for them after trying a few times. All in all a great pool vac for the price. I should have bought this a long time ago.",

I suppose we could've replaced or tweaked a few parts, but we decided to just buy another. We went through the brand-name stage, and the brand names are really expensive ($300 range), and cost as much to repair as to replace. This unit stays in the pool year round (we're in AZ), works 12 hours per day, and never needs maintenance (it probably does, but we don't do it). We leave it in with 1-2 weekly shocks, algaecide, etc--we never remove it. I do recommend it highly.",

I would make some comments on the instructions received with it. The instructions are very rudimentary in terms of improving performance. The wights which come with the cleaner to put on the hose do not do anything to the angle or position of the cleaner.

If once installed you don't see it moving quickly around the floor of the pool and making a \"tat tat tat\" sound, you most likely installed it incorrectly or your pool filter needs changing. Having said that, it does a good to great job picking up floor debris and, considering the alternatives, you can't beat this price point. I recommend without reservations.",

I just hold one end of the hose up to the return line and then make sure I keep the hose underwater while connecting it to the suction line, so it doesn't fill back up with air.

Would recommend this to anyone with a 10k gallon pool since it works so well for me. There are obviously some trouble areas like having to occasionally remove the lodged palm tree fruit from the flapper but all in all it has worked well for me. I use the vacuum once a week in the morning for several hours while I do other chores around outside like mowing the lawn followed by balancing the pool chems and cleaning out the filters after it is finished vacuuming.",

I started with 2 weights....which worked well, but I just added the 3rd weight and it works much better!! I should've gotten 1 of these years ago!!",

That is not a huge issue because most automatic vacuums only do the bottom period. I am very happy with the vacuum.",

So...4 month in, I am less impressed. The back roller brace broke and a hole has rubbed thrown one of the main pipes (not a hose segment, one of the 2 pipes on the body). It pulling up the dirt, but loses a lot of suction due to the hole. It will not last more than one season. DO NOT BUY!!!",

This vacuum picked up a good majority of the dead algae that accumulated in the bottom of the pool. I did not have any issues with the vacuum's suction due to picking up a leaf, however I generally skimmed the pool before putting it in. I did have to play with the weights a bit. The recommended position would cause the vacuum to hang up in a corner of my steps. Changing the weights position fixed that issue.",

My only gripe is that the big round flap thingie comes loose once in awhile. No biggie, it's easy to re attach. I want to buy a vacuum hose spinner but the ones I've seen here have less than stellar reviews. I'm glad I bought this vacuum.",
