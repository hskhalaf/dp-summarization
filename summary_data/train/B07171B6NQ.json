What a collector or just anyone interested in buying this particular Pop! should know is that there is a product defect where the stand it comes with, may not always fit the pegs on the bottom of catwoman's feet, so much so, that one of her legs may break off from you having to stretch out the pose more than the figure will allow. I'm so thankful that this seller replaced the broken catwoman due to this defect at no extra charge to me. They were very nice, understanding, and, decent about it.",

      "text": "As a huge fan of the 90s animated series and Catwoman I was happy to have her in my collection. However this has to be the worse base for any pop. I've hand Pop figures that were top heavy that they hall over but at least the stand fits. The pegs are not only to large for feet but spaced where they won't even reach where they need to go. If you keep it in a box it's not a issue but I take them out and display the pops and this stand was definitely a huge production error.",

Note that with many of the females in this set (Ivy and Harley, but not Batgirl), this figure can tip over if out of the box. Otherwise, love it ! This animated version of Catwoman was my favorite in all of the various of her, and was glad that she was included in Series 2 ! After all, you gotta have all three Gotham City Sirens (Harley, Poison Ivy & Catwoman) available in this line.",
