The sound is clear and the controls were easy for him to learn. Even the quality of the case to store it is durable and nice. He loves that you can use it in either ear, with smooth rotation to switch it around. Overall, he is very happy, therefore so am I. Great buy!",

A true Bluetooth in today's day and age has to have voice cammands for driving. So this is just used as a backup. Audio is good both incoming and outgoing. Battery life is good and wears well. It's just lacking good software. After having it for 3 weeks it stopped pairing. So went ahead and returned it.",

In one instance, I intentionally went in a very quiet room to take notes on the call and the caller asked me to stop the \"loud scratching noise\". The headset had magnified the noise from my pen scribble. Product is being returned for an exchange. I hope the next one will actually cancel the background noise so my callers can hear me.",

      "text": "This is an update from a previous review. The device pictured is not the one I'm reviewing. I received a newer model that was 10 X better than the one pictured. It's crystal clear and it fits very well around the ear. The battery life is phenomenal!! The only issue is the listening of music through the device that's horrible! However, the speaking and listening is top notch! Plus, for the price you can't beat it. They're ok... Not very comfortable at all. It simply doesn't fit snug in the ear. Plus, the only way to re-pair the unit is by plugging it back in and then factory resetting the device. I wouldn't buy it again nor recommend.",

Also haven't mastered how to gauge the battery life. The British voice reminder of \"Battery Low\" is helpful and you best be finding that plug soon! Other than that I like it.

Really can't tell on echo cancellation because the seal with my ear isn't that tight. Works fine around most ambient noise.

I followed the instructions on the scratch off and sent them a email and they responded super fast and shipped me my free Bluetooth within a couple days! I HIGHLY recommend this item. The sound is clear, it holds a charge for long periods of time, it\u2019s just a very reliable product! Stop wasting your time searching for anything other then this Bluetooth! ...very satisfied customer here:)",

The sound quality is good and the battery is good but i hurts so much to wear it. 20 min and my ear is already painful. If i cant wear it then its useless. Its not for people with smaller ears. Its big and impossible to wear for longer than 20min.",

I have to connect manually every time I turn it on and sometimes its a little stubborn connecting, but otherwise it does it job without all the bells and whistles. so if your looking for an inexpensive ear piece, this one fits the bill. I think i would spend more on my next one because I do miss some of the extra's",

My only two complaints are: 1) I have smaller ears (2.25\") and it's tough for me to keep this on without jamming/attempting to suction the earbud into my ear. It's adjustable for larger ears but not adjustable for smaller unfortunately. 2) It says in the instructions the volume+ button goes to the next song and the volume- button goes to the previous song, but mine's opposite (so the volume- button goes to the next song and vice versa). It's just going to take some getting used to.",
