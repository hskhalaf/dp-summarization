I replaced the brake pads immediately, but other than that I have no real costs for upkeep. I would recommend this bike to anyone who needs one asap for a reasonable price.",

Two, I had to replace a wheel when the nozzle for filling up the tire broke. Other than that, it's been great over the past year. (Note: be careful to buy the right size frame. Check a few cycling websites to find out what's right for your height and leg length.)",

This bike is only 1 gear & if you are not an avid cyclist then going up hills will be a bit troublesome. Great bike for affordability.",

To change the brake levers, I would have had to change the whole handlebar, which would have been a difficult process because the parts are not generic in the states. Standard handlebars don't work. The brakes themselves were pretty weak too. I've seen lots of people on this bike, who look pretty happy on it. Just know that you need bigger hands and that standard parts likely won't work if you're trying to change something out.",

My only complaint is the \"very cheap\" brakes, but I have replaced them. For under $200 this is a great bike for flat surfaces.

Riding on minimum setting and i am 5' 5\", which means the stock lights cannot be installed. Wheels lose air, about 10 PSI in a week, 5 days riding. Sick looking colour, easily stolen by crooks. Must lock front wheel and frame, separately. Also chain your seat. Duct tape your stickers, so it looks undesirable. Most importantly, don't park at same spot everyday. NYC, male, 18.",

Also have tools and handy because this bike has a nasty habit of randomly having nuts and bolts come loose.

      "text": "I received this bike, put it together and had it on the road within an hour of opening the box. I purchased the 57cm frame which is working perfectly for me, as I am 6'2, 210lbs. I read some reviews stating that the bike was a tad on the heavy side, but to me its not heavy at all. I easily carry it up stairs going in and out of my building. My only complaint so far is that the shoe clamp's on the pedals are cheap. One of them fell off on my third ride. But this is to be expected at this price point. They are easily replaceable.",

Its cheap it rides well and overall i used it to its full potential. I like to note that the stickers on the bike are removable so those who want a clean nice look can have that. Really the only problem i had with this bike is that the pedals are kind of sharp so you can get scratched by that. that's really it as long as you are careful or if you replace the pedals i think you are fine.",

At the heart of the kabuto you-feet ll find a strong hand crafted steel frame with Horizontal dropouts that can handle the abuse of the big city.

The 32 hole alloy wheels roll on loud Kenda 700 x 32 tires that are capable of withstanding less than perfect roads. Front and rear alloy side pull brakes round out this spectacular model.",
