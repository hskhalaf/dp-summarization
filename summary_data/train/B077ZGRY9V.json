This is very comfortable to wear, the padding is really soft and it holds your head really well. Setup was easy....just stick the USB dongle into a USB port, turn it on and BOOM! You got 30 hours of battery so you don't have to charge so often...or if you play for 30 hours straight which is bad for your health ;)",

You can still use the headphones in a wired mode via the 3.5mm jack but then the microphone does not work defeating the whole purpose of a headset.

This cant (I knew that already) But for a wireless headset and not having range is kind of dumb. Though I have the same headset as this but wired and its just as conferrable which is a lot better than other headsets, normally I get headaches from other headsets. This, like its wired counterpart, does not give me headaches.",

Cons: Battery doesn't last near as long, the sound quality isn't great compared to the other products offered by HyperX. There is feedback at times, but that is also dependent on where you are in your home and the other devices around you. Overall, these headphones are by no means bad, but for the price, it's just better to get the HyperX Revolver S. I had those before this set, but I wanted to try their wireless headphones. I'm not completely sold on the quality overall, but I am still a massive HyperX fan. I've owned this headset since October of 2019.",

This pair of headphones was a good pair of wireless headphones that worked pretty well for about 16 months and then the right earcup became detached and started to hang. HyperX makes their headphones with this weird silicone material that doesn't last. The material is very brittle and breaks after awhile. I owned the HyperX Cloud Revolver S prior to this and the same thing occured the silicone material broke and the headset went with it. HyperX headphones are probably the most comfortable headphones out there but they don't seem to stand the test of time and last. For $100 I think headphones should last at least over 2 years, very dissapointing.",

      "text": "Bought this after the hyperx cloud alpha II. Both are great, but this is a step above. Sound is better, sound isolation from external noises are way better, microphone is equivalent. This will really last 30 hours on one charge (not at full volume). Max volume on this is much louder than the wired cloud alpha, so no need to run max volume unless you don't like your ear drums. If this failed, I would absolutely buy another one, amazing headset.",

Im changing it to 2 for two reasons. 1) the left side adjustment has come very loose and does not hold its position anymore. 2) the battery life has gone way downhill. I completely charged them yesterday and without more than maybe 6 or 7 hours of use with the LED's off im already getting the low battery sound. I am really disappointed because i loved these so much to begin with, a bit of a letdown honestly especially at this price point.",
