While modern technology is great you can not overate bush craft (something I already valued). But after seeing Mr. Canterbury's minimalist techniques I wanted to absorb this doctrine myself and his book did not disappoint. If you are familiar with military survival doctrine I think you will love this book! It converted me to more of a minimalist and taught me to do more than just survive, and escape the wilderness. I will try a complete revamp of my bug out bag and my day to day minimal carry kit. Can't thank you enough Mr. Canterbury!!",

Certainly a great one to take and teach the kiddos on the survival basics when in the bush and camping in the woods like we did for short stretch's (3 or 4 days) without any gear. This is Texas though and the deserts are not as forgiving. I do recommend keeping the recipes section and practice those cooking techniques any time of the year or when the opportunity for those meals arise, just to get the taste.",
