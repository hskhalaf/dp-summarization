The reason it gets a 3 & not a 4 or 5 stars is that it doesn't feature any buttons other then blue tooth connect & power. If this speaker came with a play/pause button & a skip song button which could of all been done with 1 button it would of got 4 stars. With 1 extra button we could, press once to play, double tap to skip to next song & hold to pause. Another issue I found with it was that @ full volume (which is pretty loud) the batter is on red after 45mins of play.",
