I upgraded old 50 gallon water heater to a tankless system as I was concerned about enough hot water. Old water heater was 24 years old so it was a good excuse to replace. Installed new tub with no problems! Very Happy with this tub so far, will love it even more when I can soak the stress away!!!",

I live in an area where water is cheap, so I don't mind the amount of water it takes for one use. It is well supported on the bottom and was no problem to install.",
