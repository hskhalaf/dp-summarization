I rate these a 3 as they perform ok on a number of normal kitchen activities but horribly on others. The shears can cut through bones without much hassle although you must be very wary of pinching yourself in the grips or teeth. The issue I have is that they can't be used effectively to cut through plastic vegetable bags, sinew (they are horrible) or even twine-forget about paper. So if you need an inexpensive device to cut through chicken bones, this is it; you will need other scissors for the everyday kitchen activities.",

It worked great for the first 10 snips, but after that, the blades became misaligned and would no longer close properly. Upon closer inspection, there's a ding in one of the blades now from trying to cut through poultry bones and these are now useless after using these for 5 minutes. Granted, this could be due to user error and may only be because these shears aren't intended for such a heavy duty job, but if you're looking into getting these for spatchocking turkeys/poultry, maybe look elsewhere for heavier duty shears.",

      "text": "These are great for cutting up almost anything you want. They are sharp and strong. Watch your fingers until you are used to them. These are my preference for cutting up raw chicken. My hand is average for a woman, and fit the shears well. A much larger man's hand might not fit as comfortably. This is my second set - I somehow jammed the shears and whanged the spring off when placing them in the holder. The plastic holder fits very precisely, and I wish it had a bit more room at the edges. I would definitely buy this product third time.",
