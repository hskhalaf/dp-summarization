I purchased this grill after seeing a friend do wonders with a full sized version. I've found this grill very functional. It holds heat very well and distributes heat evenly. It's just large enough to pile coals on one side if cooking for a smaller group, but for a bigger group you might want to stick to things that don't need to be seared. The grill has held up for a couple years, and the only complaint is that the handle comes loose every couple of uses (easily fixed by tightening from the inside when cooled).",

I've always had trouble cooking a rack of ribs and baked potatoes on the 14\" using indirect heat because stacking taters on top of the ribs would interfere with the lid placement. If the lid on the 14 was 1 to 1 1/2 inches deeper it wouldn't be a problem. I bought this 18\" to solve this problem and now I'm thinking I can comfortably cook for 2 using indirect heat but the lid really isn't deep (tall) enough to stack much food. I wish Weber would make taller/deeper lids an option.",

If you do not want your food tentatively, you can burn them easily as there's a very close distance between the charcoal and the grill itself.

I also love the deepness of the kettle so things are not burning--I wish the grill grate would have a flip-up part (like some of the non-portable ones have) to make for easy access to stir around the coals. Then this would be 10 stars! I love this grill and highly recommend it. It helped us cope with Covid 19 as we are cooking out in the park a lot(chgo city living) and it makes life tolerable. If its in your budget-get it!",

We can take this down to the beach, and avoid using the communal grills, set it up in the communal patio by our place. or we can set it up by a green patch by our apartment when it gets cold out. Very durable, and I was impressed by the size. It's just as large as my neighbors grills, but easier to move around. I can't wait to take this on a road trip!",

I am hoping I can cook a whole chicken in here, that I have not even attempted yet but for everything else I've tried just awesome! <3",

One chimney of hardwood charcoal can run for hours. Ideal for our space outside on the balcony!",
