Back then, if you wanted to record several shows that were being shown at the same time, you had to have multiple TiVo's since they only had one tuner. I had three, one for each of the major networks. We're now using a TiVo Premiere XL4 with 4 tuners to get all of our shows and we can watch any of them in the bedroom (in HD) thanks to our second TiVo Premiere and MoCa connectivity. We also watch Netflix and Amazon Instant Video on the TiVo so there's no need for another 'box'. We're now thinking of getting a TiVo Roamio as well.",

In short: TiVo invented the idea, software and hardware to do what others have now made commonplace but offer to their clients good but older products. The newer TiVo product is even better inthat it is better than is offered by today's carriers because it is NEW, dependable product vended by intelligent, caring people.

The UI is slow, but otherwise it's a great box to use. The remote is AMAZING, and better than anything else out there. There is, however, a new model coming out for the holidays, so at this point, I'd probably wait. I wanted one, so I bought knowing that there will be a new model coming out.",
