It is easy to use and cooks waffles in about three minutes. The waffles come out really easy which makes the iron easy to wipe clean. I did accidentally make a scratch on the non stick part of my waffle iron without much pressure when using a metal fork once, so just be extra careful. The waffles were delicious.",

Wish it had a double bowl, but it cooks bowls so quickly, not a big deal.",
