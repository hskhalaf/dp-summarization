It's not an earth-shaking effect, but it helps. Then, after a few hours, I have to go wash my face to get the Sticky off. Where it comes in handy is when I have to shave twice in the same day -- I don't like to Scruff-up a Lady's face (or other body parts), and my stubble grows out very quickly. So, for those late evening dates, it's the sticky stuff to the rescue. I'd use it more often if it wasn't sticky and so overpriced.",

For me, it's just too thick - it comes out like hair gel, and I feel like I have to wash my hands after I use it. It's strongly menthol - bracing in the morning, for sure. It's also really expensive, especially given how it dumps out of the tube. It's a decent aftershave; you can do far worse. I also find that, for me, I can do better as well.",

The seller Luxury4Him was unbelievable and they only took three days to deliver after my order, and the shipping/handling was free. Fantastic.",

Excellent for sanitizing shaved skin and preventing \"shaving pimples\" from popping up.
