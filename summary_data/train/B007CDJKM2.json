It allows me to work close-up without having to look through the lower part of my bifocals, so it's great for soldering electronics, working with small yarn, or small painting jobs. The LEDs provide a good bright light that's very adjustable. The interchangeable lenses snap firmly into the bracket, no worries about the lens moving ntil you want it to move. I'd prefer a different texture and perhaps a cloth sleeve on the forehead strap, but that's a minor nitpick. Size adjustment is easy and I had no problem making it fit my large head.",

While it fit my giant noggin any movement of the headband would result in that outer band scratching your forehead, so any adjustment while working and you get a nice sharp scratch across the forehead, not enough to bleed but enough to get your attention.

The white plastic part of the headband that fits around the forehead has developed four vertical humps about 1/4 inch wide, 1 inch high ( the width of the band), and protruding about 1/8 inch from the otherwise smooth, flat surface. This is apparently caused from expansion of the plastic material from body temperature. However, the humps do not go away when the headlamp is not in use. These humps create some discomfort when wearing the magnifying headlamp for extended periods.",

The user can choose to flip up either the lens, or the entire front part of the visor. Definitely a plus that this brand also sells replacement lenses (in case of scratches, broken retention clips, etc) as a lot of other brands don't offer this. Can't comment on the lamp as we haven't used it yet.",

      "text": "Wow, for under thirty bucks I can now change all the tiny button batteries in my wife's Micky Mouse Watch collection. Fit's great, doesn't have any sore spots that leaves red welts, the lenses are a bit delicate so just don't be the Incredible Hulk when changing them. I thought the light was a dumb idea just to raise the price a bit, but it's super bright and does a great job on top of the visor or if you detach it and side light your subjects. I wish I had bought two or three so I could just leave whatever power lens on them all the time and just change head sets.",

It does when not being worn but when on my head the headband scrapes against the \"flippable\" part of the visor thus stopping it from being flipped up or flipped down. If there was an adequate amount of space between the headband and the visor it would be an excellent product. Word of advice, put the visor through its paces as soon as you receive it so if it doesn't work for you, you can return it within the return window. I guess I'll be selling it used in the near future.",

Users need to be aware that the more powerful the magnification the shorter the focal length and the nearer the object has to be to the lens for the focus to be clear.
