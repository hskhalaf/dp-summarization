The blowing capability is fantastic, I like that I can control the amount of wind. The only thing I would suggest is to get an additional battery. Love this product",

And the mulching process leaves a fine dust spewing out everywhere which should not be expected for this price point.",

It isn't as forceful for sure, but what I like about these tools is their portability, maneuverability and light weight. This model fills that bill perfectly. It is good for medium duty. The turbo mode does kick it into high speed which comes close to an electric or smaller gas model. However, in turbo mode it will consume the battery much faster. Always keep a spare battery in the charger ready to go.",

I had read some reviews so my expectations weren't all that high; really did the job though. My only complaint and why I didn't give this five stars is because when I put the battery on the charger the lights indicate fully charged. When you leave it on there it changes to charging indicators but it takes a while for that to happen; something quirky with the indicators but the battery is charging and doesn't seem to be bad.",

I mostly use it in blower mode, and it is more than adequate in both battery life and wind power. vac mode is real useful for picking up the leaves that are in corners that no blower angle seems to be able to push out of the corner... the grind up feature is also pretty good.",

You can gently (or not) press it into the bed of stones to jostle and suck loose even buried leaves. Works well in the yard, works well on the deck. Blows too, but I don't under stand the appeal of blower. I'd prefer to suck up the rubbish in a convenient bag for the garbage man. The bag attachment is not dirt-tight. If you suck up dirt, there's a good change it will blow through the bag and cover everything with a nice layer of dirt dust. I suppose that could be blown into a corner to be swept up.",

For a battery that cost around $120., that will only power the machine in blower mode for less than 20 mins. and far less {10-12 mins) in vacuum mode is really disappointing.

The bag is a bit difficult at times when you are trying to maneuver around landscaping. At times leaves will stick in the vacuum tube. It sure beats raking and blowing leaves into bags that fill too fast. Great for adding to compost bins!! Happy Mulching!",

As for the performance, it is OK in both modes as long as it keeps operating which is not for long for the reasons I've mentioned. The bottom line is: OK as a blower with enough spare batteries; unusable as a vac/mulcher without certain design changes.",

      "text": "If you have a small amount of work to do, it does a good job .. If you have a bigger job, you need about three batteries. I have several Greenworks tools, so batteries are not a problem for me. After use, you have to let the battery cool off for about an hour before you charge it. This blower runs about 20 minutes at the fastest speed and makes the battery wam. If you have extra batteries... No problem. Has a good strong airflow, but is not an industrial machine. I like not having to use gas and pulling a rope and maintaining a gas unit. I use the blower function only and not the mulching feature.",

Would recommend this for everyone. Powerful as you could possibly need. I haven't even tried the suction sweeper yet. but I am sure it will be great. Soon as I do, I will let you know.
