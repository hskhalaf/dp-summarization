So you might say I was looking forward to these. After I opening them to see all but three cookies were broken, I was a bit disappointed but figured what the heck at least they will taste fine. Unfortunately, they taste stale and don't have the same crunch you get with Oreos. The fact that they were all broken makes it odd that they were stale also but they were. I checked the expiration date, and it is for Sept of 2019 so should have still been good.",

I really liked the pull-tab resealable opening - so much easier than the old days, and the cookies stay fresher. Mint fun fact: you can easily grow all the mint you need since the plant grows so quickly.

Amazon Prime Pantry offers these at a great price, around$2 less than my local grocery store. The only negative about these cookies are that they are incredibly addicting.

I don't need, want or like that. Even as a kid I was never a \"double-stuf\" fan. I've never once eaten a standard Oreo and thought \"That was nice, but I wish they'd increase the cre\u0300me, so it would coat my tongue with overly-sweetened, oily fat.\" They put too much cre\u0300me in these. It's not nice. Market that rubbish to people who like it (as Double-Stuf), and go back to the right proportion for everyone else. I'll just buy Mint Newman O's next time.",
