Don't get too caught up in the 2850K spec. It's the quality/tint of the light that is important - these are simply white without the green/yellow tint. I wish they would pick a lumen rating and stick with it. So far I've purchased the \"same\" bulb and had 570, 650, 680 and 800 lumens. Luckily they all have the same nice color and the output difference isn't as big as it sounds on paper.",

When they are dimmed, they take on a sickly greenish hue...not Reveal white color thru the dimmer range. They are brighter (650L) than 60 watt incandescents (560L). My wife hated them and I ended up buying Sylvania Clarity 60 watt incandescent clear ceiling fan bulbs. Now I gotta sell 10 of these GE's. I did not want to purchase any more GE Reveal incandescents because I experienced poor quality and short lifetime the last few yearts.",
