Even after washing in high temp water and a commercial dryer, the outer fabric just won\u2019t tighten to keep the stuffing in!

The pictures make the cover look flat and washed up so receiving the blanket in a smaller than expected package didn\u2019t help. When I first cut the plastic the cover started to plump up. (A lil scary lol) Once all the plastic was off the comforter was fully plumped! As I opened it the pillow cases tucked in the middle felt like a fancy material. Very pleasant \ud83e\udd70 This set is not photogenic but I posted a pic anyway because I\u2019m soo in love with my new look . I slept like a princess on cloud 9. Thanks!",

      "text": "SINCERELY-- this comforter is the best comforter I have ever owned! I knew I wanted a black comforter, but a comforter that was BREATHABLE, COMFORTABLE, & EASY TO CLEAN. This comforter has been all of these things!! (I bought the size: Full; in the color: black) I love the company too-- they reached out personally to check in on how I loved their product. & I am not one to leave reviews, but I wanted to personally leave one for this product-- it was well worth the money. I rest easy every night! & I love how the look created a new vibe for my room! If you're looking to buy-- BUY ASAP!",
