I called to get a replacement (855.855.0294). After being on hold for some time, I was told they would replace it but first I need to cut the plug off the unit, provide a receipt and peel off a label and mail everything to them. Then they would provide a replacement. Guessing the process would take a few weeks so just going to kiss this purchase off as a lost cause and purchase another unit from a local brick & mortar store.",

However, it has no \"quick cook\" features (I got over this because it is still faster than a stovetop and doesn't heat up the house like an oven) so is sort of a pain to use. The real reason I would not purchase again is because it heats very unevenly. Nachos were burned in some places and completely unmelted in others! And there is a turntable, too! Great to heat up a cup of water, but barely passable for food. If I had any other quick options, I would have returned it.",
