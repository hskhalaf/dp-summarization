Keeping my items in like new condition always makes it easier if you\u2019re ready to upgrade. Great construction, will try it tomorrow and write a follow up. (Sublue, please write a response and let us know if a cover is something we could look forward to. Thank you",

It is very easy to use, the charging is simple and the controls are very intuitive. It is a bit on the spendy side, but once you try it, you will understand. Certainly made the summer swim season a ton more enjoyable. I would recommend picking up an extra battery because one will last @ 45 min. and if you have more than one user, it will ensure everyone gets a turn.",
