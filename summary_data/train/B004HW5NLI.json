My Barnett Ghost 375 swam in it. If they had incorporated straps inside with Velcro to secure the crossbow limbs I think I would have been more satisfied with it. I ended up returning it and purchased a Plano Manta hard case. That case allowed me to customize it for a perfect fit to my crossbow. Plus it will offer much better protection for my $500 crossbow.",

I have a barnett ghost 360 and wish i had gotten a more fitted case. I bought a different type for my sons crossbow and it is much better. This one is not as high as i would like for the scope. the compartment for the bolts on the top could be longer and larger. all of the dimensions are just too universally odd. i would go with a different type. I regret this purchase. the photos people posted where it looks like someone is swimming inside is accurate.",

The large pocket fit the quiver with 5 20\" bolts in it, along with the broadhead package and still room for some more stuff. The smaller pocket is a good size too.
