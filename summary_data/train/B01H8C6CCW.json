I had nothing under the bed or on top other than pillows/blanket, but two days into my trip it split at the factory seam. I used the patch kit that came with the bed. Due to the split being on the seam, it\u2019s hard to get a great patch. Used it a few more nights and a much bigger hole started on the seam again. Don\u2019t get your hopes up with this one.",

The bed would not reach all the way to the back of the seat, leaving a gap between the mattress and seat. Finally, my center console made it impossible for this to lay flat, but rather caused it to lay at an elevation, where I slide right into the gap created by the mattress not being long enough.

We always had multiple blankets on top. It really was a slow and steady decline. I've now purchased a product twice as expensive from another company. It's a different material. I've gone through this exact same issue with regular air mattresses, never having any long-term luck.
