      "text": "Love - love - love this gadget. I bought extra mounts for the front and back of my Harley-Davidson. Works like a charm. I've been doing time-lapse videos with this thing (easy-peasy with Aperture) and my pals on social media have been loving the footage I've been posting. Surprisingly great quality footage!! I will say, my only disappointment is with the little \"remote\" for your wrist. Nice idea -- but the battery in mine lasted only an hour or so, compared to the 3H battery in the Ghost. I'd suggest a re-design of that to use longer-lasting watch-batteries or something.",

I love it and think its a way better camera then the Go-Pro for the price and gives you more flexibility since you don't have to have that bulky cover like you do on the Go-Pro. The remote and Iphone apps are great additions for any camera but especially an action camera where you dont want to have to take it off and on your helmet to turn it on or off. Great camera and the additional ability to spin the lens is great.",

Loads more footage time and charge, this could easily go all day recording without recharge. My only complaint if WIND NOISE. I'll be adding a simple foam air baffle over the mic, otherwise sound was great. Comes with several mounts so you can quickly drop-out the camera and move it where ever you want, or stand it up for money shots.",

The only water that touched the camera during the trip was from the splashes of the rapids and it is now unusable. Keep in mind these rapids are only class II and III so they are not even that fast.
