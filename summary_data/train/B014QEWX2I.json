      "text": "I have had this on my bike for about a year now. It mounted easily and works flawlessly. I rarely need the headlight as I mostly KATY Trail ride, but when I do hit roads I do use the strobe headlight and the flashing taillight for some added safety. I have not charged the headlight in forever - maybe last fall - and it still strobed fine today. I use the taillight a LOT and it still seems as bright as the day I bought it. I will buy this again.",

Great safety feature keeping the light on in daylight as I was able to notice other bikers a block away using their lights too. No different than DRL's on cars.

      "text": "So far so good For years I used a light and motion 200 lumen light, which now barely holds a 2 day charge. The market for USB lights is vast enough that spending near $100 for a light doesn't make sense. The blitz is all plastic but extremely well made. The mount is secure to my handlebars, and light is secure to mount It's bright, and holds a charge. The rear taillight, while being non-rechargeable, is nice. Small bright, easy to attach. Definitely recommend this set",

It is not the type with the silicon band that you can wrap on. The tail light burnt out quickly - I replaced the battery and it technically worked in that an extremely faint red light emerged, but nothing like it was when I first received it. I hope that doesn't indicate the quality of the front light. I have to charge it more often that I like, but it is functioning fine.",
