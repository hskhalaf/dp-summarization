Feels like powder once applied. Not heavy, greasy, or thick. If you're thinking about trying this, trust me, it's worth it! I have tried so many foundations and some work but are too greasy, or too thick. This one is so light and fresh. I have reddish skin and have always been self conscious of my redness. This covers it with just a small amount. Looks like I have no makeup on & feels light and powdery. You'll be happy you tried it!",

Tried it anyways and it was not the same. The makeup creased in the lines in my forehead half way through the day and I was able to wipe the makeup clear off my skin with the touch of my finger. Also did not have great coverage. But overall I have always loved Shiseido's foundations liquid and powder but this one does not make that list.",

What I like about this foundations is 1) it is lightweight at the same time giving you decent coverage 2) it stays put all day 3) it doesn't feel or look cakey 3) sets well (I do use a finishing powder with it) Using a primer doesn't seem to make any difference in wear. Make sure to give this foundation a good shake before every use.",

Still, though, this product deserves my five-star rating because it is a very nice foundation",
