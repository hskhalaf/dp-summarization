I drink it before bed at night because sometimes it makes me feel bloated.... and I'd rather sleep throughout that feeling and wake up feeling awesome!!! Instead of drinking it in the morning and then feeling bloated all day. It's just what works for me. All around I just feel healthier and that's worth a little bloat until the magic fiber does it's job. Nothing's perfect.",

Last.l night I mixed it with vanilla what protein and it was better, but you do need to shake it every sip because the stuff will sink to the bottom.

First of all it tastes like sweet wallpaper paste. 16 oz of liquid is barely enough to make this quaffable and if you don't drink it quickly it totally congeals. If you are able to somehow ingest this slime, be ready for virulent flatulence followed by an anti-climactic soft BM. Make sure to have atleast 1/2 a roll of TP and wet wipes available. My wife who is obsessed with bowel health also found this product quite unpleasant.",

Will try using with just water and see if I can get it down, but it appears to be flavorless.",

After finishing up my fiber supplement I bought from my gym, I switched to this (just wanted to try something different). From the get go my stomach has been in knots and my wife hasn't appreciated the additional air freshener :-). In addition, I noticed that my shakes began to taste bland upon adding this. They normally taste sweet between the banana, strawberry, blueberries and honey. Needless to say, I switched back to my original fiber supplement and my body and wife are much happier. :-)",
