The camera is a massive improvement over the already decent camera on the OnePlus 5. The speed improvement from the new CPU is remarkable, especially when running multiple apps or games. Picture quality is amazing, when watching Amazon prime shows in HD on my phone, I often think they appear better quality than on my TV! Only concern after using the phone for a short time was I found the fingerprint sensor to be slightly temperamental which slowed down the unlock. However after more use, the sensor has seemed to \"learn\" more about my finger and the unlock is getting even quicker.",

    "description": "Size Name:128 GB| Style Name:8 GB| Colour Name:Mirror BlackQualcomm Snapdragon 845\uff0cIn-display Fingerprint Sensor, Hall, Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Proximity, RGB Ambient Light Sensor, Electronic Compass, Sensor Core; Dual nano-SIM slot,3700 mAh (non-removable),Fast Charging (5V 4A),2340 x 1080 pixels 402ppi,6.41 inches. Comes with 2 year manufacturer warranty. Occasional fingerprint scanning failure: If your phone's screen fingerprint recognition rate is low or unrecognized, try the following methods to exclude: Is a third-party protective film used on the screen? Third-party protective film is not officially certified and cannot guarantee performance. It may decrease fingerprint recognition rate and is not recommended. Whether there is dirt in the fingerprint recognition area, bubbles or dust in the protective film. Whether the protective film/cover glass of the fingerprint area is scratched or cracked. If so, please try to re-input your fingerprint or replace the protective film/screen. After the new applied/replacement/removal of the protective film, the fingerprint needs to be re-input, otherwise the fingerprint recognition success rate will be affected. If unlock the phone under strong light environment, need to completely cover the recognition area with your finger. If under low temperature (-5 degrees) environment recognition success rate is low; try to use the fingerprint at room temperature. Warm tips: due to the influence of environmental factors such as temperature or light, the recognition rate may decline. It is suggested to turn on the face unlocking function to assist unlocking.\n\nBOX CONTAINS\n1 x OnePlus 6T\nScreen Protector (pre-applied)\nCase\nDash Type-C Cable\nDash Power Adapter\nSIM Tray Ejector\nQuick Start Guide\nSafety Information\nType-C to 3.5 mm Headphone Jack Adapter",
