It has enough cooking surface for our needs that include grilling for our family members that live in the area - it is not suitable for large outdoor parties - but that is not an issue for us.",

Has a bun warmer and a temp gauge built in. Big enough to cook eight burgers or a whole cut up chicken. Does require some assembly but it's easy and the instructions are very good.",

I was able to pick this up while it was on sale before Xmas & I am glad I did. It works great!",

The fact is, either the bottom stainless strip over the grease drip pan bowed when it was tack welded on, or the design is ineffective. Problem: grease does not drain. Grease collects on the bottom of the BBQ. Mind you folks, this BBQ is shallow. These two confluences do not add up to 5 stars, this adds up to grease fire and a difficult to clean BBQ. I\u2019m tempted to either contact the manufacturer or look for a local welding guy. If there were risers under that bottom strip that runs over the grease drip pan, it would fix a lot of this problem.",
