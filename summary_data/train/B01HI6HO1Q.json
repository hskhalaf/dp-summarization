It would be easier to clean if the cooking plates were removable, but not a deal breaker for us. The coating chipping, however, was a deal breaker. The coating was not perfectly smooth in one place, and it just started flaking off when I noticed it and touched it with my finger. First concern is food safety. And how long before more chipping happens and affects the operation of the product?",

If you don\u2019t overflow the maker, see the picture for what happens. 3 If I fill it enough, the waffles don\u2019t cook all the way and are very thick where they should be thin.

When it stops steaming your waffle is done cooking. You just lift a corner then lift the whole thing out. Afterwards he unplugs it, leaves it open, and once it cools he takes a clean dry rag to wipe out anything that might be left. Usually there's nothing to wipe at all.",

It makes 4 square waffles at one time, which is great for the two toddlers in the family who are hungry and don't understand what daddy means when he says, \"wait and be patient.\". They love how easily it cleans up and that it's compact enough to store in the cupboard. A great buy for the price!",

      "text": "We make waffles every morning. Our previous waffle iron coating is wearing off and so I wanted to try this Dura Ceramic coating waffle maker. This waffle iron took >12 minutes to cook one (4 squares) waffle - and it was extremely doughy! I don't have 1 hour, every morning to make waffles for my family. This is being returned the minute our replacement arrives. If however, you like very shallow holes in your waffle, doughy texture, and have plenty of time to hang out in the kitchen, this may be the waffle iron for you.",

      "text": "My original review: I really was happy to find a waffle iron with the small squares. This thing is fabulous. No oil needed, I've had it for months and it bakes clean each and every time. I liked it so well I gifted one to my daughter, and she can't say enough good things either. Definitely recommend this produce. My update: My waffle iron is super, but the one my daughter received has never worked correctly. The outside gets hard while the inside remains uncooked. Same recipe as mine, so we know it's the iron. so... I guess take your chances, and hope you get a good one.",

This thing was great at first and I don\u2019t use it often and clean it with a dry cloth wiping it out after every use. It has been taken care of and now it doesn\u2019t work!! 17months exactly and it\u2019s out. Boo. It is a great non stick waffle maker maybe mine was just a lemon. It has been used maybe 10 times.",
