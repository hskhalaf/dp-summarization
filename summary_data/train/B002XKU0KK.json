      "text": "I bought this 4 piece set for my wife for our trip to Europe. We travel some but not a whole lot so we were looking for luggage that would hold up and wasn't too expensive. We shopped around quit a bit and finally ordered this set. Because of Amazon's return policy, we figured that when it arrived if the luggage didn't measure up then we could return it. Well, the luggage is very attractive, well constructed and it held up great on our trip. Based on the experience of having used it, I highly recommend this luggage set. It can't be beat for the money.",

The different sizes in this set have worked out great, and the smallest bag is perfect for overnight. Can't beat the price--I paid much less for this than for my now-retired set. Recommend to anyone looking for a good quality set of luggage at a reasonable price. UPDATE: Still love these and they are holding up beautifully. However, I have the red set and my mother has a similar orange set, and they get really dirty from airline travel. I would probably get the all-black set if I were to buy them again, since those wouldn't show the black marks.",

Due to it being a gift and getting it early we can do a simple return through amazon, which we don\u2019t want to return it because we love the luggage, w whist want a replacement for the messed up zipper.
