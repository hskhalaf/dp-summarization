      "verdict": "A spectacular treat is waiting for sandal-loving trail travelers who would opt for the Hurricane 4 by Teva. Indeed, hikers who would give this true-to-size shoe a chance are destined to discover how immensely comfortable (on day-one), supportive, and beautifully crafted it is. Unfortunately, the sandal still comes with a handful of flaws, arguably the most unamusing of which is the clunkiness of its forefoot zone. To sum up, the Hurricane 4 is yet another delightful Teva gear whose excellence on many fronts overshadows its few criticisms.",
      "pros": [
        "Scores of verified purchasers spoke quite highly of their Teva Hurricane 4 sandals in the comfort department",
        "Its arch support was considered outstanding by a host of wearers",
        "Based on numerous reviews, this strappy Teva hiker runs true to size",
        "The sandal, especially the Teva Hurricane 4 (women\u2019s version), was praised for having a super-stylish design from top to bottom",
        "Quite a number of owners swore by the minimal break-in period of this hiking footgear",
        "Some users deeply adored its unbelievable lightness above all else",
        "The Teva men\u2019s Hurricane 4 impressed several male hikers with its long-lasting build quality",
        "This amphibious hiking sandal was admired through the roof by a small group of testers for having incredibly adjustable straps"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "About a handful of patrons found the sandal too wide, especially around the toe region",
        "Its inability to fight off stink was enough to disappoint a couple of consumers",
        "A very tiny percentage of reviewers complained about the sandal\u2019s sweat-inducing footbed",
        "An owner didn\u2019t appreciate the weird sensation she got from one of its triangular buckles"

They fit true to size as well so no issues with having to exchange or return and the straps are adjustable to deal with any swelling.",

The really great thing is all three straps are adjustable - toe, instep, and heel. I have never seen a sandal made like that before, and I'm delighted with the total adjustability of them! In addition they have very thick and tough soles and wonderful arch supports, which are missing in most sandals I have had. I'm delighted with this product and will eventually re-order.",
