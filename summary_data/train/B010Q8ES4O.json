The closed captioning on this TV is right over the area where translations are given if regular caption is in foreign languages during an interview, where identify is stated for person being interviewed during regular newscast and also in same area where my cable identifies what upcoming shows will be about. This is something I find very frustrating to me, something that would prevent me from ever buying this particular TV again even though I love the rest of it.",

The picture is pretty good but I did spend a lot of time in the menus disabling features like its 4K and 120Hz upscalers because otherwise it made every show look like it was shot with the kind of cheap camera equipment used on daytime soap operas.",

I can just switch the ports on the hdmi splitter without having to unplug anything.",

This time it was in another location on the screen. I was very close to just brushing it off and keeping the TV until out of nowhere, i heard a pop sound and the screen cracked from where the warp image started. Seems they may be screwing the screws too tight or perhaps just half assing production. I sent another request for a replacement. This will be my final request. Will update if 2nd replacement comes with same manufacture defects.",
