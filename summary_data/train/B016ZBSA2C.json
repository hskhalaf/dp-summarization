Naturally, the first thing to do when you buy an iMac is to install Windows 10, which run great on this system in boot camp mode. The 5k screen is out of this world. A must for all Apple and Windows lovers. I would recommend instantly upgrading to 16GB of memory, as 8GB is just not enough.",

      "text": "I renewed my iMac late 2012 for this one. It is as usual an excellent machine, and the 5K is fantastic. However I made one big mistake, my last iMac was a fusion drive 8mb, which was fast, but this time I chose the 16mb without fusion drive. What a difference in speed! It takes much longer to start up and open software. Take note, better to go for 8mb and fusion than 16 and not. That is the reason for 4 stars. Otherwise a doddle to transfer my old backup through time machine and everything works well for my photo editing with the 5K. Still a bit pricy for what is has though.",
