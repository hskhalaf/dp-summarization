In conclusion, Brooks Launch 6 is a shoe that is suitable for neutral runners looking for speed, cushion, and durability.",

        "Also mentioned by a couple of runners is that they like the new layout of the Midfoot Transition Zone",
        "The users have noticed the quick transition from heel to toe with this new design in the midfoot area",

The Launch shoe is noticeably more firm than the Glycerin line, which was fine at first... but as I wear them, I can definitely notice the difference, especially in my lower back. There isn't as much cushion, which is painful and frustrating.",
