I contacted the seller and the seller \"closed\" the return because they said my return time had expired. It's definitely NOT worth it, spend a little extra and get what you pay for! The seller is the one NOT good. I ordered the cheaper pair from Australia and I think that is the problem with the glasses. The seller is Designer Eyewear. Stay away from them!!",

And the rubberized bridge support is equally worth it. I have a medium square face and these glasses were instantly comfortable with unmatched clarity. DO IT!!!!",

While looking at the ocean in Hawaii, I could see more colors and there was no squinting. There are felt nose pads which are nice and no tangling your hair when you push your sunglasses up on your head. Love them!!",
