It is supposed to settle onto the potty and know when to go, but I myself have had difficulty getting it to work consistently. I like that it comes with accessories like 'handsoap' to give her the full potty experience. She just turned two so I think she is a little young to fully play with it, and she hasn't embraced it as much as her other dolls. Hopefully she will like it more as she gets a little older.",
