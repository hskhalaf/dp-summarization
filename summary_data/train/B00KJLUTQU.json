The paper is straight garbage. It tears and gets soaked before you can finish the drawing. The polymer that you use to stick the rings down will tear the paper and really get stuck to the rings.",

The pieces felt a bit cheap, but not incredibly so. The storage box is perfect for protecting the pieces, but don't give this to a child with a heavy hand. Patience helps, too. Because of the plastic quality, too much pressure will crack the gears.",

The original sets of the 60s used pins, and the main \u201cgears\u201d still have parameter holes, so nothing is stopping us adults from using pushpins. For kids, there are mounting putties that would work well. This is a wonderful gift for those who love to create unique & intricate designs. Highly recommended.",

My one complaint concerns the adhesive putty included with the kit. It is hard and very difficult to use. My suggestion is to purchase some reuseable craft putty (you can get it at an art supply store) and use it to adhere the plastic molds to your paper. Much easier than having to use the putty included with the Spirograph.",

      "text": "Very nice set. Has a lot of items in it. Is well contained. Easily stored and transported in the case it comes in. My 9 year old niece really liked it but it was just a bit advanced for her to use and figure out. I had to help her make some of the basic designs and it was a bit hard for her to keep the wheels in place on her own so she could make the designs but i think with some help and practice she will grow into using it.",

Once we got the right amount of putty to hold the pieces in place, it worked great! If you use too much of the putty it raises the spiral pieces too high and the smaller spiral being used in the center to make designs tends to go under the larger spiral. As a result you have a sloppy uneven design.",

They use bigger pen holes, so you have a larger variety of pens that fit and work. They have more designs available with the tracks you can build. They are thinner gears, and they feel cheaper and more flimsy than the 70's kits, which I think may be part of making them so more non-Spirograph Kit pens work with the gears and rings. The new putty that replaces the old push-pins is superior.",

      "text": "Two stars given for the variety of the designs you can make, but we didn't even get to that stage. I didn't realize that you had to make your own outline for the spirograph and feel that the pieces do not connect easily or well enough to keep it together. Also, it is difficult to keep the outline steady while also running the inside piece. Feel like I need two extra hands, so my 7 year old son doesn't even want to get it back out.... Highly disappointed.",
