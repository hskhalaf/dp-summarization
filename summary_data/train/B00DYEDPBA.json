The reason we replaced it was the new dog finally chewed the hose beyond our capability to repair it. But the pump still works to this day. How could we not buy the same one? Would be nice if they had a replacement hose and tips on amazon though.",

I\u2019ve had a few rechargeable Coleman pumps over the years that were great but I hated that I had to anticipate ahead of time when I\u2019d need them so I could charge them up. Not for spontaneous use. And eventually they stopped charging. So last time I bought a plug-in Intex pump. It filled very slowly and overheated (got really hot in your hands)and shut off with limited use. This Coleman model hasn\u2019t overheated once and we\u2019ve used it often to fill our Quickset pool and repeatedly deflate and fill multiple oversized pool floats. Fills items very quickly!! Very happy with this purchase.",

When I was inflating the ring for my Intex pool I was worried the motor might overheat since it took so long. It was also popping out of the pools valve as well so I had to sit there holding it. But as inexpensive as this is it is definitely far better than blowing things up with a hand pump or your mouth. .",

The pump is very light and powerful, inflating my pool-related supplies in short order. The power cord is slightly short, but I'm fine using a 8' extension cord. Attaching the hose to the pump body is sometimes a little challenging - the groove cutouts on the hose don't fit well with the nubs on the pump itself. The provided, attached hose adapter for inflating smaller inlets on items such as pool toys can easily slip off at times, too. Despite these small challenges, this pump is still a great value for the price.",

The two main drawbacks are the following: Noise: pretty loud, like a vacuum. So make sure you inflate your bed early if you're out camping so to not annoy your neighbors. Power draw: this things did not work with the car inverter I purchased. It would pulsate instead of inflate. Even using a jump pack it caused the jumppack to overheat. Overall, really good product.",
