I gave it three stars because when I received it there was a hole in the robe\u2019s belt and I had to order a replacement. When the replacement arrived there was a hole in the robe. Luckily I had not sent the original robe back yet so I was able to keep the original robe and the belt from the replacement and sent the damaged robe and belt back.",
