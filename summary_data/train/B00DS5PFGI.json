I have an older pair of clip-ons with the exact same mechanism except the sunglass lenses sit lower and so completely cover the eyeglass lenses.

I thought that the company would reach out to me but they didn't despite speaking to Amazon Prime personnel. Hopefully this review will spur them to reach out to me so that they can work closer to make sure this doesn't happen again to anyone else.",

He keeps them in his car and uses them with both pairs of glasses. He loves that he can do that. So, a great purchase!",
