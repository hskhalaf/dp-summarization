The center portion does not seem to be as hot as the rest of the grill (things don't brown/cook as fast there) but the rest of the features make up for it. The surface is really nice and I really like the grease collection cup. Will be ordering another soon for our cabin.",

I do wish the hole for this was a bit larger. But it is functional for sure. The drip tray was loose but i was able to bend the tabs that hold it in just a bit to keep it securely in place. The surface heats up fast and even. First time in years i have been able to make perfect pancakes 4 at a time!.",

The design is nice (except that the power cord is way too short) and it is large but the most important thing about a griddle is to have even heating. This griddle heats a row across the top and bottom and doesn\u2019t heat the middle. You can see from the picture above, the pancake was ready to flip on the top and bottom, but raw in the middle. A compelete failure. I don\u2019t really know why it is so hard to include a heating element in the middle but this is worthless.",

When you're feeding that many mouths, you need a big griddle. This one is larger than my previous, and heats evenly throughout. The reviews that I read where people are having difficulty with the heating evenly, I believe they're not preheating it and allowing it to warm up enough. Don't turn it up high, set it to the temperature you need and give it some time. Pancakes turned out beautifully.I've been very pleased with it, and my older smaller one now lives in my RV.",

This one has a great non-stick surface and it's actually quite large. It does cook more evenly than most other griddles I've used as well. I suppose it wouldn't fit with the 'slimline' form but it would be more useful if it had a taller lip on the back for the food to bump against when trying to get the spatula under.

My only complaint is the drip tray, it fits loose. not a big deal on the countertop, but it always fall out when carrying it to and from the pantry. so much that we broke ours. But replacement trays are available and cheap from Prestos website. I highly recommend this griddle!!",

One person mixing batter and two cooking. We were able to easily keep up with the demand for pancakes!",
