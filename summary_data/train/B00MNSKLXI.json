It fit my dog really well, she didn't mind wearing it, and it looks nice, but it ripped in several places after just a few uses. I put a few treats, a collapsible water dish and baggies in the pockets and the bottom of one pocket ripped open. I attached the leash to the D ring to walk her, and it's starting to rip there as well even though she is not a heavy puller. If this wear had been after a year of use, I would be OK with keeping it and possibly buy another, but not after just a few uses. This is unacceptably low quality.",

      "text": "I got the small/medium size after reading reviews and it works great for my 35lb Aussie mix. She's 9 months old and even when she's full grown at 40ish pounds it will definitely fit her still. I had a bulkier backpack that moved far too much when running with her. This one is lighter weight and fits closer to her body so the pockets aren't flopping around. It holds some stuff but definitely not a ton so it you're truly backpacking with a dog you might get one with bigger pockets. Otherwise this works great for day hikes and running. I usually balance both sides equally so I haven't had a problem with it falling to the sides.",

But, it's way worth the effort to move it back up on the dog's back every 10 minutes or so. My lab (not known for his brains) didn't even notice this pack that I filled with food, treats and water for a 4-hour hike. Gave it 4 stars just due to 'rolling'.",

The large handle on the top is great for holding her if I haven't attached her leash yet, and the ring for the leash is huge, so it's easy to clip multiple things on it, or just quickly attach the leash without fighting a tiny ring. For the first walk, I put 5 pounds in my 70 pound german shepherds pack, we walked a little under a mile, and she was absolutely pooped afterwards. This pack has helped me train her to walk alongside me without a leash, which is another huge plus.",
