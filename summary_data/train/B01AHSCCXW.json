I bought a 100\" screen from elite screens that I can not be any happier for the money. The speakers are pretty good but I hooked it up to an external speaker for the full effect. My friends were blown away when I told him how much everything was. I can't get over how something this mini can be so bright and affordable.",

The fan noise wasn't as bothersome as others indicated, but again, we were in a nosier officer setting. The setup was a few seconds via hdmi cable. Unfortunately the image wasn't clear enough to read the documents on the projected image. The letters/words are too blurred to be able to read them. Tried to use the focus wheel, but even with best \"focus\" we couldn't make out the words. I was projecting to about 5-6 feet distance. I had to send it back and looking for a projector with clearer/sharper image.",

The focus is somewhat twitchy but I recently traveled with it and it was especially good for practicing a Powerpoint presentation. It's not easy to replicate the function of a large monitor and although its better than 2 others I tried, it's still not really that functional for MS Word. Workable but not optimal. The color is much better than the two other products I tried and there was no problem connecting to my Macbook air.",

I love that it is so light weight, easy to carry with my laptop, through TSA and on my back all week. Also love how easy it is to set up and use. The quality (brightness, clarity, resolution support & projection size) is so much better than the older projector ceiling mounted where I teach. Only warning is that on battery you lose a lot of brightness, but I only needed to do that once, for a quick impromptu demo - how cool to be able to do that!!!",

I attempted to go to the AAXA website but it's not working. So I have no idea what to do except to randomly re-encode my videos. And the speaker is tiny and the volume adjustment is nonexisten. I suppose the only way you can get decent sound is to plug in amplified speakers.",
