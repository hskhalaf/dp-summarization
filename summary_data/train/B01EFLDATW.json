      "title": "More of a motorcycle-jacket style",
      "text": "I'm 5 ft 7 in tall, medium build. The size SMALL fits perfectly. Plenty of room in the shoulders, and cut is tapered a little which is comfortable if you have a more athletic build. The shoulders will look awkward if you try on a larger size. Sleeve length is good, it has a tactical look, and keep in mind it is a little short. This seems to be a deliberate design choice, as the jacket has a motorcycle-like look. This may not be to everyone's liking - Personally, I'm ok with it, though. I would recommend tucking in your shirt.",

I have gotten many compliments already and I have been wearing this almost everyday besides the day it snows or gets very cold. Only complaint is that you will need to buy one size larger than usual.",
