I wish you all could see the look on my gilfriend's face when she opened her present. If you think that the images on amazon look impressive, you will not be disappointed when you open the box. The product came with all the proper packaging and after customs and over night delivery, the purchase came to just under $600 CDN. Awesome! Kay I'm done ranting. AWESOME!",

I was hesitant to purchase it without seeing it in person, but I am glad that I did. The watch fits perfectly on my girlfriend's wrist (though she may need to have a link or two removed at a jeweler at her discretion). The price cannot be beat, and is nearly half the retail price. I simply cannot recommend this watch enough.",

    "title": "Movado Women's 604982 Amorosa Diamond-Accented Stainless Steel Bangle Watch",
    "description": "This Movado Amarosa timepiece features a unique bangle band housing a black dial with 18 diamond on the top and bottom. A truly stunning watch, this is a must have.\n\nThe elegant simplicity of Movado's signature Museum dial is highlighted in this sleek and versatile timepiece from Movado's Amorosa series. This watch features a round black dial with silver-tone Dauphine hands and a concave dot marker at the twelve o'clock position. This is the minimalist look made famous for Movado by American designer Nathan George Horwitt in 1947. Horwitt intended his design to be evocative of a sun dial, with the dot representing the sun at high noon. The dial is housed in a silver-tone stainless steel case that measures 25.5 mm in diameter, and it is framed by a perfectly round silver-tone steel bezel. The watch presents on a beautiful polished steel bangle bracelet accented with 18 small round diamonds. The bracelet measures 6.25 inches and fastens with a jewelry-clasp. Other notable features include a scratch-resistant sapphire crystal and precise Swiss quartz movement. Water-resistant to 30 meters, this watch can withstand splashes and brief immersion in water; however, it is not sufficiently resistant for swimming.\n\n About Movado\nMovado, one of the most celebrated watch brands in the world, traces its origins to the small village of La Chaux-de-faunds, Switzerland where, in 1881, a young watchmaker named Achille Ditesheim hired six assistants and opened a small workshop. He called his company Movado, a word which means, roughly, \"always in motion.\" The company grew and prospered, evolving from a small pocketwatch manufacturer into a leading innovator and designer of precision wristwatches. Throughout its history, Movado has maintained its place at the pinnacle of innovation and excellence in design, craftsmanship and technology. Movado watches are crafted by highly-skilled watchmakers to meet the exacting standards of Swiss time technology. They are accurate to within seconds a year. All Movado watches are sealed and protected against water, moisture and dust, and individually tested to meet strict international standards of quality. A long-time dedicated supporter of the arts, Movado has, itself, been the recipient of over 200 international awards. Movado watches can now be found in the permanent collections of over 20 museums worldwide.\n\n Amorosa Collection\nSleek, chic and sizable, this contemporary bangle watch features removable links for a custom fit. Offered in polished solid, two-tone or 18K gold-plated stainless steel. Available with diamonds. Museum dial. Swiss quartz movement. Sapphire crystal. Water resistant to 3 atm.\n\nThe art of Movado is the art of design. Since its founding in 1881 by 19-year old entrepreneur Achille Ditesheim in the village of La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, Movado has achieved a legacy of design innovation, earning more than 100 patents and 200 international awards for artistry and innovation in watch design and time technology.\n\nMovado, meaning \"always in motion\" in the international language of Esperanto, is the hallmark of some of the most famous timepieces ever created: the 1912 Polyplan, its revolutionary, patented movement constructed on three planes to fit a case curved to follow the wrist\u2026the WWI Soldier\u2019s Watch with its elegant, protective grill\u2026the 1927 Ermeto, a capsule-shaped pocket watch wound by the sliding motion of its case\u2026the innovative 1950\u2019s Kingmatic series of rotor-driven automatics\u2026the Movado Artist\u2019s Series by luminaries of the fine art world\u2026and the Movado Museum\u00ae Watch with its legendary dial.\n\nDefined by a single dot at 12 representing the sun at high noon, the Museum Watch dial is regarded as an icon of Modernism. It was designed by Bauhaus-influenced artist Nathan George Horwitt in 1947. When Horwitt\u2019s dial was selected for the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1960, it was the first watch dial ever awarded this distinction. The name \"Museum Watch\" derives from this recognition. Today, Movado watches are in prominent museums worldwide, and this legendary dial distinguishes an entire collection of singular timepieces.\n\nThe Movado Boutiques extend the Movado brand philosophy of design innovation beyond watches to a range of products for modern living. Exclusive offerings include the proprietary and patented 114-facet Movado Diamond\u2122 jewelry collection, Movado\u2019s own modern 18K gold, diamond, sterling silver and gemstone jewelry, signature pens and personal accessories, Movado clocks and fine Swiss watches. Selections are highlighted in our seasonal catalogs. There are currently more than 25 upscale Movado Boutique stores in major markets across the United States.\n\nExcellence in design. A dedication to Swiss craftsmanship. The quest for technological innovation. The Movado philosophy remains as valid as it was in 1881. Swiss made and water resistant, all Movado watches are distinguished by a legacy of design innovation and dedication to the future of time.

Since its founding in 1881 by 19-year old entrepreneur Achille Ditesheim in the village of La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, Movado has achieved a legacy of design innovation, earning more than 100 patents and 200 international awards for artistry and innovation in watch design and time technology.\n\nMovado, meaning \"always in motion\" in the international language of Esperanto, is the hallmark of some of the most famous timepieces ever created: the 1912 Polyplan, its revolutionary, patented movement constructed on three planes to fit a case curved to follow the wrist\u2026the WWI Soldier\u2019s Watch with its elegant, protective grill\u2026the 1927 Ermeto, a capsule-shaped pocket watch wound by the sliding motion of its case\u2026the innovative 1950\u2019s Kingmatic series of rotor-driven automatics\u2026the Movado Artist\u2019s Series by luminaries of the fine art world\u2026and the Movado Museum\u00ae Watch with its legendary dial.\n\nDefined by a single dot at 12 representing the sun at high noon, the Museum Watch dial is regarded as an icon of Modernism. It was designed by Bauhaus-influenced artist Nathan George Horwitt in 1947. When Horwitt\u2019s dial was selected for the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1960, it was the first watch dial ever awarded this distinction. The name \"Museum Watch\" derives from this recognition. Today, Movado watches are in prominent museums worldwide, and this legendary dial distinguishes an entire collection of singular timepieces.\n\nThe Movado Boutiques extend the Movado brand philosophy of design innovation beyond watches to a range of products for modern living.
