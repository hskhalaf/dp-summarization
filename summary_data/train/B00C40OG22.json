They stand behind their product. It is such an inexpensive charger and it keeps my iPhone X charged. I love it. I plan to buy this exact one for my husband when he upgrades his phone.

I was hesitant to trust wireless charging in the iPhone 8 because I read the reviews that talked about how the iPhone had to be positioned perfectly on the charging pad for it to work. I have not had that issue. As long as the complete width of the iPhone is contacting the pad, it will charge. I have tried all sorts of haphazard positions, and every angle works so long as the width of the phone is on the pad. The wireless charging is slower than charging through a cable, but I believe that is a problem in wireless charging technology across the board and not specific to this charger.",

      "text": "I'm amused by these complaints. In order to be disturbed by this small blue light that activates when the device is charging your iPhone, the phone would have to be near your bed while you are sleeping, preferably at eye level since the length of your phone acts as a roof over the device, and hence the light, thereby covering up most of the light's distribution in the room, and your bedroom would have to be pitch black dark, in order for the small light to have any effect on the room's ambient light level.",

Charging speed is on par with normal cellphone chargers, still trying to do a comparison with a fast charging pad. Overall, very happy with the product.",

But it's very easy to just set your phone down and forget about it charging. For just over thirteen dollars, you can't do much better. Highly recommend.",

While this does not in any way effect charging, it makes the phone rock around if it's being used at the same time it's being charged.

This charger charges at 7.5W while the 10W charger is a little faster, the difference is almost negligible. 3. Both chargers work phenomenally with Spigen cases with both my iPhone 8 and my Galaxy Note 5. In conclusion, get this charger if you want a charger that would work with any Qi Enabled device. I found it to be more value than the Fast wireless chargers on the market...even the Fast one offered by the same company.",
