Hit the reset button and it finnaly turned on BUT its infrared feature doesn't work(the setting was on for that,it was fully charged). so i turn the camera off to see if restarting will get the infrared to work but it won't turn back on. I have to hit the reset button which only works to turn it on 60% of the time.I also try to connect it to a computer. I tried different computer and the computers did not recognize the camera.This camera was an unacceptable waste of my time .I would NEVER recomend this camera to anyone.",

Battery went dead but CS returned it to me in record time with additional cords including one for the car that was not available when I purchased it. The few days I was without it I really missed it. Also superior as a dash cam, I clip it to the visor and put it on automobile mode. Continous recording unlike my previous dash cams which made small clips only.

I only turn it on when I am out of my car. I have not dropped it yet, or had it in heavy rain, so I cant comment as to how it holds up. Video transfer is easy. It just plugs into the computer via the charging cable and uses windows media player to watch what you captured. My only real complaint is navigating through the menus takes some getting used to. Once you get used to it though, it becomes easier. Overall, I'm happy with it.",
