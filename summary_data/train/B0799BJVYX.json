Super impressed with this piece and it's the perfect size for our small apartment ! A must have for storing things . Super impressed.",

I have a 30\" flat screen, and it is working out perfectly. (went through a 6.5 earthquake just fine, I should add) However, in a child-based household, I'd probably think twice about it.

The top piece did have a crack in it on the presses wood side but it didn\u2019t affect the pieces ability to stay together nor the appearance so I didn\u2019t worry about it. It looks great put together and I would buy from this company again. I added photos of it in its space in my living room entryway.",

I would definitely buy other items from this company based on my experience putting this together. It looks very nice in my kitchen.",
