Works brill but boiler will stay fired up till temp is reached (unlike your old thermostat that has TPI technology in it) then when it goes off there is enough residual heat in the radiators to go up to 25 degrees. Too hot. Then when drops back to to 20 or what ever you set it to it comes on again and heats up to 5 degrees over what you need. Cleaver British gas. Who owns hive. Re fitted old one back on now.

The Hive was easy to install - it took me around 15 minutes, the majority of which was waiting for the Hub to connect and update its firmware. My boiler is fairly modern (Vokera 29 Compact) and it only needed 4 wires connecting to the control unit. The app is intuitive and easy to use, as is the physical thermostat. If you're not mounting it to a wall though, I'd recommend buying a stand; the base of the thermostat has a tab to remove the battery cover and it means it doesn't stand on it's own.",

Integration with Alexa & Life360 is great for turning heating off when everyone in house leaves BUT it turns settings to off rather than to schedule mode.

In theory it will work with an oil boiler, but you will have to install it or arrange the installation yourself. The marketing talks about geofencing functionality, but all it can do is notify you if you go outside a certain range and the heating is on - it does not automatically turn the heating off. You might be able to do this more properly with IFTTT or a similar setup, but not with the app as-is.",

Unfortunately only after I'd already fried the boiler's lower voltage circuit... 3 stars is being pretty kind to it. It works ok most of the time, but the hub regularly goes offline. So much so that I've invested in a smart plug to plug it into. When the hub drops offline I can remotely reboot it by controlling the smart plug. Shouldn't have to do this imho.",
