The keyboard is very precise and comfortable, allowing for fast typing. Mouse and touch screen very accurate. The display is crisp with natural colors. Processor and SSD performance is ample. Beautiful detail solutions like the power supply plug and the additional USB charging port in the power supply add to the appeal. And the design is clean, minimalist, beautiful. I hope I will have this laptop for a very long time!",

      "text": "I purchased the i7, 8GB RAM, and 256GB memory. The laptop is lighter than my previous Surface, the Surface 1st Gen. The quality of the keyboard is much nicer than the first generation so there's definitely been a lot of upgrades. I love the feel and the quality of the laptop. The battery lasts pretty long when I have multiple tabs open. Very short delay when starting up the surface. Very quick to shut down as well. The laptop restarts in about 20 seconds. Love how quick the laptop is when changing tabs despite having multiple programs open. All in all, I love this laptop and the price is even better.",

Turned on to a black screen with streaks all over. Eventually had to go to a Microsoft store for a replacement. I hope I just got two duds and this isn't a trend.",

I've owned loads of laptops and this one tops them all. I also own the latest Microsoft Surface Pro (not the laptop) because I couldn't decide between these beasts. I really like them both, a really good hardware and overall goods products by Microsoft. They hit the sweet spot with these machines. Highly recommended!",

The only issue was the charger that came with it, it's of terrible quality and stopped working for me after just 4 months of use and had to buy a new one.
