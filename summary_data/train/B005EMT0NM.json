I'm allergic to all the drugstore sunscreens and have been using Cotz - which is a great brand I swear by as well. But I've been missing the convenience of spray on sunscreen. This one is incredible. It is so light and leaves a glowing sheen and lacks the chalky, dry effects of the zinc/titanium oxide creams. Because of the price I treat it like liquid gold. Yes, expensive but sooooo worth it.",

We applied it every few hours and my very pale husband didn't even get sunburned. My one complaint is the price, but if sun protection without chemicals is a priority then you'll pay the price like I did!",

I know it\u2019s pricey, but I swear it lasts twice as long as other sunscreen brand sprays. I only reapply like once in a whole day. Also, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s more ounces than a typical brand, so one can lasts like a week at the beach. AND it smells sooo good.",

I am very light skinned with blue eyes and I burn pretty easy. Not with this stuff. I did re-apply it several times throughout the day because I did not want to ruin my trip by being burnt. I feel like people underestimate how much or how often you need to put sunscreen on. I tend to spray and then rub it in or ask my hubby to rub it into my back. I have purchased both the pina colada scent (which is my fav) and the citrus mimosa (close second to pina colada).",
