My food is well protected and easy to access. No more baggies and trash to recycle. No more smashed and bruised fruit or veg. The pieces are very easy to clean and just work wonderfully.

The picture doesn't show it, but the jar has a strap attached. You put the jar in the bag, then close the velcro over the straps. Would have been easier to just have the strap on the bag, but that's just not enough of a negative to take off a full star. Very well thought out lunch kit!",

      "text": "Now I love to pack and carry my food for lunch. The lunch jar looks trendy, many colleagues have complimented while I was opening the jar and taking out the boxes inside it. Food remains warm as described. I make sure to clean the boxes right after eating to avoid any smell later. This lunch jar has three boxes, so sometimes I feel I should have purchased a bigger one with four boxes. But the cover bag is big and has additional space to add a small box if needed. I am very happy with the purchase.",
