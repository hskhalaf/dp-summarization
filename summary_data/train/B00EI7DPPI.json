The manufacturer has recommendations on running through vinegar to remove the taste, so it's obviously an ongoing problem. It didn't work. Why not solve the problem before the consumer gets the product instead of them having to deal with it. Also, it brews single serve cups painfully slowly. We bought a Keurig and went back to that. Never a funny after taste, even right out of the box.",

My favorite part is the split brewer. I can make a travel mug and run out the door, or make a whole pot of coffee. And I don't need a lot of room on the counter",

Really simple operation, just read the instructions and it works as advertised. Single cup function works great with loose coffee, but I haven't really tried any pods with it. K-cup style pods would NOT work with this model. Overall, 5 big stars. We love it.",

The programmable features were easy to figure out, and and full pot side is good. All in all, I wish I had spent the money on the Ninja",
