One globe broke in November when a coffee mug fell on it and another broke in December when I was moving the display. I was going to give up on the idea, but they really are nice, decided to try again and just warn people to keep hands off. I did enquire about replaceling the one I broke originally and this is doable, but they wanted to charge $25 for just the one, which I thought was ridiculous.",

However the flaws don\u2019t make too much of a big deal, great product to gift to a friend or a loved one! Very adorable!",

The globe is beautiful, just the right size- so many globes, while beautiful, are so big and bulky that it takes 2 hands to shake and then you still don't get a good swirl. This is perfect, you can lift it with 1 hand and it has a lot of gold glitter that swirls and floats. I loved it and more importantly the person who received it also loved it.",
