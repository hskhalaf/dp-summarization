It doesn't have the exact same consistency and definitely has a different smell. I don't know if it has different ingredients. I'm guessing it may have been made in a different country (perhaps EU?) and sometimes that causes a shift in the ingredients. The packaging looks exactly the same. The one I bought at ULTA has a stronger, sweeter fragrance. This one has hardly any fragrance; smells like nothing. (That can be a good thing as fragrance is an irritant, but makes me wonder if it's still the same product).",
