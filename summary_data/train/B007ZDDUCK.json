I used the supplied terrycloth pad and some color did rub off of the antique finish which I expected- not a big deal for these nearly 100 year old footstools. I've attached some comparison photos: top is before, bottom is after results.",

The Leather Milk doesn't make the tablet sleeve look like new - it makes it look better than new. It does darken the leather a bit initially, but that lightens up again with time.",

If you want it for cleaning leather, it's nice. If you want it for blending in fading, it won't work. I had numerous email interactions with the company, but nothing resolved.",

The Chamberlain's product just felt like I was rubbing water on the leather. That being said, I am still glad I purchased it because I would not use the Obenauf's product on softer leather like car leather or softer shoes. Obviously, the Chamberlain product is excellent looking at reviews, but if you have tough leather products (boots, briefcases) that you don't mind having a darker tone, I would go with the Obenauf's.",

Since the milk is uncolored, I was able to use it on dark red and purple leather. Both bags look and feel amazing. I slathered it on with the included applicator pad and let them sit for a day. I used a lot, since my leather was very dry. I look forward to using it on other leather products that I own, that just need a bit of of a rejuvenation.",

It does darken the leather a fair amount so if you are worried about lighter colors staying light, I recommend Bick 4. Bick 4 will not darken the leather but does not seem to actually condition leather quite a well as Leather Milk. This product seems to fit right in between Bick 4 and Leather Honey in terms of hydrating the leather and also darkening the leather. Bick 4 for light conditioning with no color change, Leather Milk for medium conditioning with some darkening of the leather, and Leather Honey for heavy conditioning but substantial color darkening. I will purchase more when this product runs out.",

Unlike mineral oil, this product went on mess-free and absorbed into the dry leather evenly making it soft and supple instantaneously. The process was much easier, in fact I applied a second application a few days later because my leather was SO dry. The lotion smells nice and comes with a nice 4-5\" round application/buffing pad. I will absolutely recommend this product. With two applications I only used about half of the bottle.",
