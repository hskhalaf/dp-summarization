Like most DC sneakers, it garnered positive reviews not just for its style and colors but also for comfort and performance.Its heavily reinforced upper provides sufficient foot support and protection and at the same time gives a distinct look that many perceived as trendy.Although narrow-fitting for most, it still left a general impression of being comfortable when worn especially with the right shoe size on. Lastly, it is affordable and offers loads of color options.",

        "Like most DC sneakers, this particular model bears a budget-friendly price tag",
        "This shoe offers moderate arch support according to several buyers",
        "One video reviewer emphasized that because of its multi-panel upper with lots of reinforcements on high wear areas, durability wouldn\u2019t be a primary issue of the Maswell shoe"
