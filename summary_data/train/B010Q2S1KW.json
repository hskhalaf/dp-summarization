I can't comment on the remaining stock available only via independent sellers.",

      "text": "Overall not a bad tablet but I wish to make potential purchasers aware that you cannot add extra Users i.e. your children, as Asus have disabled this function. Why? No idea. But it cannot only be used by one user. It is a standard of Android from some version up that Users can be added, but Asus decided not to allow this. If I had know this I would not have bought two of these tablets. Overall though the tablet is OK and once set up works OK but the lack of being able to add a User gives me major problems when I wish to allow my grandchildren access on them.",
