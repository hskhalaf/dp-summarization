I also wear orthotic inserts so I cant tell you about the cushioning in the step of the shoe. All in all, I like the shoe.",

In women tennis shoes, I usually wear a size 7.5 wide and even 8 to allow for extra toe space and spread during intense activities. Men's size are supposedly 1.5 size bigger. So, the 7 I got was technically an 8.5. BUT, these shoes seems to run slightly small and narrow. Although still slightly big, it almost fit with thick socks. One small annoyance is that these don't provide enough grip on a typical basketball court. I have slipped every time. However, the traction is enough for most surfaces including wet, slippery pavements.",
