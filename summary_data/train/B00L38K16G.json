It applies easily and doesn't dry out skin or give brows a stiff feel. They remain soft yet in control. I would call the color light ash blonde. It's light enough not to look garish, yet dark enough to give some definition to your brows. I love Benefit's Gimme Brow. The brush is great, but the lightest shade is still too dark for me. This color (Rimmel Brow This Way, Blonde) is better for me and more natural looking.",

I tried shaking it up, and thin brown liquid poured out. Gross. I've used the real version of this brow mascara before and have been super happy with it. Even more so than the expensive Sephora versions. This was a huge disappointment since I can't find this one in stores anymore. I just threw it away. Buyers beware.",
