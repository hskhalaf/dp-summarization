We used this grate 4 times. As you can see from the pictures, it completely burned through. What you can't see is that it warped forward so that the wood was falling forward. Also, it gave off a bad aroma during all burnings. Unlike any other grate we have used in the past. This is not a product to purchase if you are trying to heat your house. It would be quite useful for decorative fireplaces.",

My previous \"bargain priced\" steel grate did not hold up well, with several bars sagging and ultimately breaking off. When I inspected the grate that I purchased from Rocky Mountain Goods, I saw that the bars were noticeably heavier, with high quality welds. It also contains a screen to prevent embers from prematurely falling to the floor of the fireplace, which allows more heat to be transmitted. This fact I confirmed after my initial use of the product. All in all, I am very satisfied with my Rocky Mountains Goods Fireplace Grate!",
