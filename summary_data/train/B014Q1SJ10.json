Chronic osteoarthritis mysteriously disappeared quite a while ago. I did not purchase this product for that purpose, but no complaints. Why five stars: I didn't expect huge changes in T levels; just small changes since these are natural, safe, ingredients. That being the case, they work fine. The only thing that changed in my diet in years are these supplements, and now there doesn't seem to be a hint of arthritis in my knees, elbows or wrists. Go figure.",

This product is made for raising your testosterone and it does just that. If you're relying on energy drinks you need to stop right now, and get yourself on a Testosterone Supplement. Testosterone is one of the key things that males need for processing energy in the body. If you find yourself just not having the energy to do anything, it's probably low testosterone.",

I have much better workouts, more energy even upon waking up (quit drinking coffee completely!) and vitality increases as well.

Stay patient and try at lest 2 cycles, what do you have to lose for such a very reasonable price.. Hope this helps!",
