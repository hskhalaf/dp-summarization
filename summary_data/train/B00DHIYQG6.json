Want a good recommendation: Buy this pedal with closed eyes, your ears, your wallet and your sound will thank you. If you can not spend more than $ 100, this is an excellent investment and choice. This pedal is in my pedalboard for years !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The three potentiometers to equalize give a variety of very useful and nice sound possibilities. From an overdrive, passing a Rockera distortion, to reach some metalheads shades ... just try it.",

It does a great job of clipping tube amp at bedroom volumes for practice. It\u2019s also quieter than tubescreamer as the individual controls allow you to dial in a tone you prefer and keep him to a minimum. The volume on this thing is freaking ear splitting. Great activate during a solo. Will cut through the band with ease. Keeping this along with Boss OD1 and tubescreamer. All have a place and a use on pedalboard",

The MXR M75 into the clean channel provides the required hot distortion and articulation without the muddy lows. The tone controls while limited were adequate at shaping the sound for the mix as needed. The pedal appears to be adequate quality for a around $100. Knobs are tight and the pedal has some weight. This is a a good choice for a hot Marshall distortion sound.",
