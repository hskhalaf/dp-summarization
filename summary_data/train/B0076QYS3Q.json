Sodomite that you will need to purchase a beauty ring for the bottom...understand that these sinks don't secure down tight like a normal sink would...this isn't functional for kids and everyday normal use... Great for a 1/2 bath or a spa type setting but wouldn't recommend for normal everyday use... Take a look at the picture that I installed and you'll see how nice they look...hope this helps you...",

For us a vessel sink is a necessity for our for very small bathroom so it needed to be stunning and practical. This fits the bill perfectly. Pros: - Well made - Very attractive design and color - Over-packaged for safety during transportation Cons: - None that I could find. It's perfect. Overall: Beautiful and well made. If this is your style you just can't go wrong! This is being used in with the following faucet and drain plug. They compliment this sink very well.",

It also looks like rubbing with water, which of course people do with sinks, will worsen the poor paint job. It is also scratched in the center, and it appears that it would be very easy to cause more scratches to occur with any usage.",

You can separately purchase a mounting ring for the bottom, which I would highly recommend. The ring is evident in one of the photos.",

We looked at similar sinks locally and they cost 5 times the price of this one and I am still wondering what's the big difference between this and the others! We installed this ourselves and used a strong adhesive gel (clear) to attach to the marble countertop we purchased. The sink is now sitting very firm over the countertop with no visible leaks or such. I hope this lasts long and is durable but for now I am one happy customer!",
