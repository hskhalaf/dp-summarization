I also love the Petersen's Guide--which, for instance, is better about teaching you the different parts of a flower and the different kinds of leaves, and also has more evocative descriptions. It also includes many more species. But Petersen's is better once you get a little more advanced, because it's a bit harder to identify the flowers you find using that one.",

Its seems to be of the most popular flowers and the pictures are of just one stage of the flower, but still fun to reference. I am constantly seeing something and go to the book to see if its in there! At camp there is no internet, so this book and its size works great.",
