I also use ESS File Explorer with it. If it won't support the formats you like then change the player you are using and the app you are using to access the drive. I can connect to it along with several of my friends and it works flawlessly.",

Rather than spend the extra money buying an upgraded memory unit of the Ipad or Tablet, spend the money on the Seagate GoFlex WIFI drive. I'm glad I listened because for the $100 I spent on the GoFlex, which I got on sale at Amazon, I have a 500 GB hard drive that I can share with the smartphone, Iphone or Tablet. Streaming movies showed initial hiccups while the unit was buffering but went very smooth once it got over the hiccups. The onlt hangup I have with this is I cannot connect to the internet while I am connected to the drive via WiFi",

What I don't like about it is that the media is just clumped together there is no concept for a folder or any other way to organize the contents. And things are just clumped together when you view the files in the onscreen viewer. Other than this knit, I do like the device itself. I dont think I would personally pay more than the $99 I got it for though. Its original price is $200 which is quite high given the mess of the root directories.",

You have two options, either download the Seagate Satellite app on your device and browse your hard drive through that or you just open your web browser on your device and it automatically brings you to crap UI that I mentioned. Either way it just sucks, it doesnt want to play my movies or it wants to waste my time trying to download them to the device. Just dissapointed it wasnt wayyy easier to use. Will return and figure something else out. Hopefully Western Digital makes something worth buying.",

      "text": "The overall concept is sound but the device and the software is truly half-baked. Anyone considering purchasing one of these should go first to the Seagate support site for the GeoFlex Satellite and read some of the customer complaints about the GeoFlex Satellite. Complaints range from Firmware issues and overheating during charging, to simply not doing what it is supposed to do. I have returned this item to the vendor today having wasted half a day trying to set the device up and get it to work.",

So when I saw it drop to $100 about a month ago, I purchased it instantly. Does exactly what it says it does and works fine, couldn't have expected more, although I am disappointed that a newer 1 tb model has been released (at the same price of $200). So for anyone thinking about buying this product for $200, don't. Buy the newer model instead.",
