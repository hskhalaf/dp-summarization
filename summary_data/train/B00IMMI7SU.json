At first it was just a little loose, wasn't bothered by it. A couple uses later and there doesn't seem to be much of anything holding the head to the handle anymore and I'm afraid that one of these times I'll swing it and that head is just going to fly off. Whatever that black resin looking stuff they put in the top to try and secure it with just doesn't do the job. First TEKTON tool I've been disappointed with, hopefully the last.",

Because of its low price, it was what I considered a \"throw away\" tool. I intended to use it for welding school and assumed it would break from the abuse. NOT THE CASE. It is made very well. I can only hope that the rest of there hammer line are still built this way. I plan to buy more hammers from them. The price for there hammer set is pretty awesome, and if they are built like this one, I'll never need another set again.",

Made from high-strength, lightweight fiberglass, the virtually unbreakable handle core naturally dampens stinging vibrations. A poly jacket completely surrounds the core and protects it like a bulletproof vest, absorbing the impact of missed strikes. The smoothly rounded ball end lets you work and shape sheet metal to just the right contour. Grab a hold of the soft, non-slip rubber grip and experience the ultimate in comfort. Since it is a directly integrated piece of the handle, it can never pull loose like hammers that use a push-on grip.",
