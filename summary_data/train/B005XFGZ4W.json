      "text": "Great game. I would have given it 5 stars at full price when it was new. At this price, you cant go wrong. The controls feel like they are built around a gamepad (probably are) but work just fine with keyboard/mouse. Death has become one of my favorite video game characters. Gameplay: Feels like they too God of War and mashed to together with zelda. Added in a pretty good inventory selection and skill trees to keep Death growing and engaging. It is a very good game. A couple years old, but nothing about it really felt dated. If you havent played it and like God of War, you will be pleased",

The graphics and control of the character are exceptional. each quest and aspect of the game are intricate, challenging and just plain enjoyment. The weapons and upgrade of the character are unique and create different styles of action and fighting throughout game. one of my only five star reviews on games, this one is well worth it. shocking suprise and has play through mode.",

Music is not annoying but really fits each area well and also has a well wrighten storyline. They put some time into it and it shows. Also it does take use of the xbox controller for some of us who don't like to use the keyboard.",

Along the way, the Horseman discovers that there are far worse things than an earthly Apocalypse, and that an ancient grudge may threaten all of Creation\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\n\n Awakened by the End of Days, Death, the most feared of the legendary Four Horsemen embarks on a quest to undo Armageddon. Along the way, the Horseman discovers that there are far worse things than an earthly Apocalypse, and that an ancient grudge may threaten all of Creation. Become the terrifying force which everything fears but nothing can escape. Death Lives in Darksiders II.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeath comes alive to take on the unlikely role of hero in Darksiders II.\nView larger \n\nDEATH LIVES\n Darksiders II follows the exploits of Death, one of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse, in an action-packed tale that runs parallel to the events in the original Darksiders game. This epic journey propels Death across an expansive gameworld as he tries to redeem his brother, War, the horseman blamed for prematurely starting the Apocalypse in Darksiders. \n\n Like the original Darksiders game before it, the second game in the series is primarily a hack 'n slash adventure. The game takes place across netherworld environments, including \"The White city,\" an outpost where angels live, and \"The Eternal Throne,\" a floating fortress where the Lords of the Dead stand guard over souls that need to be cleansed. Although Death is the most feared of the Four Horsemen, his physical abilities are very different than his brother, War. Death is far more nimble, and relies on a combination of melee and ranged attacks. In combat Death's primary weapon is his huge iconic scythe, with a wide range of other weapons and usable items that must be gathered as the game progresses. Weapons can be dual-wielded, upgradable armor can be acquired for protection and Death has access to a terrifying and powerful pale mount. \n\nKEY GAME FEATURES\n * Become the most feared of the legendary Four Horsemen, able to destroy entire worlds and battle forces beyond Heaven and Hell\n * Explore startling gameworld environments reminiscent of heaven and hell\n * Customize your experience with varied armor sets, weapons, and skill trees allowing players to create their own Death\n * Explore a vast open world, complete dozens of side quests and customize your Death with a full leveling system, skill trees and endless equipment combinations\n * Death is a nimble and agile character capable of incredible acrobatic feats allowing the player to explore the world like never before\n\nADDITIONAL SCREENSHOTS",
