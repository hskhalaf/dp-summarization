If it weren't for OneNote, I wouldn't have used this tablet as often as I aspired. Pros: - Good Battery life and Excellent charging speed - Gorgeous display - S-Pen is still the best in the market - Perfect compromise between mobility and note-taking ability - Quite responsive Cons: - No S-Pen slot... seriously Samsung, what were you thinking?? - Glass back makes it glossy and fragile - Samsung Notes is essentially a downgrade from the feature-packed S-Note",

Outdoors I can crank up the brightness and see it easily if not in direct sun. The processor is quite fast and it has plenty of memory. Battery life seems good too.

Accessories, like cases and screen protectors, are way more abundant than the Sony has. More onboard storage would have been nice, but 32 GB is decent. Also updated to Oreo 8.x.

It's much more useful , cheaper and I can use my phone through it with the flow app too.",

It's be ideal to have no physical button but rather a in-disolay one, such as the Nexus 9 has, so whenever you are in landscape mode, the button follows and no need to reposition your hands when using the tablet.
