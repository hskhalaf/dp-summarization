The pictures it takes are also very good. If you are in a dimly lit room however, the flash does creat a shadow on the bottom of your pictures, so be careful with that.

    "description": "Color:BlackFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n Functional beauty in an alluringly slim body. Packing sophisticated style, advanced functions and high performance into its ultra-slim design, the Coolpix S210 fits comfortably in the hand and simplifies operation. \n\nCoolpix S210 Highlights \n\nVR image stabilization Compensating for the effects of camera shake to realize sharper results, electronic VR image stabilization frees you to enjoy capturing special moments without worrying about slight hand movements, particularly in lower light conditions. \n\nISO 2000 capability Light sensitivity range up to ISO 2000 allows the use of faster shutter speeds to avoid blurred results when shooting moving subjects or in locations with insuffi cient lighting. ISO sensitivity is automatically optimized in High-Sensitivity mode. \n\nCoolpix Premium Features \n\nCoolpix in-camera technologies give you the edge when it comes to taking beautiful pictures more easily and with greater enjoyment. Included are innovative functions that increase shooting opportunities in a broader range of situations, help to optimize images, and add a new dimension of fun to sharing those results. \n\nVR image stabilization Nikon Coolpix cameras offer an array of VR technologies that produce blur-free images when shooting in unsteady conditions or at slower shutter speeds. Selected models are equipped with one of two types of Optical VR, Lens Shift VR, which delivers sharp and steady images effective for shooting and faster framing with the LCD, or Image Sensor Shift VR, which moves the image sensor to accurately compensate for camera shake. Other models offer Electronic VR which applies movement data to image processing to turn blurred images into beautifully clear results. \n\nBetter pictures in lower light Selected Coolpix models offer ISO capability beyond the range of conventional digital compacts. An exciting advantage that greatly increases photographic possibilities, high ISO capability delivers excellent exposure in challenging conditions, broadens the scope of possible subjects and allows scenes to be captured beautifully without compromising natural light. \n\nFace-priority AF Available only with Nikon Coolpix cameras, the clever Face-priority AF function helps ensure satisfyingly crisp portraits no matter where the subject is in the shot. By automatically detecting people's faces in the frame, the photographer is free to press the shutter for sharp portraits with focus exactly where it's wanted. \n\nD-Lighting Only Nikon delivers the advantage of D-Lighting, a unique technology with the ability to rescue underexposed images or shots taken with excessive backlight. Accessible in Playback mode, this innovative feature automatically creates a copy of the image, adding light and detail added where necessary, while leaving correctly-exposed areas untouched. As a result, images are significantly improved in a manner that is much more natural looking. \n\nIn-camera red-eye fix Coolpix cameras offer refined red-eye reduction capability that surpasses other digital compacts. First, a series of pre-flashes stimulate the subject\u2019s pupils, causing them to constrict. The camera then analyzes the captured image for the remaining presence of red eyes, automatically correcting them in-camera before saving the image to memory.",
