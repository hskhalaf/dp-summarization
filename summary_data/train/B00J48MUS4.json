      "text": "A good game but doesn't rope you in like AC4 black flag. Paris is beautiful but the world is deadlier and the movement and combat is sticky. You can no longer use NPC's as human shields when someone is shooting at you, so whenever you are being shot at by multiple guys you will very likely die. The emphasis on the companion app and the micro-transactions add a really slimy gimmicky feel to the game but both can be ignored. As flawed as this game is, it's still worth playing and takes the assassins creed franchise in a new direction. Hopefully the games that follow this will be better but it's worth exploring the vast city of paris.",

The actions are, as usual, pretty repetitive. The previously nice multiplayer mode has changed. But, for me, the worse part is that it almost ignores the overall \"Assassin's creed\" story. For players, like me, who are trying to know what happened to Desmond friends, ignore this game. Even AC Rogue, which also don't talk much about the \"present\", is better than Unity because it at least talks a little about the predecessors' mythology.",

Pros: -Story continues after Assassins Creed Rogue -Graphics -New weapons -Better AI Cons: -Can't use the hidden blade as a primary weapon -There's a time limit when using Eagle Vision (I can't stand this) -Modern story was lacking -Unnecessary death of a character -a lot of glitches (faces people) etc.",

The game should have been complete at release to the point where only a few very minor bugs, but I guess releasing an incomplete game is more of an aesthetic choice. The story seems kind of short for Assassin's Creed, though not nearly as short as AC Rogue. Visually, a very pleasing game. Though, it does appear that a lot of work went into the viduals and not enough work went into the gameplay itself. Climbing/movement on rooftops seems to over compensate too much. Combat system is rather lousy. Overall, just an average game.",

The AC story has always keep me interested in the step but in Unity I am lost. The story line is not consistent, everything is everywhere. Unity is the reason I purchased my PS4 and now I'm sorta disappointed. The glitches are ok. I can look past glitches, software issues if the game itself was intriging. I am overall disappointed in AC Unity. I will go back to square one in AC black on the PS4.",

And they force online play on you, like constant advertisements during the game that ruin the immersion. Don't make the mistake I made. I gave it the benefit of the doubt. You should skip it.",

The story isn't very deep, but there are side missions galore that will enhance the story. The sound and voice-acting is phenomenal: I could hear every raindrop, fiddler, and rejoicing pub around me, and the actors read their lines appropriate emotional tones (if only the script was better). Co-op is especially fun and challenging enough when playing with friends.",

Everything took place within the animus which made me feel like I was missing a big part of the over-arching story of the game.
