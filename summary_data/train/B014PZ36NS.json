You can easily dis-assemble, pack, and take it 3) wood frame and body 4) each drop makes EXTREMELY loud 'bang' noise. This might bother many people in-door, but oh well, my babies seem to love the definitive drop effect. cons: a bit flimsy but OK. conclusion: You can definitely get people's attention when you play outdoor... I think, and there will be no problem finding your playmate.",

BAD: As I've seen noted by others, the pucks are loud as they smack into each other. If sound is an issue for you, this is going to be loud. Also...it is a little too expensive for such a simple game, but it is well-made. Haven't seen how it does being stored outside in the rain etc. but from the looks of it, it's best to store indoors.",

Would be great if there was some sort or rubber bumper that could be added. And a tray underneath for catching them all when they are released at the end. Which is again loud.

Other members of the team would not be allowed to \"help\" until the disc was released. It was great to watch each team member struggle with the board when the saw what the teammates had done.
