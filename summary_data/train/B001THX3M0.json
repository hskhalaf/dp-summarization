The unit seems to be well constructed and so far has held up nicely. Although I don't use it regularly, it is a great tool to have when setting up your surround sound system. The backlight is also a great touch, since it is dark in some of these theaters.",

Bought this and used it to re-calibrate my system and it is WAY better now. Sure enough this registered the left speakers as louder. I didn't see it mentioned in the description, but this also has a \"min\" and \"max\" button on the side which will display the min and max levels detected. Also it has a 15 minute period before it auto shuts off, and has a light sensor to light up the display. Back side has a screw for mounting to a tripod. I'm impressed.",

This is a fun toy for an engineer to keep at home and see how actual sounds in his environment actually relate to published levels which cause, for example, permanent hearing damage. I don't have a reference to be able to guess at how accurate it is, but the *precision* isn't much better than 6dB. That is, it might show 85dB near your speakers, and then you slowly turn up the volume and it jumps right to 91dB. I probably won't use it to tune my stereo EQ, but it's a fun thing to keep around.",

      "text": "This is a neat little sound meter that gives pretty good readings, thereby helping to establish relatively accurate noise levels. I use it when our recent neighbors get overly rambunctious in their partying. The difference in response one gets when registering a complaint with the local law such as: \"Officer, the peak noise levels from this party go over 95 db A-Weighed, at 200 feet, in a bedroom with no windows towards the noise ...\" and the more generic: \"Officer the neighbors are driving me nuts with their music.\" is substantial. Good product for some general applications.",
