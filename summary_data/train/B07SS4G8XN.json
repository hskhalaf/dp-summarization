We have not had to make any adjustments and nothing has broken on it or the hose. It does move a bit slower then our Polaris 360 did, but it gets the pool very clean and costs a lot less, with a lot of less moving parts to break and replace. We did add a leaf catcher so not too much Debris is put into the filter. It\u2019s a real nice cleaner and we DO recommend it.",

      "text": "We've been using this for about 2 months now. Overall it does a good job cleaning the pool and seems very sturdy. The reason for the 4-star rating is that it sometimes gets stuck on our drain covers, which seem to be a pretty standard size and shape. It's also not able to climb the walls more than about 2ft or so in the deep end. Presumably this is because we have a pebble tec liner, which is a bit more porous than normal plaster would be.",
