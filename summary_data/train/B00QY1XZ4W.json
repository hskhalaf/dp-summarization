My Granddaughter was in a play and they had put very heavy studio make up on her every night. She struggled to get it all off at night and it made her face break out. I told her to try my cleanser and it immediately took of every speck of make up and a tremendous amount of eye make up and lashes, and soothed her face and even helped clear up her break outs fast. It is wonderful to use with a rotary facial brush as well. It was recommended to me by my dermatologist. Especially good for sensitive skin.",

      "text": "Now this cleanser was suggested to me by my dermatologist and just the tiniest bit goes a very long way; as it's emollient properties are so rich! One thing to consider, though, is that it left my skin so taut (not in a bad way...as it actually looked like a mini face-lift) that I found it necessary to apply Vanicream's Lite Lotion, afterwards, in order for my skin to stay glowing - yet very supple, as well. Considering how sensitive my skin is, I highly recommend this wonderful product.",

The doctor prescribed an allergy medication plus told me to use Vanicream cleanser and Vanicream cream (not lotion) My face was better within a week of using. I've been on this regimen for a year and my breakouts are fewer, nowhere near as painful, I don't get sudden itchy rashes and it leaves a barrier between me and environmental irritants - I love this stuff.",
