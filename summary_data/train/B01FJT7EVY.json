The camera quality actually shocked me, it's fantastic for a budget phone or even a higher end device. All in all I think it was a good purchase. One complaint would be the fact that the phone did not come with headphones, but heck that's a small complaint.",

So forget about using the camera. Then there is the issue with the phone being from south america, when texting it wants to autofill words with spanish. Changing all settings to english does nothing to fix this. Takes twice as long to send a text! I will be replacing this phone in a week or two! Then I'll have to sell it for half what I paid here just to get rid of it.",

Multiple help forum responses had people removing apps until they found the culprit when this was a known issue during previous updates. The phone itself is pretty standard, although slow and frequent apps not responding. In short, Sony should have stuck with Walkmans.",
