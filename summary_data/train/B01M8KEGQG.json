These elegant 'Salute' glasses are tall, perfectly balanced to swirl and view, have a very thin lip and tight opening which comfortably fits the nose to fully appreciate the bouquet. Gorgeous 'clink' sound when toasting. See their durability/commercial use video. Glasses are tipped over on different counter tops and do NOT break, even marble! I'm amazed at the quality, you will be proud to own them.",
