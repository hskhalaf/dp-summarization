I am so pleased with the sound I am getting from a moderately priced speaker through this cable. my husband, a sound \"snob\", said that it is annoyingly good sound, meaning that he was shocked and amazed that something so reasonably priced could produce such clear and full sound. obviously, the speaker deserves applause too but with an inferior cable it would not sound as stunning as it does.",

So much prefer the PVC jackets used here over braided fabric jackets that are so prevelent these days. HIGHLY RECOMMEND Additionally: These cables are so worth the $$$ the old saying that you get what you pay for is true in this instance AND THEN SOME!!! A Great deal at twice this price.",

Dislike: doesn\u2019t pop/snap into my Asus laptop\u2019s headphone jack fully. Thus, the sound inevitably cuts off, have to re-establish connection, alternatively have to hold plug steady until it loses connection again. This may or may not be the circumstance for you.",

I would love to see this cord in a slightly smaller form factor because the cord is visible in my car and I have no where to hide/put it when not in use. I truly do recommend it to other people and I will be buying one for my Bose speaker at home- especially for the price!",
