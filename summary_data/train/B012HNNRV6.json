The product shipped by this vendor is NOT the same as the product from Shea Moisture. The foil top was half removed and the liquid inside is a greyish yellow watered-down liquid and not anywhere near the thick consistency of the product or even a regular shampoo. I am not even going to try using either of the two bottles on me first. There are other buyers who have offered similar reviews - I should have heeded their warning. Don't make the same mistake I did.",

The original is a thick gold color. These WILL be returned. This is so frustrating!!!!! Something to remember, it\u2019s probably best to just purchase it from ONLY Shea Moisture.",

However, it seems they have changed the formula yet again, and this time, it's garbage. The body wash is murky and smells \"off\", like the oils have expired. I won't be purchasing this again.",

The foil that covers the top of the bottles was not attached, which means they might have been open previously. When buying soap for a baby, I definitely would not buy an unsealed bottle. Also, The label on the bottle is slightly different, as well as the ingredient list. The company might have changed the product slightly, but this should be updated, especially since this is typically a product that health-conscious parents and parents of babies with allergies look to purchase.",

Foil tamper seal had been cut/ replaced. Buyer beware of the vendor source. I might even recommend only buying from local retailers at this point. This product should be close in appearance to classic light yellow Johnson/Johnson baby shampoo-no junk floating or sitting at the bottom. *Requested refund and got it instantly - no questions asked.",

Since starting to use this product, not only has there hair been hydrated but there skin as well. They no longer get extremely dry and ashy, there skin is a lot more moisturized.
