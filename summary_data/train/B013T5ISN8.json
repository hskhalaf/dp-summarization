Alcatel sent out an update (7VGS-UES6) which loads this phone with useless garbage and a file manager that wastes resources and constantly reactivates regardless of force quit. Even with all it's permissions cancel it still restarts and tries to advertise another useless app. I used to very much like this phone and posted a review in that regard saying that I didn't expect to need a new phone anytime soon, but now I probably need to buy a new phone all together because this is a polluted hunk of junk thanks to the people who made it and I will never buy another Alcatel device after this.",

So far it's up to Marshmallow, and has a great screen, great performance, and amazing dual front facing speakers. Battery like is solid and the added benefit of expandable storage with a very stock interface (after adding the Google launcher) are an added bonus. The only issue with this phone is the camera. It's slow, and in medium to low light blurring does occur. I expect this from a phone at this price, but if you have decent light and steady hands you can take average photos.",

I have found that the Outlook app occasionally slows down dramatically and is unusable, and requires the phone to be rebooted. But other than that, the battery life is adequate for a full day under moderate-to-heavy use, even when travelling, and I have encountered no red flags with this device. It's a pleasure to use and a good value for the money.",

I think it has a background noise cancelling feature built into the microphone but they cut out to much noise and there's no option to adjust sensitivity, or they just put crappy microphones in the phone to cut cost. Other than that everything else was good about the phone but the bad microphones were a deal breaker for me, I sent mine back.",
