I didn't have very dry skin, but I could have used a slight touch up, and after just a few days of applying it about twice a day, it has done wonders without giving my face the oily look. I would strongly recommend this moisturizer for anyone that wants smooth, moisturized skin, without comprimizing on anything.",

It sets well on the skin, but it breaks me out. I would try this again if it were fragrance-free.",

A bottle will last me about 6-8 weeks, and I can't see myself using anything else at this point. Highly recommend - love this moisturizer!",
