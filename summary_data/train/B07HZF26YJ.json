My skin looks better, healthier and is better moisturizer and hydrated. This is perfect for me although in my 30s I would have found it excessively oily.

      "text": "This oil works well to moisturize and protect my face, but I'm not wild about its application and the initial oily feel. You put a few drops of oil on your fingertips, and gently rub into your skin. Yes, it absorbs fairly quickly. But yes, it's a thin oil that can drip between your fingers before it makes it to your face. I've discovered that it's better to do one drop at a time to cover a single area before moving on. I love the effects of this oil serum. I just don't like the medium. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",
