Praise is given to the versatility of the silhouette, the lightweight build, the durability of the materials, and the flexibility of the midsole. On the other hand, criticism is afforded to the squeaking noise of the platform and the slip-magnet of an outsole.Fans of road running shoes that are designed for neutral pronation are the ones who are going to enjoy the Flex Experience RN 8.",

I wasn't sure if I could deal with that kind of feeling on my feet so I brought them back",

Recently I've noticed the right shoe insole has moved about 1/8\" over exposing my heel to the sole/side of shoe seam. This has led to a few heel blisters as the seam rubs with every step. The only solution I can find is adding another insole to help cover the area but it seems foolish to have to do so much extra work for a brand new pair of sneakers. Buyer beware the shoe quality is not good. I would not recommend these to anyone I liked.",

The tread wore off in a couple months as running shoes usually do for me. They were causing my right foot some pain, and they really hurt my foot after a 7 mile run at the start of quarantine. My ankle now clicks when I extend it and feels kinda sore a lot of the time. I replaced these shoes shortly after.",

I'll be ordering another pair soon! They ran a bit small but I've learned this about Nike brand so I'll buy another half size or so up.",

These shoes are comfortable and after they were broken in they fit pretty much perfectly. The material of the shoe feels nice, though the silver reflective strips on the sides detached from that fabric pretty early on and now sit more like ears. That's a mild aesthetic inconvenience and in no way makes this shoe any worse. Definitely worth the price.",

I wouldn't use them outdoors and yet they still didn't last? Ugh, never again will I buy Nikes on Amazon. I'm thinking they're a cheap knock off since my other Nikes have held up longer.",

But the shoes are not very much comfortable. But they are too noisy on smooth surface. I personally would never buy them again.",
