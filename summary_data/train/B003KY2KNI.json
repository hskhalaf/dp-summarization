They don't match perfectly but it's pretty close. On a side note, I purchased 6 baskets for the side openings of the island at The Container Store that fit PERFECTLY! If you're on the fence about getting a kitchen island, let me make it simple for you....GET THIS ONE!",

Without the wheels this heavy unit would be a monster to move around.",

Still, I can live with it and I totally recommend it. The price on Amazon vs others that I compared with was the best too. PLEASED with this purchase!!!",

Can\u2019t be mad at that! So I must say they stood by me on this. However, it would have been MUCH better to have a product that was completely up to par with NO issues.

For example, we had a small plastic box on top of it, and when I slide it about 4-5 inches to make room for a cutting board, it left long scratches where the box was!

One piece with a channel for a wall was cut unevenly so I had to jam a side piece in roughly, a set of pre-drilled holes were misaligned, and one door doesn't sit perfectly in place so it bangs into the center wall (second picture). Overall it seems like it's built to last, however you'll probably need a hand assembling it if you aren't stubborn like me.",

You can clearly see how the stool looks nothing like the island! Very frustrated. Oh, and the paint off the base is cracked.",
