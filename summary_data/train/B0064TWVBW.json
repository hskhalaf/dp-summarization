I picked this Delta faucet because it provided several opinions/fittings. I was pleasantly surprised to see I didn\u2019t need any of the supplied parts. The female threaded front end mount on the drain diverter fit perfectly, no cutting, soldering, it took less than 2 min to add the supplied thread tape and twisted it on.",

Save yourself the frustration of thinking you're buying a quality product from an honest American company. This is nothing but Chinese junk in Delta packaging. You might as well buy the cheap stuff from Menards, its actually better than this product, less expensive and is honest about where its made.

Spout & diverter work as intended (although water does come out a bit sputtery and not in a solid straight down stream, but most importantly no water leaks out the bottom when the diverter is pulled up for the shower.)",

So, maybe I didn't cut it perfectly, but my sticking point is that I shouldn't have to hacksaw anything that claims to be universal.
