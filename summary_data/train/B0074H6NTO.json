Thanks to available on-line video guides learning curve is steep, it takes about an hour to figure out how to optimise scanning process. Quality of scanned images could be compared to images taken by digital camera. Software will remove majority of dust and scratches. On some negatives a distinctive horizontal trace was visible during scanning, I would root this to film developing machine. I would highly recommend this product.",

When making a scan using SilverFast, I frequently get \"Unexpected Error\" - about 20% of times normally, or 70% of times when using Multi-Exposure. Fortunately this does not crash the application and it is just necessary to try another scan - sometimes 4 or 5 times for a Multi-exposure!.",

Personally, I would given it 0 stars as it does not do the job it was built for!",

      "text": "The scanner itself is fine. Does exactly what it says on the tin, and I have 30 years of kodachromes, velvias and negatives of various types to chomp onto the pooter. My missis doesn't quite know what my birthday present was letting her in for - middle-aged-bloke-with-a-computer-widow! Silverfast Ai is frustrating to install. It took an hour of big-red-switches, reboots and retries before the software suddenly found the scanner. Persist with it. The interface is awful, the manual worse, but once mastered it delivers a rich set of features. Important point to note. The colour profiles apply only to negatives - so your velvias will still contain red-faced people basking under purple-tinged skies.",

Plustek's own software is basically useless, whilst the SilverFast 8 software is almost incomprehensible to use - although it does produce better results. I'm now wishing that I'd kept my old Epson Photo flatbed scanner, which produced results at least as good, with far less effort.",

After lots of painful research and trial and error I narrowed it down to a hardware fault. Plustek confirmed this when I contacted them. I returned the scanner to Amazon and their service has been great - a replacement was sent out first-class post and now all appears to be ok. Well done Amazon. Let's hope the scanner proves to be reliable. By all accounts this is one of the best negative scanners out there for the money.",

It's an expensive piece of kit, which you would expect to work. I can't voice my disappointment enough. Do yourself a favour and avoid this product.",

Sometimes the scanner stuck during the transport, in this case please shake it well with hand for at least 2 minutes, connected it back to PC & it will work. If it is not working, please take it back to the place you have bought it for repair depending on your warranty. Please if you face any trouble, please feel free to contact us. Kind regards, xxxxx",
