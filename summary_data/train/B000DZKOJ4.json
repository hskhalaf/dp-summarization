Just a friendly reminder: If you are using entry level camera, such as Sony A380 or under, this lens is too much. a $700+ lens such as Sigma or Tamron is fairly enough. If you are using high-end camera, especially a full-frame camera such as Sony A850 and up, this lens will show you the absolute advantage against all other lenses!",

When it worked correctly, it yield crystal clear, tack-sharp images. I arranged an exchange on Monday morning, and received its replacement via free overnight shipping on Tuesday afternoon! The replacement workds perfectly as expected. Amazing service. I paid the exact same price on Amazon as I would have buying direct from Sony, but there is no way Sony could (would) match that incredibly fast replacement. Kudos to Amazon",

It's mated with the Sony A-Mount LA-EA3 adapter. I've added more photos to show. Most of these shots was between F/4-2.8. I've personally tried this lens and E-Mount 70-200GM F/2.8, the only difference is the GM is brighter rendering. AF is slightly faster but not that much in comparison.",
