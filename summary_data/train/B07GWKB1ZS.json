      "text": "This is a great premium light strip. It\u2019s nice knowing I could use it outdoors but I currently have mine indoors and I honestly like the construction of this more than it\u2019s indoor version. Note that this is pretty thick though so you won\u2019t be able to lightly mount it to places like the back of your TV, bit if you are using it up against a wall or something you should have no problem. I wish the maximum brightness was a little brighter and that its color accuracy, especially in the reds, would be a little sharper. Those are not picks in an otherwise great product.",

This stays under cover in the back porch, both are mounted for ambient light. At first I though it was just an issue with the WiFi or Alexa, but it doesn\u2019t work with the app either. We\u2019ve reconnected everything physically and with the wireless but it simple doesn\u2019t work. Do not recommend for the price we paid this should have lasted more the 4 months I got out of it.",
