Filters are also priced well and long at least as long as stated if not longer. Replacing filters are also quick and easy! I am a BIG FAN of the quick connects!! The best thing ever invented. Just cut to the size you need and snap them in and put a lock on it and done. No leaks and no tools. Definitely DIY system.",

I bought the iSpring 5 stage RO system and now I am sorry I didn\u2019t do it sooner. I am very pleased with the quality of the water since it takes all of the mineral taste out, that was the most important thing to me. Shipping was surprisingly fast. Installation was fast and easy with the how-to YouTube video. And customer service is great; the faucet had a slow drip, so iSpring sent a new one right away. I am very happy with my purchase.",

And, in a world full of rudeness and overall discontent, iSpring offers the best customer service and technical assistance of any company on the market!

I did have a tiny leak occur and called service. Don answered and from my description, suggested that the utility overpressure probably caused the small leak. It is very nice to have a knowledgeable person answer and be able to quickly determine a fix. He sent an inline pressure regulator and a replacement part the next day. Thank you Don! I recommend getting a pressure with every RO system as that would have solved my problem before it occurred. I'm impressed with iSpring's excellent service.",
