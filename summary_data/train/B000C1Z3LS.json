I had to spray this on HEAVILY and it definitely didn\u2019t last all day. Not even close. With my other Happy I\u2019ve purchased from department stores or the Clinique website, 2 pumps and it lasts all day. And I\u2019ve always gotten compliments on how good I smell, but not once did I hear a single compliment while wearing this particular bottle. Don\u2019t go the cheap route by buying this knockoff. It\u2019s not the real deal. It\u2019s worth the extra money to buy the genuine Happy.",

I ordered as my other bottle was running out and when I opened it and tried to use it, the smell was that skunky old perfume smell that smells nothing like the lovely fragrance that Happy is supposed to be. I got right online to return it and it says it is unreturnable . . . so I'm stuck with an expensive 3.4ounce bottle of perfume that is unusable. :(",

These little cheap minis make iit easier for us poor mothers of babies to experience the sensational scent without putting a hole in our pockets and THAT is why i gave it the four stars..... its missing one ONLY because the perfume did seem a little diluted compared to bottles purchased from Boston Store, you can tell the scent does not last as long. Still nice smell, havnt wore it since High school and it was a favorite have to have perfume back then. HAPPY memories :)",
