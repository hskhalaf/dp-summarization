In the course of a year I have only had to change the battery once. It is simple to use, reliable and compact. Many clients of mine who have borrowed it during shared presentations end up purchasing one. One of the best features is that the USB stick fits inside the battery compartment, keeping it safe and nearly impossible to loose over time like other remotes.",

Yes it's more slick, but I've found the forward button placement just above the screen blackout button on the Logitech to be a VERY POOR DESIGN. I don't have big fingers (or a large thumb) but I kept pressing the adjacent screen blackout button if I wasn't careful. Attention to pressing the correct button distracted me from making the best presentation. I rebought the Targus and I'm on autopilot again advancing slides, and can concentrate on content rather than fumbling with the remote.",

The center black tiny joystick is about 1/4\" diameter, it is almost impossible to move without it pressing down and \"left clicking\" all over the place. The small switch in the middle front selects between laser or remote mode, its a little tough to flip back n forth between the two, plus the white ring is supposed to be Green in Mouse mode and Red in Laser mode. Before the presentation the Green light was on in either mode. Maybe the switch failed? The unit in very small and awkward if you have bigger hands. I'm sending it back.",

I actually gave the presentation for a local archeaological club meeting which was held in a private home instead of a public conference room. So, what I didn't anticipate was that the presentations would be projected on a home's TV screen (instead of a projection screen). So the remote laser pointer feature didn't show up well which was a little frustrating. However, it shows up fine on a regular projector. So a separate laser pointer may need to be used. Otherwise, all of the other features worked great.",

Very clever design to keep inside the USB key for the remote and even to include an extra battery in case you need it (you know... it's very common that it will happen when you need it the most). The only thing I'd like to change is the laser, it's too small and sometimes loses visibility.",
