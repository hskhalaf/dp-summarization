The stockings themselves seem to be good quality but part of the reason I purchased this set is because there were 4 different patterns. When I recieved them I recieved all 4 stockings but 2 of them have tge same pattern. I'm not thrilled, I was expecting them to all be different, but I'll deal with it.",
