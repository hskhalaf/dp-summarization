It's easy to use, super portable and the video it captures is great quality. It's new essential equipment for motorcycle riders nowadays.",

Neither of those cameras worked very well, would overheat easily, and die quickly (average run time for 1080/60fps was <40 minutes). Just in the last day, the image quality, battery life, etc. have all impressed me. The camera has been used to do a time-lapse of an engine teardown/rebuild I'm doing, as well as driving around town. If there's anything I don't like about the camera, it's the general operation, but that's just a product of being used to the regular GoPro, so I'm sure that won't be an issue in the future.",

Every time you pick it up to use it, count on the battery being dead. 3) There is no way to turn off \"chaptering\". Sometimes you get a fairly long recording and other times it's chopped up into many little files you have to reassemble into one video. And yes, I updated the firmware.

The fact that it doesn\u2019t have timer to take pictures make it hard to take selfie with not having to connect to your phone. Anyway I\u2019m just a beginner anyway so still learning.

I eventually forgot to close the charging bay before going in the water and now it won't turn on. Partly my fault, but they could've designed it so that by default it is closed. They also could've made it so the SD slot was separately accessible which would've guaranteed better waterproofing.",

      "text": "It takes great video and photos. Some of the features, like voice commands, are just gimmy and are never used. Although the wifi is a good option for setting up shots, it really eats into the already limited and non switchable battery. For 200-250 its not a bad purchase, but I got it at 299. And that was a little too much for this camera.",
