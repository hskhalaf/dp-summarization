First, if your primary purpose is fitness, the GPS is VERY poor, the heart rate monitor plainly does not work during workouts, and the watch DOES NOT count swim laps in the pool. This even after a reset to factory. Also, the software used to record fitness, Samsung Health, recently released version 6, which eliminated all the connected services except for Strava. So if you use any other fitness platform you'll have to enter your activities manually. I recommend waiting for the next version... or a firmware update at the very least.",

Not sure why the discrepancy or which is accurate, but just providing some info :D Yes this watch isn't the cheapest, and there's a reason, it actually works! Maybe not quite as fashionable out of the box, but slap on a fance band and you're all set. Don't forget your screen protector.",
