After 4 months use, the heel of my right foot has worn down and now has a hole in (My Nike AF1's last about a year before this happens). Finally the laces are the round type that undo by themselves despite using all my strength to tighten them. Needless to say I wouldn't recommend these",

They are also a bit on the wide side for me, my right foot is way longer than my left, so I like something tight width wise, on the narrow side so my left foot does not move about much. Looks well enough made, but I wouldnt say it was a flat out running shoe. Would rate it mid-season Spring/Autumn too warm for Summer not heavy enough for Winter. Shoe length is on the short side, I would rate it closer to a 13.5 UK which suits me just fine, I normally take that size. Will wear heavy socks to compensate for the width.",
