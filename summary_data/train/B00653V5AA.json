They do not tell you that once the hitch lock cylinder is installed, you have to engage the key in the lock and turn the key in order to loosen (and tighten) the anti rattle/theft device and insert the rack into the hitch receiver. So you're thinking DUH right. It was anything but apparent to a pretty handy buyer and should be included in the assembly and installation instructions - DUH!",

I have been out several times and stopped long enough that i was glad i could lock up the bikes without removing them. If you have girls/womens bikes (without a straight bar) you need a Thule Frame Adapter 982XT, so the bike sits evenly. I have had 3 bikes on the rack at one time on the highway/interstate without any issues. Solid frame, built well and easy to use. Five stars for sure!!!",

Since cruiser bikes are shaped awkwardly, I dont blame the rack for giving me trouble (just prepare to twist and turn if you do own one).",

You just have to be careful how you load your bikes otherwise they will get scratches (if you care about them)",
