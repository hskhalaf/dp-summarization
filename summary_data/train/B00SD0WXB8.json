They are loose but vecro will tighten enough to fit his size and will fit him over the next i would say 2 more years. He is dropping into bowls and doesn't fear falling with these protective pads, they are also cushioned to help damper the impact. His skateboard skills instantly improved with the added protection and even my fears are less after watching him fall and jump back up.",

The pads themselves are very durable as my kid has tested them many times. They have a few scuffs, but there is no damage. Knee pads stay in place because the bottom use a cinch strap, which keeps the pad from riding up the leg. All you have to do is bend the knees to put the pad back in the right place. The elbow pads and wrist guards are secure, durable and comfortable. They stay in place without moving.",

The Velcro if not done just right will scrape his skin if he wears shorts. but they are super high quality and gives him the protection he needs!!! However I do not believe he will be able to wear them next year as they are perfect for him now but when he gets bigger they will be too small. Luckily I have a nephew I can hand them down to, and I do believe they will last a great deal longer. I think I purchased the medium",
