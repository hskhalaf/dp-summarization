Scoop of same product protein+this+coconut water+almond milk+1 banana and a few ice cubes is good. Add some carrots and even better. As for healthy effects, so far so good. Im not sure I have felt any magical tingling or anything, but Ill update in 30 days if anything new. I would say making greens part of your diet is good enough with a decent ability to drink and organic.",
