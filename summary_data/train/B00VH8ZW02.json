I waited a while to write this review because I've had some mediocre experiences with other USB chargers. This charger is still as good as the day I first set it up. I use it primarily for charging (2.0A) cell phones, Kindles and USP power bricks for back up power. All devices charge to 100% (on the cell phone, turn off all apps, or better still, turn cell phone off during charging to get faster charge, 100% charge). Leaving apps on during charging may limit cell phone \"full charge\" to about 97%.",

I plugged the speaker back into a wall wart USB cube, and it was fine. But when plugged back into this device - lots of hum. Since the speaker works fine with several USB wall warts I tried, I have to assume this device doesn't filter its output sufficiently to just act as a power supply in certain instances. Works fine as a charger, just be aware of that limitation.",

After reading their website information re: this product, I was hoping my quick charge compatible phone would charge faster than normal usb. But that's not the case. I thought Power IQ was something different than it is.",

We had a cheaper brand there and it quit working after a couple months and would always come unplugged from its cord. Not this one! So far, so good. It\u2019s a great way to charge/use our devices while we\u2019re hanging out on the couch and keep it hidden when not in use.",
