After changing batteries, resetting fingerprints over and over I gave up. Oh they had the nerve to include a foam block for to accommodate four rifles. You couldn\u2019t fit four rifles in there dismantled and stacked like Tetris.. Avoid",

I now see how cleverly they avoid showing rifles being stored and removed. If you look carefully you will notice that not one of these is an AR or other weapon with optics or a pistol grip.

The idea is that you only need your fingerprint in the dark or in an emergency. While I still keep a pistol in the safe mostly it holds the kids video game consoles when their playtime is up. Point of the story; this safe gets opened two times a day every single day without ever malfunctioning. Twice a day, every week, every month, going on 4 years now. If I could change anything I would've bought a larger version.",

Second, the bottom of this safe is bowed so that it doesn't sit flat on the floor, it rocks. Third, I can only fit my .22 & shotgun inside as long as I turn them sideways. Because the door sticks into the cabinet you end up with less room than it appears. Save your money, don't bother. FWIW, the biometric feature does work well.",
