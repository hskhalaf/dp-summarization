It\u2019s that deep, dark, Hawaiian tan I\u2019ve been craving. And the smell is fantastic. Light Coconut scent. I do NOT stink like a tanning booth after a tan. Able to go to work or out to dinner afterward without being self conscious of how I smell. And the lotion is velvety smooth, absorbs quickly, not greasy. This stuff is PERFECT!!",

Was really looking forward to this considering it said it\u2019s also help tattoos from fading in the bed but i can\u2019t deal with the smell.
