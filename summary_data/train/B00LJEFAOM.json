After spending two days with no help from Brother support online chat or 7 local IT repair shops I started shopping for a new printer. The periodic issues were: printer arrived with clogged ink jets, the 4x6 photos were smeared and had black lines, almost always the first few prints were unusable. Hours of my time were wasted waiting on phone hold for \"training\" to deal with the Brother initial set up and quirks. I used only Brother brand inks. The final disaster was no-power-to-printer in the middle of a large photo scanning to file project.",

And the movable guides on the back tray are so delicate and easy to move that simply loading the paper will move them causing your printout to be askew.
