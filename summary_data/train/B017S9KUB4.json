I let it soak for a week anyway (4 to 5 day minimum recommended), then drained the water. Water came out tinted by the oak with a beautiful oak bouquet. I filled this 3 liter barrel with Makers Mark Whisky on the 19th of April. Can't wait to taste the barrel aged result (giving it a month to age). I am buying another one for red wine. Awesome company, awesome product!",

Seasoned it per seller instructions, filled it up with Costco scotch (all I could afford), and not a drop of anything leaked. Upon delivery, my recipient's eyes slammed open and he went bonkers...it was love at first sight ! Said it's the best gift he ever received and kept caressing it and tasting the scotch. Gotta call over there and see if he ever went back to work... Note that I rated this item 5 stars despite the packaging problem (which I discussed with the vendor by phone). The product is just THAT GOOD !",
