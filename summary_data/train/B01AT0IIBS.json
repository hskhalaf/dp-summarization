It`s also fun, in a not too distracting way: playing exercises as a harpsichord or organ sometimes still sounds nice and makes you think about musicality... So far I love it, and feel, for the price, it's a serious instrument, a bargain, and I look forward to playing it regularly.",

This one does - it feels very much like a 'real' piano. My daughter wasn't worried about the fact that it has only 10 sounds compared to the hundreds of sounds offered by other keyboards, whether cheaper or more expensive. One of the reasons for this is the sound quality - the piano sounds from the onboard speakers are just terrific. It sounds great, it plays brilliantly - thoroughly happy with our purchase.",

Of course the keys are not weighted which does not futureproof it very well.

So had to return and this is main reason I am glad to have purchased from Amazon. Returns are pain free. Next we looked for a smaller keyboard and settled for the Piagero from Yamaha..
