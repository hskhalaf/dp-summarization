After it gets gross from my cats loving it to death, I can put it in the washing machine and it comes out like new. Being able to add fresh catnip makes it more appealing to my cats as well.",

They LOVE that but it's def on its way out, so I thought I'd replace it. Maybe in time they'll learn to love it, but it has been like 3 months already. Oh well. They have lots of toys. If you don't have lots of kitty toys maybe try this one! They might like it. Maybe my kitties are too spoiled lol",

These toys do not have a bunch of stuffing.

While my 2 boys used good cat manners and patiently waited their turn when the other was engrossed with the toy, I went ahead and splurged, ordering them a second one. However, manners have now gone downhill, and there have been moments where I find one of the boys hoarding both squirrels and standing guard over them when the other wants his back. Still a fantastic purchase though.",

I'm not sure why she loves this more than the others, but it is very evident that she thinks it is a winner! Even after a year of use it has somehow managed to stay intact and more than good enough for our little furry friend!",

Also, with their placement, they are quite difficult to clean. Construction of the toy, however, is solid.
