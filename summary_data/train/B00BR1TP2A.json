The life of the battery really is around 5 hours on low and about 1 hour on high. Unreal. And it charges within 2 hours. Very bright flashlight. It was lighting up an area of trees 100ft x 100ft clear as day from about 200ft away. Couldn't be happier. It comes with a shoulder strap and car charger.",

It is much brighter than my halogen corded light and when the battery gets low it can even be plugged in your 12 volt outlet in the car. I was skeptical on using this as a spotlight at first since it's an LED, but WOW this thing is bright and outshines any of the spotlights my family members have. Also, the light from the LED is more of a white light which I find much easier to be able to spot wildlife in the woods. If you want a fairly cheap super bright spotlight, this one is it!",

    "description": "The new Black & Decker 10 Watt LED Lithium-Ion Rechargeable Spotlight is a powerful and long lasting LED spotlight. Whether at home, in your vehicle, camping, or during a roadside emergency or power failure this spotlight will allow you to illuminate even the darkest of work areas. A tight focused beam provides up to 755 lumens of output. With proprietary CLO (continuous light output) technology it allows the Black & Decker 10 Watt LED lithium-ion rechargeable spotlight to run up to 6X longer and up to 5X brighter than halogen based spotlights without dimming. A rugged pistol grip handle offers the user a comfortable grip, while use of the locking pivoting stand and convenient trigger lock provides hands-free operation. A dimmer button allows for extended runtime. A rechargeable 7.4 Volt lithium-ion battery pack is built inside for extended runtime of up to 1.5 hours on high and 7 hours on low. Lithium-ion technology allows for up to 12 months without recharging. AC and DC charging cords are included to recharge the spotlight at home or inside a vehicle. The Black & Decker 10 Watt LED Lithium-Ion Rechargeable Spotlight has been tested by independent research labs for safety and reliability, including ETL.",
