Here's my issue; the bluetooth is a little sketchy. The music sometimes is intermittent, skips etc. Also I have actually lost bluetooth connectivity for no apparent reason. Otherwise the sound is fairly good for the size and the radio reception is fairly decent, and no I'm not right next to radio towers, about 50 miles away.",

Would think the speakers would handle the amplifier installed) Kinda hard to set the preset radio stations. Good sound, not concert quality but really good stereo sound. Works excellent for talk radio/sports announcers. Bluetooth works well. Never used the auxiliary input. Tough, heavy duty plastic frame. Been dropped a couple times. Like the fact it uses the Porter Cable rechargeable batteries or 110 voltage. I would buy again but I wouldn\u2019t want to spend over $60",
