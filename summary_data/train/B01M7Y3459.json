      "text": "I bought this reel because it was cheaper than a spare spool for a more expensive reel. I have not regrets, this is a pretty solid product. The drag seems to work well when stripping line. It spins really well, when I give it a smack it will make double digit free rotations. I would consider this a standard arbor size, it fits my 5wt well along with plenty of backing. I would be more likely to buy 4 of these and putting various lines on them then buying a high dollar one.",

      "text": "I recently purchased this reel for a fishing trip to Alaska. Didn't need anything special, just a reliable reel for salmon fishing. Used it for less than a day and noticed the line kept moving up in the spool toward the handle. Soon realized the sides of the spool were not \"tight\" and the line could move freely above where it should be. Tried tightening the screw but to no avail. Soon thereafter, the sides of the reel started pulling apart and the reel became useless. I would never recommend or purchase this reel again.",

So, I loaded one-half of a double-taper 2wt. floating line on the reel to use on my 6'6\" small stream fly rod. It's a great fit and the balance is perfect for me. The reel is attractive, with a very nice silver finish. It is smooth and the drag functions very well. In fact this reel works better tha some of my other name brand reels tht cost more than ten times the price. What a great value.",
