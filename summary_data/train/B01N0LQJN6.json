Placing the unit either on a rug, a small platform with rubber 'bumpers' on the underside, or two strips of wood does nothing to eliminate the vibration. I wonder if the base design is partially responsible.",

I bought this and had it sent to him, and he says it's a life saver! The remote makes it easy to quickly change settings if he wakes up in the middle of the night and needs to adjust anything. He also really likes that it oscillates and moves the air in the room really efficiently. The design of this fan doesn't take up too much space, and isn't prone to tip over. Overall, VERY HAPPY with this purchase!",

And man is it quiet. It has 8 different fan speeds, which they give unique names... like sleep, calm, cool, etc... basically just fan speed settings. It's really quiet on the lower settings yet has a great breeze still. This is a winner for me, as far as fans go",

So all combined we can stay pretty cool even on days in the upper 90\u2019s with just the fans. We live in central California where it is pretty hot all summer.

I\u2019m not sure if there is an air regulator sensor causing this issue but it\u2019s irritating when you want to have the windows open with the fan running simultaneously.",

We live in New England and summer time it's too hot at night but this fan is good enough to sleep.",

It does keep the flies away without drying out my eyes, so it's good in that way. The assembly is easy for anyone.
