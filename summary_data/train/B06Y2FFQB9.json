When I saw the price on this one, I couldn't resist buying it because the price was so low but I was pretty sure it was going to be a big let down. Wow, was I surprised... it works great and even comes with a protective gel case, batteries and even a lanyard. This was a steal for the price, I am very happy and bragging to my friends about this purchase.",

I have multiple medical appointments a week and have been able to test this product against regulated medical equipment - and it has performed perfectly! I've yet to get a reading that is different from what my nurses/doctors have gotten. This product is definitely a good buy at such a low price (less than $15 at the time of posting).",

For instance the first couple readings may show a pulse of 25 or something obviously wrong. A third or fourth attempt will show a pulse in the 60s/70s which is correct. SO, in light of that, it's a 3 star or lower rating. You will get an accurate reading only after a few attempts. Not great, but does work.",
