Replaced the little girl basket with a Nantucket rattan basket to make it look more adult. Came pretty much pre assembled - just had to connect the big pieces. Comfortable seat. Handle bar and seat adjustable for the best ride around beach town. Love it! Additional information - after a few weeks of use noticing the paint on the handlebars chips easily. Be careful to avoid chipping. I covered with clear nail polish to prevent the chips from getting worse.",

      "text": "I'm not a bike snob, but I do ride a Cannondale and a Giant adult's bike. By comparison this bike is heavy, especially since it is aluminum. It shipped quickly, was well packed, and had great assembly instructions. Speaking of assembly, it could not have been much easier - saddle, handle bars, pedals, and front tire. All I needed was an a allen wrench and 2 box ends, 10 minutes tops. Very good choice for a child that will outgrow this in a year or 2 - then we can upgrade to a higher end.",

A perfect upgrade from her 20in bike. Assembly was easy enough and the quality is good for the price. Only negative is the brackets for the basket were loose and fell out on a ride, but we came up with an easy solution to keep the basket secure without brackets. Would purchase again!",

I am sad that this bike did not last long. I contacted the seller, and 3 weeks later have not heard a thing from them. Because it is after 90 days I don\u2019t think I can get my money back. A bike should last longer than 5 months!!",
