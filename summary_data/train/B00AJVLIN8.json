      "text": "Initially I loved them... Bright and easy to install. Problem is they don't last. One side made it about 15 months. It still comes on but is very dim. The other after 2.5 years just quit completely. And yes I and check wiring and power with a meter. This is on a lift keep boat in a very clean freshwater lake. Its not like changing a light bulb. The damn things are screwed and caulked to the hull and hard wired in. Hate to buy these again and hope for better results but if I try for a better product I have to drill more hole in the boat. Boats don't like holes................",

If you expected them to be crazy bright then you should have paid for the more expensive ones and not these. Installed them just below the water line next to my trim tabs. Will definitely purchase 2 more for the middle area of transom to get alittle more water effect while under way. I recommend these for those who dont want to spend over $100 for underwater lights. Update: Purchased 2 more... totally recommended... so far the first 2 lasted me 4 trips out on the water...",
