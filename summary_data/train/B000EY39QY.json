      "text": "This sand filter worked fine for one full pool season, then the polymer on the tank broke down and began leaking, first a small amount then a spew of water. The manufacturer, Hayward, could not be reached. Instead they provided over an hour of phone wait time, urging use of the online instructions, which, of course would not address a defective product. The tank seems the most simple of the components and this one is clearly defective, unless the intended lifespan is a few months. I thought a discount on the replacement would be appropriate, or maybe just the purchase of the tank, but neither Hayward nor Amazon was of any benefit. Bottom line-don't buy this expecting any seller accommodations.",

      "text": "I replaced a 20 year old Pentair sand filter with this Hayward S270T. It took 350 lbs of sand which I bought from Home Depot for about $38. I typically changed the sand about every 5 years, but may push it to 7 since my old filter used 225 lbs of sand. This system came with everything I expected, including a gauge. Tips: Use a good soft / flexible sealant on the 1.5\" pvc pipe fittings you'll screw into the valve. Use 1.5\" screw together PVC unions right off the valve so you can tighten the screw in fittings or service the sand in the future. This will keep you from cutting pipes down the road.",

The sand I hear, and I hope the information is true, last 10 years and you loose nothing in the backwash except the debris.
