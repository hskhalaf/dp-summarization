A few weeks after getting the back board we started getting bug bites, I figured it was mosquitoes because summer had just started. The bites persisted and upon inspecting the back of the headboard we found shredded bodies of bed bugs as they were growing after biting us. We contacted the company and at first they did not believe us so we had to send pictures.",

Now that the headboard doesn't bang into the wall every time I roll over in bed I am very happy with this purchase.

It would have been easier with a second person just to hold the headboard up straight when I was trying to attach the first leg but I did it by myself and it was just fine.

After assembly and attaching it looked great, although it does wobble up top, and the bolts stick out from the back even using the shortest ones. -1 star for the less than perfect condition of the legs & packaging and for the giant pain this thing is to attach to a frame.

Our bedroom is small and we needed to remove our old headboard and footboard that was taking up so much room. This headboard is attached directly to the wall and gives us at least another foot of space, which is essential in a tiny space. Also, it has a very clean and classic look and gives the room a very calming effect.",

It does wobble slightly if you pull the bed off the wall and purposely shake it. Overall it is a stable piece. I fit my frame perfectly.",

The assembly was very simple (all hardware & tools supplied), and I was able to attach each headboard without too much trouble to my metal bed frames (I did have to use wooden spacers for 3 of them, to allow for a gap between the headboard rails & the bed frames, but that was not that big a deal)....

Saw some comments about flimsy construction of supports, don't understand those, as support boards are good solid wood and are equal to units on more expensive bedroom sets I have. All hardware is metric sized and provided as well as Allen wrenches to tighten bolts. Would definitely recommend this product. Thank you Amazon.",

Two reasons it didn't get a 5 star rating, but they are fairly minor. 1. As with most brand new products, there was a chemical somewhen I opened the plastic packaging around the individual pieces. Airs out really quick, though. 2. It's pushed against the wall, but still leans back because of the baseboard. Easy fix - folded small pieces of cardboard to about 2 inches thick, and taped to the back of eachh wooden post, no moving or squeaking or hitting the wall.",
