We could tell a difference in the first day. After two days she was smiling, had much more energy, her attitude was better as was her mind function. She has joined in family activities (meals, holiday gatherings, Amazon movies (previously she would stay in her room &make excuses not to join in) The difference is night and day!

Spending 45 minutes or so a day in front of the light boosted my focus at work, helped me feel more awake, and drastically helped my sleep pattern. I wear a sleep tracker and there was a noticeable change in the quality of my sleep on days when I used the light. I was skeptical at first, but this really is an amazing product.",

I can't really say if it has helped because I honestly can't work with it on--it's SO bright (white light, not soft yellow light) that it's harsh to the eye and it is super distracting. I've tried placing things in front of it to block the glare, but I think that's probably defeating the purpose of what the light is supposed to be doing for me? Needless to say, it hasn't helped me--but then again, I can't use it regularly like instructions say too. I wish there was a dimmer on it. :-(",

I feel more awake and less hungry oddly, so idk what it does but it works for me. Plus, it's a steal! Definitely recommend.",

Not with the shelter in place order, I\u2019m again feeling down and in no small part because I don\u2019t have access to any safe outdoor space.
