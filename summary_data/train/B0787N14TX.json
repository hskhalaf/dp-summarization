At over half the cost of the leading brand it was a no brainer. The second attention grabber was all the positive reviews it had. Reviews comparing it to, or even better, than TRX. When I received this product you could tell right away that it is a quality product. The instructions on how to set it up were easy to follow. I am extremely satisfied with this product and would recommend it to anyone who is looking to take work outs outdoors or for those that travel a lot.",

      "PROTECTION \u2013 Using the soft loops on the webbing of the Trainer will not rub when used on say a bar. Use the included carabiners for split seconds set-up. The INTEGRATED DOOR ANCHORS are light-weight and non-intrusive, yet allow you to use your Trainer on a door without additional hardware - it will not indent the door by the plastic portion of oversized and intrusive door anchors of other models",
