I'm highly impressed with Vacplus Toilet Bowl Cleaner and won't use anything else again!",

So bizarre. I emailed them but haven't heard anything and tried the FB site they list and it doesn't come up. Weird....",

Otherwise, it won't sink and won't actually work. :) Hopefully they'll fix that guidance on their packaging in the future. Very happy with this product!",
