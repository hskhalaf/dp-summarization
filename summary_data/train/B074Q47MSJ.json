This can be used for an adult or child as it is very large. I bought this for my 9 year old daughter and she absolutely loves it. It is very handy and mobile. You can just kind of fold it all up and take it along wherever. Great for sleep overs, camping, drive in movies, play time and lounging. Did I mention the dogs love it too?",
