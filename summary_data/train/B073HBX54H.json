The drawback is that now the engineers pulled a funny one and have a monster green dong on top of the sight. I'm not a guy that looks at something and says \" hey that looks like a dong\" it's 100% on purpose by IQ there is not explanation for it, and there is no reason for that design pattern to be there. I'm not sure if the sight is only going to allow me to see gay deer with IQs updated dick vision but time will tell. Will keep you posted",

The sight is OK but it noisy on shot which is the reason for two stars. Nothing is loose it just resonates with the shot. I'll probably find some butyl backed rubber, like what is used in auto sound deadening, to attach to the sight. One positive is that the mounting bracket is reversible which allows for greater range on vertical adjustments. The bracket is curved so that reversing its position changes the height of the sight.",

When you see the other reviewer that included a picture of the top it suspiciously appears suspect. I guess that shape collects light the best? I believe the sight light should be included. Makes one purchase easier instead of buying the sight then buying the light separately. Aluminum sight is a little heavy but just balance the bow and it's not that noticeable. Adjustments are crisp and an allen wrench is necessary to make sure your adjustments stay put. My setup is 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 yard pin distance.",

Was easy to install like all bow sights, really like the pins and ease of adjustment with the micro adjustments. With that said, after sighting in at 20 yds, I could not align the \"dot\" with the provided allen wrench. No matter what I did, up or down, side to side, I couldn't get it perfectly to align with the dot which meant I was adjusting to the dot which would allow for eratic shots. Without using the \"eye\" I was shooting great just focusing on the level. Unfortunately I returned it and just went with a traditional sight with a bubble level.",
