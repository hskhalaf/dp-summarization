      "text": "So I've heard a lot of online talk about Simichrome and Flitz. I have always used Flitz myself but decided to try Simichrome. I took two 6061 aluminum plates and sanded them both evenly to 400 grit. Started with 120 to remove minor surface imperfections and 400 to smooth it out a bit. I then went over them briefly with 1000 grit. I did 1 application of both and the Flitz was the clear winner. I ended up having to do 3 applications of Simichrome to achieve the same result. I will say sanding makes a world of difference. I normally sand to 2000 grit first which after flitzing produces a great reflection.",

The other thing is that I live at the beach so pitting and other problems happen quickly on the chrome if you don't take care of it.

Just squeeze out what you need for the job at hand and screw the top back on. The familiar pink compound reacts to loosen tarnish and the fine grit in the mix aids in removing very light scratches. A polish type of protective coat is deposited once the residue has been buffed away. I LOVE how this works on a pewter wine coaster and it is just the thing for knife collectors or sportsmen to use in maintaining the polish on blade steels. I have used it for that purpose for many years.",

I originally bought this stuff to see if I had a set of Bakelite utensils (this polish is pink. if you rub it on bakelite, it will turn yellow, usually). After I tested the bakelite, I decided to polish my fish. AMAZING! I've used other polish on my fish, but it never turned out like this. Plus, it's stayed shiny for so long now. I highly recommend simichrome!!!",
