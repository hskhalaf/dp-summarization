      "text": "These Champion socks are by far the best I\u2019ve owned! They are so comfortable and feel great on my feet! The fit of the socks is incredible! I was hesitant about these at first because I\u2019ve tried a lot of socks that are similar to these in price but nothing has come close to these. The thickness of the sock is great it feels like it should hold up for a while, but overall I would definitely recommend these socks to anyone that has a hard time finding socks big enough to fit your feet! If you have any questions feel free to ask! Also if you found my review to be helpful please check this was helpful!",

No pilling, stretching, fading after ~10 wash cycles. Like most cotton socks they tighten up in wash so, I recommend ordering the largest size available. They will stretch back out to fit your feet. Thickness depends on how much stretch. Even if you have small feet (e.g. Men's 5) the size 10-13 socks will fit fine. They might be too small if you have large feet (e.g. Men's 13).",

Suprisingly the thickness didn't make my feet more sweaty then then normal. I tend to have sweaty feet which is why i thought the ultra-thin socks would help.",

The price was pretty good when I bought them. Packaging was a plastic bag with a cardbord top (featuring company logo, details etc etc). What you'd expect to get in a store.",

Just a very comfortable and cushioned sock. You can use these alone or wear a second sock over them which cuts down friction against your feet even more. I use a very thin second sock.
