The bristles are nice and soft, the curved handles makes them really comfortable to hold (therefore, making teeth cleaning easier), and on the opposite side of the bristles is a tongue cleaner-like surface. I feel like I'm cleaning my mouth well with these. The charcoal in the bristles is an innovative touch as well, which I like. I'll definitely be buying these again!",

I use them with my charcoal tooth powder. After a thorough gargle with cool water, I follow with a gargle for 2 minutes with a pulling oil. Another gargle, and I brush with an over-the-counter whitening tooth paste (using the same bamboo charcoal tooth brush). A final gargle with cool water, and I'm good to go. You certainly don't have to use the pulling oil or the whitening tooth paste. It's merely my personal preference.",
