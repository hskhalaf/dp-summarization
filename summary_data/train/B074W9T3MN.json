It worked great but I really prefer a mug. I was so excited to come across this! It\u2019s perfect. I actually have to leave the lid off for a bit so it can cool down enough to drink! If I get up and won\u2019t be able to come back and drink it for awhile I just put the lid on and it stays warm till I get back to it. Definitely recommend for toddler mamas!",

I have several Yeti items and they keep hot/cold for hours as advertised. Maybe this one is a dud. Oh well, hopefully I can send it back.",

What is the purpose of spending all this money on this high tech mug when all the heat escapes through the top? Answer. To spend another 10 bucks on a lid with with magnets that closes to keep your beverage hot. Why didn't this lid come with it? Its a scam. If I would have known this I would have never bought it.

      "text": "OK so I've been eyeing yeti but haven't bought because you can get similar products for half the price. Finally bit the bullet and IT WAS SO WORTH EVERY PENNY!!! I didn't realize how quickly my coffee was cooling off until I bought this and burnt my tongue the first time I used it. I also didnt realize I was trying to rush through my daily cup just to keep it from getting lukewarm. This thing is a GAME CHANGER. Probably my best purchase of the year so far, which sounds silly because its only a mug. But let me tell you, it is THE MUG.",

I find it keeps my coffee hot long enough but because the cover has a hole that you cannot close, it does not keep my coffee hot as long as my travel mug does, hence the 4 stars, not 5. I wish they would have made the cover exactly as the travel mug has with the closable hole in it for I really do love my coffee piping hot. Otherwise, it is very well made, easy to clean and better than a regular open mug.",
