After taking it out of the oven the needle didn't move and stayed at 200. Then after I moved it around, it just went down in one shot. So I tried it again. The oven was a 355 degrees, the thermometer was saying that it was at 200. The needle hasn't moved since then. This simply doesn't work. So I am giving you the heads up.",

I think oven thermometers are a must have for serious bakers. This one works great. We recently moved and I could not find my original Taylor Classic oven thermometer after the move. I strongly suspected the temperature of the oven at the new house was quite a bit off. I ordered a new thermometer, and I am so happy I did. The oven I was using was running 50+ degrees higher than expected. With the thermometer I could adjust the temperature appropriately and my family didn\u2019t have to eat overcooked/burnt food.",

Fast forward 6-months and this thermometer stopped working which was very surprising given Taylor's brand name. I emailed customer service and heard nothing back. The no-name thermometer continues to function and it is several years old. Very disappointed in Taylor and will not buy another.",
