Because you can store food inside, dogs can't move them or tip them over... Making your floors pet food free. 2. These are PERFECT for travel. You can store food and bowls inside the airtight container and take it with you on the go. 3. We bought Larges for our St. Bernard and Labrador, and a medium for our Doxle. All were the perfect size. UPDATE: I was so impressed with these I bought more as gifts. The recipients love them as much as I do!",

For example, I have an 86lb Great Dane/Rhodesian Ridgeback mix who eats 35-40lbs of kibble a month. That is just slightly less than the amount of food this thing holds. It's crazy convenient. Additionally, the bowls are great quality, light weight, and the perfect size for my dog. The only weird thing is that the clips on the side open upward and I'm used to rubbermaid bins with clips that open downward and I get confused sometimes. That's life",

The large bowls that come with the set, sit on top of the lid, and so there is no leakage the water into the food, unlike some other food/bowl holders out there.",

We buy 44lb bags of food and there's still 7-8 lbs left in the bag after filling the container. This doesn't affect my rating since the description on the product page seems close and height/size are appropriate.
