I've got to main qualms with the design: 1. the pouch that the bag is stored in is separate from the bag itself (rather than attached to the bag itself); meaning if the little pouch is misplaced you're out of luck. 2. the straps are too short to carry over the shoulder--which is a pain if you're carrying your groceries even a few blocks. Really cute; just not very practical",

I just got the black and white \"phases of the moon\" bag from Amazon, and it's not quite as good as the one I bought in the airport for 2 reasons: 1) The ripstop nylon fabric is quite loud, and almost crinkly, sort of like a plastic bag. 2) this moon print has some text on it - the fabric on one side of the bag is upside down, so the text is upside down. It's not that big a deal, but $10 is plenty for a simple nylon bag. I'll keep the bag, but it's not as nice as the first one I got.",

They're very sturdy - have been able to carry at least 2 regular bags worth of groceries in this, including heavy items like a gallon of milk.

I personally addressed my concern by attaching braided floss to the Baggu tag on the holding bag and sewing it to the hemline of the reusable bag with enough slack that I can finagle it with ease. Problem solved. Definitely would buy again.",

I try to use it every chance I can. they even let me use it when I went thrift shopping and it fit two puffy jackets a pair of pants and several dishes. It feels very sturdy and durable. Made of nylon so its very easy to wash and dry. I love my bagguuuuu <<<<3",
