Power led and usb led stay on. Blinks the internet led and the lan but nothing else. Three other cables did not make a difference. Older laptop on win7 and a more recent desktop win10 did not find a way to get the login page. Raspberry pi did not understand this router either. Straight to bin (so that Amazon does not send this unit to someone else) and no more head banging TRENDnet again.",

Then the web interface (as accessed from my Windows 8 machine) became so slow that it took about 10 minutes to fully load a page. TRENDnet support has been next to useless. Funnily enough when I accessed the web interface from a windows 7 machine it seemed fine. Also the general design of the interface is pretty basic compared to my old netgear router. I'm going to send this back I think and get a decent router instead.",

However, it seems most effective when within 150 feet. With solid performance and competitive pricing on its side, Trendnet's AC1750 Dual Band Wireless router seems like a good alternative to the high-end Wireless-N N900 routers that don't support 802.11ac.",
