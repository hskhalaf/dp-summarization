I've used other products like this before and they have always been better than nothing, but didn't actually work well. I would stuff a dryer sheet in them along with the glove deodorizers, but with this one I don't need to and its still strong enough to keep my duffle bag smelling fresh.",

The end circle part is the only part that holds any of the filling as falls down from the rope end. They are small, short and thin. The scent is fairly faint after first couple days. The worst thing is that 2 days later my boxing gloves are still wet, so the moisture is not being sucked up. I have used 2 other brands, so I have ones to compare to as well. Meister glove deodorizers are by far the best, biggest, lasting scent, and keeping gloves dry! Very disappointed with this purchase.",
