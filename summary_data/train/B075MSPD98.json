We can seat 90 in our theatre and it sounded great even in the back row! It looked absolutely authentic too. We did have to cover the red and blue lights of course. It is a shame the radio dial doesn't light up while in Bluetooth mode tho. Now it's a prominent piece in my house I'm using and getting a real kick out of. Awesome product. Simply love it!",

The tuner numbers are so out of sync with actual station you are trying to get it is ridiculous. Seems like there is absolutely no quality control. VERY UNHAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE.",

Having said that on looks alone it's great. I have it sitting beside my bed and primarily use it's Bluetooth function because typically I just throw on some Amazon Prime or Netflix TV series as I'm falling to sleep from my phone. The quality of the speaker connected via Bluetooth is surprisingly good with a nice full sound. I only wish the FM/AM reception and tuning was a bit better.",

You could turn up the music fairly loud and it wasn't as noticeable but I wanted something I could keep in my study to play soft background noise when studying and the hum drove me crazy. Amazon was great and exchanged it for another. The second one is dead quiet and works fine. Speaker is somewhat small so don't expect studio monitor quality here but for what it is and intended to be, it meets all expectations. It's certainly better than iPhone speakers, which is what I was doing previously.",
