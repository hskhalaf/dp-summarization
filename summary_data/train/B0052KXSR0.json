The machine arrived pre-threaded, but I decided to have a go at threading it myself; threading the lower looper is a bit fiddly, but with the help of the instructional DVD, I managed it without too much swearing! It really is a great piece of kit at a decent price. I suspect it's going to get used rather a lot.",

There\u2019s lots of helpful YouTube videos too to help with troubleshooting and advice which was a massive help at the start as I had to keep re threading one of the strands but I soon worked out how to re thread and sort the tensions out. I also bought some extra spools from amazon which you just tied on to the end of the existing thread- makes Chang spools so easy. Janome is such a reliable make too and most sewing shops service and repair janome machines. My other machines are janome and I highly recommend.",
