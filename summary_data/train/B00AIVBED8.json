I have gotten much greater use out of these than other gloves that I have purchased. Plus, it is stylish. I may not land my iron shots closer to the pin with this Bionic glove but at least I look more stylish using it. Seriously, this glove is my go-to glove. If I can't find this brand and this model I feel like I'm compromising on quality. Great glove!",

      "text": "Initially I thought this glove would be an improvement. The padding is quite thick. I ended up having to change the way I grip clubs. I also had to back off my swing quite a bit as I had issues controlling the club face. I think the padding removes a lot of feel. After a year of using these, I switched to a non padded glove. I felt a noticeable improvement in club feel. I also feel like I could generate more speed due to a better connection with the club. Overall I would recommend this glove if you have grip strength issues. They definitely protect the hands better. The downside is reduced feel and effective change in grip size.",

I finally tried on the Bionic Stable Grip in the men's Cadet size. Perfect! I even like the little ridges on the fingers which I was skeptical about initially. They have proved to wear a lot longer than other golf gloves I have had previously. I'm a confirmed Bionic glove fan!",

I've tried using a L occasionally and have had somewhat better, but still unacceptable overall... particularly for the dollar premium. When they fit as they should and don't tear at the seam, however, I don't think there is a better glove out there.",
