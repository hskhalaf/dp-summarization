But it\u2019s also energy smart- when the water level is super low, it stops cooling probably because the reservoir is too low to cool efficiently. The only other negative as I see it- the child lock on the hot setting does not seem to pose any sort of challenge to a three year old. It\u2019s so easy to use the hot water button that you could fairly easily unlock it by accident. So if you have a little one, maybe look around before committing to this one.",

      "text": "Impressed by the sturdiness of my new Brio Cooler. Saw this Limited Edition version through amazon and was pleased by the features it provided. For one the self cleaning ozone works with a button and doesn\u2019t require any work from the consumers end. Second the easy access bottom loading, which is by far the most impressive. Thirdly was the quality of the cooler. It was sleek and looks elegant in our living room. Loving it already. Thanks",

In our kitchen it's no problem, but if you're considering locating this near a bedroom it could be an issue for you.",
