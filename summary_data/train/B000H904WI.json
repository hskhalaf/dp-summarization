I may use this in the orchard next spring to protect a young tree from the deer. The deer won't jump into small enclosures, they say, and they certainly have not jumped in to eat my tiny cotton plants. They had no compunction about eating the tops of my sunflowers, which had no protection. So, if your dog doesn't need a fence, you can use this one to keep the deer from eating your favorite plants.",
