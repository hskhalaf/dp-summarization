Previously I was using 2 different routers to try and boost my signal in my room (I have 100mbps internet), but only managed to get about 10mbps max with a small Netgear router, then hooked up an Asus and that delivered about 40-55mbps depending on time of day. Just set this up and I get 78mbps (of the 100mbps) to my room. I am absolutely blown away with how well this works. I was worried I'd need a repeater but this eliminated that need.",

Alongside that, apartment layout can be difficult to deal with when there are concrete walls blocking your WiFi. This was the only router that solved both issues and gave me crystal clear WiFi through out my apartment. The router is also incredibly easy to set up. The app, however, could be better. It gets the job done, but can be a little buggy.",

This is all fine if the Portal wifi router is the only wireless access point on your network but maddening if you have to administer multiple access points and have to shut down the device completely to test for interference on specific bands.",
