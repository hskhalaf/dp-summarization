My first observation is Kaytee brand looks like Zupreem but the bits were bigger and it took a while for my birds to try it (but they a finicky bunch) and when they did try it, I saw them dipping the pieces in water as if they were too hard to eat. Evidently, they are eating it much slower than their favorite brand, but it just seem like they aren't enjoying it as much.",

They seem to eat around the pellets and eat the seed AFTER three days of NOT eating. I really wish my birds liked the pellets because it wouldn't be as messy. BTW, they won't eat ANYthing fresh and there is just so long you can leave \"fresh\" in the cage.",
