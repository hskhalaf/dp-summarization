The nest cameras took longer to take out of the box and unwrapped to set up.

The Funlux cameras have a similar set up, but the app was hurrendous. I like them because they have a magnetic mount, also have screw mount, and they work with my nest thermostat in doorbell system.",

There is no way to turn the cooling period off or adjust it. This product is absolutely useless in this application.

      "text": "For me the primary point of purchasing a Nest indoor camera was to keep an eye on our vacation home. However, whenever there is a power outage, no matter how brief, our camera does not reconnect automatically. The only way to restart it is to drive a couple of hours to unplug it and plug it in again. Makes no sense! Our Nest thermometer always reconnects but I am clueless what to do about the camera. Maybe it is time to switch to another manufacturer.",

The notifications of movement, dog barks, etc are very useful. I love being able to talk back to the camera (a though the voice they hear is light). For safety, checking in and keeping an eye on things at home, this is a fantastic product.",

Zero issues with those failing. Would not recommend this product to anyone. I'm giving 2 stars because it works well when up and running. But I am no longer able to trust this thing anymore.",

The basic plan will cost you $10/mo (or $100/yr) for 10 days of history and the premium plan will cost you $30/mo (or $300/yr) for a 30 day recording history. I think you should get at least 24 hours of free recording history included or another way to record the videos (SD card, NAS, DropBox, etc). The cameras aren't cheap and you are forced to buy into their cloud recording plans. Should have done more research before buying. Will be moving to Arlo cams.",

If you want a great product that is reliable, get Nest. If I have a single gripe, it's that their outdoor cameras power cord has a huge puck so you can't install the power cord through a small hole in the wall, you would have to leave the puck on the outside of the house instead of inside.",
