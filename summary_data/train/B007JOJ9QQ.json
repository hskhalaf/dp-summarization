I tried replacing the batteries and giving the machine a thorough clean. Unfortunately those efforts only improved things briefly. And now it has been sitting unused on the floor for well over a year. I can't find any repair places locally that will look at it and its pretty heavy to try and ship anywhere. I feel like I've already put too much money into it. Not sure if I should just trash it and buy something else. And I'm unsure if the Neato brand is what I'll go with again.",

No answer yet. Now the second unit is asking me to constantly reset the battery charge period. I have a bad feeling about this one too. But hey, when they work, it's great.",

I have had this for a while, and didn't use it for some time, now the battery is completely dead, and there is no way to get it fixed without spending a gazillion dollars again. No thank you sir.

Since he was out of warranty (by 1 month--isn't that usually the case?), I could ship him back to the company (for $79 to get a repair estimate, + $50 UPS shipping,) which I did. The repair people said his laser guidance system wasn't working properly, and that's the part that frequently malfunctions...and that he was unrepairable. Sorry! Wow! Never again Neato.

I will call the 'help' line as I'm sure there is a solution to this. It picks up everything in its path and easily goes from carpet to wood floor with no problem.

Works great and has been reliable for the year I've had it so far. I did run into some initial issues with it getting stuck but they were due to obstructions, such as the fabric underneath the couch hanging too low and covering the laser (fixed by raising up/tightening up the fabric). When obstructions are clear, it works perfectly. When obstructions are present, it works about 60% of the time. Just make sure obstructions are clear and you will be fine. Great product.

And like a toddler, Larry is susceptible to swallowing and choking on things that I work around when I'm vacuuming (e.g. phone charger cables). Unlike a toddler (and me), Larry is very thorough (I guess the silver lining to redundancy). Almost a year in, he's able to work for at least 20 minutes at a time before needing a recharge.

I would not buy this if you have a cluttered room because it is going to constantly be trying to go around things and the battery will die quickly.",

Neato keeps the cat fur and dust to a minimum. She is so short she can get all the way under sofas and beds. I love to watch her work - and try to keep things out of her way.",

I was expecting to come home to a dog free house, I walk in the door and guess what, they were still there. And the cat, dont even get me started, this thing is way to slow to even consider vacuuming up a cat. After about a year of use the battery is finally dead.",

At first it took several sessions to complete a cleaning because of the small dust bin (and three shedding pets!), but after its several overall vacuumings, it can pretty much do the house in two sessions.

    "description": "AMAZON.COM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNEATO XV-21 PET & ALLERGY AUTOMATIC VACUUM CLEANER\nDesigned especially for pet owners and allergy sufferers! \n\nThe Neato XV-21 takes automatic vacuuming to a brand new level. Whether your floors are carpet, wood, tile, or vinyl, the XV-21 is ready to take on the task of keeping your floors neat and clean. \n\nThe XV-21 features a special bristled brush that enables the pick-up of tough pet hair, dander and fibers, and the Pet and Allergy Filter boosts airflow and suction power and picks up and retains more than three times the amount of fine dust particles of standard filters. \n\nCome home to that \u201cjust cleaned\u201d look: Easy to set up for daily cleaning \u2013 scans the room and automatically vacuums for you in an efficient back and forth pattern. Set it up to clean as often as you wish \u2013 even daily! \n\nKeep your home healthy, Reduces allergens and picks up pet hair. Unique Pet and Allergy Brush: Bristle Brush easily picks up pet hair; Runs quietly, especially on hard floors. Special Pet and Allergy Filter: Super-high airflow and suction power; Picks up and retains fine dust particles. Cleans Like You Do: Vacuums in methodical back-and-forth pattern; Vacuums close to walls and corners; Carefully cleans around obstacles and under furniture. Easy, Automatic Operation: Large, bagless dirt bin, it\u2019s easy to empty and clean; Automatically adjusts between carpets and hard floors; Automatically returns to base to recharge. \n\nBringing Next Generation Intelligence to Robotic Vacuum Cleaners: RPS Technology\u2122, Laser-based Vision & Room Mapping: The Neato XV-21 is equipped with onboard Room Positioning System (RPS) technology, a revolutionary system developed by Neato Robotics that combines laser vision with mapping. \n\nWith RPS technology, the robot uses its laser to see its surroundings and create accurate maps of areas to be cleaned \u2013 including furniture, objects and doorways. The robot constantly updates its map of the room, so if a new object is added into the room during a cleaning run, the robot will add it to the map. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIRST TIME USE\nPlace your robot vacuum on the charge base for its initial charge. Neato is ready to clean when the status light turns solid green. Charge the batteries overnight before you use your Neato XV-21 for the first time. After that, run through three complete cycles of charging and cleaning-until-recharge to get the most capacity from your batteries. \n\nHOW DO I GET THE MOST FROM MY NEATO XV-21 BATTERY?\nYou can recalibrate your Neato robot\u2019s batteries to improve capacity and lengthen runtime between charges. You may need to recalibrate the batteries in these situations: \n\n * The robot is new \n *  The batteries are new \n *  You updated the software \n *  Your cleaning area expanded \n * \n * \n * Follow the steps below to recalibrate the battery:\n * \n * \n * 1. Turn off any scheduled cleaning and confirm the robot's ON/OFF switch is ON.\n * 2. Reset the batteries by going to MENU->SUPPORT->NEW BATTERIES. \n * 3. Place the Neato robot on its charge base over night to ensure a full charge. \n * 4. Run the robot until it finishes cleaning the maximum area you ever want it to clean (i.e. the entire house), or until the robot displays \u201cBattery Low\u201d on its display and needs to recharge. \n * 5. Dock the robot on its charge base for a full charge, until the status light turns solid green.\n * 6. Run the robot as usual until it needs to recharge again.\n * 7. If the runtime improves to longer than 40 minutes, the batteries have been recalibrated.
