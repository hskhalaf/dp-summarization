They even sent extra parts (extra grooming loop and bolts). The electric lift is smooth and quiet. It does not disturb the dogs when I raise them up or down. I love my table so much and I am thrilled with the purchase! I am a professional groomer and this is my first electric table. I wanted to stay under $400 for my first electric table, but also didn't want to sacrifice quality. I am very pleased with the quality, noise level, adjustable height, and price!",

Only issue is wish it went down farther because as my dog ages he can not jump as high to get on the table and as I age can not pick my dog up. Mickey does not mind the rising and lowering at all, and is very comfortable on the table top. I do use a soft bed when just brushing and some trimming, then remove it and have him stand for the rest. I will always have a canine companion in my life, and this will help make it better for both of us.",

This is the deal, we lower it and have the dog jump up on it, then we lift her up to the height we need and it has made grooming the dogs so much easier, faster and better on the back. We thought at first a little expensive, but now having it, worth the money. It is well made and would be considered commercial grade to me.",

Table arrived in perfect condition. I went to Lowes and purchased four 2 inch threaded screw type locking casters which fit the legs perfectly. Table is so easy to move around now. Table is very, very well made from top to bottom. Motor runs very smooth with no jerky motion going up or down. And very quiet also. The table top corners are semi rounded so you don,t get hip bruises on yourself while grooming. Bolts are all stainless steel . Arm is a nice addition. All in all a ten star table",
