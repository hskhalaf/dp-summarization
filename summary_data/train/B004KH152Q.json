No problems with the instructions - it takes around 30 - 45 minutes to assemble them (based on your skills). A small step stool is helpful, but not needed (you can tilt the heater to assemble the top pieces).",

Once the unit is ignited , the heat distribution is minimal, but after 10 minutes you can feel the heat 8 to 10 feet away. This unit looks better and heats much better then the traditional patio heater. I guess i lucked out because my unit is amazing, i plan on buying two more. Dwayne NY",

It keeps looking nice while my original one is all rusty now. Holds up to a pretty good wind too. I've had several of the round bottomed ones blow over which really messes up the top, not to mention bending the long tube. This one doesn't seem to blow over and I live in a pretty windy place.",

It does give off heater better than I expected but to enjoy it you must stay within four or so feet of the heater. This was my experience and your mileage may vary.",

It does not heat up a big space unless you stand next to it but does add ambiance and lights up the entire backyard like a campfire. I think the triangular shape is more stable than rectangular as it stands like a tripod. With a gas tank installed the base becomes more firm with two coasters for moving around. It is also easy to light with an electric battery ignition switch.",
