The camera powers up quickly, zooms in and out quickly and snaps shot after shot with only a very brief pause between photos. Being 8 megapixel, it takes nice photos. We also like the large LCD display. The camera easily fits into a shirt or pant pocket and is very light. The display is bright, but not as bright as our last camera and thus why we did not give the camera a perfect 5 stars. Overall we are very pleased with the features and performance especially at the $200 pricepoint.",
