It has a seal on the infuser insert and on the cap so it's leak proof which is fantastic. I love the tick marks on the side to let you know when to drink and how much. The rose gold is more of a pink, but it's cute. I like the sleeve included but I prefer to see the fruit! It looks so cool. I signed up on the website and got the ebook with some great infuser ideas.

The problem was the infuser slits are so large that the mint leaves would get into the main part of the bottle. And that is the worst feeling to be drinking and a piece of wet, breaking down leaf get in your mouth. I ended up sending it back and got a infuser bottle with small slits so the leaves don't slide out even as they break down.",

The loop on the lid allows for an easy carry with your fingers if juggling other items, the grip is located in a comfortable place, the infuser portion is large and removable so you can use it as a standard water bottle, and it has a timeline goal along the side to motivate hydration. Unlike some other infuser bottles, this one is very easy to remove and clean due to the top lid portion screwing on/off with little tabs to pinch when removing. Highly recommend and it's great with mint and berries!",

      "text": "My water is so delicious now. I easily drink 60 ounces a day, which I don't know if I've ever done in my life. My favorite item to infuse is fresh cucumber slices. I also love pineapples. I've used blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, and oranges. All are delicious. I've also added freshly sliced ginger root, although that sometimes slips out. Nothing else ever leaks, though. It's easy to use, comfortable in your hand, fits in cup holders, and attractive (I got the berry color). Highly recommend!",

      "text": "The bottle & lid work well together, and I like the grip center. However, the water bottle (lid) leaks WHEN/IF the infuser is in place because the infuser cap is slightly higher than it should. So, when the infuser is in place, the lid for the water bottle does not screw on securely (resulting in leakage). Additionally, the insulating sleeve that comes with the water bottle is difficult to maneuver, resulting in a 'lumpy' fit on the bottom and in the center. I do like the product, but I'm disappointed in the infuser 'fit'.",

Furthermore, the fruit infuser makes the drinking more exciting and also refreshing. The bottle has a good closure which insures it doesn't drip when carried around, and a comfortable grip on the two sides to easily hold it with bare fingers.",

Two things I wish were different - I like the cozy that comes with it but it covers up the hourly reminders. Also, there is an error on the hourly reminders. The hours go from 8 - 9 - 10 - 11 am and the next line should read 12 p.m. but it reads 12 A.M. instead.",

To be perfectly honest, that was the one thing that was making me hesitate to buy it. You may want to change that. Just to be as accurate as possible !! Thank you for an awesome product overall.",

Today I added frozen strawberries and blueberries after leaving it in the frig through the night so I could grab it on my way to work. YUM!
