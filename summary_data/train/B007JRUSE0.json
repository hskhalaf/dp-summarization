After about 3 uses the right side wouldn't always start on pushing the handle down, took several tries. Now today neither side will start. The only thing good about this toaster is the retractable cord. I live down in Mexico and it's not worth my time and hassle to send it back. Bought this because it was an Amazon Best Buy. Should have listened to the negative reviews.",

Everything about this toaster is wrong. The four slots for the bread are too small for regular sliced bread, toasting level is laughably random, so sometimes it burns your toast and sometimes it warms them up..... nicely!",

      "text": "We got this like new from warehouse deals for a pretty good price and it works just fine. The heat is distributed equally to all 8 sides of the toast/bread. The only thing what would be a bit better if the crumb tray could be pulled from the front and not back, but it's not a big issue. It also toasts bagels very well. With our toaster I can suggest to start with turning the buttons to half the way so it will not burn the toast. Higher setting will burn it. My wife fell in love with the toaster.",

It looks great on the counter. Our last one only lasted about a year with the high usage so we were nervous about buying one a little more than the cheaper models but it has proven to be well invested money and we have not had a single issue with it. I think it would even make a nice house warming present for someone or a birthday present for that bagel lover in your life.",

The toast burns and often doesn't pop up in time and toasts unevenly. (case in point--fire alarm just went off when setting was at five for a piece of toast).",
