For the price this has the most poweful motor at 1500+Watts. The only thing that is a little uncertain is the warranty period. The owners manual makes no mention of a time period and the seller mentioned a 7 year warranty. I will look into this with the seller to see if they can send me a confirmation.",

Load Jar -> Press (single!) Button -> Wait 180sec. -> Eat. Tho, while everything is available online, of course; but, I\u2019d wish the instructions were more, er, instructive for my particular model.",

The Blendtec tackles everything I've ever given it and is easy to clean and maintain, and takes up only a small portion of my counter top. I hear the concerns about the jar not being glass, and the plastic definitely corrodes over time, but I think I prefer the lightness and durability of the plastic. I definitely land on the Blendtec side of blender wars!",

    "description": "Color:FourSide Jar Black| Style:Blender\n\nLet\u2019s talk about time for a moment, it\u2019s the one thing in life that is given equally to everyone. Regardless of our circumstances, jobs, or family commitments we all have exactly 24 hours to use each day. Time is precious and fleeting. It will not wait for any of us to use it up or share with others.\n\nCooking meals and cleaning dishes takes effort and a lot of time. Day-after-day meals need to be made, and then the cleanup begins. It\u2019s a necessary part of life. Blendtec blenders significantly reduce meal prep time and cleanup. When you buy a Blendtec blender you\u2019re not only buying the world\u2019s most advanced blender, you\u2019re also buying yourself more time.\n\nHow can a blender give you more time? It comes down to technology and design.\n\nOur advanced technology and jar design create a vortex, which pulls food towards the blade instead of pushing it to the sides of the jar like our competitors. With Blendtec jars, you won\u2019t waste time tending your blends with a tamper to get all the ingredients down into the blades, and no tamper means one less thing to clean when you\u2019re done.\n\nBlendtec blenders can also heat your food during the blend cycle. For instance, if you want soup for dinner, a Blendtec blender can blend it up and heat it up at the same time so it\u2019s ready to serve straight from the blender jar. No need to heat your soup in a pan. Can your old blender do that? No pan and no additional heating time means less cleanup.\n\nNot only can Blendtec blenders heat your food, they can also make ice cream. Actual ice cream can be made with the exact same blender that makes soup.\n\nDrinks, appetizers, main courses, and desserts can all be made with the same blender using the same jar. The time it takes to make each course could be measured in seconds not minutes or hours. Cleanup for an entire multi-course meal could be as simple as pushing the pre-programmed, self-cleaning button to wash a single jar, and just like that, you\u2019ll be done.\n\nThere is a reason that having the world's most technologically advanced blender is worth every penny, it gives you more time to focus on life and the people who matter to you.\n\nIlluminated LCD timer displays remaining time on blends.10 incremental speeds + Pulse",
