      "text": "Bought a new Dell Inspiron 5570 and this cable lock. When I tried to install it onto my Dell it did not fit. It is about 1/16\" too wide. Turns out Dell now uses a smaller locking port on some, if not all, of their laptops. This is Dells fault, and mine for not researching this issue before hand. Lesson learned. For my model laptop only the Nobel Lock TZ18T or Kensington N17 will work. Hope this helps someone from making the same mistake as I did. Regarding the lock, it is a solid looking and feeling cable and lock. 4 out of 5 stars for not posting some kind of compatibility statement regarding Dell Laptops.",

On security, it does the trick in a very simple, easy to use way. Sure, anyone with a mini bolt cutter could cut right through this, but for deterrence value, it's perfect. The cable length is perfect for locking to a table leg or locking loop (my library has them built in to study carrels). The cable is flexible enough that you can move the computer easily without having to touch the cable, but stiff enough that it doesn't look like you could break it without tools.",

But then with the right tool, the cable could be cut as well, so this device is really more of a deterrent than absolute protection against all efforts to break it. I use it to chain my laptop to the table during trade shows, and for such a purpose it is perfect.",

The presentation of this product is one of my favorite attributes. It doesn't just come in plastic, it comes in a nice little box with a silver/gray sleeve that has the manufacturer's name on it. I would definitely recommend this product!",
