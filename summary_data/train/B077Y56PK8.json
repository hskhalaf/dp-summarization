Many of the recipes fall between 7-12 grams of carbs per serving which IMO is kind of high considering most people eat at least 3 meals a day and you MUST keep your carb intake under 20 grams to maintain ketosis. Also, most people do keto for weight loss. This book has many recipes that are 700+ calories per meal not making it ideal for a calorie deficit on a 3+ meal a day plan.",

Most Keto cookbooks call for tons of ingredients that can become overwhelming when putting together your shopping list. The things I love most about this book are the recipes are delicious, the ingredients are simple, and each recipe is designed for two servings. I also love the \u201csubstitute\u201d section under each recipe. Thank you so much, Jen Fisch, for putting the joy back into cooking!",

This cookbook is loaded with simple recipes for busy week nights. As with all cookbooks, every recipe isn't right for me. I skip the tomato and cheesy recipes because of food allergies, but there's still lots to work with.",

Nice photos of prepared recipes, great for people to actually see what the dish should look like. Most are super simple, which is wonderful for a busy single dad like my son. He tends to eat the same meals over and over again, so I bought this to give him some ideas about meal possibilities, Now I want one for myself as I start on my own keto journey.",

In my opinion/experience, that's just the way it is with most cookbooks.",
