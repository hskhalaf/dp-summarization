I could see this lasting 4-5 years which at the price paid isn\u2019t too bad.like many Chinese made items , the assembly instructions are not ideal. You need to make sure the 4 legs are assembled in proper direction, so you able to attach shelves to outside later in process( holes for shelf facing out).everthing else went togeather well . Big issue is packing . Many areas were paint is chipped from lack of protective packing material you will most likely need to touch up many areas with black paint to prevent rust.",

As can be seen in the pictures the cross supports are already rusted and falling out. The fabric is not UV protected and fades FAST. See the color difference in the pictures. I live in the Midwest and I don't get blazing sun every day. No stainless steel on this thing at all. So it will eventually rust away. For the price I guess I expected it to last more than once season. Maybe 2. But It looks like it'll last season and that's it. Will not buy again.",
