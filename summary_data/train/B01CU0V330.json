I\u2019ve added them in their Easter basket hiding them in the eggs and it was fun to open each egg and see which bird is inside it. I bought both sets A and B and they are nice. We didn\u2019t use the recent thingy and arrow thingy in the package, because they were made out of paper and were so hard to pull off the white plastic holder that they ripped, so we only used the toys. You can see them in my hand how small they are.",
