I find it easier to take pictures of people when they aren't intimidated by a bigger camera. This is fun and easy to use and the touch screen is great. It has a lot of amazing features, too. My only complaint is that I would like a hard copy of the instruction manual instead of on a CD. I like to browse through it at my leisure.",

I purchased this one because I can use my memory card and batteries from my old camera and the carrying case (I should have left my old camera in the case instead of tossing into center arm rest and crushing it). The Nikon fits nicely in my pocket to take unposed interesting pictures of family and places of interest. The touch screen makes it very simple to view pictures after they are taken.

The camera erased pictures from the memory card, the lens would stick frequently, the zoom causes the camera to shut-off and brings up a 'lens-error'. I know that Nikon is a name brand, but their customer service is terrible. I would discourage anyone from buying this camera. My daughter is saving her money for a Cannon.",

It takes great pictures, even when you have to zoom. I have had problems in the apst with other cameras where the flash somewhat whites out people's faces, but this flash works very well. Picture quality is very high! I love the camera and all its features!!!",

The price was very reasonable for what you get! Only negative is the zoom lens is out when reviewing pictures so you can't lay it face down.",

    "title": "Nikon Coolpix S4000 12 MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Vibration Reduction (VR) Zoom and 3.0-Inch Touch-Panel LCD (Silver)",
    "description": "Color:SilverFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n Nikon's Coolpix S4000 creates touching memories by combining 12.0 effective megapixels, 4x wide-angle Zoom-Nikkor glass lens and an amazing 3.0-inch High Resolution HVGA (460k-dot) touch-panel LCD with sensitive touch. The Coolpix S4000 also features HD (720p) movies for high quality movie recording. The Coolpix S4000, with Nikon's EXPEED image processing concept, 4-way VR Image Stabilization System and Smart Portrait System enables you to get incredible pictures, incredibly easy. Nikon's Scene Auto Selector automatically analyses the scene you are taking and adjusts the scene mode for you. All you have to do is compose, then touch! \n\n\n\nStylish design and intuitive touch-control operation over an exciting set of advanced functions for shooting and viewing \n\nIntegrating elegant design and intuitive operation, Coolpix S4000 is a stylishly slim compact camera equipped with a touch screen interface that places a variety of controls at the fingertips. The Coolpix S4000's advanced functions and delightfully compact design makes picture-taking and playback more exciting. \n\nWith a spacious 3-inch 460k-dot LCD featuring Nikon's Clear Color Display and intuitive fingertip shooting control, the Coolpix S4000 brings a new dimension of fun and visual beauty to photography. \n\nThe Coolpix S4000 offers advanced shooting features that fully utilize the touch screen. With Touch Shutter, users can select their subject by a single touch on the screen to adjust focus and exposure, and to automatically release the shutter. White Balance can also be adjusted by touch in Food mode by dragging a finger to move the slider marker. The Coolpix S4000 is also equipped with Subject Tracking, which automatically follows and focuses on a subject selected by touch. \n\nTouch control also lends a new dimension of fun to viewing and retouching images. The speed and ease of fingertip scrolling through images and instant image selection makes other forms of control pale in comparison. Then there is the supplied stylus that can be used with a variety of input, retouch and image enhancement functions. Included is the Paint Function, which enables memos, drawings, colorful borders or stamps to be added directly to images. \n\nAnother important feature of the Coolpix S4000 is its high performance imaging capabilities. 12.0 effective megapixels of sharp resolution is matched to the compositional freedom of a precision 4x zoom, Nikkor lens that ably covers focal lengths from 27-108mm (35mm format equivalent). Advanced digital image-processing faithfully reproduces fine details and subtle tones, delivers quick response, and maintains image quality and clarity when taking advantage of extended light sensitivity settings as high as ISO 3200. \n\n\n\nNikon Coolpix S4000 Feature Highlights \n\nEXPEED digital imaging technology \nNikon's smarter approach to digital imaging technology. From image capture to processing, Nikon's comprehensive EXPEED digital imaging concept encompasses the entire picture-taking operation. EXPEED is much more than a processing engine; it is a revolution in digital photography. \n\n3-inch, 460k-dot TFT LCD featuring Nikon's Clear Color Display with touch screen control \nThe 3-inch LCD featuring Clear Color Display for the Coolpix S4000 is a delight to both the eyes and the fingers. Its large size and high-resolution make picture-taking and playback more enjoyable. The screen resists fingerprints, and features anti-reflection coating for better display in bright situations. \n\n\n\n\n\nHigh-Definition movie recording \nEntertain audiences with movies that capture the impact of the scene with HD. The Coolpix S4000 can shoot up to 1.5 hours* of HD movies (720p) with sound at 30fps. \n*Recording stops automatically after 29 minutes. This figure is based on in-house testing standards and stated for recording at 25\u00b0C with a fully charged EN-EL12 battery. Actual results may vary greatly depending on factors that include differences in ambient temperature, and the amount of zoom and autofocus operations used. \n\n\n\n\n\nFour advanced image stabilizing features* help ensure sharper results Nikon's Electronic VR image stabilization compensates for the effects of camera shake. Motion Detection automatically controls shutter speed and the ISO setting to compensate for subject movement as well as camera shake. ISO 3200 capability allows faster shutter speeds when shooting in low light or capturing fast-moving subjects. And, Nikon's original BSS (Best Shot Selector) function automatically shoots a series of sequential frames and saves the one with the sharpest focus.\n* The camera selects and uses only the features required to optimize each image. \n\n\n\n\n\nIntelligent automation contributes to carefree shooting \nNikon's Scene Auto Selector eliminates the need to manually select a scene mode to match the shot, and this makes it faster and easier to capture the moment in beautiful fashion. The Coolpix S4000 uses this intelligent function to analyze the subject and its surrounding settings and automatically selects the most appropriate of the following six scene modes to achieve optimal results--Portrait, Landscape, Night Portrait, Night Landscape, Close-up, or Backlight. \n\n\n\n\n\nNikon's exclusive Smart Portrait System \nAutomatically detecting as many as 12 faces in the shot, Face-priority AF helps produce satisfying portraits by adjusting focus and exposure. Smile Timer automatically releases the shutter when the priority subject smiles and offers the Blink Proof function, which automatically shoots two sequential frames and saves the one in which the subject's eyes are open-wide. Now featuring faster processing speed, In-Camera Red-Eye Fix automatically corrects perceived red-eye effect before saving the image to memory. \n\n\n\nNikon Coolpix S4000 Other Features  * 16 scene modes for optimized shooting in various settings \n * Scene Auto Selector \n * D-Lighting \n * Auto Sort function \n * Quick Retouch \n * Approx. 45 MB of internal memory \n * USB charging via Charging AC Adapter EH-68P/EH-68P (AR) or PC \n\nWhat's in the Box  * EN-EL10 Rechargeable Li-ion Battery \n * EH-68P AC Adapter/Charger \n * UC-E6 USB Cable \n * EG-CP14 Audio Video Cable \n * AN-CP19 Strap \n * Stylus TP-1 \n * Coolpix Software Suite CD-ROM",
