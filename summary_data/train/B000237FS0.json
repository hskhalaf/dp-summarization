This should be labeled leak-resistant, leakproof is just plain misleading.",

However, when using a bain marie for cheesecake, it DOES NOT keep the water out of the pan. I continued to wrap the pan in foil. This last time, the foil leaked and got into the cake, showing me that it is not leak proof from outside fluid. I will spend the money for a solid aluminum pan or steel pan.",

Now that I have two mini-pans, I guess I could stack them and steam two in my pressure cooker at once, but the whole point in making a mini cheesecake is NOT to have that giant cheesecake calling out to be eaten (figuratively speaking).",

I have tried many other fancier brands of pans and this one hands down is just as good if not better! I especially appreciate that unlike most spring form pans, the design of this is such that there is no \"lip\" around the edge of the bottom part of the pan, so after you take the ring off, it makes serving whatever you have made a lot easier.",

The bottom of the pan is slightly elevated (I assume to make a more leakproof seal) so this takes away a little space. The same cheesecake recipes I made in the past are no longer fitting because of the size difference, but the inconvenience is minor. Other than that, I've had no issues with baking and removing cakes from it! So far, it's been leakproof as promised, but I've been using tin foil either way just to make sure.

I ordered this particular springform pan based on the \"Best Buy\" information from a much-respected tv cookery show. Maybe Nordic Ware has changed the style on this pan since this tv show's cookery book of 15 seasons of reviews was published last year.",
