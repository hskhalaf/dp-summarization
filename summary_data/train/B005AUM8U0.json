Doesn't say Oster anywhere on it, just stuffed in a small white box lots of parts with assembly required. Yet it clearly states installs in \"seconds\".

The mixed reviews lead me to believe that there may be a quality product here... If you get lucky. However, I would not waste my time again to possibly get another poor product.",
