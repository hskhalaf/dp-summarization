Nice deep slip resistant treads easily hold my size 12 feet securely. Step stool does slide slightly on smooth surfaces but won't once you put your fell weight on it. Locks into folding or climbing positions. Storage Deck has holes & slots for screwdrivers, paint brushes, & other tools. Very secure climbing! PS. USPS would not deliver it, had to pick it up @ the postal office!",

It is sturdy, really lightweight, has a clip release that opens the ladder quickly & easily. Wish I had paid up and purchased the more expensive (but well worth it) Flip-N-Lite from the beginning.

      "text": "This ladder is awesome for reaching the double-stacked kitchen cupboards in our 9' ceiling kitchen. Wide steps for stability climbing and a tray at the top to give you a spot for tools or items being put up or removed from those cupboards. It's also relatively flat when folded close - which is an easy process of lifting a handle. Plus it weighs less than 18 lbs.",

The ladder closes up so tight that I can no longer hook the ladder on to the plastic hanger that the old ladder hung on for so many years. I have not found a new way of hanging the ladder is conveniently as the old way..",

The ladder provides good support, has a good grip though it is plastic and does not have rubber on the feet so I wouldn't use this in inclement weather I've only used it indoors, and provides good height.",
