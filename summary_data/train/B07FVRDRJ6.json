The quality is pretty good too, after a few months of use I haven\u2019t had any wear and tear. While I was concerned the tops were going to disconnect from the handle because they feel a little loose, they haven\u2019t at all. They are fairly easy to clean, although some food seems to lock in that you need to really scrub out. I give 4/5 stars because the spatulas bend and cannot support the weight of some foods i.e. difficult to flip heavy burgers or pancakes.",

      "text": "I upgraded all my pots and pans and wanted new cooking utensils, too. These were cheap, well reviewed, and there were lots of them. I had low-ish expectations, but I love these! Not only do they not melt at high temperatures (something I've seen happen even with \"high temperature\" utensils), but they get all the sauce or oil off the pans. The flat spatulas are so good that they practically clean your pans when you scrape the food out. Honestly, amazing!",

      "title": "A little upsetting, update",
      "text": "I love the look. I bought these because the set has everything I needed but mainly a whisk that wouldn't rust...so when I was whisking pancakes and it fell apart I was upset. Then I used one of the spatulas and it's broken under the silicone. Besides these issues I do like the set. But now I need a new whisk since I threw my other one out. It's been less then a year and I'm looking into a better quality set. Yes these look good but now only the tongs and brush are actually usable. Everything else either came apart or to flimsy to use",

      "text": "These are great utensils, especially for the price. I have had them for a little over a month now and was able to replace all my previous untensils with them. They are holding up well. Only thing that I don't like about them is the the spatulas are too flimsy. A spatula should be stiff for flipping food.",
