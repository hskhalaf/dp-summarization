I like the concept of human grade cat food but the execution was absolutely terrible. This is disgusting to prepare and I'm certain that my cats don't like it because of the strange texture. It turns into this powdery mush. I'm sure you can develop a human grade pate\u0301. I don't understand why the formula had to be so strange and off-putting.",

They aren't as lethargic (indoor cats!), their coats are shinier, and their moods have even improved! It is WORTH IT to feed your furry family the right stuff! You wouldn't want to eat McDonald's every day of your life, would you? That's basically our equivalent of all the chain-store crap they sell us for our animals!",

Her calcium levels are normal and she is back to her healthy self! I wish I had before and after pictures for you. Her fur grew back and she now has a luxurious coat, in addition to becoming playful and happy again. This is a great food! Thanks!",

    "title": "The Honest Kitchen Human Grade Dehydrated Grain Free Cat Food",
    "description": "Style:Free Range Chicken| Size:4 lb (makes 12 lbs)\n\nABOUT PROWL DEHYDRATED CAT FOOD:\n\nDished up with 70% free-range chicken, Prowl is the original cat\u2019s meow for adult and senior kitties, who don\u2019t dig grains. It\u2019s a less processed, high moisture alternative to canned food, and it\u2019s bursting with natural whole food goodness.\n\nThe Honest Kitchen Prowl is a dehydrated cat food that is AAFCO complete and balanced for adult cats of all breeds. This dehydrated cat food is high in moisture and can be used in place of homemade or canned cat food diets.\n\nThis cat food is 100% human-grade cat food (an important quality distinction!) and contains no red flag pet food ingredients like corn, soy, rice, beet pulp or wheat. Just add warm water, wait 3 minutes and serve a delicious & healthy meal!\n\nABOUT THE HONEST KITCHEN:\n\nThe Honest Kitchen started in Lucy Postin\u2019s kitchen in 2002 when she started making her dog\u2019s meals from scratch to help combat his ear infections. The physical difference from his new diet was spectacular but her kitchen was a mess.\n\nLucy then realized that dehydrating whole foods made mealtimes much simpler while maintaining the natural health benefits of the ingredients. From there, The Honest Kitchen was born - and her kitchen stayed much cleaner!\n\nToday, The Honest Kitchen is on a mission to revolutionize the pet food industry through their obsession with product integrity and commitment to help as many pets as possible get on the road to good health through natural, wholesome proper food.\n\nFeeding Instructions\n\nWeight Daily Feeding (cup) 1 - 5 lbs 1/8 - 1/4 6 - 10 lbs 1/4 - 1/2 11 - 16 lbs 1/2 - 3/4 17 - 21 lbs 3/4 - 1 Mix food with warm water, stir well and wait 3 minutes for food to hydrate. These guidelines are based on the requirements of lean and more active, indoor/outdoor cats. For less active cats, we recommend feeding slightly less. For larger cats, adjust accordingly. Our foods must be hydrated with water before serving, but you can add slightly more or less water than we suggest, according to your pet's taste. Refrigerate or discard any leftovers.\n\nTransition Instructions If your dog has never tried our foods before, we recommend starting out slowly. Over a period of 1 to 2 weeks or so, start by adding just a small amount of the Honest Kitchen (with water added) into your dog\u2019s current meals. Gradually increase the amount of the Honest Kitchen while decreasing the amount of your dog\u2019s original diet.\n\nThe Honest Kitchen may be mixed in with your dog\u2019s current dry kibble, canned, raw, etc. However, we do not suggest adding in other extra ingredients during the transition if you can avoid it, especially if your pup\u2019s system is very sensitive. After you\u2019ve successfully transitioned your dog to the new food, perhaps after 2-4 weeks or so, and they are doing well, then you may consider adding in extra ingredients or introducing another honest kitchen recipe, etc.",
