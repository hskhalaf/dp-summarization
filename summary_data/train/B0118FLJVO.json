I will most likely put an orthotic insert in the shoes if I plan to do a great deal of walking. The shoe is extremely light and stretchy. It will look good with skinny jeans and leggings because it isn't too bulky like some fashion sneakers. Highly recommend.",

      "text": "I have horrible bunions and was looking for a substantial shoe that could accommodate my foot issues. These Propet brand are wonderful!! The soft shoe allows for bunion comfort and I added a new insole for my flat feet. You wouldn\u2019t need to do that if your feet are normal. The wide width is a blessing and my feet are very happy!!",

They are light as a feather and you can see they are very well made. There is sufficient arch support too. I honestly did not have to \"break\" them in at all and have been wearing them daily since they arrived. I will continue to purchase my shoes from Propet from now on. I am more than happy with the Propet Women's Travelactiv Fashion Sneaker. I would highly recommend buying this shoe for the comfort factor alone.",
