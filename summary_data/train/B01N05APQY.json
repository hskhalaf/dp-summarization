Even though their flavor names aren't completely transparent, the intensity level makes it easy to see that Odacio is a medium intensity right in between Stormio and Melozio.",

The only problem i will face after the shelter in place is over, is refusing to socialize at coffee shops when i can recreate an amazing cup of coffee for a portion of the price :))",
