They are comfortable but the quality has slipped. I don't think the rubber should crack after four years and making them rather useless in snow/sleet etc, the usual weather we get here in Maine. Especially when 10 months a year they are in a heated dark closet. Not sure what other boot to recommend instead, maybe Bogs.",

The boots fit just great and seem exactly like my old ones. They are made in Vietnam. The tread has awesome traction. I just wish I had bought these earlier.",

They exceed other similar boots due to their use of D rings for laces which allows easy tight lacing as opposed to lacing with eyelets. Gusset on top is too narrow and must be slit about 2 inches to enable boot to be easily put on with ski socks. Otherwise boots fit as sized. Since Sorel was purchased by Columbia Sportswear the Sorel/Columbia boots have more narrow gusset than when Sorel was independent; apparently a creeping modification.

The only problem I see is if you get enough snow to go over the top of the boots and it gets inside. But the removable insert makes drying it really easy.",
