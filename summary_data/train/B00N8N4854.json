The top of the screen does not ever work, I have to switch to land scape view every time in need to select something at the top of the screen. IE quick settings or contacts.

      "text": "Got this like a week ago. I bought the XPERIA Z3 6603 and works perfectly with ATT and gets LTE. No bloatware or anything from Tmobile like I've read in other reviews. First thing it did when i turned it on was download the new version of android (lollipop) so that was awesome. Love it! Everybody asks about my phone. Plus i added a 64 sd to it. Only bad thing is that they don't add the plug in adapter for the charger. It comes with the international one that doesn't work in the states. It came with a screen protector and one for the backside as well.",

It is lacking a fingerprint sensor and wireless charging, but does have the magnetic charger. Great sound, great screen, water resistant, excellent camera, decent battery life. If it had the fingerprint and wireless charging option it would be the best phone for the price on the market, hands down. In fact, it might just be the best phone for the money still...only rival might be the Sony Xperia Z3 compact available on that big auction site competitor for about $150 delivered.",

They gave me one more OTG cable. 4G work in usa. It's not any carrier network's logo and preloaded apps phone. Because I've got wrong with another two seller before. They sold vodafone version. But they have good communication and refund my money. I've spend extra money for two times return ship. So, choose my suggestion if you want to buy this phone. I don't want to talk about this phone any more. Because I'm sony crazy. This phone is excellent by the price.",

      "text": "I am writing this review having returned the product. Incidentally, worth mentioning how absolutely fabulous Amazon were. The phone factory reset itself twice losing me valuable data. It turns out that this is a known issue and as such frankly the product is not fit for purpose. I did contact Sony direct who were worse than useless in that they denied there was any such issue even after I had supplied them with internet threads setting out the number of people experiencing the same issue. Should anyone from Sony read this - please be assured you have lost a consumer completely, I will never buy another one of your products.",

      "text": "After being with Apple for 8 years, I decided to make the switch over to Android. At first, it's all very daunting. But the more time you spend with it, the more you start to like it. The screen is amazing and there are plenty of different ways to customise the phone to your taste. The best thing for me though, is the fact that it's a sub 5\" phone that fits perfectly in your hand, and doesn't compromise it's features, speed, or power, too much. I would definitely recommend this phone to others.",

No, I'd definitely go for a different phone that Sony still makes android updates for and doesn't try to melt itself while you use it.",

It's really fast, waterproof, a great size to hold an use and the preloaded Sony music software genuinely improves the sound - even when used with Google Play Music. And the battery life is fantastic - the first phone I've owned that can be used as a satnav for a normal journey without needing to be charged by the time you arrive at the other end. My only complaint is that Sony could have been less tight and included a magnetic charging connector for their clever charging port - but you can easily buy these on Amazon for \u00a310.",

However the glass used on the screen is very very fragile, and there are many reports of fractures without cause over the web. I am currently in the return/repair process myself and hope to have it fixed as a manufacturing defect as there has been no impact or drop to cause this. Sony have admitted this issue on previous phones like the Z1 but currently claim there is no issue on the Z3/C but reports on the web say otherwise.",

The same goes for my review of the Z3 Compact tablet...it's upgradeable to Lollipop and hopefully Sony will keep updating it. It's also nice to get such a powerful compact phone, most manufacturers lower the spec of everything, with Sony it's just the screen size. Again: - Very fast, smooth - Great screen - microSD card slot Negatives - A bit slippy with being glass on both sides - Sony apps are uninstallable But highly recommended if you like your phones this size :)",
