Amazing! The cheaper fans will quit in a few days, and I threw three of those away before I tried one of these. The air kings move a noticeably larger amount of air, too. They are larger than a cheapo box fan but still much more efficiently shaped and easily to deal with (logistically speaking) than a fan with a separate base. Do yourself a favor and splurge on a decent box fan.",
