Blows my dang mind, even the TV's speakers are better than expected, bass is noticable. The apps and Roku function very smoothly. I would highly suggest anyone that loves movies or games (or BOTH) to get this TV! Great price for supreme value!!",

Blacks are black, subtle contrast is visible, gamma is acceptable, and colors render great. The only critical adjustment is to turn the sharpness down to 20 to get rid of fringing on fine details. Most 4k monitors are small enough that you have to scale up the fonts to work, which cuts into the advantage of the increased resolution.

My biggest problem is a scanning bar that slowly rises from the middle to the top of the screen when using HDMI. I was informed it is a problem that cannot be fixed, and it started happening right after the 1 year warranty ended, of course. Also, it isn\u2019t really 120 hz, it is 60 hz using tricks to appear 120 hz. You get what you pay for. This brand is trash and I\u2019ll never buy it again.",

Of course you can physically connect a soundbar but there's no way to do wireless speakers with this device as far as I can tell. Obviously just a proprietary trick to make us buy Roku speakers from them but what's the point if you can't buy the speakers.",

I have used 3 different flash drives and the live pause feature continues to be \"just plain flaky\"!

Audio gives you lots of options, and although you're not going to get good bass or full-range sound out of the built-in speakers, you will definitely be impressed with the option to highlight speech (makes it easier to hear dialogue at low volume while the kids are asleep even with other stuff happening in the picture).",

I don't need top of the line TV. I had the other TCL for 7 years and it began to have black lines through it.

And that is when we discovered this is a common problem and there really is no easy fix.

      "text": "Purchased as a Black Friday promotion. Shipment was approximately 1 week beyond the initial promise. My first TV in 6 years and the upgraded, double boxed, shipping is a step up. This initially seems to be a very good value. The picture quality is exceptional and the integrated Roku application works great. Easy setup for antenna, satellite and internet inputs. Synced perfectly with my existing Roku account. The ultimate test of the set will be it's long term durability, but I am initially quite impressed.",
