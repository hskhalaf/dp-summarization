Another strange thing is the protector that is shown in the photo is clear, but the one that came with it is an even darker bronze color that doesn\u2019t match the watch, or the attachment bars on the band, I wasn\u2019t planning on using it anyways so it doesn\u2019t hurt my opinion of the band, it was just strange.",

I have freakishly small wrists (wish the rest of me was as small) and sometimes it is hard to find watch bands that fit me well. This band has two individual straps that hold the excess so I don't have a problem with this coming loose or getting bent backwards. The fact that the band is thinner than most fits my wrist really well and the bumper that was included free is very attractive and will protect my watch very well. I will definitely repurchase!",

The leather band is lightweight, slim, delicate and overall looks great! If you have a very small wrist (as I do) overtime the band will eventually stretch due to wear. You may find yourself wearing the band on the last holes. The long watch bands might become annoying overtime. Offering the band in a S/M and L/XL size would be great.",

I have sensitive skin, and I haven't had an issue with these. I also have small wrists, and it fits perfectly. There's an adjustable band holder thing to keep the band from sticking out.

These bands improve upon that immensely. I am really enjoying this new slimmer band-classic-and the color is a true navy (dark, dark blue). My other bands have gotten softer over time but kept their shape with no fraying of the stitching. Love them!",

I took off a star for durability only bc the holes are a little worn, but I do take it off to shower and go to bed... so I take it off/put back in a lot. I will definitely purchase again",

The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is because I do not wear it everyday, however, I have noticed the strap is starting to rip and it is digging into mg wrist, creating a sore. ): Kinda sucks that it only lasted 3 weeks but the bumper is still holding up strong.",

If you notice, the protective silicone case that comes with this color of band is shown as clear, which is partly the reason why I chose this band. When I received it I was slightly disappointed, though, ONLY because a rose gold silicone protector came with the watch band instead of a clear protector. I quickly emailed the seller (information on the cute little card inside the packaging) and explained the situation and without hesitation, the company went into action and corrected the error immediately! Thank you so much, WFEAGL. It\u2019s perfect! Totally recommend",
