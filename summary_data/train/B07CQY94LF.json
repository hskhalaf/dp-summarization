Without a pen, the wallet held everything pretty good. But once I put in a pen, it becomes a little difficult to close the wallet but it still closes though.",

Even the two outside buttons have individual leather covers. I only hope the stitching and buttons can hold up as long as the leather after several years. Definitely recommend.",
