There isn't much arch support for high arched people, but I wear aftermarket insoles in most of my shoes. The soles wear very well on hard surfaces and protect your feet and body well which is the only thing that counts when you're out there running to get some good exercise.",

I owned this shoe for a few weeks and racked up some miles upon them and so far so good. They are light and comfortable to wear. I recommend them.",

I walk a lot and its still have a good tread, same level of comfort it had when I bought.

I tried tying and lacing them different ways but no matter what I did, my heel kept sliding out of the shoe. Plus, all the cushion they brag abbot in the description is in the heel of the shoe as well. Not a lot of mid foot cushion. I'm definitely sending these back.",

      "text": "Feels like high quality materials. Shoe laces are nice...a bit stretchy. Feels pretty stable and is on the higher end of cushioned. Its not a particularly light shoe, but if that means it is well constructed with materials that last, I'll take that over a light shoe that wears out to quickly. We'll see how they last. Update: I've been wearing these shoes all summer. I walk 4 to 6 miles a day since I have a German Shepherd in his prime in need of lots of exercise. Shoes are extremely durable. Still look like new. I have purchased 2 more pairs on sale. One to get a different color and one for when these eventually wear out.",
