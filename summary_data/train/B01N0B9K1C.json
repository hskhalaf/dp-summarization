I tried the 13 4 e and it was too big. So until Brooks makes a wider toe box I'm going to switch to New Balance. I've been a Brooks addiction & beast customer for years. Both shoes are now too narrow in the toe box .even in the wider sizes. Too bad, they used to make a really nice comfortable shoe for people with wider feet and a few foot problems.

I should have returned them, but I was hoping the squeaking issue would have gone away as I broke them in. Nope!!! Now I am stuck with squeaky shoes :(",
