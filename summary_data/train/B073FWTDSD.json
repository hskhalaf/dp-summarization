Fit is nice in workout and regular pants alike.. they love the added \u201cmiddle\u201d support and no it doesn\u2019t cut into them like some thicker bands will.. classic colors. I always wash with bra/panty/sock load and just hang them to dry.. (it takes just minutes to do so!) Ha! Then, you never worry about them tangling up in dryer that way and elastic lasts forever without the heat!",
