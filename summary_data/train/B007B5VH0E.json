I wish the directory would list alphabetically, but once you find the number, you just lift the cradle and it dials the number. Although the display window is adjustable, I am not happy with the contrast- not as pictured and not that easy to see.

I found this wall/desk phone with a large caller ID display for about the same price .I decided to replace my present wall phone. I'm delighted. Easy to program, though I did download the detailed manual from their website. Amazing features at an unbelievable price. By the way always keep one phone hard wired.

Our other LC4940 was able to tilt and lock at certain angles (until the tilt function broke after a year's use), but this replacement unit simply lays flat at all times. We will probably end up putting a piece of wood to hold up the display, but we should have to do such a thing; it should have came working right out of the box.",

If you are screening your calls you must listen to yourself and then the received message. That. to me, defeats half the usability of an answering machine. The optimal is when you turn off the ringer (easily done) and only know someone is calling when they leave a message, which you can immediately answer by either using the speaker phone or by picking up the hand set. This one doesn't have the option of silencing the announcement. Other than that it works fine.",
