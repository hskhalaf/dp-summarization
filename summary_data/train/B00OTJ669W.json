Please don\u2019t forget to lay on a towel while floating because the float does get hot and the sweat pours off you. Great float and would work as an air mattress. It\u2019s huge. Love it!!!!",

The plastic that it is made of seems tough and thick and the bottom is made of another material that seems particularly durable. The only part of the float that is difficult is the canopy. It is hard to get it together and difficult without two people to attach it to the float. The canopy also will not fold down, so if you don't want it up you will have to remove it. We have enjoyed it so far though and are looking forward to using it all summer.",

Wasted multiple days filling this thing and then using leak finder to find out that the SEAM didn't hold properly( and there were multiple small tears as well). So I'm out $80, my girlfriend's present sucked, and I wasted way too much time trying to fix something that should work out of box. Intex has been absolutely no help.

But the canopy acted like a sail and kept pushing us into the banks. Got quite a workout having to continuously paddle- not at all relaxing. (Paddles are a must!)

      "text": "Best purchase of the year. Took this baby to the lake and laid out all day on it. AMAZING! There was room for me someone else if needed. The shade was a pain to put on but once it was on it was worth it. Tied off a floating cooler to it so no need to have things up with me. You do sit up off the water pretty high so to get wet you have to bend over the side. It is very sturdy and you won't feel as though you will tip over. Its made of good material. Would totally purchase again.",

      "text": "Living in Florida visiting the local sandbar is just what we do every weekend. Bought this float for the ladies to relax and stay cool in the shade. Yet, our float arrived missing one of the canopy connection points and the one it did have was flipped upside down. Guess someone fell asleep at intex and didn\u2019t even perform a quality check on it. Was extremely disappointed after spending 20 inflating it and another 10 minutes assembling the \u201ctent\u201d style canopy that it couldn\u2019t be used. I will say it is a great size. Very comfortable, but needed the canopy. I\u2019ll give an update once it\u2019s exchanged.",

There is so much room even with all of us on the raft. The canopy acts like a \"SAIL\" so we literally float around the pool. Dogs LOVE it! Enjoy! Highly recommend. I just ordered an outdoor 5 ft rug that will fit perfectly on top instead of the blankets/ towels which slip around. I will post a pic with the rug once it arrives! Looking forward to great floats with dogs, music, and a glass of wine on board!",

After 2 days that nice rounded look is gone and it has all sorts of odd angles requiring you to take it apart and fix for fear of punctures.",

I am 62 years and have Parkinsons, so therefore my stretching abilities dont always work, but once I found a way to get in I can do it most of the time. My only drawback is that the back is very high, the sides are lower so therefore much easier to rest your head.",

Amazon was very good about returning it, but we decided to keep it for the kids to play on even if it was deflated most of the time.",

It's a bit heavy and awkward to carry down to the water but with more than two people it's easy. The canopy part is sort of delicate and broke a bit when it got windy but it's still functional and the wonderful was pretty strong so that may not happen often.",

I am not sure if this happens during shipping, but I did not even get to put the top half on the float yet since I cannot get the top half to stay inflated. I am going to purchase one more time.
