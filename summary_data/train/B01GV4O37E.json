I\u2019ve been taking this brand of omega 3 for some time now at the recommended dose of 3 a day. I just started taking 6 a day (split between morning and afternoon) and the effects were immediate upon taking the second half of the dose the first day. Please try this if you have the same issues. I also take a low dose of 5-HTP, magnesium, and vitamin B-6. Good luck!",

Both of us used another brand before - smaller and we don\u2019t have to take 3 soft gels to meet suggested requirements. A very light smell of fish but not pungent or fishy in my opinion. Not buying it again. Maybe a picture in front of the bottle of the size of the soft gel may help buyers.",
