Thank you all my helpers who aided with my decision on which one to purchase. I asked you questions, and your responded. If someone asks me....I will think of each and every one of you who responded, and take up the gauntlet. It's a great item. Easy to assemble. No problems. Wow!",

      "text": "I purchased this to print off labels for DIY e-juice and for that purpose it has performed beyond my expectations. I was drawn to this product specifically due to the lack of ink, size, price, and efficiency, It's thermal, so you are limited to black and white, but with any experience in graphics design you can easily make an aesthetically pleasing label that gets the job done. Since I was having trouble figuring this out myself, I found that the best labels for DIY e-juice applications are the 1 1/8\" x 3 1/2\" address labels.",

We wanted a thermal printer that was not too expensive, fast and could print on water resistant labels. I was tasked with selecting and setting up the printer. The start up booklet packaged with printer was easy to use and the download of the user manual and the software from the DYMO website was also easy. I think the DYMO screen display could be better designed and setting up templates a little easier. However, overall I am very pleased with this product.",

When finished, you click print, and it immediately prints. The labels are a good size and can be easily applied to various surfaces.",
