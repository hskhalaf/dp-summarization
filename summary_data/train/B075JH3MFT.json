There really is nothing bad about this camera the handling the focus speed and picture quality are all fine. For me it\u2019s standout feature is it just makes me want to pick it up and get out to take photos",

Fuji's 'film' options are outstanding and the top-plate manual controls superb. The X-E3 has everything you could wish for in a digital camera. Paired with Fujinon lenses it is small, light, unobtrusive and extremely versatile.",
