These make some scenes unwatchable. Also has severe panel bleed and potentially warped screen. Panel bleed runs along the entire lower edge and is really bad in the lower left corner of the screen. I also believe that the screen is warped as when viewed from the side the top half of the screen is angled backwards slightly, possibly designed that way but more than likely a further fault. Could not possibly recommend when I have requested a refund and will not be risking a replacement.",

If you make a tv, surely there shouldn\u2019t be issues with audio delay!",

I also watch HD movies on it, and it's really beautiful compared to my previous TV and monitors.",

In terms of image, I imagine it is similar, since image is really good. But it has no Roku, it has a TCL system which is really bad, the apps it has (just 10) are really crap. The TV is really slow, when I press the settings buttons, I have to wait 2 minutes, everything is slow in this TV. Audio is not that good. I would recommend to buy another TV from past year. The casting capabilities are very limited.",

Let me just say, that personally I think this is a great 4k tv, without the ridiculous price tag. The picture is superb. Vibrant colours, and crisp graphics for gaming. The sound is fine for me. No worse than other TV's I've owned. I honestly couldn't be happier with this tv. Thank you tcl, for not charging silly money, for a high quality of 4k.",
