My suggestion... Get your own size! It ended up being looser than what I wanted for a swim shirt (especially in the arms). Material is nice but too warm for Hawaii just to wear around unless you get wet. Color as pictured. On the day I took the pics, I weighed 136lbs. I am 5'5, pear shaped / B cup.",

The whole point of this is its long, super cute with side cinch, plus the zipper is so necessary because I hate pulling tight surf shirts over my head, plus nice to unzip after a long swim but not have to take off. The cinch was good to keep it from floating into my face during long snorkels and long enough to cover my butt (I'm 5') so I didn't burn my bikini line. I loved the white but super annoying once I stained it somehow. Haven't figured out how to get stain off. Spray n wash not working.",

I believe the Large fits like a typical US Large size 12/14. I suspect it would also fit fine if you're an 8/10... loose but not baggy. Likely a snug fit for a 16... maybe too tight if 18+.",

I am 153lbs and a large fits perfect. A medium would have been way too tight.",
