Appears too little fabric was used because the sewn seam didn't even perforate the fabric. The plywood that the fabric and cushion is fastened to was badly warped making it difficult to bolt to the bench during assembly. I was afraid the threads would rip out because of this, but so far it has held fine and the wood will probably settle/bend back into its intended state.",

I preferred the added support over having an option to do decline. It's solidly built and takes no time to put together. The packaging is decent. The only issue I had was that one spot on the leather underneath the bench arrived with a small hole from another part rubbing against it. I'll probably put small electrical tape over it. Not a big deal. It adjusts easily, rolls around nicely and doesn't move when benching. Nice buy for the price. (The price is lower on their website but their shipping is more.)",

Also the gap between cushions is very small (another plus). IT IS VERY WELL PRICED AND ALL AND ALL PROPOBLY THE BEST ON THE MARKET! I am very happy with it!!!",

I have several other rep products and they are an excellent company. They have a great customer service line too - I called them to see the best way to purchase the bench, and they recommended Amazon if they shipping worked out to be cheaper (instead of a direct purchase).",

There's practically no gap on this bench, and the pads are nice and firm. Overall, best bench I've ever used (outside of maybe one or two benches in a strongman gym that my cousin works out at).

Cons : none. Well you can get picky and say it doesn\u2019t decline but that\u2019s about it.
