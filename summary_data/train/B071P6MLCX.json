It does have 2 straps to help secure the holster on one side and the top but those only keep it from falling off the vest completely.",

Not the manufacturer's fault though, I guess this is a common problem with vest's of this type so I am reading? I would have tried to return it but I altered it too try and compensate, but its just not working. If your a small man, you will be ok! Also if your wanting a duty belt, this vest already has one on it!",
