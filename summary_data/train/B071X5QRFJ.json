The toe was uncomfortable and rubbed the wrong way. I bought this pair to replace them and gave the toe strap pair to my friend and she absolutely loves them. So I prefer no toe strap, she prefers with a toe strap. Depends on the person. Choose carefully.",

My regular size, then, is going back. They are way too expensive to put up with that nonsense. I have ordered a size smaller to see if they might work. If not, they are both going back.",

      "text": "If you have wide feet, going up a size may not be a solution because of where the arch support will land on your foot. I wear 9.5 and sometimes in wide depending on the shoe. I bought a 10 and as the picture shows, they were still too narrow for my foot and I had over and inch of extra sole in front of my toes. Not comfy for my size foot. I did really like their strap tightening through the sole. If the half sizes and the wide option was the same price I might have stayed with Chacos brand. Teva size 10 fit perfectly for me.",

My only complaint is, that in spite of other people reviewing differently, I had to size down. I am a 7 1/2, ordered an 8 and they were huge. I returned for size 7 and they fit perfectly.",

I've been wearing croc flip flops and tevas for a few years but now need more arch support postpartum. Wish I had tried these years ago! They fit great (order down if you're a half size). I can easily wear them all day chasing after kids, cooking and working in the yard, walking...Arch support is just what I needed when I don't want to wear tennis shoes. Don't hesitate!",
