On the other hand, some testers were unhappy with the width profiles. Also, others felt that the interior chamber wasn\u2019t very secure because they experienced accidental shoe removals. Overall, neutral runners considered the Gel Pulse 9 to be a worthy addition to the roster of products in the Asics stable. They also felt that it was a natural progression of the series.",

The toebox is too narrow and the shoe is too small; despite sticking to the same size as the previous 2, also my big toes rub against the lining when running. There is an uncomfortable rubbing that has now caused bruising on my ankle and I can barely wear the things, let alone try and run in them. If people where going to go for this I'd recommend going a 1/2 size up from previous ASIC shoes. This is not the fault of the seller and delivery was faultless",
