In conclusion, this cabinets look decent but the product images don\u2019t convey its port quality, for $350, I wouldn\u2019t recommend this cabinet to anyone due to its poor value.",

If you have knowledge of plumbing, etc. (which I do not) I imagine it would be fairly straightforward to install yourself. The frosted \"glass\" in the front of the cabinet is not actually glass but it is a sturdy and good-looking plastic material. It should hold up well. Overall, I'm very pleased with this cabinet and thrilled I now have a utility sink in my laundry room!",

It is very cheap: The handles are wobbly, the neck is plastic and does not seat very tightly to the base. I suppose this should be expected since the entire group is not very expensive. Just be aware this portion will likely require replacement sooner than later. I am still impressed with the product for the overall cost.",
