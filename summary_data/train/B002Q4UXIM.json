Finding one was harder than I thought it would be. Some of them had to be permently installed, so you would need many of them. Some could only be used once, so you could never have a fire drill with them before you needed them, which was a non-starter. Some looked difficult to use. And then there was the fact that their new house didn't got straight down, so a ladder that would just reach two stories would be too short. This one had everything I was looking for.",
