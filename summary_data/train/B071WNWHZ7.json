The charging ports are much more durable, easier for them to seat to charge, and has the red/green indicator for charging. This was an excellent investment from keeping me having to go buy new PS4 controllers due to the micro USB ports breaking. I highly recommend this above using the standard charging ports.",

And I am dead serious that it was fully charged and working around 3 or 4 hours after. The only issue With this is that you can't play comfortably with it charging, but if you're daring and lazy like me that won't be an issue. 10/10 would buy again if I had more than 2 controllers.",
