My only gripe is that the color between the two speakers is way off. I get that natural wood products can vary in appearance but in my case the left and right speakers are a very different shade of cherrywood red. They are not even close when putting them side by side. Disappointing for speakers that cost more than the turntable itself.",

I contacted Audioengine and got this reply \"this is something we've seen when testing the HD3s in our offices, so this appears to be normal; there wouldn't be a way to prevent this from happening, from what we can tell. We can definitely see how this would be an issue, though.\". Yup, it's an issue all right, as soon as I find a good replacement I'm sending these back.",

A few key points: - Sounds great at low and high volumes - Soundscape is well done - Balanced sound with a slight weight to the low to low-mids (which I like). Will say that the lowest frequency response is a little weak but for this price and the speaker size, the frequency arrange is excellent. Using bluetooth connect from my computer, could work to improve sound with DAC, wires, etc. but this is convenient with a satisfying sound.",

There is no main controls, just the speakers and they hook up and work right away. Only complaint is that the cable hookups/connectors in the back of the speakers are really deep/overly long , meaning that you can't have them flush against the wall and from the side they look clumsy there. Otherwise they look great in either the wood finish or the white (I have one set of each) and I love them.",

Without the sub, you might want to look into the HD6 speakers if you have room on your desk, because the HD3s will not fill out the low frequencies. I use Tidal running through the integrated DAC. The only small issue, is that that the speakers wait for a signal before the amp/dac turns on. This will always cut off the first second or two of a song after they go into standby mode.",

I reached out to tech support, and they responded with a boilerplate email that didn't address any of the questions I asked. When I tried to reach them again, I didn't even get a response.

However, there is still the issue of a slight delay of 2-3 seconds when playing a song/video after a period of pausing/not using it. The wood that is used isn't smoothly cut and had some slight shavings that fall off. Overall, great sound but average quality.",

I received another pair and I am not at all impressed with the sound. They can get loud, but it is not a good or warm loud and to sum up the sound, \"very bland\".
