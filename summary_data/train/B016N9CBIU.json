I am a professional handyman/renovation guy. I do not know how to make the van any more efficient besides some small tweaks and usage of the space behind the boxes. I have added some foldable arms to one side so I can make more room for large packages. Awesome Job Dewalt!",

I'd be willing to buy the handle but DeWalt does not sell it as a separate item. DeWalt's only response was that I could return the whole box to them and they would evaluate it. If in their opinion, the failure was due to a manufacturing defect, then they would replace it. Needless to say, I'm not going to return it. I can only see that leading to frustration and shipping costs on my part. Sorry, DeWalt but you get a big fat goose-egg on this one.",

The bad part of this review is the plastic on these cases is brittle and breaks easily. Every one of the cases have pieces broken off. I don't throw them around.

The Extra Large toolbox fits atop my DEWALT DS450 Mobile Storage box adding total flexibility and portability.

I wanted to move up to a sturdier Jobsite type stereo. After much research I decided on this Dewalt and I\u2019m SO glad that I did. It sounds great, right there with my old Bose and it\u2019s about 3 times as loud.",
