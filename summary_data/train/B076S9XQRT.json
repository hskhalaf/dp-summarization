There is an inside pad, but it is flat with no arch support. The outside/anterior ball portion of the shoe is built up, presumably to help prevent \"rollower\" ankle ankle sprains. As the anterior sole is built up and the posterior insole is flat. The gemoetry of this shoe creates major ankle pronation issues Definately not for anyone with flat or ankle problems. :(",
