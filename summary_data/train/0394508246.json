      "text": "This book uses pictures that aren't often indicative of the animals it's reprensenting. They are using odd color morphs and not the more commonly seen animals, making things difficult. The range maps are nearly useless. The descriptions of the animals are far too vague to make this book useful. The Peterson guide is far superior for the same price. Other than that nearly every state has it's own regional guides if you need an even better resource for your area. I'm an avid fieldherper and abandoned this guide many years ago in favor of the myriad guides that surpass this one's usefulness. Bottom line get the Peterson's guide or a regional guide over this confusing mess.",
