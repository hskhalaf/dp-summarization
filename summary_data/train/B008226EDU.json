Size is adjustable to fit a big dome or that chick from Beetle juice. Skip tracks feature so you can bust out of the stuff your significant other loaded on. Tough rubber coated exterior cuz that's just boss. Play/pause/answer calls so you can do all that. Get 8-9 hours of talk/listening time so you don't need to be that dude searching for a plug all the time. It has a 30-Feet range so you can roam free like the Yowie in the friendly confines of your studio apartment.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nThe DJ Slims are rugged, wireless headphones with a built-in microphone for hands-free call functionality.
