      "text": "Its impossible to find Simple Micellar Cleansing Gel anymore, anywhere, my hands-down-favorite cleansing facial wash. I was reluctant to try this, Simple Moisturizing Facial Wash, but its starting to win me over. I've found you really need to work this into a lather with a little water before applying, but it seems to work pretty well to remove makeup. Does it work as well as the Micellar Cleansing Gel? Hard to tell. It may be a bit more moisturizing, though.",

I have the typical slightly oil t-zone and dryer skin in harsh winters. This product works for this combination, for me. It lathers a little, feels creamy, cleans off make-up pretty well and has no fragrance or irritation. I do use an oil to remove mascara because it's easier then rubbing your eyes to get mascara off. This product provides a clean feeling and leaves skin feeling hydrated which is hard to find. It is not medicated so keep that in mind if you use those types of products.",
