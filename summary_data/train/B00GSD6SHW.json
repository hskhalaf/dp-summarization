The sleeves were too long, but easily remedied, able to turn up bottom of sleeve because it is same material and print as jacket without filling. I did not order the solid black. The one I have is a subtle print with black and charcoal grey with fur around the hood in grey and black tones. This color selection is darker than the photo and is very flattering. The Jacket feels and looks like good quality and is warm. Excellent value for $79.",

I purchased this to cover a March trip to Denver right after the big blizzard and also for our trip to Yellowstone this fall and it has surpassed expectations as usual. The hood is nice and deep and covers my face well from the wind and is a great length especially since I have a longer torso. Love the colors and it beads water perfect like it's supposed to. Highly recommend!",

I'm 5'11\", so I ordered a medium and kinda hoped for the best, and it fits perfectly, and I can fit a hoodie underneath. It's great because I'm always cold, so I'll always have on a hoodie underneath.",

My only complain is the velcro to hold the flap closed but I can live with that I was worried the medium wouldn't fit but it fits perfect. My chest is 36, waist is 30 and hip is 40 and I still have some room to wear a sweater.",
