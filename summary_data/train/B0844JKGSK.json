I hope they checked future products because mines was sent with a Pro Max barcode on the plastic but if you read the box itself it reads Pro. Customer service was very helpful in helping me with my replacement it shipped and delivered in one day. This new iPhone didn\u2019t seem to cost so much anymore once I\u2019m allowed to make monthly installments on it I\u2019m very happy about that promotion so I definitely took advantage of it, very blessed! I also liked the Cricket promotion I basically save 5$ a month now going thru Amazon so I\u2019m very pleased! Thank you!",
