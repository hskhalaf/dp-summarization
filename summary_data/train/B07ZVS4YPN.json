Because it is higher, the heat starts out higher but it still puts out a fair amount of heat. Plus, it is up off the ground to keep the dog out. So far, it starts every time and is esthetically pleasing. \\",

Some reviewers mentioned that they needed to use a separate lighter to ignite the flame but I have not had that issue. You just need to make sure the gas is turned up enough and the igniter switch worked perfectly. The heat output is quite nice and effective and there is a nice amount of space for setting a glass or plate but I would still recommend having other outdoor side table later on hand to support those items.",

In addition, the unit is inefficient when it is turned full blast, I do not recommend that, but luckily at the lowest setting it is more than adequate for warming a small area.

If you are not going to use the lava rocks, you will need two bags of glass rocks to fill it up. I am pleased with it.",

We have this on our patio, this item has made it so we spend a lot more time outside Whether it is a summer evening or a cool autumn night. The adjustable flame allows for comfort for whomever needs it. The ambiance from the flame is awesome. Propane bottle hides within the cabinet below the flame ring. Comes with the lava rock and a lid. Easy to clean and maintain. I love this item.",

Again, not a major issue but not ideal. It doesn't put out a ton of heat, but I didn't expect it to with it being propane. Overall, it works just fine - you get what you pay for!",
