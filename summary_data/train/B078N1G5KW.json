      "text": "This is a fine leash for flat water paddling. The length is a little misleading if you stretch it to 10ft it will be pulling back hard on your leg. If you are a flat water paddler and stick to the middle of your board you will experience mild tension. Relaxed length is about 3ft. The leg cuff is only large enough for ankles. It will not work for calf or knee height attachment on an adult. Otherwise it looks well built, good stitching, solid swivels at both ends. I would not suggest it for surfing a sup, you wont be able to reach the nose and ankle attachement on a large board in surf can be problematic.",

It is attached well, but is uncomfortable when wearing it. I haven\u2019t used it on my board in case I return it. I\u2019ll have to look at other reviews and see why this \u201ccontraption\u201d is better than what I\u2019m used to.",

Ankle attachment is soft neoprene and hook/loop fastening, very comfortable and easily fits on my ankle with plenty of room for adjustment. I have an athletic build at 5'9\" 200lbs. Some reviewers have mentioned that the cable is too tight while coiled. Mine barely offers any resistance, even when stretched out to 5-6 feet. In my opinion, this is a perfect safety attachment for use on a paddle board, as I'm intending it's use! Excellent product.",

The leash cuff also features a handy hidden key pocket.",
