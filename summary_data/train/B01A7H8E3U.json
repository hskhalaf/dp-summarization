Chains and metal edges scraping against each other doesn't help the incredibly thin coat of rust protection.",

If you assemble with the heavy chains on top the screws will become crossthreaded and are nearly impossible to replace. The basket I received was listed as \"used like new\" but 2 of the screws and nut combos were stripped beyond useability. The basket was otherwise in new condition. Thankfully I work in a metal shop and know enough to rethreaded the nuts and bolts before making the crossthreading worse. I also plan to replace the nuts and bolts someday which will involve some welding and hydraulic presses.",

    "description": "MVP Black Hole Disc Golf Baskets. Introducing a series of three disc golf baskets from MVP Disc Sports, the Black Hole Pro, Black Hole Precision, and Black Hole Practice. These baskets are designed by MVP and manufactured to the highest quality and customer value. Retailers may drop ship any of the Black Hole baskets directly to disc golfers from MVP Distribution Headquarters at no extra charge, keeping overall prices low. All three Black Hole models share the same heavy duty portable base, pole, and cage assembly, all conforming to PDGA height and diameter specifications. The Black Hole Pro and Black Hole Precision models feature a slim band design and course-quality heavy gauge chain, while the Black Hole Practice brings a lighter option with no header band and lighter chains seen in the Hive basket. The Black Hole Precision features one narrow focus tier of chains to demand a far more accurate putt during practice. The Black Hole Pro is designed for the most realistic putting experience off the course.",
