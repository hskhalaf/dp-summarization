Its warmth, support, and accurate sizing enabled outdoor lovers to cover more miles even in cold conditions. However, it failed to please in terms of weight and break-in period. To conclude, if its rather reconcilable setbacks can be overlooked, the Vasque Snowblime UltraDry would make a good winter trail companion.",

In fact there was a time when my left foot was wider as that was the flatter foot. I have had other Vasque boots without a similar issue and have not had this issue with any other shoe. If it was too narrow it was too narrow for both feet.",

My feet have gotten cold in these when I've just stood around on snow/ice w/o being active, but no where near as bad as my old boots. But remember, these are hiking boots designed for activity, not ice fishing boots meat for inactivity standing on ice. Perfect for their design, winter hiking.",

This is key for long term comfort and walking down steep hills. The only potential issue I can see: breathability. The sides of the toung is the only part of the boot that has a breathable fabric.

In addition these boots are very heavy at almost 5 pounds, much heavier than my old merrell's, just too uncomfortably heavy, with a lot of slop even after lacing them as tight as possible. These might be ok if you order your normal size and wear them with two layers of winter socks, but you're feet with be roasting. I'm returning these for something else lighter and true to size.",
