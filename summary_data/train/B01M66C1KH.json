Some questionable water sources were used during our trek, and the grayl made life that much easier. We didn't have to haul our water with us saving weight, time, and energy. Thanks Grayl! You guys made my 5night, 6 day trek that much easier.",

After a thorough cleaning, I tested it using my pool water. The filter worked. I was surprised by the taste. In Italy, I used tap water, street fountains and spring water.

I learned the hard way that air pressure fluctuations as the plane changes altitude can cause the seals to leak. You can still use the Grayl to purify bottled water from the service cart once you reach cruise altitude- just make sure to consume it all before descending or you\u2019ll likely have a mess.",

      "text": "My son was traveling to visit and stay with missionaries located in 4 cities in Mexico for the summer. I was unsure what the accommodations would be or what the water situation might be and I\u2019m glad I purchased. Even the nicest homes he visited advised him that the tap water is not potable and though many buy bottled water for drinking, it was not always convenient for him to do so. This was perfect, as it allowed him to fill from tap water and and instantly purify it for drinking. He was able to use tap water as his primary drinking source using this bottle and could carry it with him. Didn\u2019t get sick once. I\u2019m a believer.",

The chlorine taste is definitely subdued. It is a durable product with a good amount of filtered water available with each press but beware that it is a solid--not lightweight--piece of equipment and that a serious amount of pressure is needed to filter each time. I do wish that the bottle would keep liquids cold, but I can't have it all.",

The filter is somewhat hard to push down even when it is fairly new, but I never got sick after drinking the water I filtered with it. The filter cylinder has to be in the bottle for the cap to fit, so you cannot use the bottle without the filter cylinder in it. I attached a clip to the top to make it easier to latch onto my backpack. Will keep using and would recommend.",

This holds up next to those companies with this super effective filter. The press is similar to french press coffee. Worth the work, and even more satisfying after taking a sip! I can say you can trust this product fully, I am super impressed and can save on bottle usage ;)",
