Hold our 85 pound lab and 94 pound husky mix individually and they could squeeze in one if they really wanted to although they would have to really like to snuggle! It\u2019s tall and door is as well which we liked. They go in and out easily. Like the elevated floor so no water enters. We used thick Velcro strips to put down a thick shag rug so we can remove to clean but they won\u2019t drag out. Great price. I don\u2019t know why people complained about flooring as has four supports and it doesn\u2019t buckle under our dogs weight.",

It took my rottweilers a couple of weeks out in the rain to finally give the house a try, but after 1 finally broke down and got in, then the other beast quickly followed into his own new home. Now they enjoy them, and haven't even attempted to chew or tear the houses up! I am impressed!!! My dogs are both huge dogs, 150 and 170 pounds and easily fit in this XL dog house with room to turn around without problems and lie comfortably.",
