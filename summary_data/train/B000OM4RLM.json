We live in Maryland, north of DC, and back to a wooded preserve with a high deer population who are brazen in their approach to eating vegetation. This has saved my hydrangeas, sedum, and even my gorgeous gigantic mums from Costco, all of which had been devoured by the deer until I found this product. I put it on once a month. The smell is strong but not offensive. Based on reviews, the success or failure may be due to regional taste buds of the deer, if there is such a thing?",

The stuff does have a scent when first sprayed, but it's not that unpleasant, just a bit sharp. Quickly dries. I'm also impressed with how much is left in my bottle, because I've been spraying some things regularly for several weeks now. My only caveat is that I wouldn't recommend wiping sweat out of the corner of your eye two seconds after you have sprayed something.",
