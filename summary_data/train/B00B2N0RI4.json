The first replacement part Kohler recommended (valve box cover assembly) I try is about $50. Kolher says it might fix it or maybe another part might. Other 1-star reviews on this product also report problems with the control board (valve box cover assembly) and solenoid. Very disappointed.",

      "text": "I originally gave this Kohler faucet 5 stars - it was expensive but a great experience. Then after just a few months I lost almost all the water pressure. Now I read other reviews indicating that it has a bad solenoid that needs to be replaced - hopefully with an improved replacement part? So I'm ordering my part now and hope it solves the problem. For a premium priced product this is unacceptable. $600 for the faucet and now buy a replacement part AND pay someone to install it?! Kohler clearly did not test this product enough before introducing it.",

It lasted over 11 years (and we cook at home 3-4 times a day) This faucet i bought on amazon is very cheaply made and does not match the quality and standard we are used to from this brand. It will not last if you actually use your kitchen to cook. If you rarely cook or only need a faucet to wash hands or the daily coffee mug... this will work for you. Also, if you return it beware of the 20% restocking fee. :( sooooooo disappointed in the quality of this faucet...",

When purchasing, just be sure to have an outlet to plug in the system under the sink. Because of the \"touchless operation,\" preparing foods is more hygienic. I highly recommend this faucet.",

Tackling daily kitchen tasks often leaves your hands messy, full or even both. KOHLER has simplified and streamlined the kitchen faucet to make your time in the kitchen more efficient. Delivering convenient and hygienic control, this intuitive faucet reduces the threat of cross-contamination. Sensate has many convenient features such as an automatic shutoff safeguard to make cleanup easier. \n\nKEEP YOUR KITCHEN CLEANER\nThe Sensate kitchen faucet frees your hands so that you can flow through your kitchen tasks, like messy food prep, without pausing to turn the faucet handle on and off.

Simple wave your hand or a pot or pan through the sensor window for reliable on/off operation. The window begins at the underside of the spout and extends six inches toward the base. Simply wave your hand through the beam to activate the water. If you need to change the water temperature, simply adjust the handle while the faucet is in use. \n\nSPRAYHEAD FEATURES\nSensate features DockNetik, our new magnetic docking system that securely locks the sprayhead in place. With spray and stream capabilities, the dual-function sprayhead makes tough kitchen tasks light work. The braided nylon hose prevents kinks and tangles, and the swiveling ball joint ensures smooth operation with minimal effort. \n\nDESIGNED FOR BEAUTY AND POWER\nThe fusion of sleek design and workhorse functionality allows you to accomplish kitchen tasks more cleanly and easily. Sensate's signature aesthetic element is the black bonnet - an unexpected touch that adds a subtle detail to its design. A finished-matched bonnet is also available. The strategically placed activation area makes use precise and natural. An LED light near the base of the faucet alerts you that the Sensate is operational and ready to go. And in the event of a power loss, the faucet can be operated manually. \n\nKEY FEATURES\n * Touchless Operation: convenient and hygienic control with Response technology \n * State-of-Art Sensor: responds to motion in 20 milliseconds\n * Battery-Free: AC power means no batteries to replace \n * Secure Magnetic Docking: sprayhead securely locks in place \n * Lasting Finish: resists corrosion and wear \n * Durable Ceramic Valves: a lifetime of exceptional performance\n * Easy Clean: wipes clean with a wet cloth\n * Auto Shutoff: automatic shutoff safeguard\n * ProMotion Technology: connects the sprayhead hose to the sprayhead with a swivel joint for effortless maneuverability\n * MasterClean Sprayface: flexible nozzles for an easy-to-clean surface that resists mineral buildup and wipes clean with a wet cloth\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nTake touchless to a whole new level of convenience.
