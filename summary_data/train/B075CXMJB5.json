Basic problems are: 1) Ants - the top does not seal so once the ants find it, the food reservoir will be full of them. 2) Ants - typically a couple pieces of kibble will get stuck up in the mechanism / top of the chute. Even if the top did seal, the ants will still find those few pieces. 3) Capacity is a bit on the small side for a large dog. Need to refill every 4 - 5 days.",
