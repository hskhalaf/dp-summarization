If you have a bit of a chronic problem with them, reapply every month in the summer and spring, light dusting anywhere they might be. Be patient and your problem will go away. If it's a really bad infestation use in conjunction with Bengal Spray. Follow all the directions for safety! Happy exterminating!",

The problem is in the physical distribution of the product into the deep corners of the pantry. The applicator is difficult to maneuver into these areas and apply the proper amount.",
