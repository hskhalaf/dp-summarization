If your studs are 12\" apart or 14\" or anything besides 16\" this will not be fun for you. Once in though it is amazingly sturdy. We hit enough studs to make it work and I'm really excited about it.

I wanted a barn door for our master bedroom, but was not willing to pay as much for the track as my customers are willing to pay for theirs. This is a great alternative to a \"custom\" track for way less money! The pre-drilled hole spacing makes it unlikely that you'd be able to mount it right to a wall without tearing out drywall and installing blocking behind it. I recommend mounting a head rail (nailed/screwed into studs) and then mount the track to that using the pre-drilled hole spacing.",

I ran into some really wonky nuts that were way off center and the one page of \"instructions\" that were included was just about useless. Since I was using a backer board I wasn't overly worried about the poor measurement complaints I've read so, in the end, the price was right and it is a heavy duty kit. Did just fine with the heavy door I picked out to separate my laundry room and half bath. I would recommend for sure but only if you were using a backer board or a similar application. Not sure I would trust this kind of poor QC to hit studs.",

      "text": "Loved this barn door track! Great value! Compared with one at HD for $189. I've hesitated w/installing a barn door on bathrooms before (because they were the main bath & provided no security for guests!), but THIS one was on a master bath, so a prefect place for one. It still locks (w/the optional lock we found elsewhere on Amazon) but of course still allows light to leak around the edges.",

      "text": "For the price this barn door kit was as advertised. The core components have a solid construction. I gave only four stars for a couple issues that I had. The instructions are horrible so you pretty much can toss them. Secondly the metal parts are nicely powder coated, however the coating on some of the components came chipped away. Not a big deal but it\u2019s not quite black in color and was really hard to match with basic spray paint. These are nitpicky things for the price but thought it was worth mentioning.",

This is a good option for a DIY and once it is stained and installed, is comparable to doors 3 times more expensive. No hardware included and we would have purchased a different railing. It also does not come with a headboard if you need one. The cost to add a headboard is minimal < $10. I highly recommend this door for those DIYers that may not have previous experience in making and installing a sliding barn door.",
