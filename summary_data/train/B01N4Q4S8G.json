Yesterday after we had a storm he had been working in the yard for a couple of hours and was in some water . These leaked around the sides and toes and his feet were soaked. He had worn them about a month. I am so disappointed as they #1. are expensive. #2. The Merrell Brand is noted for being an exceptional boot/footwear. This may be a defective pair? Not sure. But I would not purchase it again. He has several pairs of merrells that are great. However these boots are not.",

The insoles are very thin and cheap compared to the nice insoles merrell used to put in their shoes. I am disappointed in merrell and I sent them back. Love amazon for the wonderful return policy!",

For me, I wear them as an everyday boot to work and not as a hard core hiking boot. Should manage everyday rain and snow here in the Norhteast. Well worth the money and as comfortable as any Merrell I have ever owned.",
