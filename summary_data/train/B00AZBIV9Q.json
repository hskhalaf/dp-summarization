PROS: Strong suction with a dial for quick/easy adjustment of suction strength. CONS: The hose needs to be two feet longer. The nozzle needs to be straight... not curved... and something needs to stablize the body while pulling it behind you... as it likes to roll around like an over-sized Easter egg resting mostly on its side when attempting to pull it around the house. So it usually gets carried to avoid over stressing the hose.",

It\u2019s lightweight, powerful and you can decrease the suction if you are tired of sucking up your lightweight door mats \ud83d\ude21 It\u2019s great for all the small jobs and makes cleaning a breeze. I specifically got this for getting under the beds but I use it much more than I thought I would. It makes cleaning fun and It gets all the places the heavy Kirby upright doesn\u2019t. Honestly I have the all Kirby attachments but it\u2019s too much of a hassle to use them. Use the Kirby and use this \ud83d\ude03\u2764\ufe0f",

Lightweight. 5. Cord allows me to vacuum a 250 square foot room. 6. No mess filter. It is very easy to change. Con's 1. The dual attachment for crevice and dust is terrible. The dust part always unfolds itself, making it a hassle to use. Would strongly recommend buying a separate attachment for dusting. 2. Can be very tricky to navigate on vertical surfaces. 3. Bag replacement is very expensive. 4. Awkward to use on stairs. I would recommend this product to anyone.",

      "text": "This is the best vacuum I've ever owned. It fits under furniture where bagless and/or upright vacuums will not. It's surprisingly lightweight and powerful. I thought I would never use the adjustable suction control knob but it actually comes in useful for cleaning small rugs and bathmats. The design is simple and accessories are useful. Changing out the bag is easy and clean. No more shaking dust all over the room trying to get the hair clogs out of the canister as with bagless vacuums, This thing works and works well.",

Update- I put my upright in the garage and use this exclusively. You could not buy it from me or take it away from me now...I love it. Light and easy for big or small jobs.",

    "description": "Color:Maroon Bagged| Style:Zing CanisterZing Bagged Canister Vacuum, 4122 by BISSELL Canister Vacuum Cleaners BISSELL canister vacuums are light and easy to maneuver. They\u2019re great for stairs and other surfaces like curtains, upholstery, auto interiors, and more. What are the benefits to cleaning with the BISSELL Zing Bagged Canister Vacuum? BISSELL Zing bagged canister vacuum makes any cleaning task seem effortless. The lightweight design and carry handle provide portable convenience. The Multi-Surface Floor Nozzle allows for easy cleaning of carpet, rugs and bare floors. The telescoping wand allows you to comfortably maneuver around and under furniture and also clean hard to reach areas like drapes and ceilings. When you are finished, the cord will automatically rewind with the push of a button. What is the difference between an upright vacuum and a canister vacuum? Canister vacuums are low to the ground vacuums that have a long hose with a wand on the end. As you clean through the hose and wand, you pull the canister unit behind you. Upright vacuums stand tall and have a handle, which is used to push the vacuum. When cleaning carpets, the debris is removed through the foot or base of the unit. Most uprights also have a hose and on-board tools, which are typically used for hard to reach places and when cleaning furniture. At one time, canisters were thought to be easier to use for cleaning hard to reach places and for cleaning a larger variety of floors surfaces. However, the uprights of today have added cleaning features, such as bare floor height adjustments, brush roll on/off switches, and are easily maneuverable. In addition, the on board cleaning tools have made upright vacuums even more versatile. Although uprights are easier to use and more effective at cleaning larger areas in the home, they can still be a challenge when cleaning stairs. Which type of vacuum is better -- bag less or bagged? Neither type of vacuum is \u201cbetter\u201d than the other. A bagged vacuum will lose its cleaning effectiveness as the bag fills with debris. The bag must be changed when it is about 1/2 to 2/3 full for the best cleaning performance. The choice between a bagged and bag less vacuum really depends on your personal preference. Portable, Multi-Surface Cleaning! Powerful suction gets the dirt high and low--great for bare floors, rugs and above-floor cleaning Easily go from cleaning carpets to hard floors with the flip of a switch Automatic cord rewind for quick cord storage with the push of a button. Buying this product saves pets. BISSELL proudly supports BISSELL Pet Foundation and its mission to help save homeless pets. When you buy a BISSELL product, you help save pets, too. We\u2019re proud to design products that help make pet messes, odors and pet homelessness disappear.",
