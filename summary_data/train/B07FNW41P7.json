Simple things in life make me so happy. Love this ice maker. It starts making ice in about 6 min it makes its first dump. Then every 6 to 8 minutes another and another. Keeps me happy.",

Other than that, it does the job. Easy to fill, it works about at the speed advertised, and gives you an easy way to get ice in a quicker period of time than a fridge / freezer normally does. Color really pops as well. The red is deep.",

Add water to the water line, and let it do its job. 9 ice cubes times ,3 drops of ice into the basket,time to empty the bucket, ( about 7 minutes). add water back to fill line, and there it goes making ice cubes! Fun to watch! Sure beats having to keep buying bags of ice! I fill the ice bin in the freezer, then make spare bags of ice cubes to use. A little noisey, but not to the point of irritation! At least, I know it is working and doing its job!",

      "text": "The ice storage bin is not well insulated and is only cooled when it is actually making ice. So, the ice is melting continuously. The ice backs up into the chamber where the ice is made so the bin only gets at best half full. The machine is very noisy. You might think something from Igloo would be well insulated but it is not. Because the cubes are small cylinders with a hole through them they melt very quickly.",
