      "text": "Love everything about the jacket except the standing collar- it seems about an inch too tall but maybe that's just me. The sides of the collar don't seem to stand or hang symmetrically, so depending on how far up you zip the sides may be drooping or standing in different ways. Not a huge deal, but it's noticeable. I'm 6'-0 and 210 and went with a large based on prior reviews and it fits great.",

There is something about the material in this jacket that makes sweet rot when you wear it once. The jacket doesn't breath like normal materials. The next time you wear it, you smell like a homeless person. I do wear this jacket, but now the moment I take it off it goes in the washer not in the closet.",

      "text": "We were huge fans of everything Columbia produced up until now. The front zipper on this jacket is too fragile and flimsy and keeps jamming. After just a few days of wear we had to send the jacket back because the front zipper jammed so severely at the bottom that we could not re seat or re track the zipper to be able to use the jacket at all. This jacket needs a heavier duty zipper to be able to prevent these types of jams and locking up. Perhaps a heavier or better quality zipper would enable the user to re seat or re track the zipper on the user's end.",

Very similar yet fits the body well. I usually wear medium shirts, but bought a small because it fit me pretty much perfect - almost like a shirt - therefore keeps the heat in even better. There are 3 front pockets that do not stand out and all have zippers. Great jacket.",

      "text": "Received this as a gift. I got the small size because I'm 5'7 and usually wear medium shirts but small jackets. I typically wear a tshirt, sweater, and hoodie under this jacket and still have some room left over. A very light lining inside adds some warmth and the waterproof outer layer keeps the wind out. My only negative about the jacket is the color. I got the deep woods color because the picture makes it look like a dark grey. It is actually a dark green in real life. Highly recommend the jacket but also highly recommend taking a look at the colors in real life before making a purchase.",

Keeps rain off, I use it during summer and winter as It isn't too thick to be uncomfortable, but keep warmth in when I need it to. Excellent jacket for sure. As a snowboarder I will be trying this out for the first time this winter. The zippers being water proof will be good for the snow. Wearing it underneath thicker layers works out because it keeps heat in.",
