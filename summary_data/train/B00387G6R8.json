My home unit gets the most attention from me and it is buried in the basement above a large wooden beam, and the signal still easily reaches outside for listening to iHeart radio over the WiFi while working the yard.",

The stock firmware leaves a bit to be desired for all but basic setup... however if you're willing to get your hands a little dirty, you can really turn this into an enterprise level router w/ dd-wrt or AdvancedTomato. I tried both, and settled on AdvancedTomato. Neither are very difficult to flash onto the router and there are instructions all over the place for this router. Another website sells this exact router flashed with AdvancedTomato for over double the price. A little reading/watching YT videos, and you can do it yourself in about 15min, and save about a hundred bucks.",

Search \"dd-wrt wiki asus rt-n16\" in any search engine for very detailed instructions on flashing DD-WRT firmware to this router, and follow them to the letter.

I personally prefer gargoyle on my router (an implementation of open-wrt). I have had many routers, the neatgear wdnr-3700,wdnr-3800 and the Buffalo WZR-HP-300NH. The first 2 routers were probably the worst i could have owned, the Buffalo was a very good router with DD-WRT but the Asus takes it to a whole new level. Over all i am one satisfied customer!",

I experimented with several antennas, even directional ones, but that made little difference. I might also add, it very difficult to collect range data given the amount of variability that exists in the RF range. Overall, I like it and still use it, but next time plan on getting one in the 5Ghz range.",

DHCP is easily configurable and the web interface is quick. Encryption setup was simple. I don't have any CONs in this review because I haven't found any in the 2 weeks I've used it.",
