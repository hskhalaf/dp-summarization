I can wait 4 days between shampoos. The price is a huge bargain. I love the scent. I couldn't be more pleased with this thickening shampoo. I've bought almost every brand on the market but Sachajuan lives up to the hype and without the hefty price tag.",

The scent is light, doesn't feel it much. The disadvantage is that it is in a small bottle, so it's much more expensive than average. And the bottle caps is very inconvenient, you have to push the bottle hard to pour out some shampoo.",
