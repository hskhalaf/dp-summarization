Now this review is for \"YI Dome Camera Pan/Tilt/Zoom Wireless IP Indoor Security Surveillance System 720p HD Night Vision\" in case this ends up in one of those annoying 'review piles' which covers ALL versions of their product. This is an issue since I also bought (more recently) one of their 'fixed' cameras and its night performance sucks without the IR turned on (fine with IR but it clicks when it changes modes which make you wonder how long until THAT breaks). But this camera was surprisingly good.",

Considering it must be plugged in while you do this it causes an issue if you're putting the camera in another room. Not to impressed with the connection. Over all- the camera is phenomenal. The night time vision, day time picture is great and easy to use. I can hear and speak to my dog when he is doing something he isn't supposed to be doing.",

Cons: - The app often has a 3 second advertisement enticing you to upgrade to the cloud. - The alerts are a little delayed (sometimes our toddler has already left the room before alerted) - Alerts tell you there's movement on camera (serial #), not in the camera you renamed it",

      "text": "Love this camera! We use it to monitor our 1 year old puppy, she would destroy the house while we were gone. Upon using this we discovered the severity of her separation anxiety, poor pup. This is a huge help and comfort for us, so we can check in on her and talk to her through the camera in case she is howling and crying. It works great, the video and sound quality on the app is really good. The only complaint I could think of is that it can't capture the floor to ceiling view, but we manage to put it on the dining table and get a pretty good shot of the living room. We highly recommend!",
