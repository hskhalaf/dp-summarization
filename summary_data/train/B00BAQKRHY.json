The vent clip holds on securely and has only swiveled from side to side a little but has never come off. If you do not center and balance the mount to your phone properly, the ball joint will not keep it straight where you want it. Gravity wins each time even though there is a gummy substance in the center to stop that from happening. I've found that you can keep it from moving around if you have the phone plugged in and use the cord as a means to keep the phone from moving.",

In other words, be it's you wanted to use the mount in landscape instead of portrait, it would probably just flip to portrait as soon as you took your first turn.

It also takes up less space than the big phone holders and can be put anywhere! It looks pretty cool too and is a convo starter. Bonus: since the magnet goes onto your phone/phone case, you can stick your phone anywhere that is metal! On the fridge, above the oven, on the side of your car... Endless possibilities.",

However, if cables are connect to the phone and it weighs down the phone a bit, then the mount can only be used in portrait mode. Also, any extreme bumps/potholes on the road will knock it slightly off where it may need to be readjusted. It doesn't happen frequently enough where it is a hassle but definitely enough times where it's noticeable. I would still recommend it since it is universal.",

Have even used to play movies on long trips for passenger- as you can turn it whichever way if you have it docked in the middle of the car.

    "description": "Style:Dash| Color:OriginalThe beauty of the Steelie Dash Mount Kit is in its simplicity. Using trusted Steelie magnetic mounting technology, this popular phone mounting system lets you be hands-free so you can keep your focus safely on the road. This all-inclusive kit includes one Steelie Magnetic Phone Socket with 3M VHB adhesive, one Steelie Dash Ball with 3M VHB adhesive, an alcohol prep pad, and easy installation instructions. The 3M VHB on the Dash Ball allows it to be secured to just about any smooth, hard, flat or vertical surface in your vehicle. The Magnetic Phone Socket also uses 3M VHB, so it adheres steadfastly to your phone or rigid case, but can be removed if you get a new Apple iPhone, Samsung Galaxy, Google Pixel, or other phone or case. The socket features a powerful neodymium magnet and a smooth silicone ring that articulates with the steel ball on the Dash Mount. This allows your device to be tilted and viewed in landscape, portrait, and everything in between. This design ensures the phone stays securely in place, until you detach it from with a simple twist or tug. Speed bumps, potholes, quick turns are no match for Steelie's magnetic holding power. Because of its fumble-free, secure design, the Steelie Phone Mounting kits are legal in all 50 United States. Plus, when you reach your destination and detach your phone, the Magnetic Phone Socket on your device means you can still attach it conveniently to other metal surfaces: refrigerator doors, metal shelving, other Steelie Mounts, and more. Steelie neodymium magnets are safe for use with mobile devices but should be kept away from magnetically sensitive objects like credit cards, pacemakers or computer hard drives.",
