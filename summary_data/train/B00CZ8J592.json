I didn't think it would bother me as much but after using top of the line laptops, it's very difficult to handle a cheap screen from the 90's where you have to angle it perfectly just to get a good picture. What good is a gaming laptop with a crappy screen? Even doing everyday things like watching Netflix makes it very annoying. Don't make the mistake I made after being so drawn to the hardware specs that I figure the complaints about the screen was just people being picky. Turns out it's just not worth having all that power working on a very bad quality display.",

The screen viewing angle is a bit rough but its an excellent trade off considering the complete lack of motion blur that you get on most laptop screens. There are a few extras you will/may need before gaming. - Headphone Y combiner: If your headphone/mic is two plugs you will need a Y cable to combine them into 1 - Gaming Keypad: If your left thumb touches the mouse pad while gaming it will fire your weapon. This can be solved by using a separate gaming keypad to take your hand off the keyboard. This also avoids any uncomfortable heat from the laptop.",

There are NO authorized service facilities anywhere outside California. And no plans to get them, And they will not sell you parts to perform repairs yourself. All repairs, no matter how minor, must be done at the factory. That means fed-exing the unit, getting a diagnosis, getting a price, (paying $100 if you don't agree to the price) then waiting for the repair and then fed-exing the thing back. Every other laptop manufacturer will sell parts to authorized repair shops. Beautiful laptop, but what a colossal pain.",

The screen resolution and viewing angle could have been better but it hasn't really been an issue for me and games look incredible on it.

I especially like the fact that is has a solid state hard drive, a built in graphics card and a lighted keyboard. I upgraded to windows 8.1 Pro and got \"bitlocker\" for free.

On battery and gaming, the unit gets a little warm and the battery will last about an hour with heavy gaming. With just websurfing or light work, considerably longer and cooler. It's completely silent. Windows 8 sucks -- there's no redemption for that. However, one nice bonus about this laptop is that it comes with *no* crapware.

      "text": "I loved this laptop for 1 year 4 months and then it started on fire. One of the USB ports stopped working so I powered it down and unplugged it...then I waited a few minutes, plugged it back in and started it up ....then the smoke and sparks...then I disconnected and powered down....TOTALLY FRIED! Funny how it went up in smokes 4 months after the warranty was out! Grateful my house didn't burn down. Can't remove the battery and very afraid of this thing.",

The computer worked flawlessly, but I knew I could not live with daily clicking noise, so I returned this laptop. After looking at other reviews, there are a few other cases. Razer, I hope your next version fixes this problem because I'm looking to buy the blade if fixed.",

This one has a hiss on the power supply and the webcam sometimes flashes in different colours. Additionally, the screen is quite lacking, not only in resolution, which I think is still acceptable at 900p but the contrast is quite poor, as well as colour reproduction. Overall its a good computer, I like its portability and design, but the quality of the internals should reflect the observable build quality.",

Smeared with some awful AG coating, too. Worse, the windows product key doesn't even activate from the bottom of the laptop and Razer's online \"support\" won't let me submit a claim for some weird technical error.",

So far however the battery icon tells me there isn't a battery plugged in. I tested once pulling the cord and the laptop dropped like a stone. Once I finish an install (should take about an hour) if the battery indicator still shows no battery, I will open the back and look for a loose connection. I don't want to have to return this, so hopefully that does the trick. If it does, then I will upgrade the stars.",
