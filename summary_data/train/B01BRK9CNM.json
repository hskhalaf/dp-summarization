Its lightness and supportive insole also added up to its benefits. It, however, received criticisms in relation to its narrow fit and inaccurate sizing. Taking everything into account, the Northside Montero Mid Waterproof is a day hiking boot which can deliver on the trails. Interested buyers, however, should have the patience to try it out first before getting one.",

      "text": "So I just got back from a hiking trip in Ireland and I wanted to try these out there before I reviewed them. I cannot say enough positive things about these boots! Broke them in for about two weeks walking around New York City, Central Park, and on the treadmill at my gym! LOL I hiked for 30 miles over two days at a difficult level...Wanted to kill my friend as my legs were killing me! The boots were fantastic though! Walking through wet grass, rain and a lot of uphill and my feet were very comfortable! Totally water proof with the only wetness from my own sweat They weren\u2019t overly warm though either. Cannot recommend these enough!",
