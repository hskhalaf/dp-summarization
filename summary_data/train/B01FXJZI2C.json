They said parts would arrive in two weeks. After 3 calls of rescheduling because parts are on backorder. It is now July 10th and no parts or any repairs have been completed. Do not buy from Haier.

Why create something so overly complicated that simply washes and drys clothes? Seriously, how do we band together and file a formal complaint against the company to make their wrong in to a right? People have spent their hard earned money on this product to simply be taken to the cleaners! literally!",

One load that only fills the small drum halfway takes over 3.5-4 hours and even then I still have to air dry pieces. RIP you clothes if you forget to take them out immediately as they and the washer will get musty. After I'm done doing two loads of laundry after a full day, I have to leave the door open for hours to let it air out or else it just stays wet in there.",

It will work great for a month or two, then throw an FC code or something similar, and lock your clothes in the machine. Service tells me they wont refund me, instead they'll just replace it with a brand new machine. Been through this process 4 times now. Usually takes 2-3 weeks until my tenants get a new machine.

The only way to reset it that I've found is to run another load and run up my energy bill (which isn't this the problem it's supposed to be solving!?!?!?) Laundry used to take me a few hours a day to complete. It now takes me 12-14 hours just to get through my own individual loads. Absolutely not practical for family use (not even practical for individual use in my opinion). I've never been more frustrated with a piece of equipment in my life.",

It takes forever to dry clothes, and even when they\u2019re dry, they\u2019re still not really dry after sometimes 5+ hours of drying. It does not matter how small you make your loads, it takes forever. The door will also lock for whatever time it decides to let your clothes \u201ccool down\u201d. I would give this 0 stars if I could. If you are renting like me and see that this washer/dryer comes with your place, don\u2019t bother, purchase your own. I cannot emphasize how horrible it is.",
