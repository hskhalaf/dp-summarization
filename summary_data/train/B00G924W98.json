      "text": "As an amateur R/C hobbiest, I've owned several different helicopter models and some nitro cars/trucks. This little Estes quad flies very well, just as well as my micro-helicopter costing hundreds. My 6 year old could master it within a day or so (I recommend the protective kit that is available if you plan on giving this to a younger person). My only complaint would be the trim needs finer adjustment, but with the capability of getting 99% dialed-in, this is not worth removing a star. Flight time was about 5-8 min doing some flips. The blinking lights which indicate a low battery allow you to make a safe landing.",

      "text": "I have bought many inexpensive mini-copters (main rotor/tail rotor) over the years, and though they are fun, they are uniformly frustrating to fly. They are near impossible to hover without many hours of practice, and you generally destroy them before you can master the controls. Not so the quad-copter! It was easy to make this one hover and because it maintains its own attitude I can fly it relative to my own point of view rather than the aircraft's. I have no interest in doing flips or tricks: just controlled flight, and this one does that better than any I've seen. And for this price, when I break it I'll buy another one!",

It comes with a bunch of spare props too and I love the fact that it has a USB charger. Just don't lose it. Haven't flown it much outside but when I did it worked pretty well as long as there's not too much wind.

I'd say it is a bit on the unstable side and it certainly crashes a lot and the little props are pretty hard to find when they go flying off after a crash. I would not recommend as your first quad but if you are familiar with quads and OK with a challenge it's a must have. BTW, you can fly this quad with the same radio that comes with the Hubsan X4 which permits you to do flips and such.",

Also, you have to put the propellers on exactly right or it will not achieve lift. I have crashed mine probably a hundred times and it will still fly.

Do yourself a favor, and go find a protective ring to put on it before you fly... I found one for less than 10 bucks. I would recommend this to anyone who is curious about quadcopters!",

It has a high pitched whine that fits - I don't know how to explain this you have to hear it. It is very maneuverable and moves very fast and I would liken it to a dragon fly. The only drawback is that the props come off sometimes when you crash into things (yes, don't crash it), and then you have to look for them to put them back on. Still this quad is very cool to play with and I highly recommend it. You will like it.",

Overall, I highly recommend this as a fun indoors (or calm-day outdoors) quad to fly.

It landed in the dog water bowl after a particularly nasty crash. I shook the water off of it vigorously, let it dry a couple of hours and it was good to go.

Pros: fast, agile, fun, cheap, can fly in very small spaces, etc. Cons: it breaks and after that you don't want to fly it much because it handles so weirdly.",

When the props start to spin back off til they srop then flick the right stick left and right until the blue lights dlicker and it is then calibrated to its center of gravity No wrestling with the trim.
