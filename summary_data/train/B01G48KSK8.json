We tried several different areas of the tub, it did not matter where it was placed. Fully smooth surface, cleaned, dried. Failed and not trustworthy even if it did hold at this point given I have seen how it can be indicating safe the moment to later fall off. Not recommended!",

Amazon came through with this grab bar and our problem was solved. The suction is super strong and the green lighting up feature is reassurance that it is properly installed and ready to be used. I needed something that would be strong, functional and did not have to be permanently mounted to the tile. My tiles were 14\" so it was easy to avoid the grout lines and make a secure contact as has been recommended.Thanks!",

Update: My mom uses her full body weight on it and it has not slipped. As long as you put it on a plastic tub (not tile) you can trust it will be well worth buying.",

      "text": "Short of a complete renovation to install a shower stall which would cost $10k, this is the perfect and effective solution to prevent slippage for my elderly father's bathroom. I'm giving it only 4 stars because it does fall off the walls every now and then so dad has to re-apply it. But other than that, it attaches pretty solidly on the wall and gives my dad a lot of comfort that he won't slip and fall. I got 2 of these, one for next to the shower door and another next to the shower itself. Great innovative product!",

It would have been difficult to find a stud behind the fiberglass so this was what we needed. She likes the support that it gives her.",
