The main negative I have is that I would put out a word of caution to 1) realize this has to go through the postal service and there is the strong possibility it will arrive leaking all inside the box. And 2), it didn\u2019t find this out until later, but when I got ready to the detergent, placing it right side down, the nozzle (twisted as tight as it possibly could go) leaked everywhere! I highly recommend reviewing the advantages and disadvantages before you move forward.",
