I put this away since it voids my warranty if I didn't use Marshall ferret food. Her ferret kept spilling the marshall food which was $25 a bag for maybe 5lbs. Very expensive so after he wasted all the other food we tried this one. He doesnt tip this one over and we actually see him eat this one. I have ordered more and hope nothing happens to him between now and his warranty period of a year.",
