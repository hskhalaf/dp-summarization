You get 2 pumps with it, the rope to anchor it down, clips for the anchors, tape, steaks, and 2 size balloon measures. Its definitely worth the price. I would suggest sand in the base and not water but with the anchors it was great. Huge hit for our sons party and we'll be using for other events !(we didn't put enough balloons and didn't have time to put them on before the party started. But it comes with way more than enough clips to fill the whole thing 2 times over).",
