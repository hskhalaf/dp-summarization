It took like 5 minutes to set up and download the course and then you just play and it records all your shots. Then after the round, you get a ton of stats back that are super helpful. Have gotten my club distances dialed in and constantly using the rangefinder to get plays-like distances during the round. I've just unlocked the Caddie feature so I'm sure that's a game-changer too. My only question is why did I wait so long to get this??",

Because of that it is complicated and distracting while playing. Editing shots at first is cumbersome and battery usage is way too much but I'm getting familiar now so it is getting better. Bottom line - I needed real world distance expectations for each club and this is the only way to get it.",

When putting make sure to mark flag location(I just stand by hole and hit mark flag on screen). Overall I think this is a great tool for helping get my handicap below 25+. Also I make sure to run sensor diagnostic prior to leaving house to make sure each club is still paired.",
