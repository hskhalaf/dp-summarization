I don\u2019t brush hard as I have very very VERY sensitive skin butthe bristles all broke down and flaten after 2nd Use already. Didn\u2019t even last at all already have to throw away. And I owned brush for at least months before using several times a week. But this one!!! Worst. Very sorry to have to write abad review but people should know what to expect! 2 stars for packaging and added hook and the nice bag it came with!",

The handle does it for me: good size and shape to hold, and the brush head is angles correctly. I haven't used the removable brush head part separately from the handle, but I could see how that is a nice option to have. I will reorder this brush when I need another.",

My other body products absorb much better now that I have an easy way to full-body exfoliate. Product quality is good too, the handle is sturdy and I haven't had any shedding issues with the bristles.",
