So, given that there is no other damage, whatever it was (or if it was someone just stepping on it without opening the tailgate), and the way it shows as snapped, makes it so I want a replacement but one that is actually sturdy and made well.

The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because it does look weird if left on the vehicle when not using.

Also, I was rear-ended at a stop light and this step saved my bumper. The step sustained a few barely noticeable gouges, but otherwise all is good. I highly recommend this step.",
