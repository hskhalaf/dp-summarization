      "text": "I got this stand for my husband who had received \"The Joy of Cooking\" for the holidays. He liked the look and height of the stand, but because the page holders are not that far from the stand itself, the book could only be placed on the stand if it was opened in the middle. Since the entire book has recipes, this was not feasible and we had to return the stand. If you don't have thick cookbooks, this stand is very nice. If you *have* thick cookbooks like \"The Joy of Cooking\", you will need to look elsewhere.",

This cookbook stand is WONDERFUL. It is very sturdy, I love the height and angle that it provides. It's actually practical for using while cooking, because you can easily read the page. It's heavy and doesn't tip. I also enjoy just having my favorite cookbook open on the counter now, or inspiration for what the next dinner is going to be. Highly recommended.",

When I'm not using it for cooking I display a cocktail book in it on top of my liquor cabinet, which looks really nice.",
