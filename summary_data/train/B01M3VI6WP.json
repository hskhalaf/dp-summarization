The large fits comftably too but too tight looking for my liking.

This size is perfect for me though when going in the water. Overall quality is nice.",

I guess the shirt has to be if you are actually surfing. I just use it for sun protection over my bathing suit, and it works great for that. No sunburns all day!

The \"deep sea\" blue is a brighter blue than pictured, but I like it. The fit is tight to the skin, as it is supposed to be. I am 5'3\", about 120lbs, 32D chest and the small fits me as I would like it to. Will probably get another in a different color!",

I prefer this fit, and will really enjoy it. The color (Riviera) is a lovely medium blue - the picture does not do the color justice; it is more rich than the photo shows. I am thinking of ordering another one in another color. I can't attest for the sun block effect; I'll update this post in early October.",
