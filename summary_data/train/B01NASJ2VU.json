Daddy Tiger's head was not properly attached to his body so he has a giraffe like neck. The paint job on these is below a sub par level. Looks as though I let my daughter paint them herself. I honestly expected more out of this product for the price. If my review is hard to understand....... Go to the dollar store and pick up one of their barbie dolls they have..... These are the same quality. DISAPPOINTING. I do not anticipate they will last long.",

No other figures have a loose long neck like her or really a neck period. And her head is enormous compared to Dad Tiger which makes no sense. Also the paint seems to wear off rather easily from playing but I don't have super high expectations for painted plastic. Bonus: I bought a dollhouse for my daughter and was going to buy special dolls for it but she's been playing with the whole neighborhood in the house so it worked out perfect!",

The packaging was plastic that was so tightly wrapped around the figures I had to try and cut them out with scissors and then had really sharp plastic that could seriously slice up a hand. Basically this seems like the cheapest of Chinese made products and I\u2019m really surprised it\u2019s sold by amazon and not a third party seller.",
