I've been on them for 3 months and won't go without. My order from Amazon came fast and the price was less than I can get at my doctors office. I highly recommend Nordic Fish Oils. No fishy taste and no burping. The pills are large to swallow but I don't have any problems with that. I am SUPER sensitive to most supplements so was pleased that these not only settled good they helped.",

They are sturdy and have not had any of them break yet, but a better insulated shipping package needs to be used for this product for a least the summer months.",

This fish oil is nothing more than snake oil. Do not bother wasting your money consuming any Omega 3 or fish oil products. Thank me later.",

When I went to my Ophthalmologist, he did a test to measure the tears in my eyes... he could not get a measurement in my right eye (no tears) and my left eye was very low tear production. I was in so much pain, I gave myself a black eye by rubbing them. After a few months, the irritation was gone. I use eye drops when I get up in the morning, but for the rest of the day, I produce tears.",
