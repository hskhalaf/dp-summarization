      "text": "This clock has reduced the problems my 88-year-old mother has been having keeping the days straight. It's also been a blessing because it notes the time of day: in Ohio in December, it's dark at 6 AM and 6 PM, and Mom was getting really confused. I've put one upstairs in her bedroom and another downstairs in a central location. The one in her bedroom \"coordinates\" with her 31-days-of-the-month pill box, so it helps with pill-taking, too. The day-to-day of dealing with a loved one's dementia can wear one down--no matter how much one loves the person--and even little helps like this clock provide relief. Thanks so much for developing and marketing it.",
