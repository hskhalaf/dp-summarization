      "text": "I use it for sanding the inside curves on wooden toy parts and works fine. I rated it 4 for a couple reasons. The inserts do not come all the way to the top of the table. This leaves a sight lip that catches smaller parts or when starting at the end of a larger part. The inserts also just set in the table and are not secured. Additionally, the largest of the washers provided for the larger spindles and sleeves does not fit the arbor. Washer are easy to find locally, but one would expect the tool to come with the correct parts. On the plus side, the spindles/sleeves are easy to change.",

I gave it a 5 although there were 2 small issues. 1,being the sander has excellent storage for all parts except the washers, and 2 the recess for the inserts was just a bit too deep. I simply added pieces of electrical tape to the recess and it solved the problem.. having said that, the sander works as promised and solves a host of my difficult sanding issues. If I ever need another one I will buy the Triton again.",
