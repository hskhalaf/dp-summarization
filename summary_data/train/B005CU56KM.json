So I will give it four stars because it did clean and it did spray.",

Having said that, it works beautifully on brake parts and cleaning unwanted paint and tar on your wheels. Use judiciously around rubber. Not to fear getting it on rubber parts but I wouldn't coat a rubber part with it and try to use that as a cleaner. Precautions are listed on the can. Invaluable tool for a brake job and cleaning. Recommend it highly.",
