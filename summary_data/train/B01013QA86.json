It was generally easy to install and self explanatory, but I'm good with my hands. These kinds of things come easy to me. The anchors and lags that came along with it are VERY heavy duty and I'm extremely confident that the projector isn't going anywhere. My projector has only 3 mounting holes, I wasn't sure how that would work, but it ended up working out just fine.",

Instructions include info on mounting on concrete and more. For connecting your projector to the mount, there are 4 sizes of 4 screws each included, so this should work for mounting just about anything; you likely won't need to purchase separate screws. Once installed, it's easy enough to adjust; you can tighten the screws as needed with the included hex wrench. Would buy again.",

The large bolts require an 11mm nut driver, so if you were planning to install with a cordless impact, check your sockets before you get started. You can use a Philips, but if you are driving them into anything solid, (and you should) then you will probably round them out. Extremely easy to adjust. Would absolutely love a quick release for removing half of the bracket with projector. I'm using it under the roof over my patio. Don't like leaving the projector outside. So taking off easier would be great. 1st world problems.....",

My projector is pretty light, so maybe that helps, but this one met all my needs and looks pretty good doing it",

We have been using it for about two months now, and it holds up VERY well - keeps our picture pretty much exactly where we want it without ever really moving or shaking. For the price, you have to buy it! Cheap and holds up great! I would highly recommend.",
