It's possible for the back to come off, as it is only held on by three small tabs, and it is possible for one of the tabs to break, which spells trouble. I guess there's a patent, as I can't find a competitive product. For now, I'm happy and I'll always have one on my phone.",

It was the best pop socket ever. But I got a new case and so just left the old one on that case and bought this one to put a customized ETSY sticker on. But I\u2019ve had it on since last night and it is constantly popping off and will not stay on no matter what. Very sad about this. Don\u2019t want to buy another here so guess I will just have to go to a store and buy a plain one and replace the tops.",
