I am a member of Team GB Sports JuJitsu Squad, and needed a pair of trainers but I do have a Wide fitting especially on one foot, so the big brand trainers you see in the sports shops simply won't fit as they are always too narrow. These sketchers I found to be a very comfortable fit, good for everyday training around the gym, and comfortable to walk/run in. Hope they don't change the style as I will definitely be buying another pair soon. The fastenings also make them ideal for my particular training as they are on and off all the time.",
