The button holes look like they will wear out after one or two more uses, the material is very thin and cheap feeling, and to top it all off both sides of the cover are different shades of brown (chocolate cover ordered). You can clearly tell that the 2 pieces of fabric stitched together to make each side are NOT the same color and one side is a brownish red color while the other is actually chocolate.

The Duvet cover itself is great, and the King fits my comforter perfectly. The fabric is soft and comfortable and washes and dries well. I liked it so well I bought a second one.",

If you are arthritic or struggle with tasks like this I\u2019d steer clear of this cover and opt for one with a zipper. Additionally, I wish it had a couple more tie-downs on the inside for securing the duvet insert so it doesn\u2019t slide around.

So I will have to try to give it a go in the wash machine I've bought stuff like this in the past I never really encounter smells like that but it is pretty soft and the color is accurate so I will just have to see till after. OK so after I wash it the ties begin to completely break apart??? It supposedly come with 3 ties that you can tie around your comforter but it breaking apart....added photo for reference",

The comforters didn't fare as well but the duvets are still super soft and comfortable. It surprised me as I didn't expect much at this price point. I'm back now to but myself one!",

I searched for ages and finally decided to get an inexpensive solid color duvet cover while I continue to look for something nicer. This duvet cover is soft and comfortable to sleep with. However, the material is thin and doesn't look very good on the bed. It looks cheap. I understand that it's not a high-end item, and will be purchasing something nicer to replace it. But if you need something inexpensive and soft, this will do.",

The stitching looked like it was done well and the thread that was used did not shrink causing the material to pucker after two washes and machine drying. If it lasts for a couple of years, it was money well spent. My daughter just loves it.",

It was such a struggle to figure out how to do it when we got the other cover. But the instructions helped--still took 2 of us to get it right. The price for this cover was pretty incredible. It was much lower than all the others we'd looked at. But it's a good quality and we're very pleased with it.",
