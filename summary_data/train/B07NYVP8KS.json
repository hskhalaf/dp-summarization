I figured we could test out and placed the order. The bed came in less than a week and we were ready to try out each side. Much to my surprise, the bed was very comfortable and large enough for the three of us to sprawl out on. The cooling gel support foam was a plus especially since my husband and child are hot blooded sleepers. I definitely recommend this bed and may make future purchases!",

Also, it's extremely heavy so keep that in mind when it's delivered so you have help getting it to your bed frame, opening it and flipping it to the side you want to sleep on. *Update -9/14/2019* This bed is still comfortable and still looks great with no sagging anywhere.",
