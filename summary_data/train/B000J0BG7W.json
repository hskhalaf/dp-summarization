I just purchased my second D24000 after the bearings started going bad after 8 years of use. The reasons I like this saw are, the light weight and portability of the unit, water containment ability, and the good power and accuracy of the unit. I saw some of the reviews from other tile tradesmen that said their second unit wasn't of the same quality. I decided to roll the dice and hope I get one that gives me a similar period of use.",

I attached a drain hose to the catch basin drain so the dirty water flows out continuously, these two steps makes cleanup very easy and extends the life of the saw significantly.",

Very powerful motor, which means it can cleanly cut tile with ease and lack of dragging itself down. Accurate and well built. Easy and fast to switch back and forth between 90 and 45 degree cuts. Good water containment system for jobs where you have to be concerned about that detail. Easy to set up, easy to clean up. I love bidding tile jobs now because I know the saw will hold up to the task.",

      "text": "In order to precisely cut porcelain, natural stones , or ceramics, a certain amount of mass and momentum are needed along with consistent blade speed. The DeWalt , by default, is necessarily hefty . However, it's design allows easy set up despite its weight. It is a delight to use and has made all of my tile work much easier. I am primarily a bathroom remodeler and use this saw very frequently. By far, this is the best designed, easiest to assemble, labor facilitating, and accurate cutting tile saw I have owned. All of that costs a bit, but is well worth the price in consideration of how well this saw performs.",

The tubes move so watch that part. I'm extremely happy with the performance of DeWalt's D24000 and cleanup is done within 10 minutes! I don't have the stand and I don't need it.

We're about halfway done with the shower and bathroom floor tiling, and it's running just like it did out of the box. Blade is just as good as this morning when I unboxed it.",

    "title": "DEWALT Wet Tile Saw with Stand, 10-Inch (D24000S)",
    "description": "Style:Wet tile saw w/standThe 69-pound D24000S 10\" Wet Tile Saw allows a one person set up and transport. Stainless steel rail system is integrated into the tile saw frame, insuring accurate cuts. Rear and side water attachments can be placed on tile saw to catch over-spray from large tile to keep the water in the pan.The D24000S includes a 10\" Wet Tile Saw with a stand that folds for easy transporting and storage. The stand holds the 69-pound Wet Tile Saw and provides an ideal work space. Durable aluminum framing and stainless steel rails are built to stand up to the tough jobsite environment. Lightweight folding stand easily sets up on the job and stores in the truck\n\nAMAZON.COM\nLight, ultra-powerful, and a breeze to set-up, the D24000S from DEWALT is ideal for renovating bathrooms, cutting porcelain and stone, or tiling a kitchen back splash or floor. The D24000S ships in two boxes and includes the D24000 saw and the D24001 stand. The saw motor tilts and locks at 45 or 22.5 degrees for clean, smooth cuts without the need for an accessory cart block, and adjustable rollers help properly align the table. When tackling large projects, you'll appreciate the 24-inch ripping capacity (18-inch tile on diagonal). To ensure smooth operation, two adjustable water nozzles allow for the correct positioning of spray on the blade, while optional rear and side water attachments capture over-spray so water stays in the five-gallon pan. Additionally, a 3-1/8-inch depth of cut gives you the option of cutting the majority of V-caps and pavers, and an edge guide with dual position 45-degree guide makes it a snap to line-up corner cuts. There's also an efficient 1.5 HP motor, flip-style edge guide for 90 and 45 degree set-up, and a tub-style bottom with four molded sections that fit into the included stand. And because there's a fully integrated durable stainless steel rail system in the saw frame, you'll enjoy precise cuts every time. When you're done for the day, the removable cutting cart gives you better access to the saw so you can clean up quickly and easily.",
