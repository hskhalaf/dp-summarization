This is a fantastic dresser. If you lay pieces out before assembling and follow instructions it's a breeze to put together.",

The only issue is it has a VERY strong particle board smell that off gases throughout the House. This was placed in an upstairs bedroom and the smell made its way downstairs. It went away after a few days, but I might suggest opening the box in a garage and letting things air out before putting it together to bring indoors. I would place it in a nursery until letting it air out. Other than that great product !",

The directions very specifically tell you which ones to use for each application. The dresser was even easier to assemble than the night stand because we were used to their method of assembly and it went quicker. We were amazed at the accuracy of all the pre-drilled holes and cuts. It is an amazing piece of furniture for the price. We highly recommend Sauder products.",

Love Best Furniture Buys, they have the best prices and always happy to answer any questions you may have. The dresser says salt oak and looks like some type of oak in the picture, but dresser is really a streaked gray taupe color. Beautiful and great piece of furniture. Thank you Best Furniture Buys!",

Although each piece is referred to by letter in the directions, many of the pieces were not lettered. Aligning the drawers was a nightmare. One part arrived broken in half. It took two days to put together. Then, I had to take it apart because two pieces were facing the wrong direction. It's a nice looking dresser, but definitely NOT worth the effort.",
