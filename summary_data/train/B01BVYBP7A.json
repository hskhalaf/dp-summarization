The problem was the slats for the seat(s) started to split, flake and come apart after only 1 week. The company has been working with us and has a solution to resolve the issue but now I have to listen to my husband tell me he told me so. :/",

Nice wood, but I applied 2 coats of clear protectant to be sure the rain wouldn\u2019t destroy it. The table sits 4 regular sized adults easily....probably 6 children. The bench... 2 adults comfortably. Well thought out design makes it doubly useful. 2 adults can move it easily. 1 adult can do the conversion from bench to table easily. We like it.",

I already started noticing cracks on the wood and other parts are starting to peel. This table is not weatherproof and will require a wood sealant to keep it from deteriorating. Overall, I love the concept and versatility of this product but it could have been executed better.",
