That may be true, but I think they have been subtle at best and still find them to be the best sneaker for me. The Guide 10 is my new running shoe, the Guide 9 is retired to my daily use, and the Guide 8 is the new mowing shoe. 5, 6 and 7 have since been put out to pasture where all great sneakers eventually wind up.",

I can't rate the arch support because I always replace the insoles with Superfeet Orange. The soles last about 500 miles which isn't great, but the cushioning is pretty much degraded by then anyway.
