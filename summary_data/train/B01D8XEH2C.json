They have added some complexity to the game that makes it more challenging and, in my opinion, a lot more fun. It takes a little longer to play this version because of the added complexity (don't worry, it isn't too complex), but it is so much fun! I highly recommend this to any Clue or Harry Potter fan. Even if you don't think you like the game Clue, you might like this because of the changes to the game.",

I was nervous about the age range but really think it is more for the actual clue game. \"Who killed who with what\" makes sense to have a 9+ rating. But this game is \"who used dark magic on who\" So less dramatic and easy for my 6 year old to play.",

The board layout is much closer to the orginal (small squares rather than the newer rectangle squares that rarely leave you out of a room). The rotating disks and dark mark effects (with possible defenses) add a great dimension to the game and the possibility of losing all your house points gives a sense of immediacy to the game.",
