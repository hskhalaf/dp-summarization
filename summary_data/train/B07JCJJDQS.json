Because of this we thought we were using the wrong screw and used a longer screw from the pack which punctures through the top shelf. We have it held together with about 50% of the long screw jolting out but you can\u2019t see it because it is under the shelf. It still made me frustrated because it\u2019s damaged now after I paid full price. None of the other screw spaces had this problem.",
