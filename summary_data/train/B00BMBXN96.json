I needed a table for a special weekend and there was no time to go out and get a different one. It looks great standing in my entry way but it\u2019s crap. The fake wood decals didn\u2019t even meet in the corners all the way. I\u2019ve put together a ton of these things and never had any issues like I have with this one.",

The directions were excellent; I've got to compliment the technical writers at the company. *NOTE* Pay close attention to their directions! You will save time if you carefully read each instruction not having to disassemble portions and re-do them correctly. The finished product looks great and will serve the purpose I purchased it for very well. I'm pleased with the quality and the price, and would recommend.",
