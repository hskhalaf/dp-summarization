      "text": "Purchased this after returning my second HiBy because of many software and hardware glitches. I figured buying from a name brand Sony these issues would be ironed out. SOny has it right for the Sound System, it is much better than the HiBy, but not for Double the Price. The Hiby was nice becasue it had a nice bright screen and great processor, the sound was good, not great. The Sony device had superb sound, but a very slow processor - and multiple software crashes since you cannot run multiple apps at the same time. Also every time the screen turned off, whatever app you have running closes. These things made using the device unenjoyable and frustrating.",

More details, deeper bass, crispy Treble, more precise and wider soundstage filed. Also the smoother overall sound quality compares with AK120II's crisp but sometime over harsh sound. Also if you want to connect this player to your car stereo system, this NW-ZX2 has no problem to connect with the recent car's infotainment via USB port. Astell&Kern AK120II has the connection issue. Most of important is cheaper than AK120II, Only down side, just the size is little bigger and weight little bit heavier.",

The only problem I've encountered is that the Car Android app isn't supported by this version of the operating system. Then again, maybe there's a way I can get it to work. Maybe trying to hook it up to a car stereo defeats the purpose High Res files and player. We'll see.",
