This superbly lightweight yet supportive multi-sport sandal offers high levels of comfort and durability. It is also praised as a quick-drying footgear that performs well in wet conditions. It provides excellent ground stability and surface traction.However, there are people who shot it down for its abrasive ankle straps, and sweat-inducing footbed. All in all, it remains a likable athletic hiking sandal despite its reported criticisms.",

      "title": "Useful addition to collection",
      "text": "Initially, sandals felt really dense underfoot. Could feel the ridges in the rather firm foot-bed and feared these and the straps around ankles would cause friction over time. Was pleasantly surprised to return from a 100 minute country walk quite early on and before properly breaking them in, without a single blister. In fact, these are fast becoming my 'heavy duty' sandals. A size 5 does feel a trifle wide and large, (am 4.5 - 5) but better than having feet spilling out. Further, having flat feet, I like it that the foot is well-supported. It's always good to alternate shoes, but these are definitely a useful addition to my collection.",

Also, very small on size, feet were right to the edge so offers no protection on stubbing the toes. Very disappointed, really wanted to like these!!",

They do have an unpleasant odour. Overall though, I'm very pleased with them, you can wear them with trousers or summer dresses and they don't look clumpy at all.",

I choose this colour because I thought that they looked more dressey. Again there was no breaking in period, they fit purfectly and are as comfortable as my first pair.

I normally take a uk size 4.5 and took the advice of other reviewers and sized up to uk size 5. Fits perfectly so if you are in between sizes definitely size up. Would not normally order beige but they will go with lots of colours. They are extremely comfortable on and widths can be adjusted which is a must in hot temperatures whiltst walking on sightseeing holidays. Would order them again and get a different colour and pay more to as so comfy.",

They are colourful, practical, feminine, but are also fashionable. I wear mine all year round because they are so comfortable. It is hard to take them off if it snows and I have to put boots on. I love them also as they are great in wet weather as they dry quickly and do not get all squishy like trainers etc do. I have mobility problems and the professionals always comment what great sandals they are to wear for people with my problems. Highly recommend",

I can certainly put up with that minor inconvenience in order to have comfortable feet!",

    "description": "The Tirra by Teva was designed specifically for a woman's foot in order to provide unmatched comfort and performance in the water and on land. With its unmistakably feminine strap configuration and multiple adjustment options for a secure fit, the Tirra can tackle any obstacle with ladylike grace - just like you.\n\n * The rubber outsole offers uncompromised grip and a water-channelling lug pattern helps to maintain solid footing. \n * Water-ready synthetic and polyester webbing upper is highly durable and dries quickly after getting wet \n * Easy hook-and-loop closure comes on and off quickly and gets the fit just right \n * Contoured eva footbed supports your arch to keep your foot happy and healthy \n * Treated with microban, a zinc-based antimicrobial technology that helps prevent stink \n * A cushioned shoe pad in the heel absorbs impact where you need it most \n * Spider original rubber outsole is highly durable and supplies significant traction \n * Nylon shank stabilizes and supports your foot on uneven terrain\n\nTeva was born in the Grand Canyon back in 1984, when a river guide rigged two Velcro watchbands to an old pair of flip flops and created a shoe that wouldn\u2019t float away. Three decades later, we have grown up into an icon of comfort and utilitarian style.\n\nHow you choose to live is the utmost form of personal expression and around here, we want to seize every second - to live light and loud. If you are up for anything and love the thrill of spontaneity, then Teva is your people. This adventurous spirit - the one that pioneered the very first pair of Teva sandals - takes form in everything we create.",
