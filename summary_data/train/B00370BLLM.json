We even put it in the back of our SUV for an hour or so and it removes all odors. We like the product enough that this is our second machine!

      "text": "I'v been looking to buy one of these for a while now since we use very similar models at work all the time. This one is better having a UV light built in as well. Ran it on low all night with just the air purifier/sanitizer on and noticed the difference in air quality when we woke up this morning. Will set it up to run the ozone for a an hour or so while at work over the next few days and see what that does.",

I've got 2 King Charles pups and it also helps with dust/dander on the cleaning function.",

Wrote 2 emails to company and both were responded to in just a few hours answering my questions on square footage of coverage (3000-3500) and warranty (2 years). Now if only the unit cleans up my damp and mildewed basement as is advertised, it will deserve the 5 star rating. I am optimistic.",

I bought it because my kids have many allergies and we had just painted their room. The filter is also a little louder than I thought it would be for a small room. It's nice, compact and seems to be doing the job quite well. Will purchase another one for a trip overseas!",

    "title": "Green Air Pro 2 Plate HEPA Alpine Air Purifier Ozone Generator",
    "description": "Working in conjunction with its triple filter system, the air purifier pulls in unclean air from the rear passing it through the Pre-filter, HEPA filter, and finally the Photo Catalytic (PCO) filter. These filters are able to capture airborne contaminants as small as 0.3 microns. Only Green Air Pro features this triple air filter system, making the air in your home wonderfully clean. The anion emitters, now moved forward of the fan to the front panel, release trillions of negative ions into your home, attaching themselves to dust particles, and dropping them straight to the floor. This advanced function is ideal for eliminating dust, animal dander, and other particles that float in the air. Left behind is fresh oxygen rich air. Green Air Pro also features a UV lamp. When you need to eliminate strong or offensive odors in your home, the Purifier mode creates activated oxygen (ozone) based upon the square footage of your home. Perfect for eliminating tobacco smoke odors, cooking odors, chemical/cleaning agent odors, paint odors, etc. The activated oxygen will also eradicate pollution embedded in walls, ceilings, floors, carpets, furniture, clothing, countertops....all surfaces in your home. Use Purifier mode (ozone function) when home is unoccupied on units built in timer. Ozone reverts back to oxygen after approx. 30 to 45 minutes. Ozone generation: 360mg/hr per plate. Return home to fresh, clean, oxygen rich air, provided only by the 4 advanced technologies of the Green Air Pro Digital Air Purifier!!",
