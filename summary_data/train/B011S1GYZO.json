Terribly over priced as far as I'm concerned and doesn't work as claimed. Don't waste your money, there are better products to be found. Try a dry powder such as CimeXa.

A word of caution - Do not leave spray hose in jug, or entire contents will leak out overnight! Remove it after ever use and jug will last for months.
