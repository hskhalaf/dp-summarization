We received a scratched and dirty pan, that clearly spent time in a warehouse poorly protected. You need to protect your products MUCH BETTER! Also why do you need to put industrial glue inside the pan, just to hold a piece of paper? We buy expensive products because we want to avoid low quality, harmful crap. Adding this chemical junk inside the pan is plain stupid. As a reminder we are going to heat the pan up and cook food inside!! I'm having a hard time getting rid of the glue deposit. Really stupid and disappointing Le Creuset!!",

This means it's not great for baking things such as corn bread or pies. Also, the heaviness of the metal is not the same as a cast iron pan, it heats faster and holds heat for less time. If you're used to cooking with cast iron, you'll need to learn again to use this pan.",

      "text": "Good, sturdy skillet. The only problem is that it is not a non stick pan. You have to really coat it with a little oil before cooking anything or else your food will stick to the pot. Stuck on food is difficult to remove. I had to soak in warm soapy water and then do a little scrubbing. Otherwise it is a good skillet. Once heated, it cooks nicely, and you don't have to turn up the fire too high.",
