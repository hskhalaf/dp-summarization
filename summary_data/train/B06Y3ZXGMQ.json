Replacement arrived one week after dead monitor was delivered to vendor. Getting info about the replacement was like pulling teeth. Vendor did not return email and never provided shipment confirmation or tracking. Tilt hinge on monitor stand was very, VERY stiff. Lubricated it with WD40 and used vice grip pliers to wiggle it back and forth. Afraid to tilt monitor for fear of breaking something. Otherwise, very pleased with purchase.",

Once we finally got through the assembly, we had to stare at this horrible bright picture which we couldn't adjust because the buttons don't work. There was also a weird error message on the screen that we couldn't clear. This is all right out of the box. The thing also just felt flimsy and cheap. Let's just say I'll never be buying anything by this brand again.",
