After that, done...no touch up or painting at all. It is small but holds what I purchased for. Not fireproof but I also purchased fireproof pouches. Looks very nice, works well. Instructions for changing code, etc are a bit sketchy but, I eventually figured it out. Good buy.",

But this isn't always convenient, especially if you want daily access to your important belongings. A Protex wall safe would then be a good investment. Specially, since you will be storing some of your most valuable belongings in it. Protex wall safes are drilled into your wall, between studs. You can install a Protex wall safe when you are building your home or office, or you can put it in later. All Protex wall safes come with a flange so that you don't need to re-plaster the walls. Wall safes can be opened by electronic lock or biometric lock depending on the PWS-1814E you choose.",
