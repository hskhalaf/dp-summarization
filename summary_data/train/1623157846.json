      "text": "-Standard, basic information. Problem is the format, and the print and lack of proofreading. For instance, page 19 ends mid sentence. The missing information is important, essential. The recipes themselves are in smaller print, difficult to see because of the print size, font, and color of ink. And they are next to the binding, meaning the spine of the book has to be broken to be able to read the recipes. I will be returning the book because it's too difficult to read the information for me personally - (older eyes).",

My daughter is NCGS but preparing dinners for a family of 6 when at least half of them are extremely picking can be overwhelming. This book has taking a lot of the anxiety out of my shopping and preparing meals for my entire family. Thank you Pamela Ellgen!!!",
