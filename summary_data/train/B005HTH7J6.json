It took several hours to figure out what I was doing wrong, but when the rubber seal was properly placed the unit went in without any further issues. It is a quiet operating disposal, and my client was very happy with the unit.",

    "description": "The GFC320N garbage disposal by GE. The disposal's powerful grinding action reduces food waste to small particles, making the unit safe for any properly sized septic system.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\nLarge-capacity continuous-feed food-waste disposal with 1/3-horsepower motor. \nview larger 1/3-HORSEPOWER CONTINUOUS-FEED FOOD-WASTE DISPOSAL \nHELPS TAKE CARE OF THE DIRTY WORK\nSend food waste down the drain once and for all with this large-capacity GFC320V garbage disposal by GE. The disposal's powerful grinding action reduces food waste to small particles, making the unit safe for any properly sized septic system.\n\nEven more, the food-waste disposal features an advanced insulation package that helps ensure super-quiet operation, making it possible to maintain the cheerful, festive mood of a successful dinner party even during cleanup. Hardworking, quiet, and easy to install--the GE disposal makes a useful addition to any busy kitchen.\n\nCONVENIENT DESIGN\nThoughtfully constructed, the food-waste disposal system also provides a two-level precutter, an on/off wall-switch with a sink stopper, a manual-reset overload protector, a splashguard, and a direct-wire power connection, as well as stainless-steel, jam-resistant, dual-swivel impellers. Other highlights include cold-rolled carbon-steel armature shaft material, a stainless-steel sink flange, and a galvanized-steel turntable.\n\nEASY-TO-USE CONTINUOUS FEED\nTo operate, simply remove the sink stopper, turn on a medium flow of cold water, flip the switch to ON, and scrape in the food waste. The continuous-feed disposal takes care of the rest. Before turning the disposal off, let the water and the disposal run for about 25 seconds after the shredding and grinding stops to ensure all waste is thoroughly flushed through the trap and drain.\n\nThe disposal measures 5.19 inches deep by 5.5 inches wide by 12.69 inches high, and detailed installation instructions come included.\n\nGFC320V AT A GLANCE:\n * 1/3-horsepower motor\n * Large-capacity continuous-feed disposer\n * Over 2500 RPM grinding action*\n * Stainless-steel jam-resistant, dual-swivel impellers\n * EZ mount installation\n * Direct-wire power connection\n * Standard sound-insulation package\n * Cold-rolled carbon-steel armature shaft material\n * Splashguard\n * Wall-switch with sink stopper\n * Manual reset overload protector\n * Dishwasher drain connector\n * Stainless-steel sink flange\n * Galvanized-steel turntable\n * 2-level precutter\n\n* Based on RPM testing of cleared GE and competitive models\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nGE continuous feed food waste disposer has a high RPM and high torque, to grind food finer and faster. Which is really a big deal. Since select GE Disposal disposers can reach speeds of over 3500 RPM, while many brands can't reach over 2000 RPM, the Disposal disposers are less likely to jam. And, stainless-steel dual-swivel grinder blades means they're less likely to corrode, even after years of use. The Disposal offers a faster and finer grind right from the beginning. Now you can be free from the anti-jam key and able to power through food the first time, so you don't waste time. Installation made E-Z. E-Z Mount System makes installation a breeze for anyone. We have fewer parts and steps than most of our competitors' installation systems. The five-step installation starts by attaching a sink flange assembly. Then, the disposer snaps onto the sink flange under your sink, allowing water and waste to safely travel down the pipes. And, the Disposal easily attaches to your existing plumbing and wiring. After a quick installation, you can trust that your Disposal was made with stainless steel and corrosion-resistant materials for maximum lifespan and durability. Drain boost technology helps keep your drain free and clear of food waste to ensure your water runs smoothly in the right direction. The Disposal has an angled fin which pumps water and ground food through pipes with higher speed and pressure to keep drains purged and help reduce clogs. All our models operate quietly and some even offer sound reduction technology. The sound reduction package includes a fully insulated sound shell, so our disposers can handle your toughest challenges while minimizing noise. Did you know that Americans throw away nearly 25-Percent of all food prepared. And decomposing waste in landfills is one of the largest producers of methane gas, which is the main contributor of global warming It's true.\n\nSee more",
