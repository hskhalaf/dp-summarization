      "text": "A TOTAL piece of junk!!! I'd love to give this barbeque NO stars!!!! The cookware has painted handles which comes off!!! (SEE PIC). I bought this for my grandson and we saw black all over his face. When we picked him up we discovered the paint from the frying pan had come off and was in his mouth and on his face. A Total DISAPPOINTMENT from Little Tikes. As gramma I now feel I put my own grandson in danger from a toy made by a company that is no longer concerned about child safety",

Good value and good quality product. Wish I would of bought this sooner (purchased for 3 year old birthday).",

It's a little short for them but they still love it and don't seem to care...I gave it 4 stars because it could definitely be taller for the age it lists for use. They will be too big for it next year but will have lots of fun with it this year :)",
