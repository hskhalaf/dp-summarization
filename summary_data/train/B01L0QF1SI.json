But considering our cat sleeps on a wooden bench radiator he isnt complaining. It heats up nice. I can feel it to touch but not to hot. Hes been using it non stop for a couple days now. I would reccomend this. Well made. No foam to get misshapen. Zips off for easy cleaning. Cord is very well made.",
