In my case, it will be sitting atop leather ottomans atop a wood floors; this \"flaw\" would result in the ottomans and/or floors getting wet in case of spill. I would hope that the tray would be able to catch at least the contents of a small volume cup. I'm going to request a return. PERHAPS just a bad batch, as the picture in the ad does not make it look as close as in my pic (see my attached pic).",

Be aware that these are more of a satin finish and not the glossier finish you may be accustomed to if you've purchased similar products from West Elm or Crate & Barrel.

My one gripe is that they don't do a good job of painting the inside of the handles and so the finish is rough and not thoroughly painted but otherwise they are great.",
