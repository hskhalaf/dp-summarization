So be diligent and do it all. You have to keep after those nasty fleas, but they will soon be goners. Also be sure to get your kitty on Advantage or Frontline. This Pill is not a long term remedy for your cat but it will kill what is presently on your cat. DO THE FOLLOW-UP.",

In my opinion Capstar is a superior product...fleas either die or abandon ship within the first hour and they stay away for about 30 days. My cat tolerates Capstar well and one cannot beat the time to become effective. Price is competitive with Advantage II. One suggestion...give your cat a Capstar pill in the morning and put him outside immediately. One does not want dead or dying fleas in your beading, furniture, or carpet.",

I'm seeing this on reviews for every flea treatment for cats now.. just comb them thoroughly every day and use a small amount of tea tree oil dilluted with water combed through their fur to discourage fleas. I know it's such an awful problem, but these meds are pretty likely to kill your cat. So just don't. Ever.",

While Capstar works fast to kill adult fleas and alleviate a current infestation, a subsequent preventative solution is recommended to prevent future re-infestations from any existing flea eggs and larvae in the environment.
