With a small camera zoom you use the zoom to focus, like the Canon Powershot A590 where you have to zoom in really close and it will focus in. With this Canon Powershot SX10is when zooming into writing it does not take much zoom or any zoom at all it focuses right away with out zooming. This camera is made to zoom into objects at a distance like a neighbor doing something they should not be doing or a dog walker who does not pick up after themselves.",

This model also features a hot shoe for an optional flash. The Zoom-Browser software has been improved...good for maintaining files and simple photo fixes. (-) Had to buy a lense cap tether. Sometimes the auto-focus has trouble if you are zooming in too much on close-ups. (That's just a matter of getting used to the camera's quirks.)",

I would recommend this camera if someone is just looking for a really nice point and shoot camera that is a step before the SLR.",

Plus it is as easy to use as the old Canon. Rich",

    "title": "Canon Powershot SX10IS 10MP Digital Camera with 20x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom",
    "description": "Whether the action is fast or slow, close up or far away, you'll always get the shot you want with the PowerShot SX10 IS. This camera puts you on the cutting edge of advanced technology, with an incredibly powerful 20x optical zoom, 10-megapixel resolution, and new DIGIC 4 Image Processor for high-performance face and motion detection.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n Whether the action is fast or slow, close up or far away, you\u2019ll always get the shot you want with the PowerShot SX10 IS. This camera puts you on the cutting edge of advanced technology, with an incredibly powerful 20x optical zoom, 10-megapixel resolution, and new DIGIC 4 Image Processor for high-performance face and motion detection. \n\nPowerShot SX10IS Highlights \n\n\n\n20x optical zoom in action Stay close to the action with a 20x Optical Zoom, wide-angle lens and Optical Image Stabilizer\nThe PowerShot SX10 IS is equipped with a 20x optical zoom lens with a focal length of 5.0-100mm (35mm film equivalent: 28-560mm) that allows you to shoot any scene from wide-angle to telephoto. The camera uses a VCM (Voice Coil Motor) for high-speed, quiet, energy-efficient lens movement with precise control. Focal length is conveniently indicated on the lens barrel. \n\nThe lens is optimized to fully exploit its zoom length and wide shooting angle in concert with the camera\u2019s high 10.0-megapixel resolution. UD glass effectively suppresses chromatic aberration, while enhanced negative refractive power ensures that distortion at the wide-angle is also corrected. Further aberration is controlled with the inclusion of a double-sided aspherical glass-molded lens and ultra-high refraction index lens. \n\nPowerful 10.0-megapixel resolution for greater printing and editing\nThe PowerShot SX10 IS is equipped with many of the same features as a higher-end camera: an ultrapowerful zoom, eye-popping resolution and advanced picture-improving technology. 10.0 megapixels of resolution give your photography incomparable depth and ensure that any section of any shot can be enlarged and cropped with no loss in quality when you edit the image and even in large printout. It creates crisp, clear 13 x 19-inch posters. \n\n2.5-inch Vari-angle LCD for flexible viewing at nearly every angle\nThe camera\u2019s 2.5-inch LCD screen gives you the big picture, whether you\u2019re shooting, reviewing or showing off your images. This high-resolution screen offers a crisp, clear picture to make shooting, playback and using the camera\u2019s menu functions especially convenient. Clear and bright, it also features Night Display for easy viewing in low light. It also has an electronic viewfinder that provides sharp images when you shoot close-up with Super Macro shooting mode. \n\nNew DIGIC 4 Image Processor improves Face Detection, adds Servo AF, Face Detection Self-Timer and Intelligent Contrast Correction \n\nDIGIC 4 Image Processor\nCanon\u2019s proprietary DIGIC Image Processors have long set its cameras apart from the competition, and the new DIGIC 4 sets the bar even higher. Faster, more accurate noise reduction delivers better image quality, even at high ISO speeds. \n\niSAPS Technology is an entirely original scene-recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos, iSAPS works with the advanced DIGIC 4 Image Processor to improve focus speed and accuracy, as well as exposure and white balance. \n\nA new Face Self-Timer automatically detects an increase in the number of faces and makes the appropriate adjustments. For instance, to include photographer\u2019s face in a group shot, there\u2019s no need to rush in. Just put the camera on a stand or tripod, and specify Face Self-Timer, and the camera will wait for the photographer\u2019s face to get on-camera before it takes the shot. Motion Detection now tracks moving subjects in a much larger range, and the new Servo AF retains focus on a moving subject after the shutter button is pressed halfway -- allowing you to wait for the perfect shot without refocusing. Also, Face Detection and Motion Detection are markedly improved. \n\nIntelligent Contrast Correction Intelligent Contrast Correction\nDIGIC 4 also makes possible the new i-Contrast (Intelligent Contrast Correction) system, which controls the compensation level in pixel units to brighten dark areas while leaving bright areas unchanged for better images where the main subject is dark, and more natural transition. The PowerShot SX10 IS can even use i-Contrast in playback mode to adjust images that were shot without the setting activated. \n\nRed-eye Correction provides three options for removing red-eye from subjects in flash pictures.\n1) The Red-eye Correction during shooting actually identifies and corrects red-eye in human subjects as pictures are taken.\n2) The SX10 IS can be set to automatically detect and correct red-eye during image playback. 3) You can manually locate any red eyes in a scene during image playback on the LCD screen, and command the camera to remove them. \n\nLife doesn\u2019t give you second chances to capture special times. That\u2019s why the SX10 IS features ISO 1600 and High ISO Auto settings that reduce the effects of camera shake and sharpen subjects in low-light situations, giving you greater shooting flexibility. ISO can be expanded to 3200 when you select ISO 3200 Special Scene mode. \n\nMovieSnap mode lets you capture high-resolution still images while shooting a movie\nWith Movie Snap, you\u2019ll never miss a perfect still shot just because you\u2019re in the middle of shooting a movie. Simply press the shutter to record a high-resolution still. The PowerShot SX10 IS supports the MOV video format which reduces data volume by approximately 60 percent. This allows you to record longer movies while maintaining optimal image quality. \n\nA wide range of shooting modes to capture anything\nNow you\u2019re free to concentrate on what really counts--your subject. With the large, simple-to-operate Mode Dial, all you have to do is turn to the setting that best matches the scene you\u2019re viewing through the lens. The PowerShot SX10 IS does the rest. It chooses the perfect exposure, aperture and flash. Or, if you want to flex your creative muscles, choose Manual Control and do it all yourself. You\u2019ve got Special Scenes Modes to handle a wide range of common shooting situations--effortlessly. \n\nWith 24 Shooting Modes including 11 Special Scene Modes, you\u2019re ready for whatever shot comes your way. \n\nPrint/Share Button for easy direct printing and downloading\nThe PowerShot SX10 IS's Print/Share button makes direct printing easier than ever. Simply connect the SX10 IS to a Canon PIXMA Photo Printer or SELPHY Compact Photo Printer or any PictBridge compatible photo printer, press the lighted Print/Share button and print! Also use the Print/Share button to transfer images to a computer (Windows and Macintosh). \n\nPrint your own ID photos in up to 28 different sizes or use the Movie Print function to output multiple stills from a recorded movie on a single sheet with a Canon SELPHY Compact Photo Printer. \n\nWhat's in the Box  * PowerShot SX10 IS Camera Body \n * Lens Cap \n * Lens Hood LH-DC50 \n * Neck Strap NS-DC4 \n * 4 AA-type Alkaline Batteries \n * Stereo Video Cable STV-250N \n * Interface Cable IFC-400PCU \n * Solution Disk \n * User Guide",
