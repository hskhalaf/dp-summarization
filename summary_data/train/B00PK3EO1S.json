It was a life-safer for those first months and would recommend it to anyone. Was super easy to set-up and had no problems. It's not that heavy either, so we where able to bring it up and down the stairs as needed. Like all baby stuff, it's run it's course and you're stuck with baby gear. At least this one has pretty good resell value or a happy friend donation, like in our case. Hope this helps!",

      "text": "Our baby was in the NICU for 5 weeks and every time she would cry the nurses would put her in their mamaRoo. We thought, why not get this when we get her home? We never regretted it. She has a small reflux issue, and every time we are tired of holding her upright after feedings, we place her in the mamaRoo, and it works like a charm! She\u2019s entertained, and hardly notices that there\u2019s a difference. Sometimes she falls asleep there. I would recommend this to any mom who would like to catch a break from holding her baby, especially after feedings.",

I don't like how there's only a lap belt and not a complete chest belt. Seems unsafe for my now 3 month old who is getting more mobile. I personally wouldn't buy it again or suggest it to anyone.",

Frustrating is an understatement when you\u2019re trying to get a baby to nap for more than 30 min. Our second baby is only 14 lbs, so I can\u2019t imagine his weight is the problem. It\u2019s been handled gently and our first baby only used it up until 8 months. The sound quality is sharp and tinny.",

My baby cried whenever I put her in this and the various movements didn't appeal to her at all. I'm giving this 4 stars because it's a quality product and I'm sure this would be perfect for some babies. It just wasn't quite the right fit for us. I ordered the Graco DuetSoothe and it's much better for my girl.",

The seat itself doesn't seem to be comfortable, I have Baby Bjorn manual bouncer, where the seat is simple and much better. My baby is just not enjoying this bouncer. I found that Fisher Price bouncers worked much better in soothing my baby girl than this one. It has lots of tech features (music form the phone and remote control) but for me that didn't work, kid just is not a big fan of this one:( Have to say that materials used look and feel of a good quality. Price, not friendly!",

    "description": "It moves like you do. The 4moms mamaRoo infant seat bounces up and down and sways from side to side, just like parents do when comforting their baby. Select from five unique motions, like car ride and tree swing, and five different speeds. Choose from four built-in sounds or connect it to any MP3 player. The seat reclines to multiple positions to allow baby to lie back and relax or sit up and play. The mamaRoo is now Bluetooth enabled so you can control the motion, sound, speed and volume from your compatible smart device.",
