I am glad I bought this router. I give it four stars only because of the size. Operation wise it's great.",

You will need to connect this to your modem (supplied by your ISP) or it will not connect to the internet. It has excellent range and speeds across the house, as you'd expect with the multiple antennas. Although disappointingly, it was only marginally better than the ISP-supplied router I had previously. So perhaps better for larger houses with multiple users, which would benefit from the enhanced range and capacity this router supplies. It is a pain to set up and the instructions are not great - but they always are.",

I can't help thinking that I was doing something wrong somewhere, but according to the instructions you pretty much just plug it in and away you go. Perhaps it's better if you work in an office and have IT support, but for me I just couldn't figure out what the configuration issue was and that's a bit of a problem.",

    "title": "Linksys E8350 Advanced Dual Band AC2400 WiFi Router with Gigabit Ethernet (1.4 Ghz Processor, 4x4 AC, USB 3.0, USB 2.0/eSATA, MU-Mimo)",
    "description": "Enjoy fast wireless Internet speeds and improved range and performance with the Linksys AC2400 Dual Band Gigabit Wi-Fi Router. Great for gamers, and well-suited for homes with several people on the Internet at once, this dual-band Wi-Fi router uses 4x4 Wireless-AC (802.11ac) technology to produce four independent streams of data at once to increase speed and reduce lag and buffering. MU-MIMO ready* and featuring a 1.4 GHz dual-core processor, the EA8350 is designed to handle high-bandwidth activities and heavy network traffic.\n\nSimultaneously delivers four independent streams of data at speeds up to 2.33 Gbps**--six times faster than Wireless-N. View larger.\n\nUpcoming MU-MIMO technology will allow streaming and gaming on multiple devices without lag.* View larger.\n\nFour Gigabit Ethernet ports offer transfer speeds up to 10 times faster than Fast Ethernet. View larger.\n\n4X4 AC FOR FAST WIRELESS PERFORMANCE\nThe Linksys AC2400 Dual Band Gigabit Wi-Fi Router features 4x4 Wireless-AC (802.11ac) technology that is up to six times faster than Wireless-N.** Unlike traditional routers that deliver two or three data streams, the EA8350 delivers four simultaneous, independent streams of data at speeds of up to 1733 Mbps. The result is seamless Wi-Fi performance and better range that is ideal for gaming and video streaming on multiple devices. \n\nDUAL BANDS AND FOUR ANTENNAS FOR WI-FI COVERAGE\nThe E8350 has dual wireless bands of 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz and can deliver combined data transfer speeds of up to 2.3 Gbps (AC1733 + N600 Mbps) for a strong, reliable Wi-Fi signal over a wide range. Four external antennas project large, overlapping Wi-Fi patterns to eliminate dead spots and improve coverage. As a result, you can enjoy online gaming or video streaming without lag or buffering. The antennas are adjustable for optimal positioning. \n\nMU-MIMO-READY FOR FAST SPEEDS ON MULTIPLE DEVICES\nBuilt for high-bandwidth activities and heavy network traffic, the E8350 is equipped to handle MU-MIMO technology (multi-user, multiple-input, multiple-output) that enables people on the network to stream and game using multiple devices simultaneously. MU-MIMO can effectively triple the throughput of a Wi-Fi device, allowing for three times the number of users without any loss in speed. \n\n1.4 GHZ DUAL-CORE PROCESSOR TO SURF, STREAM, AND GAME SIMULTANEOUSLY\nFeaturing an enterprise-class 1.4 GHz dual-core processor, the E8350 maximizes throughput to both wired and wireless devices, making it ideal for streaming HD videos, playing online games, downloading or transferring large files, or performing other high-bandwidth activities. Unlike typical single-core processors -- which have to switch between data streams--a dual-core processor can handle multiple data streams simultaneously for better efficiency and performance. \n\nBEAMFORMING FOR STRONG, FOCUSED WI-FI CONNECTIONS\nThe E8350 features beamforming, an innovative technology that strengthens the wireless signal to specific devices within its range, rather than simply sending out Wi-Fi in a general direction. Beamforming also reduces interference from other devices for stronger Wi-Fi connections. So whether you're on a smartphone, a tablet, a Wi-Fi-enabled camera or camcorder, or a wearable computer, you can move about your home and access the Internet with confidence. \n\nUSB 3.0, ESATA, AND GIGABIT ETHERNET PORTS TO SHARE FILES\nThe E8350 comes equipped with a variety of leading technologies that make it easy for you to transfer and share files across your wireless network. On the back of the router are four Gigabit Ethernet ports, which are 10 times faster than traditional Fast Ethernet to provide the fastest wired speeds. To stream or send large files across your network at high speed, you can connect a flash drive to the USB 3.0 port or an external SATA storage device to the unique eSATA port. For printing or working with smaller files, the eSATA port also serves as a USB 2.0 port. \n\nWIRELESS SECURITY TO BLOCK UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS\nLike other Linksys wireless networking products, the E8350 features Wi-Fi Protected Setup along with WPA/WPA2 encryption and an SPI firewall to keep your home Wi-Fi network safely connected and secure. \n\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\nThis product requires a Wi-Fi-enabled computer that runs Microsoft Windows XP SP3, Windows Vista SP1 or later, Windows 7, or Windows 8 operating system or the Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.1 or later, Lion 10.7 or later, Mountain Lion 10.8 or later, or Mavericks 10.9 or later operating system. \n\nAC2400 DUAL BAND GIGABIT WI-FI ROUTER\nAT A GLANCE:\n * 4x4 Wireless-AC delivers four independent streams of data simultaneously\n * Dual wireless bands (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz) for combined speeds up to 2.3 Gbps (AC1733 + N600 Mbps)**\n * MU-MIMO-ready* to handle high-bandwidth, multi-user activities\n * 1.4 GHz dual-core processor for streaming, downloading, and more\n * USB 3.0, eSATA, and Gigabit Ethernet ports for wired connections\n\n*May require a software/firmware update to be made available for download at linksys.com/support. \n\n**Maximum performance derived from IEEE Standard 802.11 specifications. Actual performance may vary, including lower wireless network capacity, data throughput rate, range and coverage. Combined Wi-Fi speeds of 802.11ac 2300 Mbps (for two 5 GHz and one 2.4 GHz bands) is up to 2x faster physical data rate when compared to 802.11ac 1600 Mbps Wi-Fi routers. An 802.11ac adapter may be needed to achieve 11ac data rates. In order to achieve the best performance, router must be used with a compatible AC1300 wireless device. \n\n\n\nBOX CONTAINS\n1 x Linksys EA8350 Dual Band AC2400 Gigabit Smart Wi-Fi Router with Gigabit (1.4Ghz Dual Core CPU, 4x4 AC, USB 3.0, MU-Mimo ready) - EA8350-UK",
