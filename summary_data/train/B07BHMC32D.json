      "text": "I purchased this product because I always feel the need to raise my feet off the floor during flights. I considered others, but this one appeared to have the ease of use I wanted in a compact package. It folds up pleasantly small, and was an easy addition to my \"seat kit\" I travel with when flying. I did find it easy to use after an initial session figuring out the length I personally need it to be. It is simple to install, and I found it very comfortable to have my legs raised even more than I have been able to before (by placing my feet on my bag). A great addition to my must-have flight kit!",

But I will sleep very uncomfortably because I couldn\u2019t really move my feet much since I\u2019m short and there\u2019s normally only one position in which my feet touch the floor. This thing has changed that, I use it everywhere but in cars. It\u2019s awesome!",
