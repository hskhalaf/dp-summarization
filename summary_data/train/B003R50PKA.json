I must warn that it is very light weight. My youngest is very strong and active she can easily lift and drag this table. She had to learn to sit properly in the chairs. Chairs easily flip. A mat under the set is highly recommended. If the child is a climber, you must be very vigilant. My youngest was easily able to climb on top. It holds her weight. But table will easily give under the child. Both can eat, pretend play and color/write comfortably.",

You should probably be careful that your little one doesn't tip over if they are climbing all over the chairs, but that is a concern you should always have with any toddler size chair.

My teens just don't use the chairs. Everyone used to run out of flat pieces for houses but this helps with that.

The chairs don't have arms so they're easy to get in and out of but also a bit less stable and easier to fall out of, so your kid will need to be careful. Adults can sit in these too but I wouldn't recommend doing it all the time and be careful you don't lean in them. We keep the top off the table all the time because our daughter is always playing legos on the top. It's great for setting up a base of legos and then building upwards.",

The chairs, although used cautiously, will hold even Grandma and Grandpa when he wants us to sit and play. Our guess is that it will still be useable and suitable until he is 5 to 6 years old. Dupelos and Legos work great.",

We liked the look of it, the bright colors and the Lego cover on the inside of the table. The only problem with the set, which is a really big problem in my opinion, is that it's so light that the kids fall out of the chairs all the time and the table tips over so easily. I wouldn't recommend it, especially for young children.",
