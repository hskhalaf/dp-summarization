Not only did they work...it turns out they are far superior. In addition to being more comfortable than the silicone plugs they are also completely washable and the package came with two sizes for optimum fit. 10/10 will purchase again!",

The only thing to worry about is not to yank them out that I learn from experience as well I didn't read the instructions which cause discomfort or ear damage. So to avoid any ear damage you have to twist first then lightly pull them out.",

I'm an audio engineer and use these for hearing protection. I must warn you they block a tremendous amount of sound and may be too much for some.

They are comfortable in my ears and are soft yet keep the water out and not irritating to the tender part of my ear!!! Hopefully they will not stiffen up with time but I will watch for that but as of now I like them alot!",

Then I got some Mack's Ear Seals at the supermarket and was saved by those instructions. Here's what helped: you reach over your head and pull up and back on your opposite ear to straighten the ear canal before inserting the plug with a circular motion. Once I did that, I was able to sense the vacuum effect that makes them airtight. I haven't been in the water with them yet, but I have much more confidence in them now than before. I hope this information will help others who are new to using these!",
