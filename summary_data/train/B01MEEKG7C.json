      "title": "Authentic Ray-Ban",
      "text": "Exactly what I wanted. Matte silver frame and lightly mirrored round lenses. By lightly mirrored I mean you can see my eyes through the lens in bright light. The lenses are larger than John Lennon glasses, but smaller than Ray-ban\u2019s round tortoise shell sunglasses (RB2180). I\u2019ve had many Ray-Ban frames and the glasses, case, and the box they came in are absolutely authentic. I appreciated the glasses accessory kit that was enclosed :)",

I can wear them all day, and love it. I bought the cable temples and didn\u2019t like them. These glasses stay put very well with the regular ones. Face down, they stay put. Perfect flying glasses.",
