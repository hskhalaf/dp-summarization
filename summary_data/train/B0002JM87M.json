Later that night, I deflated the other tire and applied sealant to the tube to help future mishap. Tips: There is a tube built into the bottle. His wheels have Schrader valves, I used the cap to remove the valve stem and made the tube snug over the valve body. After applying the sealant, I put a little air in the tire and spun it. Then I applied full pressure and spun it again.",

Look up how much stuff to use, and use the full amount. If it says 8oz, then pump in 8oz. My golf cart tires have remained inflated, and that's the bottom line.",

Removed wheels, laid flat, removed stems, pumped in the Seal-r, replaced stem, manipulated each wheel to ensure coating of the sidewalls (some of the cracks were on the sidewalls), filled tires with air then re-manipulated the Seal-r around the sidewalls again, re-installed on tractors.

The tire never went flat and so far has held for nearly a month so I'm pretty confident it will continue to hold air.
