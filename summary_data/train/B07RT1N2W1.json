I'll have to save up for another one for my shed!",

Works well with the 4k Streaming Services and Panasonic UB820 4K Player, only thing which is a shame that no 3D option anymore for my Blu rays. Sound wise all OK with the TV Speakers but a decent sound bar would be best. Worth buying this option or the C9 if you have the funds.",

The blacks are beautifully black, the picture is excellent, and the sound from the built-in speakers is surprisingly good. In fact, we often just leave our soundbar (Cambridge Audio TVB2) off the TV obviously has less low end, but other than that it sounds great. It gets pretty mixed use - games, TV, movies, some sport (Formula 1) and all have looked and performed really well. A very nice touch is that it detects when we switch to the Xbox One and turns on auto low-latency mode itself. Very happy, and have a feeling we'll be using this TV for many years to come.",

The panel itself is incredibly thin, and the design is nice with tiny bezels all 'round. I haven't tested the sound quality as I use it with a receiver. Connectivity is good too, with gigabit Ethernet, WiFi, HDMI 2.1 (which supports eARC!) and many more misc. ports. The brightness in HDR scenes is good, but could be better IMO. That's my only gripe with an otherwise perfect screen.",
