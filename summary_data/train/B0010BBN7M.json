Also, if you get it, and you should if you need it, in spite of the price, go the complete distance3 and get the pillowcase made just for it. Do not get a cheap one. Get the u-shaped pillowcase that zips open on the complete outside for easy put-on and take-off.",

      "text": "This PIllow is AMAZING! I'm 21 weeks pregnant and could NOT sleep at all. I poured over tons of reviews online before I found this pillow. It is sooo comfortable. IT cradles you perfectly and its not too hot. Alot of reviews mentioned it going \"flat\" really quickly, I slightly agree that it does need some occasional fluffing to keep its shape but it is still super comfortable. The only gripe I had was that the \"u\" part where you lay your head can be a tad flat, so I sleep with another pillow under mine. Overall this pillow is a lifesaver and I simply can't sleep with out it. Its definately worth the price!",
