Setup, maintenance and settings are all intuitive and best of all, everything just works. Right out of the box. Another bonus: The number of features on this are amazing at the price point. Photo quality is excellent - slightly less crisp than the Epson but then all of the other drawbacks to the Epson make this the clear winner. A++",

The print quality is very good, the photo quality is outstanding in comparison to any other all in one I've used or seen. The copy quality is excellent, a bit slow, but fast enough. The scanning is quite good too. So far I've printed a good deal of material and still haven't had to replace any ink cartridges. The dual paper feed is nice and it knows which one to use. Canon hit a home run with this printer. I highly recommend it!",

ONe should grab manual and learn all it can do. wifi printing another definite plus. Scanner works like a dream. Like the auto feed for document scanning into say adobe professional 7 to create large documents.",

It scans and copies much faster than my previous scanner. It is not an extremely fast printer, but is not slow enough to be a problem. My only negative impression is that it uses ink faster than my other printers have. It is easy to manage the ink, however, because of the multiple ink cartridges and the ink monitor feature. Ink cartridges seem to be more reasonably priced, also, than some other brands. Overall, I am very happy with this printer and my Amazon purchase process.",

Love everything about it- It's big though, so you need a good footprint or side table.",

Scanning and print quality are very good and fast enough for home use. The only thing we noticed was with older photos, the scanned image colors can be a little off hue. Amazon as usual helped with non-biased reviews, fast shipping, and great customer support.",
