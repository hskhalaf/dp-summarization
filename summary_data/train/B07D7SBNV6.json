And yes, Karen, I feed my kids hot dogs...they are delicious! Both my 7 and 12 yr olds can operate it easily and love making their hot dogs themselves. We have used it several times and the hot dog and buns come out perfectly and there really isn't any clean up involved. May after a few more uses we will get some crumb buildup from the buns but that will be a cinch to clean up which is just another reason this thing is so awesome!",

Hot dogs are one thing that we do \"cook\" frequently. I also love toasting our buns. When I seen this, I knew we had to have it. This is so easy to use, place buns and hot dogs in, press button like you would a regular toasters; adjust dial setting depending on your preference. Hot dog basket pops out too which makes it easy to clean. Even comes with a cute pair of baby tongs to help you get them out.",

The hot dogs took two tries to cook properly, during which the buns barely got warm and fell apart in the toaster side. Better off sticking the frankfurters in a vegetable steamer -- better tasting, too! The bun toaster side a total zero. Could I get my money back if I return the unit, even though I discarded the original packing?",

It is extremely easy to make a perfect warm hot dog and it works fabulously. Also, the fun design was a huge positive and we all love the retro look.

It was easy to clean since there\u2019s a nice \u201ccrumb catcher\u201d in the bottom. The kids thought it was the coolest invention and it was easy for them to use. The only thing I would suggest is the tongs are pretty flimsy so just bring a better set of tongs to get them out",
