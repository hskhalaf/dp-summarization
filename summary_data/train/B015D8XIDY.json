It's hard to stuff into its case, and it definitely has that strange memory foam smell. It's extremely comfortable, but the comfort comes with a price. I'd say this pillow is more for people who don't have a limited amount of baggage/space for their trips.",

It is such a cute pillow and I have tried it out before I take it with me. Very comfortable and functional. It is smaller than a standard size pillow, but larger than a travel pillow. The fact that it is made in the USA makes it even more desirable. The manufacturer sends follow up emails to make sure that I am a satisfied customer. Rest assured (no pun intended).....I am totally satisfied.",

I use 3 pillows which s a problem when sleeping in a sleeping bag. This pillow solved my problem. I use it between my knees. It is very firm and comfortable. It is easily rolled up and put back in travel bag and expands when removed from bag.",
