Now that I am using it, it's like there is a current and the water is constantly moving so it all moves through the filter and keeps the water clear and clean. Maintenance isn't bad if you get a syphon and change half the water every couple of weeks",

Additional filtration would be best if you want more than a few glofish. Suggestions: Definitely buy your own glass heater and skip the plastic heater that comes with the aquarium kit. Buy a cheap thermometer that has the green strip to help you assure that the aquarium temperature remains stable.",

Would have given it 5 stars if the filter was a little better, but it's to be expected considering that all tanks come with a filter that isn't so great. The filter is, by all means, not bad. It does get the job done",

The bigger Tetra type fish are doing well and the little catfish I got for the bottom is doing great, and he's adorable! So I will give this 4 stars because behind the filter seems to be a death zone for the smaller guys. I also bought the bubbler with the blue lights and it gives the room a really great mellow vibe.",
