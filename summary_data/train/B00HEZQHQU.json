I have had no additional issues with this classic since using this product. (misfires, smoke from bad rings, etc). I do not feel any additional MPG, or performance using this product.

      "text": "I was skeptical about the these types of products and decided to try it on my 1999.5 Audi A4 1.8 Quattro. The turbo engine always has had a hard time with Texas heat and humidity. When I had the opportunity to drive the car at Circuit of the Americas I put this in the tank before filling up. It makes a big difference. Normally the car feels sluggish due to heat soak at temps above 95F and it feels as if the turbo is broken. With this product the car drives as if the temp is in the 70s with very good throttle response and no more sluggish feeling. Will keep on using this in the summer time.",

I recently put a different tune in my 04 Dakota 4.7 and with the need for higher octane than I can get at the pump I tried a few different octane boosters and out of all of them, royal purple made the biggest difference and work perfect for my application. I should have just tried rp first because I use royal purple produst in every part of my truck.",

    "description": "Item Package Quantity:1Royal Purple Max-Boost - 16 fl oz Can is a high-performance octane booster with fuel treatment that increases gasoline octane, reduces emissions, and enhances engine performance while stabilizing fuel. Max-Boost is formulated with MMT, which delivers the best octane enhancement to help eliminate engine-damaging detonation, pre-ignition, and pinging or knocking from low octane gasoline. Max-Boost is formulated for engines equipped with carburetors, port fuel injection and direct injection, as well as turbocharged, supercharged and nitrous-injected engines. Safe for use in leaded and unleaded gasoline's, and alternate fuels like gasohol, reformulated gasoline, and all ethanol blends. Max-Boost is safe for oxygen sensors and catalytic converters. Performance engine oils contain higher levels of phosphorus as an anti-wear additive, which can accumulate in catalytic converters and reduce their effectiveness. Max-Boost protects against phosphorus poisoning of catalytic converters.",
