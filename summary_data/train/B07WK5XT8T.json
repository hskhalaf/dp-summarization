But there just not as good as the competition. I have in fact just exchanged them for a pair of Sony WH1000M3 which I'll say do measure up. Significantly cheaper, punchier, better bass and all round clarity. The PX7s are good but not great & certainly not worth the price.",

I assure you these are awesome. The sound is amazing and battery life is long enough for two long haul flights. The packaging is exactly where and what you'd expect with Bowers and Wilkins. Connectivity with the app is top notch and auto cut off/pause when lifting a cup should you have to communicate with someone is awesome. My only small gripe is that they don't fold up as compact as my others but this is forgivable as the build is so tough. Recomended despite the price",

Seriously if you want an ok pair of headphones just to listen to music these will do the job but if you want ANY level of ANC ... look elsewhere.",

These are what the PX's should have sounded like to begin with. So musical, so clear, so rich and full. They really are the most enjoyable headphones to listen to. They're also super comfortable and much lighter. Brilliant.",

To my ears the PX7's have an unbalanced tonal set up. The treble is too forward/harsh and bass is over boosted. Strange because many Hi-Fi magazines really rate them and I'm running them on a Chord Mojo with variety of audio sources, including some Hi-Def. Maybe they just need running in a bit longer. Too late now but I'd send them back if I could.",

      "text": "The sound: Clean, detailed, present. Real buttons: well placed, with good \"feel\". Large ear cavities for comfort. Connects quickly to Avantree transmitter and does so without button pushing on transmitter. Good customer service trouble-shooting via phone. As others have mentioned, ear pressure is a bit strong (hope for \"break-in\"}. And receiving range is a bit less than my other headsets with same transmitter. Sound quality worth the $ and slight imperfections. Update: One star off for comfort. After two months, the pressure has not eased. Pity, as clearly the best sound out there. Any tips on correcting this issue?",

      "text": "I was unpleasantly astonished by the murky and low-volume sound of these PX7 headphones, with or without noise canceling engaged. The sound was so anemic that at first I thought something was wrong with my hearing. Then I tried the same tracks on my earlier P7 phones without touching the volume control, and was rewarded with vivid powerful sound. The P7 totally blew the PX7 away. Perhaps the PX7 is not suitable for my iPhone 11 Pro Max. B&W mentions only a couple of devices that currently support their aptX technology, and the iPhone is not one them. In any case, I have returned the PX7 and chalked this up as a lesson learned.",

SO, I ASK, ARE ALL THREE MANUFACTURERS USING FALSE ADVERTISIN CLAIMS? IF THEY CAN REDUCE AMBIENT SOUND,, WHY CAN'T THE ELIMINATE IT COMPLLETELY?",
