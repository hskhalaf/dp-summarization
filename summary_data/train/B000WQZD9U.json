Before we used it in the pool we sat him on top of the seat area and he loved it! He could balance perfectly with the support and play with the toys. In the pool he was more leaned back but could also lean forward to play with the toys. The puffer fish squeaks & they all float. The shader was amazing & snaps into place. He also took a nap on it outside the pool. Perfect!!",

He would float on the top and just kind of ride the waves, even bigger ones, even when it got deep, we felt very safe with our son like this as opposed to in our arms.",

However now that she is 8 months old, much more active, and is sitting up she sits too far down in the netting and the water goes almost up to her chin. Not safe! She will not be able to use this again until she is much bigger. So it's all right if your baby doesn't move much and just lays back and floats there or if your baby is larger. It does protect from the Sun depending on which way you are facing.",

Also to fold it you must have all the air out or it doesn't close well. I had to deflate it, fold it and then squeeze residual air out as it was folded.

The darn thing would not inflate. 3 of us tried for almost an hour. It's the worst product I've ever bought from Amazon. It's too bad because my Daughter could have really used it to protect her from the sun.",

I received the replacement very fast. 2 days! This float stays inflated. Unfortunately the seat is sideways instead of forward facing. The toys can\u2019t be reached easily but more importantly the sides don\u2019t provide as much support to prevent being able to lean over faCe first in water. This float is very cool if quality could make sure it\u2019s built properly before sending it to someone.",
