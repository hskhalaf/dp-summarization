She also woke up earlier each of those mornings, probable because she was uncomfortable from the deflated tube. Outer tube held up perfectly. We looked for holes, or leaks and tested for defects...couldn't find any...but the inner tube simply did not hold up.

The major downside: we've only used this bed maybe 5 trips and all of a sudden the inner mattress keeps deflating. Overnight it's lost a significant amount of air. I haven't been able to find a hole so I can't even fix it. it's just deflating halfway throughout the night.",

It was easy and quick to inflate and deflate. It comes with a compact air pump and a light travel bag. I packed it in a 20\" suitcase for our flight, and there was plenty of room to spare for his clothes and supplies. Note: I would not use this for an infant. The bed has pillow stitching just like a beach raft. I would be concerned about a baby rolling over facedown and not being able to breathe. Just my opinion.",
