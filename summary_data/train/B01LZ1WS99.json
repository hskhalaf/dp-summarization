I just got out of hospital, and they had heart monitors all over my body and when they removed the wires, it left black gooey all over my body. Soap and a lot of washing didn't remove this black sticker goo, but the wd-40 did and afterwards you just wash the oily spray off and you look like a new body. I always keep a can of wd-40.",
