One word of caution - the dishwasher usually takes this off, but there is a risk of handing your sister-in-law the glass labeled for your aunt at the last gathering if you don't pre-scrub - no big deal for us.",

I was using stemless wine glasses, so the cute wine charms that hang around a glass stem don't really work for identifying your glass. And I wanted everyone to have two glasses for comparison sake. So I could write each person's name in different colors so they'd know which glass was which. People thought it was really fun. The colors do tend to rub off onto your hand, if you aren't careful. But it washes off really easily. I've used them over and over. My mom and aunt even enjoyed decorating their own glasses last Christmas.",
