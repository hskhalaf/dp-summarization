I've tried giving her alternative brands or even mixes from Purina itself (e.g. one with vegetable blend) and it won't touch it. Now that it's older, it demands a mix of this and the Purina canned food (chicken & beef) mixed in with together otherwise it refuses to eat. Certainly a spoiled cat as far as what it chooses to eat but I think that's because Purina puts some kind of cat equivalent of crack in their food. ;)",

But cats are 'obligate carnivores' which must have meat as their very short digestive tract organs are bunched together; a lion's digestive tract is 6' long and a deer's is 30' (ours is 19') and like all carnivores, cats sleep longer than non-carnivores. Twice a day in a stainless steel bowl, I give my cat 3 different tablespoons of meaty cat food and some of this product, but not much; once she starts eating, like all of us, she gets a hunger boost from her system that keeps her eating the meat she doesn't like so much, but which is best for her.",

Overall, they are about 10 mm by 5 mm by 3 mm. Small enough for my cat who doesn't have teeth, but some pieces are pointy, which might be irritating. The bag could be better. Not easy to open and not re-sealable. The bag doesn't have calorie content written on it. Purina's website states \"471 kcal/cup\". Higher than average. Ingredients are suspect.

So far they are eating an appropriate amount which makes me happy!",
