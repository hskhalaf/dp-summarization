Also, the small bottle, even if it had been full, was not the quantity of ounces that the perm box contents said it would be. I am afraid to even try to use this product since with so little heat activator, it probably won't work and might damage my hair. Seller indicates product can't be returned because it contains hazardous materials that can't be mailed. However, they mailed it to me. I no longer trust Amazon and especially not their independent sellers. Buyer beware. You may not get what you paid for.",
