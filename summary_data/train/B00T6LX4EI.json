I love that it is adjustable so my small dog can still be in front, which is important to him (little dog syndrome!) Would recommend to anyone looking to make their life easier.",

I might consider buying harness vs using their collars and maybe they won't pull so hard. Over all, great product, and I did not feel uncomfortable at all.

If your dogs pull, I estimate the wear and tear on your arm will be cut by 33% because the jerking and tugging will be divided equally among the three parties at each of the three ends.

      "text": "This Coupler has made my life a bit easier! I have two medium-large dogs, 50lbs and 55lbs, and this coupler has enabled us to walk more cohesively as a pack than attempting to use two separate leashes (or tieing the leashes together at the midpoint). I like that the large circular joint prevents the leashes from tangling, and the dogs have more freedom to move around... I get compliments on it all the time at the dog park. It's very sturdy and of good quality. Edit: some time after the review, one of the leads separated from the ring... good thing it happened while I was leashing them and not while I was out dog walking...",

Both of the snaffle hooks swivel easily, which allows the dogs to \"orbit\" one another without tangling: a HUGE plus for me. The adjustment isn't drastic (16\" to 24\" means your dogs are between 2.5' and 4' apart at max) but otherwise no complaints.",
