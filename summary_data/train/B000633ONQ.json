At the larger bag price, it is a great value. A 30/20 blend like this one is energy packed. Great for pups, hard-working and sporting adults, and many more energetic smaller breeds. But unless you have a hard-working animal, something a little less rich might be more appropriate for a larger breed senior (especially those that enjoy laying around in retirement) .",
