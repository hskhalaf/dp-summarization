In my opinion, the beef sticks are better testing than the turkey sticks. Both are very good and I alternate them. I eat them as part of a low-calorie diet. The sticks I received from Amazon are tasting fresher that TJ's. My advice is to buy them every time you can find them on a daily deal. For regular consumption, if you have a TJ in your town, go and buy them from there and save at least 10-15%.",

They do not have a strong flavor (which might be a downside to some), and are more of a light pepper taste. I just wish they were a little more economically priced.",

I picked up a couple of these at the grocery store after I ordered them via Amazon. This is NOT a Slim Jim. There is no greasy texture, mouth feel, etc. There is a bit of a snap which I like but could have a bit more. I ordered the original and it is quite peppery so if you are spice sensitive, beware of that. I tried the Jalepeno flavor from the grocery store and found it less spicy and overall, am quite happy to find this 100 calorie, no sugar, no weird chemical taste, easy to transport hit of protein.",
