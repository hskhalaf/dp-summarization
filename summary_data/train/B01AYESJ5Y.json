The tines are closer, which worked better for hot dogs. No casualties on our side of the fire due to falling off. 5) They came in a nice carry bag, which keeps them all together and fits in my outdoor supply crate that gets hauled around all the time, so I'll always have them.",

They start to get too heavy if you extend them out too far and I'd worry about permanently bending them. Rotating is more difficult with a sausage than the marshmallow but it's possible to put 1 on each prong if you're in a hurry.",

One feature is worthy of special mention: a knurled thumb wheel on the fork makes rotating food easy for even cooking. I looked at other less expensive forks before ordering this set, but the others looked flimsy and cheap. Also, other products had numerous negative reviews that sent up caution flags. I'm sure they would not have held up under our use. I'm glad I chose the Jolly Green set. They're well worth the small additional price.",

The roasters themselves are great at well. I love the wood handle and the color (it's my favorite). The rotating thing (sorry I don't know the proper term) is so convenient and I honestly bragged about it to everyone when I brought them out to make smores! Highly recommended!!",

Would definitely buy more if needed too and they would make a great gift as well.",
