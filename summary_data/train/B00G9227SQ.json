Called Cobra direct- only to hear that this unit has been out of their product line for more than 2 years. I was advised to send it in to Chicago immediately, and they will replace it with a current model. So kiddies, the lesson here is- CHECK THE MFR WEBSITE TO SEE IF WHAT YOU ARE ORDERING FROM AMAZON IS A CURRENT MODEL!! NEW DOESN'T ALWAYS MEAN CURRENT!!",

I do not know if this particular unit was defective or if the detector model itself has these difficulties. I was sorry it didn't work out.",

      "text": "So many false alarms! I bought this for a 14hr road trip one way and since I was leading the pack I'd get one of these and wouldn't get anymore tickets in those communist states we pass through. Jeez it literally goes off at everything no matter the mode. 100 miles between towns and a wide open area for miles and this stupid thing is screaming it's head off. And it's just not for one signal either, everything possible!! Vg2, railroad crossing, emergency vehicle, X, k, kv or whatever. But if I did see a cop id see him scanning in median wayyy before this thing would even beep, boop or wake up shortly before I passed him.",
