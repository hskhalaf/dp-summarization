I've had it a week now and it just gets better. Have tried wet shaving with foam as well and couldn't be happier for the price. I've also had very expensive Brauns and in my humble opinion this is even better. Very easy to manually clean. Highly recommended.",

The trimmer is on the opposite side of the razor so you need to turn it around to use it and the trimmer is very short so almost useless. I also like the Braun cleaning method better which uses disposable containers rather than little detergent packets you have to mix with water. My plan is to try the Braun series 9.",

Just remove the cover and rinse with water immediately after each shave. I haven't bothered ordering replacement blades for fifty-five bucks given the bad reviews about the lack of sharpness. I just order a whole new razor each December when they are on sale for Christmas for a hundred bucks.",

Keeps the cutting blades from getting all nasty and causing acne. Best shaver IMO, will pay for itself especially if you have it for 9 years like my last one",

    "title": "Panasonic Arc5 Electric Razor, Men's 5-blade Cordless with shave sensor technology and Wet/Dry Convenience, ES-LV65-S",
    "description": "Style Name:LV65 Electric ShaverThe fully loaded Panasonic Electric Shaver and Trimmer for Men, ES-LV65-S Arc5, Wet/Dry with 5 Nanotech Blades and Flexible Pivoting Head, is packed with smart, innovative features that deliver a remarkably close and comfortable shave. The ES-LV65-S electric razor is a five-blade shaving system for outstanding shaver coverage and closeness, and features an active shaving sensor to detect different beard densities as you shave and adjust cutting power where needed for the ultimate in smooth, even and comfortable results. Panasonic Arc5 men's shavers feature 30-degree angle blades to cut hair at its base for close, accurate precision. The multi-flex pivoting head allows the cordless shaver to float effortlessly along the contours of your face for a clean shave, especially around your sideburns and under your chin. The Panasonic shaver has a fast, high-efficiency 14,000 cpm linear motor to help eliminate the tugging and pulling that may occur with slower electric razors, while maintaining peak power right up until the end of the charge. The convenient wet/dry design lets you shave and trim in the shower or bath with foam, gel or soap lather and dry by holding under warm water to rinse away hair stubble and residue.
