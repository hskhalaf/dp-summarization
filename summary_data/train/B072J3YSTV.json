Though the sock-like fit pleased many users, there were also complaints about a break-in period. But in the end, the product\u2019s versatility and stability during dynamic workouts were reason enough for purchasers to recommend it to their peers.",

I do cross training, sled pushes, weight lifting, HIIT kickboxing, kicking a heavy bag and pads also use them on treadmill they feel great in each activity. These shoes have thus far stood up to everything I\u2019ve used them for and on various surfaces while still holding form and structure. Then a little before the two month mark parts of the sole started coming undone, I\u2019d give it a lower rating but they fit my feet too well. Time to buy some super glue I guess.",

Both said they provided great support and stability. My son said he felt about a 1/4\" taller in them and immediately took possession! Overall, a great look on both of them. We own many Under Armour brand items and have always been pleased with their quality. These sneakers look to be of the same quality we have grown to love! It is certainly a plus the shoelaces are not super long. Another win for the Under Armour collection! Looks like I have to buy my husband a pair now.",

Am I the only one who hates that inside my shoes??? The only concern I would have for this shoe would be that the lacing does not open up all the way in the traditional sense. The \"sock fit\" style means that those with large ankles or high arches might have a difficult time squeezing into these, and I don't think I would want them under those circumstances. But for my average build, it works wonderfully.",
