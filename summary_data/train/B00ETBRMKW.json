      "text": "Bought one of these and one First Alert RD1 Radon test since they are relatively cheap (compared to the cost of unneeded mitigation) and something that can get screwed up easily (aka) redundancy. The price difference appears significant but when you consider the AccuStar includes return shipping cost (the First Allert cost $10 to ship through UPS as they recommend) and the AccuStar is a nice tin test kit and the First Alert is the cheapest plastic / paper piece the reason for the price difference is obvious. I mailed off both kits Tuesday afternoon and got the AccuStar results via email Friday. Still waiting on the First Alert. With these two you are getting what you pay for.",

That annoyed me quite a bit and I was in a bad mood for unrelated reasons. The test is already not particularly accurate and 7 minutes isn't going to matter. So I immediately responded to the email address of the lab with a one sentence rant telling them to go friend themselves and so on. Not my finest moment. I promptly got a response back offering to calculate the results for 96 hours with no passive aggressive digs at my bad attitude. The next morning I had results.",
