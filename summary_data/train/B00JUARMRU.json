I do not notice any objectionable flavor. The only problem I had was with the zip lock packaging. Fortunately I noticed that the zip lock fastener was not sealed before breaking the tear-away seal. I was able to shake the powder back into the bag before opening it. I then had to clean-out the zip lock before sealing the bag. Watch out for this problem so that you do not have product powder everywhere.",

I had used another product from what I Have always considered a very fine herb co and it did work also but it only took the edge off hunger and didn't last long . This is more an appetite suppressant and lasts longer than the other I got . I tried BulkSupplements because I had gotten another product from them that was really superior ( stevia ). I'll definitely keep buying from this company...I have used herbs for many , many years , so I 'm familiar with tons of brands . Can't believe I had never heard of BulkSupplements before !",
