Also, just to note that this does not leave the \"clean feeling\" - it's like a lotion that you wash off. Maybe it could be good for you - for it's price, try it out yourself and send your experience for everyone else to benefit from. hopefully it works out for you, but I wont be buying this again unfortunately :(",
