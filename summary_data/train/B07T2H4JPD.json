I have included a video to show me launching it but I am not very good with controlling it. I am sure it will be great with some practice. It was easy to sync to the controller and I like that it lights up. It also came with extra propellers.",

      "text": "This drone is made from cheap plastic, similar to a model that you build. As is the case with drones, it tends to fly into walls and furniture as you learn to control it. This drone lasted less than half an hour before it hit a wall and smashed a plastic blade guard and severed the blade attachment. We bought this drone for my adult son with Cerebral Palsy who only has one working hand. We were able to modify the hand control placement so that he could almost fly it one handed, but then it broke.",
