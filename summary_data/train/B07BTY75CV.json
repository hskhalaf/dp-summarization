Not realizing this, I got this for our condo's back deck and the smell was very strong (like a porta-potty), and also drove our dog nuts (if he could've gotten to it, he would have).

I place mine back in the far part of my yard and it pulls the flies back there and away from our patio. Its very gross to get rid of, so not for the squeamish. It smells like rotting meat, and it gets worse as the dead/dying flies accumulate. But it work really really well. I find 2-3 a summer does the trick. I didn't post a picture because....like I said, its gross. But Seriously, THESE ARE AWESOME!",

Smell made me wretch, have to triple bag this thing and get it right on the garbage truck. Spilled a few drops and every fly in neighborhood came for a visit.

By the next day we had so many flies buzzing all over the porch and patio. It was miserable. The bait smell is so rancid it smells like rotted trash (or a decomposing animal). One of the traps had a small hole that was undetectable but by morning the rancid bait had leaked onto the patio and it was a mess! Yeah, it attracts flies but it attracts way more flies than you originally have creating a bigger problem AND the bait smell will make you want to vomit.",

I thought something was dead in the bushes, but I never found anything. I didn\u2019t want to spay chemicals because I have young kids and a dog. I bought the fly bag and hung it up just behind the bushes. Everyday the fly population was cut in half. It was amazing on how well this product worked. It\u2019s not all great, the bait stinks. However, it only smell it within 10ft and the wind has to be just right. I would recommend this product.",

      "text": "Be warned, this product works, but it kinda works too well. It will attract flies from the next town over. I had both going at once in two corners of my yard away from the house , it stinks to high heaven, but both were filled with flies after only 2 or 3 days. I mean filled to the brim with no room left. I live in a city, small backyard, 2 small dogs that poop on woodchips and is promptly cleaned. The amount of flies these things caught is ridiculous. They must be flying in from all over.",

      "text": "I hung this in my garage where we have a fly problem due to having baby kittens and the flys are all over the kitty litter box. When i read the instructions it stated, \"dispose after 30 days or when it drys up\". Well after about a week it started to smell horrible, yeah flies where still going into the bag but my whole garage started to smell. After 2 weeks I couldn't even get close enough to the bag without wanting to vomit. It would have been nice if you could close the bag securely so it could be thrown away without the stuff leaking out.",
