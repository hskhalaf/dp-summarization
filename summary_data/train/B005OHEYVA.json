      "text": "Cute little thick rubber blow up raft. Says it will hold up to 300 pounds, but I had my self, nephew and mother in 1 and that combined weight was closer to 475 pounds. Rowed across a lake that had boat traffic. No worries of tipping and it held up very nicely. Only issue is that the oars are a thin plastic that easily bends if you are an excitable rower. Also doubles as an air mattress in a pinch!!",

It does take a while to blow up and we purchased a bellows type inflation device which did help. Our 9 year old can handle it by himself so that was good and it was fun when one adult and our 9 year old were in it together but was too crowded when we added the second adult. It was difficult to row when there were three people in the boat. Overall not too bad when used by one or two people.",

I am not very good at it either way but I wanted to attempt it for exercise./ edited, it popped after 3 weeks",

Then we took it in water and the center just sinks when an adult gets in, kinda fold the \"boat\" in half. The part where oar holder is joint on the boat also sinks while trying to use oars. Not good enough for use, unless you want to use this to just lie down on without going anywhere. Avoidable.",

We haven't tried it out on a lake or ocean yet. Update: we used it at Galveston, there's constant waves there, it worked out great. Kept us floating on top of the waves.",
