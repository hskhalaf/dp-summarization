      "text": "At 28mm its not as sharp as i would've expected it to be(a bit soft, but still great a shot)...you'll have to go low on the f stops to get a sharp image. At 50mm-80mm you'll get sharp shots at almost all f stops. Its girthy, so it looks good on the camera, but its all plastic built. Comes with a 1/2'' hood. I used this as my everyday everywhere lens. Not too worried about it getting damaged. For the price its a great all around lens. Of course there are better lens out there, but for the price this beats them out. I would recommend to others.",

      "text": "I bought this to replace my 7yr old SMC 28-80 lens that just jammed up one day when I really needed it. The Tamron lens is good, autofocuses quite fast and feels well built. I have found that a 28-80 lens is the absolute best balance you can get for 90% of all your photos which is why it's on my camera almost all the time. Basically, this lens works, it's incredible value and the color reproduction doesn't have the tint that my old SMC lens had (which gave the same tint as using Kodak Royal Gold film). As a result of this purchase I'll probably buy another Tamron lens in the future when I want a telephoto lens.",

Reasonable for anything indoors or fairly close, works as a portrait lens and does well with landscapes and architecture. Great general usage lens and compact as well. The price is really remarkable. I have 8 lenses and this one gets the most use. I have it mounted to a Pentax K20D",

For a cheap lens it's acceptable, but don't be fooled by 4 or 5 star ratings...you shouldn't expect the same result that you will get with a high end lens.",
