I contacted NuWave warranty and they sent me another powerhead. That powerhead worked for a few weeks and quit working. I am currently contacting the company to get this unit replaced. I have been using NuWave products for years and was very satisfied with their products. Hopefully they will send me a unit that will be up to their former quality.",

I cannot begin to express how easy the oven is to use and the clean up is so fast! I roast veggies, cook corn on the cob, cook mini pizzas, quesadillas, chicken breast, roasted whole chickens, fish, and so much more. Biggest thing for me, I hate dry chicken breast! Since cooking with the NuWave pro all of the chicken breast have been tender and juicy. I highly recommend. I have also purchased one as a gift and they love it as much as I do.",

I haven't had to use the extender ring yet but it's great that I don't have to worry about getting a whole chicken that won't fit. Got rid of my toaster oven! This thing does it all and I can just set it and walk away! I hate cooking",

My only negative comment is that the stainless steel extender ring seals to the top while in use (from steam) and has to be separated with a flat butter knife. The NuWave I had previously had a different extender ring and never had that problem. This has been my favorite kitchen appliance for several years, I recommend it to everyone I know.",

The first lasted about 5 months (thankfully, it was still under warranty) and the second replacement just died after using it only about a dozen times. Not sure if it's just my luck. However, while it worked, the cooking was okay. In my honest opinion, really nothing to rave about. I find it's best for items like ribs and chicken pieces. Does cook quicker than an oven. I attempted to cook a roast and the end result was extremely tough and dry. Not really useful for items that should be cooked with liquids. Pretty disappointed in this investment.",
