It has a toast function, of course, it also has bake, broil, Pizza, cookies, defrost (what?!), reheat, keep warm, a rotisserie function (can\u2019t wait to try that one) AND its a convection oven! This is perfect for everybody, and especially for those that live in small spaces such as RVs, tiny houses, dorm rooms, barracks rooms, etc.",

Set unit to 180\u00b0 never got over 170\u00b0. Then set unit to 350\u00b0 unit got up to 400\u00b0. Left thermometer inside for between 5 and 10 minutes for the test as the unit was counting down. This just demonstrates that the temperature needs to be monitored when the temp is important. I still like the unit and will continue to use it.

This toaster oven is fantastic. From waffles, to chicken tenders, to garlic toast, to warming burgers up, it does so much. It does take up a good bit of counter space but they all do. The top and sides of it get crazy hot, which makes me nervous with the kids, but other than that, we love this toaster oven and plan to buy another of its kind in the future.",

The increments for temperature are not standard for some settings. watch the broil setting, it gets extremely hot and can burn something in a nanosecond. There is no preheat alarm.

The beep to let you know your toast, etc is done will wake the dead so I have gotten used to watching the countdown timer (handy) and stopping it at 1 second or so when my family is still sleeping. Also, it has started to burn the toast a bit on the bottom, so I have raised the rack to the middle position and it works well again. I'd buy it again.",

Now I'm having to guess and there was no cookbook with suggested frameworks supplied with the oven manual...Google here I come!!!! 2/10/'19: Well....with use I had to change my rating (4 to 2) and opinion. This unit throws off so much heat and is so hot to touch on all its surfaces it's a high risk for related heat burn/accidents. Also... no appreciative benefit with convection function, poor broiler crisping...returned for refund. Nothing ventured, nothing gained, right?",

The quality is amazing, the control panel looks super hi-tech and you can't tell that this is a relatively cheaper alternative! I highly suggest buying this brand; no need to get anything more expensive! I don't even use my full oven anymore. This cooks everything so much faster at lower temps and makes foods crispier (if it's that type of food)!",

So, to use the pan, you have to sit it on top of the wire rack. This is not how it is supposed to be. It takes up too much room that way to rotisserie a chicken. Going to see if I can \"figure out a way\" to use the oven without having to return everything. SO SAD -- I was very excited to try this oven out....*sigh*",
