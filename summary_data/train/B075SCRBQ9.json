There is an obvious story here, and I guess that is the problem. It is too specifically set up for one situation. The Krypto dog figure could also be a bit cuter. Otherwise, the set is fun and a good build for hardcore Superman fans. There are better sets for kids that just want something to play with, in my opinion.",
