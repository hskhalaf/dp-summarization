      "text": "This facial cleaner, for oily skin is absolutely wonderful! I love it just wish I had found it years ago. I have oily skin and work outside so all the dirt in the air gets trapped on my skin resulting in clogged pores. I used it , with not much hope of any positive results, but after about 2 weeks of daily use I could see dramatic positive results to my face. I just ordered a bottle for my daughter. Try it, give it a chance to work. Remember your skin didn\u2019t get in bad shape over night so don\u2019t expect the problem to go away overnight.",
