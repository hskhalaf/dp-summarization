One had the manual and the other didn't. Very suspicious. Needless to say I will not opt for a third. Be careful.",

From everything I can tell I thread this machine right, but can only get it to do one or two different stitches. The booklet that is included has a few mistakes that make learning the machine even more confusing. In my opinion, this machine sacrifices efficiency for versatility, which means that instead of being able to do one or two things well, it does many thing very poorly (or not at all).",

Even the manufacturer doesn\u2019t even have much information on this model so it\u2019s really frustrating.",

It was easy to thread and the manual was easy to understand. Since it also sews a chain stitch, it's capable of sewing a single line of stitching, an overlock stitch, as well as a 2 or 3 coverstitch! If I hadn't already purchased the Stylist II, I would buy another one to use as my serger! An all around great machine.",

Local repair shop won't even take it because they say these are basically unrepairable. Complete waste of a LOT of money. One star, because I can't leave fewer.",

Set it up as soon as i received it. Wonderful product. It is not a machine for inexperienced sewers new to serging. The instruction manual shows how the thread and the exact needle position is key to great stitches. Would buy again! Great for doing couture finishes.",

It is obviously complicated to learn how to use any serger/overlock or coverstitch machine so it is going to be a little complicated for anyone who isn't already familiar with these types of machines. But for anyone who is already familiar with these machines, it is an awesome machine that does it all. I advise that if this is the first time using a serger or coverstitch, that you take a lesson at your local sewing store.",
