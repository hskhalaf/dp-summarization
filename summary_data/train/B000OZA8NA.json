      "text": "It works fine once you figure out the nuances. There is no ON/OFF button - if the receiver is in place it just comes on. The really strange thing about this is the electric plug. You can not tell the polarity of the plug - both prongs are the same size but the boombox will only work if you determine which one is the \"large\" prong and plug it in correctly. As a result of these two things it is not what I would consider very user friendly, however, I have kept it and will continue to use it.",

Have fun, i am thinking of getting another one.",

This box makes listening to XM outside so simple, before I had a regular cd player the cassette adaptor, the antenna, the power source for MyFi and the power source for the cd player, way too many wires. I couldn't believe how easy it was to plug in and listen for hours without all the wires. The reception is crystal clear and the sound is just awesome! I would recommend it to anyone who has XM radio. It has made listening by the pool a joy. :)",
