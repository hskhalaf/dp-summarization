Everything from the thickness of the rubber to the bite to the positive on/off water shutoff performed just as I knew it would. There are cheaper versions but the military grade versions are designed to take more abuse and still perform.",

As long as you thread the cap on properly and make sure it's tight, you shouldn't have any issues with leaks. I also like the new material compared to the older version, it appears to be sturdier.

The reservoir fits fine but it's a tight fit to thread the hose through the slot at the top of the pack since this model has a valve on the hose to prevent it from potentially leaking. Since the hose can be disconnected from the reservoir, I flipped it around and put the valve near the reservoir so it's easier to to put in my pack because I've never had an issue with the bite portion leaking while I'm riding. Seems very durable and worked great on 4 rides. The first couple rides it had a plastic/chemical taste but the last two it's been fine.",

Worst part about this thing is the cap. It is VERY hard to unscrew. It turns my fingers into hotdogs, just trying to twist it open. I can't imagine how people with carpel tunnel or arthritis would use this. But it seems pretty much all of these reservoirs have twist caps like this, no matter the brand and model",
