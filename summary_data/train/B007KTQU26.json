They fit very well and using them for several hours at the time don't leave you feeling like your head has been in a vise . The build quality is very good also and the mini-connector that plugs into the headphones is really substantial ,although it does take a little effort to unplug. I am glad its snug as it won't get loose thru the years of use. Overall I am VERY HAPPY with my purchase . A LOT of product for the money. WP",

They don't slack in any area, have less bass than the typical DJ phone, more clarity in the mids, and are incredibly comfortable. These are the first phones that i've worn easily for 6-7 even 8 hours at a time, without hassle or any of the usual stress that come with wearing headphones. And well, given the quality, and that they may be slightly less sonically desirable than the best phones out there, for their purpose, they do an amazing job. Comfort is really amazin especially when paired with quality.",

Would buy again! Just the way they look gives you that credibility you might be looking for if you're like me - my old cans were a freebie set of beater Nadys that did the job, but just didn't excite my fans like these do.",

After some time I have to adjust them on the ears in various way to lighten the impact. Eventually, I need to take headphones off to give ears some rest.",

The swivel is amazing, and the cord is placed far from where any hinges can cause any damage to them. The ear piece is a little bigger than I'd prefer, but they are super comfortable. Cannot wait to use them this weekend. Also, super fast shipping!",

The HDJs are known for their hinges for breaking easy but i have the issue of this happening to me because i treat them like like gold. Overall they are great headphones for in-studio sessions not gags",

The clarity and sound separation I get out of the V700 is just far superior. After doing some research it looks like DJ headphones audio quality is not important compared to things like noise isolation, loudness and bass enhancement, so you'll likely get the same audio quality with most top-of-the-line headphones. I care for isolation and loudness but I am personally not willing to compromise in sound quality, so I returned these. On the bright side the build quality seems to be outstanding, they are sexy-looking and luxurious.",
