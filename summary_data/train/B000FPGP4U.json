I was using this for a remote presentation and was maybe 100ft from the pc and had connectivity issues. Within about 50ft it seemed to work ok, but any further was hit and miss. I changed out batteries, moved the dongle and everything else. My best guess is the transmitter just isn't beefy enough or the reciever strong enough for real distances. If you're under that limit than i think this will work for your needs. anything more than that and I'd suggest the smklink brand. i've got 200ft from it, of course it's twice the price too.",

This is a must have. Cons: - Loses connection in a decent sized training room. I had to be near the front of the room for it to work. That's really frustrating when you're teaching a class or giving a presentation. - Sometimes it just doesn't click through - you press it, and nothing happens. Then, sometimes it advances several slides at once. Not great. - Laser is really weak, and barely shows up.",

If you want to simply use it as a laser pointer, the fob clicks out so that it is \"on\" but is till captive and won't fall out. Finally, I continue to appreciate that it uses standard AAA batteries instead of hard to find watch batteries used on the really small versions of this.",

I love that the dongle stores inside the remote, which also acts as an on/off switch (if the dongle is in, you can't use the laser pointer). My only complaint is that I would prefer the remote use AA batteries over AAA, but I don't think the batteries should drain too fast.",

Research shows that audiences learn better and enjoy presentations more when the speaker is more animated and uses the whole staging area. You can't do that when you are tethered to the computer.
