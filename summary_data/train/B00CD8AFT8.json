After passing it on to someone else and buying myself the 14 inch sleeve, I'm super happy with it! The fit is a little snug around the corners, which leads me to believe that the corners could wear out quicker than the rest of the sleeve, but it's been great for keeping my laptop safe when I put it in a purse or am just toting it around. Fantastic product for the price and I'll probably buy a backup just to have on hand. Highly recommend!",

The case has a nice soft inner coating to protect from scratching the display and some ok plush to absorb some impact. The interior has enough room where it isn't a super tight fit nor is it too empty where my device flops around. There's enough space to store my passport, paper documents and currency. Overall, good purchase.",

I have been traveling with it for a few months - planes and bus rides. I give it a 4 star for durability because I haven't \"tested\" how it handles under very rough conditions. I like to use a mouse over the touch pad and I am also able to easily fit a small mouse pad behind the Chromebook inside the sleeve. This helps prevent the mouse pad from bending and the underside cracking.",

The Surface fits perfectly in this sleeve with all accessories attached. I cannot vouch for the water resistance because I have not encountered a situation where that would be tested. I would say that with everything inside the sleeve, there is still a little wiggle room inside. This is not a deal-breaker as it does what it's intended for. Not too bad for the price. There was no smell like some of the comments, and yes, though it was slightly too big, it does the job for protecting my tablet in my bag.",

I'm very glad I purchased this affordable sleeve, which also comes in smaller sizes to fit your 15\" or even smaller lap tops. As for travel, I would readily carry my expensive lap top in this sleeve inside a carry on for both air or land travel. It is definitely worth it, get it without any hesitation!",

It's not a huge deal, but I don't like the way my new laptop shimmies inside the sleeve... makes it feel less compact and secure than when I know the sleeve is holding it tight on all sides.

      "text": "Purchased for use with a 15\" MacBook Pro with the touchbar. This case fits almost perfectly. It's not an exact fit, but it's very close. The sleeve material has some \"squish\" to it and feels nice to the touch. The zipper starts just over the short edge, runs up and over the long edge, and ends just over the opposite short edge. This makes it easy to get the laptop in and out. I carry the laptop+sleeve inside of another bag. There is not enough protection in the sleeve that I would feel comfortable with it as the sole source. It does protect the laptop from the contents of my other bag. Very reasonable price for what you get.",

      "text": "Purchased this to potentially use with the new Dell XPS 15. It's too tight of a fit. While I was able to force the zippers shut, it was obvious I would possibly be scuffing the corners from being too snug of a fit. Overall, this case is a great bargain for other standard-sized laptops; it has strong zippers, soft inner lining, and substantial padding. The Dell XPS 15 is built with unique measurements, which made this sleeve a bad fit for it; nothing to do with this sleeve, however.",

      "text": "Brilliant, simple, strong, and fluffy. I recommend this sleeve in the 17\" size for all laptops and accessories. It is an excellent multipurpose size for interchangeable use. You may have extra material hanging off the sides, but that just means you have something to hang on to when you're swinging it around. That being said, it will protect your equipment from scratches, but not impact or heavy compression. It's just a sleeve so be prepared for that. You will have to stuff it in something sturdy if you don't want it to get bashed. With that in mind, it serves it's purpose brilliantly and I won't hesitate to grab another when the need arises.",

I've yet to see any material degradation, just some strands of fabric that can be snipped off. They're a bit of a tight fit for some laptops that have some protrusions on the bottom of them, but the one laptop I have with this still fits in if a bit snug.",
