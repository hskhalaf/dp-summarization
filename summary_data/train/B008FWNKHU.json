This parachute did not challenge my players in any way and it simply did not perform the way I expected. I highly recommend investing in a higher quality brand that you are certain to get results from. This was not simple to figure out, it took my players several minuets to figure out how to put this chute on, they even mentioned several times they thought it was broken.",

Calves and glutes hurt, but I am happy overall! Get the elastic bands and wear them to practice squats and lunges and get an extra burn! Drills for 5 minutes non-stop and you will get a good workout.
