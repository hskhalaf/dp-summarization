Also, once in a while the screen gets these green lines all on the right side of the screen. Also, the volume of the TV is very low. I would recommend buying a sound bar or a surround sound system.",

I also have had issues with linking my Sony exterior speakers and subwoofer. Sometimes it will sync, but sometimes it does not. A little annoying. Overall I feel like I got a great smart TV for the price. I think I wouldn't hesitate to pay the full price either.",

Keep Minimum apps on the TV and or use a console through the Hmdi (ps4, xbox 1 or laptop/smartphone) to navigate through apps you should be fine. Factory reset it if it's already slow makes it works like new!. Not bad for the price.",

Also, this specific tv is made exclusively by Best Buy, which might be why the tv seems to be cheap junk (Years ago I bought an Insiginia TV from Best Buy and it had the same flickering issues as this one), so I won't make that mistake again.

And most TV apps forget your login info so you have to log in and verify your TV provider every time. It also has a pitiful amount of memory, so if you don\u2019t know how to add more memory, you\u2019ll have to be satisfied having only a few apps.",

Called Insignia directly, concluded it was likely toast, but there was nothing they would do because it's after the 12 month manufacturer's warranty, so in the trash it goes. Spend a few extra bucks for a brand that isn't garbage, buying an Insignia product is the same as throwing your money away.",

I can say you can tell the difference immensely when it comes to games with HDR and 4k support. The one thing I have noticed which may just be due to coming from a plasma to led is the colors start to look washed out at an angle if you are close, say 3-4 feet. Further away it's not as noticable. Also the built in fire runs better than my Fire TV (2nd gen) and fire TV (4k). For 279.99 this is a crazy good TV.",
