      "text": "My achy knees sure do appreciate this pad. I just couldn\u2019t find anything comparable locally and wasn\u2019t impressed with the low rated reviews for strap-on knee pads. This one is longer than most (about 20\u201d) and thick (about 2\u201d). It is impossible to take the cover off (spot clean only) but feels like there are two pieces of memory foam surrounding a stiffer pad in the middle. Stitching on both side seams and handle is very good. I\u2019ve just started having problems with my knees, but this pad is helping me ease into the transition of living with osteoarthritis. It\u2019s handy for any household chore that requires kneeling and a real godsend when used outdoors on rougher garden terrain.",
