They probably should not charge more than $25 dollars for this - and that is probably a fair mark up for the few dollars it must cost to manufacture them. It just makes an extremely difficult time feel even worse - though they do meet your need if you want to bury your pet. sigh. :(",

The last pet casket I purchased a few years ago was over $300 and it was very nice, but the place I purchased it from no longer sells pet caskets.
