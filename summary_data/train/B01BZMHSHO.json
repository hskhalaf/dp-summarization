It's soft on the outside, but as it's new, a bit stiff inside. I know the card slots and the whole interior will loosen up over time. I'm certain everything with Kate's name on it is selling fast, so get this now. I highly recommend. Oh, and there's a touch of glimmer to this wallet. I read that it was dipped in sparkles or something and it just adds a great additional touch and makes it unique. Love, love, love it.",
