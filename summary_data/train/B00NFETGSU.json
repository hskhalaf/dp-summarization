      "text": "We love our snugapuppy bouncer! I bought it when my now 7 month old son was a newborn. He loved looking at the toys, the vibration, and music/nature sounds. It is so snuggly and cozy, he almost always fell asleep in this bouncy seat. I love how easy it is to transport from room to room and how durable it is! It is also a cinch to wash, which with blowouts and spit up was a lifesaver! Our little guy still uses his bouncy to play and keep him contained say while I cook dinner or do dishes etc. It is an awesome seat and I highly recommend!",
