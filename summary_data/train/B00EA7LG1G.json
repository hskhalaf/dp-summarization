Cannot remember the year of the board, but it is when it was produced with a sintered base. The wax absorbs really well and lasts for a few serious sessions. Usually riding in pretty cold/sometimes wet conditions (northeast) and I am always zooming by my friends (no pun intended). Cannot say anything bad about this wax. It also smells amazing!",
