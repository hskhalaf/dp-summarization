      "text": "I just wanted to drop a quick note about how much I love this PC. It is a real beast. If there is something that I wish was better/different it is is the small and relatively slow SSD drive. Why CyberPower would skimp on a Western Digital Green drive into this level of machine, is a bit of an enigma to me but - you live you learn. The regular HD, though, tears it up anyway so I backed away of the hassle of swapping SSD out for now.",

      "text": "This is a very powerful computer that is fantastically priced due to the current pc building market. It has enough power to run pretty much anything at max settings and stream the game to Twitch or Youtube. If you are a hard core gamer and or streamers looking to upgrade your rig this is a wonderful place to look as you can't even get as good a deal building it yourself these days. The Ryzen 7 chip is better for streaming so if you want it for just gaming I would suggest looking into all the options Cyber Power gives here.",

The hardware really pays off, the AMD CPU really way better than Intel. The Nvidia GTX 1080 GPU performed perfectly. I am not a fan of storage, so a 240 GB SSD is small, for good enough for boot up, and 2 TB HHD is good enough for storing data. I didn't think I used up the 32 GB memory, which means it is over qualified. Overall, this is one computer you don't want to miss.",
