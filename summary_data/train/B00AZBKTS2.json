I soak the removable pan, smoker chip cups and lid in a big laundry sink with lots of Dawn and hot water over night and use a Mr Clean Magic eraser the next day.

I've noted some small tweaks I can make for future recipes but even my initial \"failures\" tasted great. As others have noted, the cord is short. I only use this thing outside to smoke (have never used the roaster function) and use an outdoor extension cord. I use a long extension cord despite the manufacturer recommendation to use a short extension cord but haven't had any issues. Highly recommend.",

      "text": "For the price and ease this item does amazingly well. Highly advise you to use a thermometer for not only temping the meat but also for gauging the cooking temp. Smoking is significantly reduced at lower temps due to design of the wood trays and how they are heated from the sides of the cooker. Meats definitely receive a good smoke flavor at higher temps, but cook a bit faster than I would like and can be tougher due to extra heat. Suggest starting at a high temp to get the wood smoking then reduce temp for longer cooks to loosen meat up.",

Now, if I can only find a nice spot to store it!",

I was kinda bummed after I added wood chips a 2nd time and it did NOT smoke. However, the 2nd ,and 3rd time it did!! It smoked wonderfully, I suppose it was operator error on the 1st run.
