I've started using the insert (heating element) directly on my eyelids underneath the mask instead of inside because it is warmer and feels better. The heating element itself is covered with a soft material so it's very comfortable. The only thing missing is an audio cue (a few beeps) when it switches off so you know you're done. I use an alarm in my phone which is a pain.",

The package also comes with a ear blocks which works wonder in blocking out sound. I have tried several brands before, but non of them gives me the portability to heat up whenever I want. Also, the heat of this eye mask spread evenly instead of one hot spot, the pricing is amazing for the quality of this product, highly recommended.",

The other masks I have both work better for the same reason: they sit closer to the eye for better penetration of soothing cold and therapeutic heat. My preferred heat mask is smaller and softer than this mask. A nice touch with this product was the little spray bottle that was included to facilitate the application of moist heat. This mask came with top-notch personalized customer service.",

Then it goes up to the bridge of my nose leaving a long space barely touching my eyelids. In order to warm my whole eyelid, I must push on the mask around the nose area to hold it against my eyes. The pellet/microwave mask does not have this problem. I don't consider this purchase a success.",
