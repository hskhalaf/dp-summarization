It is also something worthy of recommendation thanks to its one-to-one fit and astonishing surface traction. That said, every good thing this Keen product has on offer may only be accessed past its premium price tag.Nonetheless, the Rialto II H2\u2019s defining qualities still make it a sandal deserving of many hikers\u2019 patronage.",

It's comfortable and durable, with a higher-traction sole. Waterproof Upper Constructed using a premium waterproof leather, the Keen Rialto II Walking Sandals keep water at bay so you can walk with confidence no matter what the weather. Having a water resistant shoe will improve comfort, durability and offer a wider range of protection to help you gain the maximum from your footwear. A breathable quick-dry lining helps to ensure a constant supply of fresh, cool air that works to cool at all times Sweat and moisture build-up can be wicked away as it as it's produced then transferred to the outer layers to be easily evaporated. The lace-lock bungee system ensures a secure and stable fit for the foot, it can be easily and quickly adjusted whilst on the go. Lastly, a molded rubber guard protects the toe from loose debris and rocks. PU Midsole A PU midsole yields superb cushioning properties allowing you to walk further for longer. Holding excellent cushioning abilities, the midsole absorbs shocks as you move throughout the gait cycle providing resilient cushioning and reducing the risks of potential injury. The midsole also boasts excellent durability and aging resistance ensuring longevity no matter how many miles you rack up. A microsuede lining PU foot ensures ample underfoot cushioning and all-around comfort. An integrated arch support provides all-day-long comfort and ensures long-lasting stability. Completing the midsole is cleansport NXT which ensures your feet remain protected every walk, but so do your shoes; the cleansport NXT natural odour control means that the inside of the shoe remains as durable as the outside. The combination of durability, comfort, and support creates a shoe that allows for optimum performance ensuring you last even longer, even in the snow. Non-Marking Rubber Outsole A non-mark",
