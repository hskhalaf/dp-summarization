This scent is perfect because it's a fresh, clean, \"citrusy\" scent, and I get compliments on it all the time. This is one of all time favorites. I took away one star because the lotion did not have a seal, therefore it could have been used or it could have been tampered with. I will not buy again unless I can be assured that it is a new sealed product.",
