On \"trickle charge\", the device may be connected indefinitely. After several weeks, I started the truck and it cranked on at high speed, clearly the effects of a now-fully charged battery.

Another reviewer pointed at that he contacted customer service and was told that there are no plans to make accessories for the G26000. I assume the 26000 and the 15000 are the same connector, so that means there are no planned accessories for the it either.

Except for my mistake, I'm glad I got the multi-purpose one which I might be able to use around the shop once in a while.",
