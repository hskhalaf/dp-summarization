      "text": "Using at a church. Much better than the projector we replaced, but not quite as bright as the advertising made it sound. It's probably the best we could do in this price range and is absolutely beautiful in subdued lighting. It just leaves a bit to be desired in our sanctuary on a sunny day where a lot of light comes on through the windows. Operation is easy and the audio output connection sends a good clean signal to our sound board.",

      "text": "I purchased two of these projectors to use in live training events that my company does for groups of 25-200 people at a time. I am very pleased with the clarity and brightness of the projector. The auto-keystone features work well and the manual adjustments are intuitive, easy to figure out, and quite capable. I love the flexibility of inputs on this projector. Everything from wifi, VGA, and HDMI, to USB, ethernet and standard RCA. I have never not been able to connect and get the projector running. I would definitely purchase these projectors again.",

      "text": "We use this in a corporate training environment, almost 100% with MiraCast (from a Surface Pro tablet or Surface Book). Works great. Bright. Sharp. The projector has a ton of auto-adjusting options available as well (like auto-sizing, auto-keystone correction, etc). They only thing that's odd is that these are disabled when you ceiling mount the projector. Strange, huh? In any case, this is a great unit. Well worth the $2K cost.",

Manual elevation via an up front lever, prior Sony had an automatic elevator, but this Epson has a much better image. Audio was ok for testing, but will use a professional PA system for large presentations. Zoom and Focus were easy to operate and this unit has many input channels, like 2 HDMI inputs, composite, etc. You can't go wrong with an almost 5,000 Lumens projector at this price point.",
