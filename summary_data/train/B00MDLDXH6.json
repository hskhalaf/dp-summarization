It is light, cool, and well-ventilated but apparently strong enough to withstand considerable wear.

And another nice feature is that if you are not using all the sun protection options, you can \"store\" the next and face flap in the top of the hat while you are wearing it normally...you don't have to remove them. I find this useful.",

This hat gives him perfect protection from the sun because even all the sunblock in the world can\u2019t work when you\u2019re out on the river casting over and over again.

Also, it allows for the hat to be worn independently. Overall, a must have item if you\u2019re an outdoorsy person like my hubby.",

The side curtain at the back can be tucked up under your hat when you don't need it on your back. Wish it could be disconnected. You can disconnect the chin cord & front cover so if you don't need it (I didn't like them), then you don't have to have them flopping around. Well ventilated at the top for evaporation to keep you cool! For the money paid (not much), this was a GREAT value and I'd be happy to buy again if I ever lose this hat.",

      "text": "The part that covers the face doesn't stay down in the wind, so that's very annoying and kind of defeats the purpose. And, the Velcro parts that the face cover part attaches to (above the ears on the inside of the hat) can be uncomfortable sometimes (rub against the head). Besides that though, it fits great (snug but not tight--don't have to worry about it possibly flying away). Color is nice and rich (I got green) so it doesn't look or feel cheap. It's on the thicker side so it doesn't feel flimsy/feels like pretty good quality. And the vents help make sure there's some ventilation. Good for those trying to hide from/protect themselves from the sun, like me (:",
