My mother does not hesitate to say if she likes or dislikes anything and she is very happy with this pillow. She can side sleep as well and actually uses this wedge with her own pillow. She says it is very comfortable and I like the fact it has a removable washable cover. I hope I can someday find a second cover.",

      "text": "This bed wedge has really been a good purchase for me. I was recently diagnosed with mild to moderate sleep apnea and the wedge has really improved my sleep since using it. It has also helped with digestive issues and has helped to ease typical aches and pains as it provides good support for the upper body and neck. However, it does take some time as well for the wedge to loosen-up, typically about a week to 2 weeks, which is described in the provided instructions.",
