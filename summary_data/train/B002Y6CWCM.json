Inside it has a fair amount of space to keep your brushes or paints in. The 11-Inch-by-14-Inch canvas fits perfectly on it. The picture can be misleading as it appears to have a stain and a coat of poly or protectant on it. The one I received did not.",

I noticed someone asked a question about the lowest angle of the easel. I saw nowhere to upload a picture for that person, and this offers me the option, so I am posting four pictures I took a few minutes ago, showing each angle for those interested.",

The easel is a pain in the butt if the medium you're painting on is thin so I definitely do not recommend this if you like to paint on canvas board/panels or papers. However, for gallery wrapped canvas it works fine. =) Maybe a good table top easel for someone totally new to painting provided you also supply them with the gallery wrapped canvases. Otherwise this is going to drive someone bonkers everytime they have to pull their painting out of the opening between the back and bottom of the easel.",

I also wished it had the capacity to hold the painting surface more upright, leans the board back too far making the artist having to lean over instead of having the back straight. The groves on the board that props the easel need to be a little deeper, making it harder for the easel to fall backward easily. Despite this I am using it as a holder, it is not big and can easily be used anywhere, is VERY portable, and love the storage drawers. A great invention!",

      "text": "I use this easel for diamond painting and it has worked well for my smaller projects. If you work on diamond paintings that are larger than 30x40cm I would definitely purchase a larger sized easel. My 30x40cm project hangs of the sides a bit but its manageable; I may invest in a larger sized easel in the future. This easel holds an A4 light pad perfectly! I love the drawer and use it for my tools. By adding this product to my set-up I no longer have neck pain when I work and it makes crafting so much more comfortable!",

      "text": "Nice desktop easel for my watercolors. It probably wont work for plein air, but it is perfect for what I wanted. It is unfinished wood, so I may give it a coat of varnish to keep it conditioned. But the construction is sturdy and the latches keep everything neatly contained. The easel adjusts to three different angles to control the flow. With the proper tripod and mounting hardware, I may be able to adapt if for plein air, but I haven't figured that out yet.",

      "text": "This was an impulse buy. I usually paint with the surface laying on the floor. This can get uncomfortable. This tiny easel is easy to set on any flat surface, making it easier to work on small paintings wherever I want to sit. It's very lightweight, and adjusts easily enough. You could knock it down/out of place without much effort but that doesn't really cause any issues for me. I was surprised I could fit so much in the drawer. I can get pretty much all of the paint tubes I want, brushes, and a few small items in there along with the pallete (which I cover so that it doesn't get caked with paint). Good value.",

When you're finished, and close up the easel and close the drawer and secure each with the little lock latches for each -- place your drawing tablet on top and slip into a drawer. Perfect. $13!",

I replaced the hinges with sturdier ones, including bigger screws. I anticipate having to replace the hooks and latch before too long. A piece of wood is cracked, and I may have to glue and staple it together if it cracks more. Hard to beat at this price, and I'm happy I've been able to fix the problems.",
