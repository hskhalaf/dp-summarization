But I used it when it arrived today and when I vacuumed the carpet after letting it sit the carpet is Visibly lighter because of all the dirt it absorbed. I'm blown away seriously. I vacuum every day. Today was different because you could see all the gunk in the vacuum filter. So gross To think that I didn't realize how dirty it was despite my cleaning efforts yet I'm so happy that i found this bottle And can keep it this way from now on",

I'm impressed and I will be buying more in the future.",

It did a better job than spray cleaners (Resolve, Bissel) but you may want to try another product if you want fragrance.",

Then I shook off the excess, put it in the washing machine on hand wash cold with Borax, and let air dry. No odor left at all after! I'm very pleased.",
