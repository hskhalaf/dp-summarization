I think we're going to buy more for other rooms - we all think the girls are lucky! I also have two 20-ft strings on our deck, combined with overhead string lights with 11 wat bulbs. Between the two the deck is filled with warm, cozy light. Last year the curtain lights stayed on all winter, took a lot of abuse in the weather and mostly survived. This spring I replaced them with new, and plan to take care to keep them from flying around in strong winds overwinter.",

I bought three sets, 2 sets i had no problem with unwinding and stringing the base wire, the last set seemed to have been packed by an agitated chimpanzee as they were very tangled. With patience i got them sorted out. Still, 2 out of 3 aint bad as the song goes. Guests love them, love that there are multiple settings for every mood and that they are able to be dimmed. I'll probably buy more to accent the upper deck.",
