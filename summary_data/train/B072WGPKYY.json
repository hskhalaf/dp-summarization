It\u2019s a heavier oil so if you want this under makeup, you need to but this baby on waaaaaaaaay in advance. I use it at night. I do my full skincare routine then and tailor it down to bare minimum what I need for day time. All in all, a little goes a long way, works great, and will buy again",

Oh and the scent is beautiful! It smells like a spring field full of fragrant flowers! I can't stop raving about this product! An investment well worth it - especially now that winter is on its way and I have the dryest skin ever! I'm in love!",
