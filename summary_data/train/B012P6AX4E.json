It does work (contrary to negative reviews), but you have to use it twice daily, AM and PM... Unlike bimatoprost/Latisse, which is just once per day. You must be patient! I didn't see real results for about four weeks. I'm on my second tube. If it didn't work, I wouldn't have come back for more.",

I'm not sure if they are longer, but I do notice a difference when I wear mascara. I don't need to use a primer to get a false lash effect. Overall, I think the serum is helping condition and strengthening my lashes by: -decreasing breakage -increasing growth of eye lash hairs -slightly darkening my lashes Slight Con: -mild itchiness when first applied, goes away after dried.",

Also, it filled in a sparse spot on one brow (thankfully) that I've always had trouble with. Pretty impressive after only two weeks. I'll be reordering.",

I've recently decided to try it in my brows too, so we'll see what happens there! The product is affordable, a tube is good for a year, and a little goes a long way -I've been using it for probably 5 months now, and I'm not even 1/4 of the way through my first tube yet. I purchased this product with my own money, and I'll probably repurchase it when I run out.",
