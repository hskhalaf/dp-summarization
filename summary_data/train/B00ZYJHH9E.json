I subscribed to Spotify premium so I can stream to my Heos devices directly from the Spotify app. The soundbar is an excellent addition to my TV. Huge improvement as the speakers on my Samsung TV are lame. But the thing I was most impressed by was how great it sounded when playing music through it.",

It was WAY(!) out of sync and even though the app (albeit in beta) lets you adjust the Audio Delay from the TV to the Heos (3 & 5) speakers, not one of the adjustments came close to syncing correctly Perhaps in the future they will enhance the Audio Delay feature but no sense in retaining this while they decide to do so or not..",

Other than that the app is truly brilliant and the best part of the system. I believe they polished it now in 2019. This is clearly the future of home audio, compared to old system.
