Once the clip was removed, it was very difficult to connect the 2 ends of the silicone back together and slide the clip back on. Even after trying several times and pushing the clip all the way down, the ends of the ring would not come together completely at the bottom to seal the ring onto the glass bottom to prevent leaks.
