      "verdict": "Although the Inov-8 Race Ultra 290 was successful in delivering a comfortable and breathable ride, it still received negative feedback from users. Some runners thought it was too narrow, heavy and expensive. Despite the negative comments, some runners still consider the shoe as a great addition to their collection. The Race Ultra 290 offers moderate stability, durable components and responsive performance for everyday training.",
      "pros": [
        "A soft mesh and some synthetic materials make a comfortable and breathable upper unit based on the remarks of several runners",
        "Most reviewers appreciated the attachment tabs on the upper for gaiters, which offer more protection against dirt and other debris",
        "Runners generally welcomed the anti-microbial treatment given to the Ultra 290 because it keeps the interior environment healthy",
        "The Meta-Shank Generation III delivers flexibility and impact protection for the forefoot area",
        "Sticky rubber in the outsole area ensures durable protection and traction that\u2019s needed for racing, according to a few testers"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "Some runners felt that the Race Ultra 290 was a bit narrow in the forefoot area",
        "Others weren\u2019t impressed by the midsole, which to them was mostly stiff in the midfoot and heel areas",
        "It has an expensive price",
        "A few thought that it was a bit too heavy for their feet"

They provide excellent traction without too much tread like some trail shoes. I can still pivot and turn easily. The bonus is that while these are not waterproof, they are also not an open mesh, so I don't end up with socks full of dirt and dust at the end of a day.",

She has a medium to high arch and she's a little wide footed, but the shoes fit comfortably. The only issues she had was actually breaking them in. Once they were a little worn-in the shoes gave her great support during the run and even on the obstacles. The fact that they were light-weight helped here manage a pretty intense pace throughout the race. I would recommend these shoes for Spartan or tough mudder races.",
