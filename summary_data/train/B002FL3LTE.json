I've been using it for a few months and have no complaints. The wheels roll very well. Assembly was a breeze. I love the foot rest. The back is positioned in exactly the right place for me. The seat is very comfortable--even when I sit for long periods. It's also the perfect height for my counter-height work area.",

Apparently, they sell this same chair, without the seat height extension, for a typical desk height. Update Jun 2019: I have been using this chair 5 days a week for the past 14 months and have not had any problem with it. It still holds its 30.5\" raised position and the seat and back covers show no wear. Completely satisfied.",

This chair so far has proven to be easy to assemble, only screwdriver required, and it took less than 10 min to assemble. It is very comfortable. Working from home required me to have a chair that I can easily move around and get out of, as well as be tall enough to fit my tall desk. Good chair.",

I am a petite woman (4'11\") and have been having a lot of neck and shoulder pain with my arms being extended to reach my mouse for long periods of time with my previous chair. Having a higher chair helps keep my arms closer to my body. This chair definitely helps with that but my legs are pinched between my chair and desk which doesn't really bother me. Overall I'm happy with this purchase.",

      "text": "Exactly what I needed. Rolls smoothly even on carpet! Great product in this price point. Feels sturdy. The downside is the back accordion part of the chair, it feels like cheap plastic. Not the biggest deal unless you are particular about it. Also the fabric of the chair is slightly rough. Ehen wearing shorts, it feels like wool. Again, not a big deal I can just put a sheet over it if it bothers me too much. Fine when wearing longer pants! No need to spend over $200 for a drafting chair, this one is great and easy to put together!",
