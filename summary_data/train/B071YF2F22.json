I was a little unsure about the hinges coming together and pinching, but it's fully covered once together so there's no risk of that. The grippers on the bottom help to keep the seat from slipping and moving around. Toilets are all different shapes and sizes but this one does a good job at being versitile so you can use on any toilet.",

They act like anchors and the seat dosn\u2019t feel secure if they don\u2019t engage with the adult toilet seat (so far, only home use). The carrying bags are useful.

      "text": "This is easy to fold and very compact. It comes with a carrying pouch which is very convenient. There are however a couple of issues for me. First, the seat is larger than conventional potty seat which leaves a big gap at the front of the toilet, so my baby keeps putting her hands there. Second, this does slide around a little bit on the toilet seat depending on the shape of your toilet seat, so there were a couple of instances where my baby almost lost balance when the seat slipped. Overall, good product!",

      "text": "We're elated to be almost done potty training out 2.5 year old boy, but then the anxiety of using public bathrooms set in. This is an amazing alternative to laying TP on the seat or lugging a full size seat. It comes in a nice sack with drawstrings and fold up much smaller than you'd think to take up less room in the diaper bag. The silicon feet keep it steady on most public toilets and the bright colors (we chose yellow) keep it fun for little ones. I would definitely recommend this for anyone potty training children with anxieties about using the dreaded public restrooms.",

The plastic ends have making marks/ indentations on our toilet seats, but they have helped my daughter go from diapers to the big potty without a little potty in between. They are very sturdy, even when my little one wiggles around. Overall, these seats were a great find. We have not took them traveling yet, but They are easy to fold and store. If we do take them traveling I would use a gallon ziploc to store then rather than the small bags they provided.",
