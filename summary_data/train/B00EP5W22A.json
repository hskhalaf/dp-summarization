The volume the device generates is simply not loud enough for us to hear. The website argues that it is the issue with the phone, etc volume setting but that simply isn't true.

Couldn\u2019t be happier with my decision! We get EVERYTHING delivered to our home from our pet\u2019s medicine, our medicine to groceries using Amazon Fresh. Happy to report that we haven\u2019t missed one package since!!!",

It produces a surprisingly good picture and audio, however, the device needs to draw a small amount of current from the doorbell circuit, causing some electronic doorbells to malfunction. Contacted DoorBot customer support and they allowed me to return it for a full refund.",
