Comfortable after long periods of wear, good noise cancelling. only bad thing is that the light is supposed to flash blue and red when it's pairing, which is super confusing because traditionally a red light means low battery. this means it's really hard to tell when the headphones actually have low battery. basically, it's when they stop working: not super helpful.",

After some research I chose this product, it also have a nice modern look which I like. Pros: Music quality. Confortable. Battery life. Cons: The only \"cons\" I need to write is its noise cancelling feature is not as perfect as I expected. I have tried on Bose QC 25 in store, feels better than this product. But I never did compare at the same time, and considering the price difference, this is good enough. Would be more as a 4.5 stars.",

Calls can be hit or miss, but this may be due to me being a mumbler. Battery life currently at about 1.5 days in my normal usage, I think. Build quality balanced between solidness and lightweight for comfort. At the price I paid, 5 stars. Not sure if I'd have ever paid the full MSRP for these, however. I recommend.",
