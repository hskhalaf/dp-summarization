First night they slept through the night! Defiantly worth the money. It folds up easily for travel. We have a Chicco and graco and they fit perfectly in both.",

Did not use different sheets as some of the other reviews state, we just stretched the PNP sheets over the mattress topper and PNP bottom to make it a secure and snug fit, no gaps. Even now, at 3 yrs old, we still bring our MamaDoo along for any weekend getaways! Plan to use this as long as our little one will sleep on it! No complaints here! Have removed cover (pink) and washed several times, everything goes back together excellently like it was brand new!",
