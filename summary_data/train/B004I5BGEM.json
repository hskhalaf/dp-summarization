The frame does rock a bit while climbing up, but if braced properly against the wall or corner, with pipe insulation, it decreases the rocking by 60%.",

We split some rubber tubing from the hardware store and extended each piece to the right of each step so that it can't spin. Helped a lot.

It shakes a bit when he rolls over, but that's because we didn't anchor it to the wall (we have just the bed, not the desk underneath). The metal seems sturdy enough -- we've been using it a month now and nothing has bent or bowed. The bright white finish looks great. Assembled by one person. Took a few hours, but it wasn't overly challenging. Very pleased.",

Bed frame is sturdy and seems really safe which is probably the most important feature to all of us right. Price was great and the boys slept great in it last night \ud83d\udc4d",

No storage space so I\u2019m not sure why that is an option to give stars for. Overall I like it. We will see how it goes when changing bedding as getting up there is not the most comfortable for an adult.",

Definitely make sure all screws are in very tight and use the two brackets to secure it to the wall or else it will wobble. I used the screws under the bed where the slats are to secure it to the wall on both sides. This is a must.",

My daughters love it and it is plenty sturdy to sleep two adults on bottoms. Assembly took me several hours which is what I expected. Very pleased.",
