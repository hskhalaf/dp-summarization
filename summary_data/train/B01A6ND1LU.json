      "text": "Outstanding little receiver. There are only two speaker \"out\" connections, but the device generates enough power that I just spliced two speaker wires together and connected a total of four stereo speakers. The Bluetooth range is limited (weak signal) as noted in other reviews and the power light is very bright. There is an FM tuner in the unit and it's a little clunky to set up - but it works fine with the included external FM antenna. However, the key criteria for me were price and delivery - it was a bargain at under $90 and delivers powerful sound. I'd definitely buy it again and highly recommend it.",

After several weeks, Pyle Technical Support are still unable to provide or recommend a solution. Will have to ditch this product and buy a reliable brand - a total waste of money.",

The LED light on the front is very bright, but a small piece of electrical tape covered it up and is barely noticeable. The volume adjustment seems to be weighted towards the low end, where a small turn of the knob results in a large volume increase. Again, still a great value and sounds nice.",

I think it is dangerous, and could easily cause a fire.",
