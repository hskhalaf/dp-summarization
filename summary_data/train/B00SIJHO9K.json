      "text": "I've owned a number of G-Technology drives and never had a problem until I bought this one. So far, in the 8 months or so that I've had it, it's corrupted itself three times, requiring me to recover its data, format it, and put the data back on. With a 1TB drive, you can imagine how exhausting and time consuming that can be. So, expect to have to buy another drive to keep a back up of this drive for when it no longer mounts, or buy software to recover all your data. Really disappointing. For so long, G-Technology drives were the best money could buy. I'd steer clear of this one if I were you.",

Decided to purchase the ATC with thunderbolt to use when I shoot video in rough environments. The USB3 drive comes out of the case when I shoot in normal situations. I like the fact that drives can be changed out in the case and the thunderbolt connector on the case makes the drive future proof as evidenced by the new MacBook pro's.",

I like the protection it offers although fortunately I haven't had to see if it actually works as advertised. There are 2 issues I have so far: 1- The thunderbolt cable is too short. It would be nice to have it wrap around the box a little further by maybe 3 inches. 2- If I move the unit around much at all the thunderbolt connection continues to disconnect which is very annoying since I'm editing my photos off of this drive.",

The case has a nice finish that so far has been able to keep a p-touch sticker on it (I know that can be a problem with some other drives).",
