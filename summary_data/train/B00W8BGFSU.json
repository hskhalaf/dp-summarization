      "title": "Nifty Little Projector",
      "text": "This pico projector is the lowest priced 720P projector in the market and was the primary reason for my purchase. The image quality met my expectations - 150 lumens which is more than adequate with the lights off and most importantly the 1280x720 resolution means no mesh / grid lines or blocky text characters of lower resolution projectors. In addition I did not notice any of the \u201cwashing out\u201d of the picture expressed by another reviewer. Perhaps the other reviewer was watching near a light source / sunlight? In summary a great little device and a great upgrade from the Brookstone pico projector.",

Most importantly, it stays relatively cool, which is essential when you've got this thing mounted up for a mind-blowing \"Netflix and chill\" session in you bed. Only complaint: sound quality is a bit inconsistent. Occasionally it will hiss and make static sounds, plugged or unplugged from its AUX output.",

I can't see myself using it very often but cannot wait to use it during my camping trip next week. The main menu setting is a bit weird with the black background but once you're connected to a video source, the projection is extremely clear for its size. Best bang for your buck for a 720P HD projector. Can't wait until 1080P eventually comes out!!!",
