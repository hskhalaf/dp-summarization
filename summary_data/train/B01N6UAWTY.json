I didn\u2019t know that I needed headphones that were particularly resistant to tangling. I wasn\u2019t thinking about noise canceling. Even the light pink peachy color that matches my rose gold iPhone! These headphones were made with incredible attention to detail. They include a ton of smart features at a very reasonable price. From the soft case magnetic case to the songbird branding on the headphones to how easy it is to use, each component works to make my time at a super crowded budget gym and on a subway commute more comfortable.",

I love the woven chord, which is great for someone like me who's super hard on their headphones. I was pleasantly surprised to find that these are actually noise cancelling headphones unlike most other in-ear headphones that only plug your ears. The app is great and really straight forward for tuning the headphones. I find that treble boost sounds the best. As someone who would consider themselves an audiophile, I'm stoked on the overall build quality, the sound, the seal, and lack of sound leaking out when I'm blasting tunes at the workplace.",

The lightning adapter powering the headphones is excellent because you don't have to worry about charging issues like with Bose. But you have to plan ahead and make sure your phone is fully charged for long flights, for example, if you want to benefit from this. Doesn't drain the iPhone battery much. Excellent choice of ear bud covers, with six to choose from. Overall, a great, sleek, and genuinely compact choice to the Bose product line.",

Libratone provides three different earbud sizes which are really humanistic! Also, it has four levels of noise control, really flexible for my needs. I don't want my music volume to be too loud when I was outside which is harmful to my ears, at the same time if the earphones have a high level of noise cancellation it will make me feel dizzy. Libratone fixed my problem, I can choose the noise cancellation level, it's really a perfect headset for me.",

In short, the included tips are absolutely terrible and neither of the tips fit my ears properly so unless I'm sitting perfectly still they won't make a seal and will fall straight out. The noise cancelling and sound quality is passable, it's not great, but it's also not terrible. I didn't like using the app and the different NC levels by clicking the remote/app were just annoying; I'd rather these just work like my Bose QC25 (which doesn't sound amazing, but NC is best-in-class). Might be worth if ~$80",

The walk is usually about an hour, and with my old headphones I could always hear all of the traffic and would have to crank up my music to drown out part of the noise. Way different experience with these new libratone earphones!! They cancel out the traffic so well, and have changed my walk to work for the better! I would definitely buy products from Libratone again and would recommend these headphones to anyone who needs great noise cancelling earphones!!",

True, you can use the physical button for noise cancellation if you remember you can do this, but why wouldn't they allow you to use the app for that purpose without an internet connection? Just seems not customer friendly. And $179 for these? Nope, Bose offers better NC and music for that price without tying the charge port on the new iPhone... Returned.",

The sound quality is also very good (at least to my subjective assessment). There is an app that works (though not necessary as the controls on the head phones enable changing ANC settings, pause, volume up and volume down) but it requires logging in each time so I largely ignore it as the additional settings available there in are not mission critical. The cable segment is well made and for me the right length (plus there is little entangling that has bugged me with other brand units).",

On top of all that, they're just super sharp looking, though I wish the volume/noise canceling control was a little smaller.

    "description": "Libratone Q Adapt In-Ear: because you decide how much of the world to let in. Q Adapt features Libratone\u2019s Signature Sound Profile designed to provide a full range of crisp, clear, enhanced sound. The Q Adapt In-Ear offers 4 levels of CityMix Adjustable Noise Cancellation for your Lightning connected iOS device. Level 1: Keep the music playing while still letting in 80% of outside sound.
