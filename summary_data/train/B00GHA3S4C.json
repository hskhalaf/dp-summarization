The zucchini noodles come out looking like one wide flat ribbon at first, but as soon as you stir lightly, the noodles break apart into strands. I tried it with a carrot though and it did not work because it was too small. You would have to have the world's thickest genetically modified carrot to make it work here. I can't wait to try it with other vegetables but even if it only works with zucchini, I still think it's worth it.",

I was a little concerned about using it because a friend of mine bought another brand like this one and she said she not happy with it. I was hoping mine would work better and ...it did! the Native Spring slicer is very well designed. I sliced four large zucchini in matter of minutes. It was easy to use, fairly easy to clean (they give you a little brush with helps clean the inside) and I like the overall ease of use. I'd recommend this product to anyone looking to eat a healthy diet. Our zucchini spaghetti turned out fantastic!",

The end piece that was supposed to help you leverage the zucchini didn't really work well. Instead of assisting with the twisting, it ended up carving through the end of the zucchini instead. So it ended up making more of the zucchini \"unusable\" for pasta then I hoped.",

It looked like something out of a food magazine all because of the spiral slicer. I did some carrots for color as well and was pleasantly surprised with how easy it was. Cleaning the slicer looks difficult but it's super easy since there is a little wire brush included to get into all the teeth and crannies. Overall, love this product, will probably be spiral slicing everything because it's so fun :)",

      "text": "I have to eat gluten free and so many recipes substitute spiral cut veggies for traditional noodles. I thought I'd give this one a try. I have loved every dish I have made, the slicer is easy to use and clean. Even though it comes with a little bristle brush I found that using a toothpick in the corners of the blade works the best to get the little bits out. Easy to store and ready to go. I would recommend this spiral slicer to anyone.",
