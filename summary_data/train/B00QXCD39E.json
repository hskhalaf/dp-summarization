I have seen and felt lesser priced mats, and they do not offer the protection that this mat offers. From the packaging, to the quality of the covering and mat thickness, this mat is worth the money. As the pictures show, the mat comes in four sections. Each section is 2 feet by 4 feet, for a total of 8 feet in length combined. I highly reccomend this mat. I have not been paid for my opinion or review of this product.",

      "text": "My daughter loves her mat. Only problem was the Velcro on the bottom kept sticking to the rug and making it hard to move around. Should be designed with the fuzzy part of the Velcro on the bottom instead of the rough side that sticks. I placed felt strips over the Velcro and that helped. The mat is heavy enough that it doesn't move around.",

This mat met all my expectations. Good price, quick shipping, well built, and light enough for her (my 8 year old girl) to move up and down stairs by herself. Would purchase again without question. Another plus is that they are modular so they can be integrated with additional mats (via velcro) to create a larger surface area.",
