When it stopped connecting to my MAC, I took it to a local computer shop. They tried it on three separate computers. It would not connect with one of them. The power light lights on the drive, but no computer recognizes the drive. It is past Amazon's return date. The guy at the shop said he trusts Western Digital, but that does me no good now. I have figure out if I can send it back anywhere.",

I contacted customer support and they sent me a link to software that costs $120 so I can try to retrieve my data. I told them I was shocked that was their answer since this drive is basically brand new (no drops or damage or anything besides normal use). They said they could only help me format it and if ai wanted my data back, that was their best option. I paid extra for these drives, expecting them to work well for years. Very, very disappointed!",
