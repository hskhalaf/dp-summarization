That said, there two things that are issues for me with this watch: visibility and the background \"light\". Specifically, I can't read the digital display to save my life. I've tried and just given up. As for the orange display \"light\" - I say \"light\" because it's really not a light in the sense that it shows anything, just faintly shows the digital display in the dark. Long story short, it's a sweet looking watch and the analog display is accurate, but don't buy this thing if you don't have night vision... .Go with one of the other models instead.",

If you try to use the timer, or check the date or do any of the other features that this offers, you have to be standing in direct bright light to see anything. The illumination is a small orange light that will only allow you to see the hands of the watch. If you need to do anything with this in low light, find something with more of a \"glow\" function. I still wear it everyday, but I've resigned myself to only using it to tell time.",

It is bulky, uncomfortable and even in broad daylight you can barely see anything but the hands. Other than broad daylight, you will only see the hands, even with the led light. This is a HUGE disappointment from Casio G-Shock. I can't understand why it has so many positive reviews aside from people trying to justify buyers remorse after the return period.",
