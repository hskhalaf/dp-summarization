Although one of the runners commented that the product was a bit small, others still recommended the Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 34 Shield because of its reflectivity, fantastic design, and excellent performance. They loved wearing the shoe even on rainy days because of its breathability.",

Toe box isn't too small, my Achilles isn't bothered by the back of the shoe. It's lightweight and slim, yet provides a nice amount of cushion. Only needed to run in them a couple times before I did a 10k and had no problems in the race. Hope Nike doesn't ever change this model, will buy again.",

The ride is firmer and heavier than I expected; the laces aren't easily adjusted and I wish there were more reflective accents on the sides. They are comfortable enough for short runs (< 6 miles) and will get me through the winter but I will definitely go back to Saucony or Asics for my next shoe.",

Unless Nike suddenly decided obsidian was not another word for Black, the colors are falsely advertised. Also, I\u2019m normally a woman\u2019s 7.5 but for Nike shoes I go up a half side; however, the 8 is a bit small for me. The shoe itself is fine. The regular Zoom Pegasus. Just be wary of the navy coloring and maybe go a half size up from your regular Nike size.",
