Intermittently, it starts over in its toasting countdown when it should be finished, won't release the toast, and generally misbehaves. \"Rebooting\" sometimes solves the problem, but I have a feeling this is going to get worse. It is past the return time-frame for Amazon, so I guess I need to contact the manufacturer. Update: Nine months in. After the three-month issues, everything seemed fine until today, when it went crazy again. I think I need to go back to an analog toaster without a micro-processor.",

I would say it\u2019s not at all smart, and performs much worse than a $30 toaster. Suddenly, won\u2019t stop toasting, will not cancel or release the toast while it keeps toasting.

It's usually fixable by just unplugging and plugging it back in, but still is annoying for such an expensive toaster.",

What's the point of an expensive toaster if can't toast evenly, just like cheap toasters? Anyhow, I'm keeping it because I'm lazy and I like everything else about it. Maybe one day someone will invent a toaster that toasts evenly!!",

Bread is toasted more uniformly than any other toaster I have had, although a little more heavily on the outside coils then the inside coils. There is a little variance there. If it is still functioning properly in a year I will update the review. For the price, it needs to work correctly for several years, otherwise it is way over-priced.",
