I've been looking for a good product to use on him between grooming appts and this conditioner is the best I've used so far. It's the perfect round 2 step after their oatmeal shampoo. The conditioner smells GREAT and two days after his bath he still smells nice and is Soooo soft!! My groomers shampoo doesn't last this long! We love it.",

I still have to add a bit of oil to his shampoo in the winter to keep the flakes at bay, but this conditioner alone keeps his skin clear and moisturized in the summer. In 12 years, no other product has done that for him. I will buy this stuff for the rest of my little dude's life if it's available.",

I still use this bottle of conditioner, but only on my older dog who will allow me to take the extra time in the tub to apply & let sit for a bit. Great smell and shiny hair.",

The exceptional long-lasting raspberry tea and pomegranate fragrance has patented fragrance extenders so your clean, soft dog will smell amazing long after bath time is over. \n\nThe gentle cleansers in the 17 oz. bottle of Veterinary Formula Solutions Ultra Oatmeal Moisturizing Conditioner are pH balanced specifically for your pet\u2019s skin, gentle enough for frequent use and won\u2019t wash away other topical spot-on flea and tick treatments.
