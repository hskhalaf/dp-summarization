My first mow was against grass that was easily over a foot tall and this cut straight through it like it wasn't there. I was immediately slapping myself for ever going electric. I cannot stress the difference enough. I didn't think Id use the variable speed as much as I do but its actually pretty sweet. Pull start seems smooth and easy to start. Cuts seem really consistent in height. Idk what else to say other than I would definitely recommend.",

This is difficult when you are maneuvering the unit so its rather jerky. Also, the motor is not as powerful as my prior Honda. Four inch grass was a bit too much for it and you couldn't take a full cut but had to nibble away at it. Weird not having a throttle or a choke but it starts readily and stops quickly.",

Update- 8/5/2020 Mower wheels lock up when pulling backwards. Oil leaking from the air cleaner. Getting ready to call Honda about warranty. I would not buy this mower again and I do not recommend it.",
