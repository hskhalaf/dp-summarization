      "text": "Awesome product. Inflates with a few breaths <10. Rolled on my side and my hip doesn't touch the ground. Little bubbles/air pockets allow air to pass under you and prevents sweating. Air pockets also slow the passage of air from one side to the other when you roll over, so the mat seems more stable than a typical air mattress. Packs into a tiny stuff sack. Great for backpacking. Has a double plug, so when deflating you open a second valve that allows the air to escape almost instantly.",

I was looking at other brands, and the one I really wanted was a slightly smaller pad, with a .4 higher R value....and it was $200 and weighed 1.5 oz more. This pad is an amazing deal and I will recommend it to anyone. The only thing i can see killing it is if it punctures too easily...",

The only drawback is I am not a small person ( 6 ft tall) so it is just large enough for me to fit comfortably. This will be great for backpacking. It is super light/packable, easy to inflate/deflate, and comfortable.",

It is extremely lightweight but feels very durable. However, I have not placed it on the ground outside yet though to see how it will last. I was also pleasantly surprised of how comfortable it was to lay down on and how it kept its support when you moved around. I would definitely recommend this product.",

If you got good lungs you could probably do it it 7-10 breaths. Not bad at all. Its also light weight and comes in a nice bag so you can bring it with you anywhere.I recommend putting it inside your sleeping bag with you because if you tend to move around at night, you may not be on top of the pad in the middle of the night.

My only ding on the product is if you do not seat the one-way valve perfectly, it will pop out just as you finish inflating and you get to start all over again. Perhaps a second model of this will have a screw in valve instead of just push in. Other than this observation, everything is totally cool. I look forward to getting the most out of my purchase.",

This sleeping mat is comparable to name-brand counterparts at 3 or 4 times the price in terms of design, comfort, and weight. Although I have not punctured one yet (it comes with a small repair kit), it does seem more fragile than some of more expensive name-brand models that this is obviously based on. I haven't tried it in cold weather, but assume this is a 3-season sleeping mat. At about 1 lb. it's definitely competitive. If you're at the stage where the difference between 16 oz and 12 oz is a deal-breaker for you, you should probably just by the $200+ REI mat anyway.",

Its decent for back and stomach sleeping, but the Sleepingo is more comfortable all around and offers better support especially if you're a side sleeper.",
