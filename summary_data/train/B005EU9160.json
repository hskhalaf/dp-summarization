      "text": "This was a really great kit for the price. Everything we needed to enjoy our new trampoline. After reading a couple of reviews saying how uncomfortable the rods to the ladder were I bought a pool noodle from the dollar store, cut it to the size of the rods, and placed them on each rod. It worked like a charm and all the kids can climb up and down without hurting their feet. Even my 2 year old has no problem using the ladder. The anchors seem really strong and the bonus net for the shoes worked well to keep the yard tidy. I would definitely recommend this kit,especially because buying everything separate would cost alot more",

Only issue i had was they sent me some random bolt that was too short so i had to run to lowes and get the correct size to finish the assemble. My daughter complained about it being cold and hurting her feet so i added some foam padding and now she has no issues with climbing up and down. And getting the little shoe holder was a nice bonus but it kept slipping off so i used zip ties to secure it, now there are no issues. Even with tiny flaws i would still recommend. Assemble took less than 5 mins",

For one, its at too shallow an angle when installed and my kids have to climb up at a 45 degree angle instead of the angle in the thumbnail. Also, the fact you have to use a trampoline without shoes means you're climbing this without shoes, maybe without socks. It's actually sore to climb in bare feet because the bars are thin and solid metal. Plastic wrapping or some padding here would be really great. I'm also concerned about my kids exiting the trampoline onto this bare metal thing that sticks out a bit.",

The price was reasonable and it fit perfectly on trampoline. It's holding up well but shoe holder is sagging a little but still holds in shoes perfectly and ladder and stakes are not rusting.
