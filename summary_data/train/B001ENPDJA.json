It's good quality and functioned well, but it's a bad design. having the keypad on the far side of the controller instead of the side closer to you as you hold the controller means that to use the keypad you have to drastically change how you're holding the controller. So for occasional use it's fine, but if you're trying to answer multiple messages in a row it's uncomfortable and annoying.",

I agree with some of the other reviewers saying it could really use a back light and that the keys are fairly small but otherwise it feels very solid. The clip mechanism is strong and it might take some people a few days to get used to because of the positioning but overall for $10-15 this is a no-brainer even if you don't think you'll use it often.",

My other complaint is that it also made my controller much heavier, so every time I set the controller down to rest, the L2 and R2 buttons would get pressed (depending on what game you're playing, this can be seriously annoying). Don't let my review stop you from giving it a try, if you still want it. My friend absolutely loves it, and says it's flawless.",

Unlike the Xbox 360 keypad which uses the connection directly to the remote this needs to be charged separately then it simply \"grasps\" onto the remote. I don't know why they couldn't use the USB connection on the Controller to attach this and not have to charge it separately but that is my only complaint. It does have an ON/OFF switch so that is a plus to keeping it charged. My first full charge of the keypad took over an hour.",

The rechargeable battery lasts longer than the controllers charge time, the weight when placed onto the controller is negligible, and if you have to plug the controller in you don't have to remover the keyboard to access the micro usb port if you use a usb cable.

My only gripe with it is that the buttons are so small but for those used to using a cellphone keypad it shouldn't be a problem. For the PS3 it's perfect but for the PS4 you cannot clip the keyboard on the controller for obvious reasons but it still gets the job done separately.",

It's independent of the gamepad with it's own BlueTooth and power, so you can use it even without attaching it to a gamepad. Worth the purchase IMO.",

Of course, it is not as fast as typing on a full size keyboard, but it is compact and allows me to type way faster than finding the letters with the directional control. If speed is what you're going for, get a USB keyboard (it will save you about $30 dollars too).",

If you don't have a keyboard hooked up to your PS3, this is a much better solution than typing through the many keystrokes on PS3 controller itself to get a letter. There is sometimes a lag between when you press the letter and when it registers on screen. It will take a while to get used to where all your symbols and puntuation characters are. Out of the 3 ways to \"type\" on a PS3...this is the 2nd best. 1) A USB or bluetooth full size keyboard 2) PS3 Wireless Keypad (this product) 3) Not get anything and struggle!",
