As I said, probably a good hose but check the ends to make sure they were installed correctly.",

They're stiff, will lengthen or stay collapsed exactly as you set them, and if you put a turn in the hose, it stays! I recommend these over the cheaper slinky style any day. We all know that no site is perfect for placing the hoses - you've got bumps and dips and rocks to maneuver the hose around. These hoses just make it easier!",

Hose seems durable and of good quality for our use. Need a rugged hose checkout the Rhino Extreme. Same kit available but more durable hose.",

The thing I like the most is that I can keep the ends on and they store right inside my 4\" bumper so it's a little less dirty work to set it up. Just pull it out, hald turn it onto the drain, screw in the sewer connector, one more turn and done! The rigid tube extends and collapses securely without flopping all over so you can get just the length you need without having to creatively snake it all over to create a long drain path like you might with other looser tubes. Perfect!",

I really like the way the hoses compress down, and the end caps to keep them from dripping in the storage compartment.",

Also the fittings at the end come unscrewed when you are trying to screw the hose onto your RV fittings.",

I will reorder another from Amazon and pray it's the good one. There's few things one fears more than a sewer hose failure when dealing with a travel trailer.
