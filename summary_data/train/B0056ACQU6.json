Black Rapid did pay for the repair and replaced the strap. After lightly using the second one, the connector pin slipped through the socket and came apart. Black Rapid said their one year warranty does not cover what they called normal wear and tear. Due to two failures, and the company's failure to replace the second broken strap, I cannot recommend the product.",

So, I consider extra money that I spent as kind of insurance for my rather expensive D90. I spent even more buying Sport-2. A built-in underarm strap is not a must for my activities, but does no harm. I found only one thing that could be done better. I am partially a left-hander and would prefer to keep my camera on the left side, but such an option, perhaps, does not exist. Bottom line: after the first time I used it I will never use the old one.",

The product uses/blocks the tripod hole on the camera so you have to take the sling off to use a tripod. Unless you have a place on your actual lens to attach your rapid fire, which most do not. Still if your leaving the tripod at home for the day the rapid RS-Sport2 is a very nice option.",
