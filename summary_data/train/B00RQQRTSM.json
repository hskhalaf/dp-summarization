The company has absolutely no means of selling repair parts or allowing for it to be sent back to be repaired by them. Use the heck out of it the first year (we didn't), then after the initial 12 month warranty expires, if it breaks, just throw it away. Not worth it and will not buy anything from them again.",

This tent is lightweight, packs and unpacks in a matter of minutes, and provided excellent shade! Locking it in and taking it down takes a special touch and some muscle. But what a great tent!

My baby took a few naps in there and this prevented sand blowing on her face and the window allowed enough breeze inside. A wonderful purchase. would recommend to anyone thinking about getting one.",

I managed to set it up by myself while also trying to wrangle my child, but the pop-up portion was a little complicated at first, and folding it up on a windy beach was difficult. I'm sure with multiple uses, it would get easier to put up and take down, though. Overall, very pleased with the purchases, and especially liked the pouch and sling which made it easier to travel with than another brand I considered which collapses into a large circle.",

It has pockets to fill with sand as well as anchors for your tent to stay in place. The blue color is awesome.",

Unfortunately, it is much more difficult (and time-consuming) to get back in the bag! It comes down easily, but there is so much loose fabric, it is hard to roll up. It is useful to have two people to help put it away. We had problems getting all the sand off the tarp floor, too. It provides a nice amount of shade for our family of three, and seems to be well-made. We had people on the beach stop and ask us about it.",

      "text": "I recently ordered this tent after reading the very positive reviews online. Not only is it well made and reasonably priced, it performs excellently. We took our tent to Oceanside, OR yesterday for Father's Day and had a spectacular time at the beach. A large part of our enjoyment was the comfort we experienced from our tent. It handled some significant gusts with ease. The attached bags at the sides and rear of the tent allowed anchoring with heavy rocks and the tent stayed securely in place. Opening the side vents allowed air to flow through the unit to reduce pressure buildup from inside. This was an excellent aspect to the design also. Highly recommend!",

      "text": "Loved the concept, certainly is easy-up (as a dad with small kids) i highly appreciate! Built with quality. Only reason for 4 stars is that even with the windows/screens open the sun does make it 5-10 degrees hotter inside the tent, stopped using it for beach (in 85-90 Deg weather) instead an umbrella which provides perfect air breeze circulation. This isn't the companies fault, just inherent in all tent designs to be aware of.",

It is plenty spacious with room for a baby and lots of stuff. Could easily fit at least one adult and a few small kids or two adults if no kids",
