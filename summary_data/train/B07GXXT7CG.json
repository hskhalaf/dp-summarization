One the 2nd and 3rd round of ice, you'll find the ice tray on the floor with all the water overflowing from the machine. Happened 3 times already. 2nd issue is that it automatically turns off by itself. I had to restart the machine once a day, even if I didn't use any ice. It's an additional chore i could live without.",

However, we had to stop using it because it leaked terribly. The manufacturer advised to empty all water from the bottom tray when turning the unit off to prevent leaking; but, this did not work for us. It leaked so badly that it shorted out the outlet it was plugged into and also ruined the kitchen cart we had it on. I am currently shopping for a different ice maker.",
