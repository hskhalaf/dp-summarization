Dislikes: the schedule works the same time each day (would be nice to only run on the weekends), dust bin not easy to remove/clean, occasionally gets 'stuck' under the dining room table (putting chairs up fixes this), not sure how long it runs (we use it when not at home) so have to look at the rug tracks. Overall happy with the unit. A lot of bang for the buck.",

I returned and found it under our living room chair dead, which it was never in the room before I left, so that was pretty weird.

This vacuum picks up all the dirt that he tracks in and all of his hair. It works the best if I run it every day, as opposed to every few days, since the canister is so small and, my dog sheds so much. I would purchase this vacuum over and over again. I would absolutely recommend to someone else (i already have!). It was a great value for what you spend compared to a Roomba, etc.",

I personally have the i4 without the brushes for hair and my next purchase for myself will definitely be this model. They're quite modular, so if something breaks or wears out you can simply order extras. Simply a great robot vac and design.",

It is a random pattern cleaner, though. Keeps going over the same areas and not cleaning others. The Web site didn't work to register the product and was in oriental lettering. They said they were working on it. The box states it's a 30 day free return, which is a plus. I haven't used it to totally run the battery down, so it hasn't gone to the \"home\". I have had it running over an hour or two and it's still cleaning.",

Even when in same room he takes a random pattern to get back to his home. If he is in a different room I have not seen him succeed in that yet. However, it may have just taken more time than I was willing to give it due to the random pattern. So far, we are satisfied with the purchase.",

Might work on dog hair that is very tiny, but we have med dogs with short hair and it doesn't work....even after a major cleaning as a touch up.
