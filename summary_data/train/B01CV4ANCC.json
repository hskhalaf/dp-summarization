The other side began to lose its ability to stay in the adjusted position (would slowly move towards the outside no matter which way I positioned it), and eventually snapped off as well.

I can't speak to whether or not the 3M stickers are rated for exterior applications, but mine came off after 2 months. They sent me a replacement after they needed a photo to verify it. It took a month for it to arrive. Can't really complain. For the replacement, I stripped off the foam and tape on the mirror's underside, applied waterproof automotive glue, and once dried it's holing up great. It went through some winter and spring rainy days and doesn't look like it will fall off. YMMV.",

Although they sometimes need to be repositioned after going thru a brush type of car wash. They do the job and do assist in eliminating the blind spots. Installation was fairly easy with the only difficult part was squeezing my fingers between the mirror and it's mounting post to firmly press against the car's mirror. Just make sure you thoroughly clean the car's mirror before installing and they should stay on just fine (contrary to some of the other reviewers). definitely would order again if I needed to.",
