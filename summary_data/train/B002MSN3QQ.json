It can be absorbed rapidly through skin. Octinoxate has been detected in human urine, blood and breast milk, which indicates that humans are systemically exposed to this compound.

There are plenty of chemical sunscreens that feel nice on your skin.)",

The up side is, without being oily the product is very slippery and spreads easily, so a little goes a long way.",

I never get burned when I wear this luxurious sunscreen... feels like I'm wearing nothing and makeup goes on smoothly. I exfoliate regularly so I burn easily, my cheeks especially since I have mild rosa\u0301cea. My item never arrived. So I cannot review it,.and I cannot return for a refund! Trying to find a way to contact someone to make this right. Item not cheap.",

I have oily/combo skin and find that this applies smoothly and while not particularly moisturizing, it doesn\u2019t make my skin feel tight or dry over the course of the day. It is also one of few sunscreens that have not felt irritating/contributed to breakouts. Have not had any issues purchasing (& one repurchase) through Amazon as the product quality has been consistent for me and Amazon is an authorized reseller according to the manufacturer (unlike a popular online Derm focused website, which is surprisingly on the manufacturer\u2019s unauthorized reseller list).",
