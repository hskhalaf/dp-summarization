I have contacted Brother many, many times for help. They respond, but only to tell me to read the manual or the on-line help...which I have already done, more than once, yet they continue to send the same \"support\" answer. So, don't expect much support from Brother if you have issues. If your problem is a simple solution and covered in the manual you will be fine, otherwise - you are on your own.",

It's easy to change threads, and fairly easy to pick up where you left off if you break either thread or bobbin thread. There is a stitch counter on the display, but also a \"cursor\" on the pattern that shows you where you are, which makes it a little easier to back up to where the thread broke. If you are using quality thread, it won't happen much.",

As a complete non sewer, I found it easy to use but had a lot of issues that I believe if I knew how to sew wouldn\u2019t have been issues for me. But now that I\u2019ve worked out all the kinks it\u2019s a good little machine and i use it all of the time. I got a good deal on it so overall it was a good purchase.",

Some fabrics don't embroider well, namely ones with stretch, but, with practice, this machine will even do those decently. Just plan on paying a few dollars for any really cool embroidery patterns. This is definitely entry-level. If you are able to make your own embroidery files, I think you would want a model up, though",

I love it more each time I try a new design. Highly recommend this model Brother for much pleasure. Enjoy!",
