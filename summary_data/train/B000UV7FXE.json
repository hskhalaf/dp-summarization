Anyway, finding skincare that doesn't dry out my dry patches or act up my acne but still cleanses is very difficult. This totally does the trick!!! It cleanses without drying bUT still feels clean and doesn't exacerbate any redness or acne. Totally recommend!!!",

I also like that I dont need to use a full pump, half a pump is more than enough to wash my face, behind ears and decolletage.
