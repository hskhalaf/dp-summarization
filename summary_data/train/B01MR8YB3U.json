It wasn't as responsive as we'd hoped, and the phrases/songs got repetitive quickly. It still feels like we're missing some phrases or stories or something, but we can't seem to get her to say anything new. Her crown doesn't stay on very well, but it occasionally gets worn by my daughter, so it has some replay value. The lack of leg movement was a bit of a let down for the kids. The head an eye movement was enthralling for a bit, but wasn't enough to keep them engaged.",

Seems it\u2019s an attractive prop, but not fun as a robot. On the plus side, she\u2019s been practicing the braiding I taught her on it.",
