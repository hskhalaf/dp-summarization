It's hard to handle a wheelbarrow across my mulched garden but this isn't much help. With a 50-pound bag, it was easy to move except I had to practically hunch in half to prevent it from falling out. It's waaaay smaller than it looks too, that bag pretty much filled it up. It will probably make a nice dolly but it's highly overpriced for what I needed.",

Definitely not capable of lifting heavy items. If something is light enough for this thing to carry, it would also be light enough for you to carry it yourself...",

Likewise it also has a small carrying capacity but that allows it to navigate into small places and not require much storage space, so that's another acceptable tradeoff. I've found it to be an excellent cart for residential horticulture. Barring steep slopes, you can usually easily get whatever you would usually have to carry from one place to another. I like mine so much I have ordered almost all the add-on accessories and use them all on one occasion or another.",

Very, very handy! The ONLY problem with it, is the wheels do not steer, so turning tight corners takes maneuvering. Doable, just have to learn the dimensions so you can make the tight turns. Yes, I recommend buying this cart.",
