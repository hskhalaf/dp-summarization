      "text": "My wrx came already came with a short throw shifter. While it felt so much better going through shorter gears, did not feel as confident when shifting. The extra weight makes it an entire difference. I'd highly recommend any weighted knob when installing a short throw. I chose this one for style, price, and weight. I'd recommend getting a blox racing adapter to complete the look which is located right under the knob. For comparison i believe stock knob is .3 lbs compared to this knob which is closer to 1lb.",

      "text": "I've ordered a few knobs before but they were just for aesthetics. They never had the weight to them, so shifting felt so awkward. I opted it to get a weighted one and hoped it would provide a better experience. The Mishimoto Weighted Shift Knob is really amazing! It provides a smooth shifting experience. Fits a Honda Civic 2007, but it is a bit high - It isn't a deal-breaker. Get's warm/hot during the day and cold during the night. Comes with three plastic adapters which I assume is for different vehicles. Overall - satisfied with the product.",

The knob literally slides through gears, it's so smooth and effortless. The knob also looks really appealing, it has a clean darkened chrome look to it. The shift knob has great weight to it as well, could knock someone out! Even though this may seem obvious, but because it's a metal shiftknob..the knob does tend to get hot/cold depending on the temperature. You'll either be greeted by an icicle or satans fist! Love it, would buy again!",

It gets really cold in the winter time so I'm assuming it gets hot in the summer as well. It sits kinda high up on the shifter so I modified the adapter to allow it to screw down further which you can see in the last two pictures its lower.",

      "text": "I bought this as a temporary knob in my MR2. I cant complain too much for 40$ but there are a few things you should be aware of. This thing is slim, it feels more like a hand brake handle than a knob. Secondly, the plastic adapters that come with it only allow you to screw it on like a inch not the full 2 inches, making it feel wonky/unstable counteracting the weighted concept. However, they are plastic, so you can easily tap the one you need if you have the tools. After that fix it works like a charm. If it was thicker and fit better, I'd probably keep it. But I'll be looking for a replacement soon.",

      "text": "The quality of this product is beyond what I was inspecting. From the packaging it came in to the knob itself, it is worth every penny. It comes with three threaded nylon adapters of different sizes that should fit most cars with a stick. The knob is very heavy which is awesome, and the black chrome finish is beautiful. It extends the shift knob quite a bit. Doesn't make your shifter a short throw obviously since the actually distance of each gear change hasn't changed, but it does provide you a great deal more leverage. For the price, you can't beat this knob.",
