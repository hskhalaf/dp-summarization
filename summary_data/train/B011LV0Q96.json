But once you have it figured out, it's well worth the small amount of effort required to get it right. The two different cast-drag settings, one on either side, are easy to maneuver, and the idea is that you set it for your own style of casting. I paid $40 for this reel. You can pay much more for baitcasting reel, but in my opinion, you don't need to. I paired mine with a 7' medium-heavy Ugly Stik rod. It is now my go-to reel.",
