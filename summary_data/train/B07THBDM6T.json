HOWEVER, these Yoga laptops have one major issue which seems to be consistent with many Lenovo touchscreens. The Touch screen stops working with your finger. It still works with the Lenovo pen but that's about it. Apparently it's a BIOS/Driver issue and Lenovo refuses to address this issue. if you're going to buy this laptop with the intention of using the touch screen, I would recommend looking this issue up.
