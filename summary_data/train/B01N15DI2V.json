At no point did the phone remotely look like it would come out, so this did it's job perfectly. I even took a bit of a tumble and the phone stayed where it was supposed to. Fitting it to the handlebars was a simple job, just put it on and tighten it....easy as that. Highly recommend this phone mount!",

Held phone securely while riding and its super easy to get the phone out of the mount - no unscrewing things - just flip the band off and pull the phone out of the mount.",

The colored rubber band like things were sturdy and kept it in place. I used one color the whole way from NY to VA and they give you two other rubber bands with it. The mount worked great even with my bike having rather large handles. One thing to note is if it rains you will need something to cover the phone. This mount served it's purpose perfectly and I would definitely recommend it.",

I'm not sure I would trust it to hold my phone securely without one of the provided rubber bands, although other reviewers said they've had good success. Given the spring action, it seems that the wider your phone, the more secure it will be. One bit of advice: Be sure to measure your handlebars and compare with the specifications: mine was almost too big.",

      "text": "This is a great phone holder. It fits my iPhone 6s with a Defender Otterbox on it. The additional elastic rubber holder adds extra security. I have a slanted handler bar so I mounted it in the slope. The only con is that it is hard to remove the phone. It would be nice to have a release for the spring. However, that is why makes it hold the phone so we\u2019ll.",

I wanted it on my bike stem and ended up taking off the rubber layer for the attachment area, but it still doesn't budge once screwed on. I had my phone mounted on this mostly for music on a 60mile ride on gravel/trail, and my phone moved around WAY less than expected! With all the bumping and maneuvering, I expected it to dip down instead of staying up the whole time. I didn't have to adjust it more than once or twice the whole ride. When I was back on the smoother road, even with potholes and such, it still stayed in place. Great product for the price!",

I looked at a lot of phone mounts, so many of which seemed error prone especially over rough terrain. I love that this one has a clamp AND a net to hold the phone. I also appreciate the longer pin provided to secure the mount, as my bike has goofy handlebars that aren't actually round. The longer pin was necessary to span the distance. Super pleased with the performance so far, my phone has been completely stable on multiple rides. I will be buying another for my husband.",

The clamp does not actually fit over the handlebars correctly. The reason this product is listed as able to fit a 1.3\" diameter is because it comes with an additional screw clamp that is longer. The curve of the part that goes around the handlebars don't fix exactly. Since it still holds my Pixel 2 XL phone I didn't feel the need to return. I would purchase again.",
