If you\u2019re not going to work on your club face and swing before buying these you\u2019re wasting money. However!! A soft swing will crush the ball 100 yards easy. These clubs have a lot of power. The power comes from connecting clean with the ball though. So if you have a bad swing. These won\u2019t fix it. 4 stars because they are expensive.",

My A Wedge used to be my 100 yard club. I now get 85. My 7 iron was my 150 club. It is now 130. Am going to my fairway woods much more often.",

Features * New RIBCOR design stiffens the perimeter of club head, focusing face flexibility in the hitting area for distance and forgiveness with greater energy transfer to the golf ball * Optimized heel and toe weighting increase MOI for even more forgiveness * Speed Pocket structure and ultra-thin leading edge work together to increase speed on shots hit low on the face * Fluted hosel and 360A undercut cavity saves weight, redistributing it low in the head to increased launch distance and consistency RIBCORNew RIBCOR design localizes club face flexibility in the hitting area to transfer more energy to the ball for more distance and forgiveness. It also stiffens the perimeter of the club head for a more rigid club, enhancing sound and feel.
