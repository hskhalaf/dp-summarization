I really like the feature this screen has which brighten up dark corners. The colour is not the the best and my biggest gripe is the viewing angle, when I lay down on my chair to watch movies, the top of the screen will become really dark. I only spent 30% of my time playing FPS games, so I can not justify the reason to keep this screen, but this is definitely the best screen for CSGO Pros!",

Otherwise seems very good quality, sturdy and great picture, can be rotated and very flexible.",

If you've got a decent gfx card (I have a GTX780) it's going to be worth every penny, 144hz topline (most monitors are 59/60hz) I used to think the white background on webpages such as this one for example were white, the thing is when you see webpages on this thing then you really will know what white is. Superb range of resolutions for gaming and no lag at all. Got a proper gfx card? Get one of these. I spent ages deciding and it's superb knowing that being fussy was worth it.",
