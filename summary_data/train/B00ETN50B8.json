Install - hopefully you have a better Allan wrench like one I attached that has chuck and socket capabilities. Attach the bottom shelf first to the legs first ... fasten one side completely, leave the other loose. Flip the top upside down. You'll put the tight side in its slot first then apply pressure to the other legs to pull them into place as well. If you tighten the shelf completely, you won't have enough play in the legs to pull them into their slots. Good luck",

Yes, its made with real wood not particle board, (which just for that makes it a great buy for the price) but the wood they used dents and scratches extremely easily. For example, if you drop something hard like the corner of a TV remote on the table there will be a deep dent and it will expose the raw wood color without the stain.

      "text": "3.8 stars. Ok, so this is a great table. Solid wood, looks great, perfect size. My only complaint is that one of the wood slates is significantly of a different height than the rest. Now, I expected an uneven surface, and even like that about this table overall. But, this one slate.... It's like, maybe 1/4 inch higher than the rest. That might not sound like a lot, but it is on a table; cups don't really balance, for example. Fortunately it's just the one slate that's so far off, so I turned the table around so I wouldn't be so annoyed with it.",

The wood has a beautiful reclaimed look to it and I love that it is real wood. The ONLY reason I didn\u2019t give five stars is that the place where the bottom shelf of the coffee table screws into the metal leg pieces was angled incorrectly on one side so I had to use a rubber mallet to correct it in order to install the lower shelf. But with that done the assembly was easy (my 3 year old installed a lot of the screws lol) and the final product exceeds my expectations. Very happy overall!",
