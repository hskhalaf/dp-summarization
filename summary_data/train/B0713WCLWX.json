Luckily none of them were broken, so that's cool. but still, whats up with that???",

PROS: Easy to clean up after they're done burning in my himalayan sea salt lamps (I've found that other votive candles tend to really stick to the salt and are nearly impossible to clean out of the space where the votives go). Burn for a long time! No scent whatsoever! Great value overall.",
