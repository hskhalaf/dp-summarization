      "text": "After spending a loooong time reviewing these indoor grills, I must say I\u2019m very happy with my purchase. First time using it today I grilled a tri tip steak. It was done in about 10 minutes to perfection. I can\u2019t comment about any smoke because the steak grilled was very lean. I suppose a meat with a higher fat content would obviously lend itself to smoke issues. Clean up was super easy. Turn it off, lay a damp paper towel on it and close the lid for approximately 30 seconds. Use your tongs on the paper towel to easily remove any residue. Cleaned up absolutely spotless. I mean seriously, you can\u2019t beat the quality for under 50.00.",

Also, since there are plates on the top and bottom, it makes for faster and even cooking. It's not that hard to clean - I use a grill brush when the plates are still hot and then I'll wipe down with a damp paper towel before I put the grill away. Definitely a great purchase!",

Other than the fact that the product broke after only 3 months, I will note that it is a pain to clean since the grill doesn't come apart.",

Very glad I did because it grills hamburgers, chicken and steaks and is much better at sealing in the juices. It is also very easy to clean and you do not need a brush. Wet paper towel and tongs is all you need. Great grill for two people and excellent for apartment size counters. Have grilled daily since March 31st delivery and it has been a great experience. A wonderful buy at $38.69 and worth every penny even at regular price.",

      "text": "The use of this grill has been limited so far to grilling sandwiches. The end result was achieved satisfactorily, after several attempts at repositioning the sandwiches, for they kept sliding downwards due to the sloping angle of the grill plate. Despite this, the grill heated up rather quickly and evenly distributed the heat. It was easy to operate and with time, we'll be grilling meats, poultry and fish. Hopefully, the food will stay in position and make the grilling experience a pleasurable and easy one.",
