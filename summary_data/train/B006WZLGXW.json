It is very small though, maybe it's just me but it seems like she will outgrow it by the time she is 3 (she is 18 months now). Like it said, it is very simple so if that is what you are looking for it is perfect. I think it is a little overpriced for what it is, however. She does love it though and has been playing with it non-stop. Make sure to secure it to the wall, because it is very light and can be tipped over easily.",

This was easy to put together. It came in one big box and my husband had it together in less than 30 minutes (part of that time was us ooo-ing and aww-ing over how cute everything was). The handles for the faucet spin (no noise) and the oven knobs turn and make clicking sounds. The oven door and under the sink door are heavy enough that they stay closed, but easy to open.
