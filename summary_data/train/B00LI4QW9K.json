My one gripe is all the screws that come together at the top, just under the top of the unit. All the plastic tabs you have to put over the screws in that one location look really cheesy. I'm going to take them off and put some dark brown paint on the screws instead. It's also in a dark part of the room, so it doesn't show. And I'm not sure how you could fasten it all together without having multiple screws there.",

The toughest part was unpacking boxes. You need to prepare all assemble tools, but one plus driver is enough for all process.
