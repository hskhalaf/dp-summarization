This allows quicker recoil and subsequently quicker reactivation of the tool. It might become a matter of familiarity, but I find this unit slower to use. Solid unit for the price and quick transaction.",

If you get a lot of neck, shoulder or back muscle knots...this is a great little tool...even if you see a chiropractor regularly...as my family does. It never fails...the weekend hits, the chiropractor is closed, and I have a stiff neck! This little clicker will loosen it right up and make you feel like a million bucks soon after and even better the next day. A great buy!",

Worst part is there is no way to begin to fix it... Too pricy in my mind for it to only last a short time. But it saves me office visits to it pays for itself",
