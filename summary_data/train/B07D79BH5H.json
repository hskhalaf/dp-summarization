He ABSOLUTELY LOVES them. I knew he would so I bought him 2 pairs because Amazon had a temporary price reduction on them and it was worth it to get him a backup pair. He says they are super comfortable and when he comes home, his feet don't hurt at all. As for fit, my husband is typically a 9 in most sneakers, depending on the model/MFR but in New Balance and these CRAG V1's he's a 9 1/2. They fit him perfectly!",
