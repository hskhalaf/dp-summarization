And also, you may use a spoon to help to disssolve all the powder at beginning, but after a few minutes the mug does it works! Really nice. I recommend it.",

It doesn't hold too much coffee as I throw in powder creamer and a little International Delight liquid creamer in there, but the fact that it mixes these altogether from the bottom causes less mess vs a regular mug and having to stir all these ingredients togther from the top, which causes the mixture to spill over the edges creating big messes. The only little issue I have found is the bottom of the mug that holds the batteries isn't fully secure and easily comes off. Either way, I continue to recommend this mug to anyone, coffee drinker or not!",
