My cats are pissed off. They will not use anything unless it is sandy, and this is more like the old type of clay cat litter. I didn't realize Arm & Hammer sold this kind. I bought 2 boxes and it's too heavy to return, so I don't know what to do with it. Probably donate it. Also, it's mushy to try to scoop out stuff. It's the worst crap I've seen in a cat litter.

I have noticed from time to time that reviews for Arm & Hammer have varied and are often more negative than positive, which I don't understand. It's become the only littler we use for the feline members of our family. The Arm & Hammer litter does indeed make some great clumps and with four adorable felines, the scented litter is appreciated by \"all\" members of the family. (Quick Tip: Walmart still carries the 40 lb boxes, which I order online and they deliver within 2-4 days.)",
