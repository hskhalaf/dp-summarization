It's convenient to be able to brown food (or saute onions, etc) on the stove top with it, then transfer to the slow cooker. Size is good for just the 2 of us as well (never too much food as the rest can refrigerate for lunch the next day). I am confident leaving this overnight while sleeping, although the kitchen smells like food when we wake up (doesn't hold all the smells inside, but that's probably a good thing). I also prefer this digital timer to a non-digital one, and it automatically switches to 'keep warm' when finished cooking.",

Have only made two dishes with it so far (a stew, and crock-pot lasagna), but both came out perfectly! Easy cleanup of the no-stick pot as well! (I followed the suggestion of cleaning it by hand instead of in the dishwasher). Highly recommend getting one if you are in the market.",
