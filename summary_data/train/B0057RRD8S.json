Not a deal-breaker, but I wouldn't use it again to bake something that has a stellar topping. They are probably going to see more action as serving pieces that oven-to-table, to that reason. Typical Pyrex quality - hefty, well made, glass covers fit nicely, more pleasing to the eye than the regular flat casserole dishes. Overall, I'm pleased with this purchase.",
