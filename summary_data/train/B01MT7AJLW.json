      "text": "SONY hasn't disappointed me, as always! These headphones are absolutely amazing! I have tried many models and I got this after having the wired sisters MDR-XB950 for over 2 years. I wasn't sure if it was worth to switch to Bluetooth due to battery life (for the headphones and the device), sound quality and strength of the item, but OMG! And the Bass Boost mode is indescribable! If you love bass, these are for you and definitely worth the price! Same light and resistant quality of the previous models and if you run out of battery you'll only have to plug in the provided wire and carry on listening to your tracks!! LOVE THEM!",

Maybe my only complaint is that it feels a bit fragiley constructed, a little more plastic than I would hope for - but so long as you take good care it should be fine. They are however light, lighter than its noise cancelling version that I've tried. But the sound is wonderful and for any bassheads, it's just perfect. Battery lasts a good long time, too.",

After only a few months of ownership, cracks started appearing in the plastic. Turns out this is a very common problem with Sony\u2019s MDR headphone range.",

I returned them to Sony but Sony would not honour the guarantee and wanted to charge \u00a370 to fix them. As I\u2019d only paid \u00a3100 I thought this was way too much. Their customer complaints system was utterly frustrating, and verging on non-existent, with subsequent people simply reciting the same line to me that there was \u2018nothing\u2019 they could do. Outrageously, they even wanted to charge me \u00a328 to return them broken! I was very surprised that a company the size of Sony would have such shoddy customer service. I will avoid buying Sony in future.",

      "text": "I tried a few different headphones before settling for these (some were higher price). The music I listen to is mainly hip hop so the bass is important to me and these headphones certainly didn't let me down on that front. The fact you can have the bass boosted or normal is also a great feature. They are well made and sit comfortably over the ear with no sound leakage. Bluetooth connects instantly and the battery life is excellent. The only downside is that you don't get a case or protective pouch so you have to buy one of these separately (this is a must when buying headphones)",
