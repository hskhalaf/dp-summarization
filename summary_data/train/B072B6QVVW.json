      "text": "as written by the 10 year old who uses Sphero mini: Sphero mini is an evolutionary device for the whole family. The perfect size makes it easily transportable for on the go fun! From the fun of building courses and playing \u201chide and seek\u201d possibilities are endless. It\u2019s not only a toy but it\u2019s a game! I love the different ways you can control it; tilt, slingshot, face drive, and much more! I have an original Sphere, too. this one is similar, but a whole lot different. Mini seems faster and quicker. Also, the LED inside Sphero-mini is cool. Sphero mini is a great product.",

I love the idea and it seems pretty solid but just like the first Sphero ball they made, the 2.0 was much better (power, speed, control, etc). So my advice is to keep supporting this company because they are doing great things. I hope their price points remain affordable because these toys are still \"toys\" If money is tight and you are considering your options then wait for 2.0 mini",

Also, I recommend downloading the Sphero edu app first. The kids can actually code with it. The play app is fun but not for long.

Cons: the exterior shell snaps together (our dog can easily break it apart [I understand this was not designed as a dog toy, though]), you must remove the shell to charge it. The cons are minor, but if a rubber cover we're available, that would solve the problem of Lucy breaking it apart. I've seen the request from others who own this, too. Overall, a fun little robot.",

It rolls right over carpets, rugs, hard wood floors, floor vents, and even some doorways (if you\u2019re at full speed). Very fast shipping from Amazon and the manufacturer. Accessories ordered from Sphero have free shipping in the US, I ordered the plain white shell. Total winner all around. Great gift for any geek!",
