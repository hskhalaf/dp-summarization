I filled out the information and submitted it and within seconds I received an email saying it was denied because the problem was due to my negligence. Seconds later I received another one directing me to call a number for assistance. This situation is pretty cut and dried. A machine shouldn\u2019t leak water! Also, a Nespresso Citiz should last more than 6 months! Save your money when it comes to Square Trade!!",

It\u2019s the perfect size. Cons: - Noisy! Is this standard because it\u2019s an espresso machine? I\u2019d say its vibrations are 2x as loud as a Keurig, for example. - Does not produce an 8oz cup of coffee so you end up using more Nespresso cups, which I think will be expensive over time",
