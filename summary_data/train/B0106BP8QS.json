      "text": "This is the second Skylink system. I bought the SK-200 for my house and now installed the similar SK-150 for my apartment. They are easy to set up and install. I've been monitoring my house for months now & the system works well. I can opt to get notifications on my iPhone & Apple watch. I called tech support because I thought my motion sensor wasn't working well. The tech representative was very nice & helpful. The motion sensor goes on the ceiling & not on the wall as I had placed it. Now it works well. I no longer pay a fortune for having my security system monitored.",

It works but....you need to know how all the pieces work and you are responsible for your setup and home security. This kit removes the \"middle\" man from the home security model. You set it up, you programs and place the pieces and you make sure it sends you notifications via Internet to cell phone. Make sure you have a UPS on your Internet/cable modem, router and Skylink hub. We are happy and it works.",

Because of that, it can't be disarmed by those family members. Other less critical complaints include the camera not recording when the alarm is triggered and the sensors having small stickers that cause the two sided installation tape to fall off. I've sent the details of the app problems to the alarm company, but they haven't addressed the problem yet. If the problem is fixed, I'll update this review.",

It takes 5-7 attempts to open properly EVERY time the app closes. The app WILL NOT alert you if a zone trips, even with notifications selected. The app opened the camera once every dozen times I tried to open it to view area. Sent feedback with no reply, so customer service is as effective as the garbage app. There are better options out there...use them and stay away from this product. At least until they pull their head out and address the looming issues with the crappy app.",

I did not expect much given the price, but the hook up was simple, there is not monthly fees and I love how it works with IFTTT and third party devices. I even have it configured to call my landlord if the alarm goes off via IFTTT, which is pretty darn cool. The alerts are instant and work better than expected. The only downside to the product is that it would be fairly simple to unplug from the wall and disable. I guess by the time it is disabled, it has alerted you, but it sort of makes the siren a bit of a mute point.",
