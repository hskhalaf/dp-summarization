It also requires a good amount of space to accommodate it. The LCD is quite outdated now and not as user friendly as newer models, but for it's time, it was functional and served it's purpose. The keys are and always have been good to the touch, but are annoyingly loud, especially during high speed typing. Personally speaking, for it's time, it was a great product until it got a little age under it. After that, you had to deal with the compromise in performance and rickety construction.",

It sure looks great on my desk, though, and I really like the volume control and keys for controlling iTunes.",

Visually all the components were fine, so I bought the same model used and so far it is working just as well as the last. I love having the media control keys easily accessible and performance monitor on the LCD, I can tell if silent programs are leeching CPU or RAM. Highly recommend.",

The room where I keep my PC has a lot of natural light during the days, so I've since switched to the Saitek Eclipse keyboard (blue against silver keys) which I can comfortably use night and day. The Saitek doesnt have all the features of the logitech, so if Logitech comes out with a G15 with silver keys I would probably switch back.",
