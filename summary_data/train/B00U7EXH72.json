This is a great toy and very easy to fly and i do not mind that out of the box it only lasted no more then 10 minutes for every charge but with in a month of use the charging became an issue where it would not fully charge and would only last a few minutes after each charge. Ive even replaced batteries in the remote several time and still only charged up to fly a couple of minutes. So now after a couple month both are useless.",

If there is any wind, it becomes more of a kite than a quad copter. Feels delicate, but handles the abuse. Flight time is reasonable at ~ 8-10 minutes.",

It is STAR WARS, so of course that is a cool factor. The material is just painted styrofoam, and the thing eats batteries like crazy.

But this is very good at keep level and not crashing during maneuvers. I've spent more money on brookstone garbage that wasn't half as fun or easy to fly. Only reason I'm not giving this thing five stars is because the battery life could have been better. But besides that this is a perfect purchase.",

      "text": "This was a great Birthday gift for my 8 year old. He loves start wars and he had before some experience with remote control helicopter and cars and was able within the first 2 days 5 (flights) to fly the Millenium Falcon controlled throughout the house. It is pretty rugged and the blades are pretty well hidden so when it hits an obstacle it just bounces of it. The controls are standard like for a drone or a remote control helicopter.",
