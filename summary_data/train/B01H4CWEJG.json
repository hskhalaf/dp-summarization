I knew I wouldn't be able to keep white trainers clean so I bought black ones which weren't reduced as much but still well priced. The fit is really comfortable and the tread is brilliant even in wet running conditions. They always look smart and the black ones only need cleaning now and then. The white ones need a little more attention.",

They absorb the impact brilliantly, the sole provides good grip, even on smooth surfaces and the top provides a good amount of water resistance.",
