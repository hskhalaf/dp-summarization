I am definitely looking into buying a secondary system for my house I would definitely recommend one of these filtration systems,,, excellent product.",

I take water everywhere I go with me now because nothing is as good as my water from home after installing this system. Very pleased all around.",

I was using an alkaline pitcher for about 6 months, which cured my heartburn issues. Since using this filter, I have not had a single issue with heartburn, so I'm assuming the PH level is high enough. Easily worth the investment.
