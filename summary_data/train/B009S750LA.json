I feel like they should have to make a new category to reflect this obviously cheaper, low quality, maximum profit version 2. If you could see it in real life next to their own Version 1, you would not buy this cheap welded scrap.",

I don't think you'll find a better stand in the price range and as a tall person, having appropriate monitor ergonomics did wonders for my neck and back! Setup is relatively quick and easy and the stand is very stable. Yes there are nicer stands out there with better range of motion and articulating capabilities, but you will have to pay hundreds of dollars for them.

      "text": "I\u2019d give this less stars if it wasn\u2019t still a good quality product. My only problem was that out of all things, the FASTENER was missing (it normally comes inserted and is not a separate assembly piece). So the one piece that ties the entire product together was left out during production. Despite this flaw, I didn\u2019t want to return this item since I felt I could fix it myself. Should anyone else encounter this problem, the best way to fasten the arms to the pole base is to tighten an M7 1.00-30 hex bolt/nut with a socket wrench and pliers. This is a great product, but the attention to detail in the production and warehousing departments could be better.",

      "text": "This device claims to have the capability of supporting two different sized monitors but they will not align correctly. Customer support has informed me the only way to do this would be to purchase an additional piece of hardware (STAND-VAD3) which then gives you the ability to move one of the two monitors up and down to align correctly. However, this additional piece of hardware is half the cost of this dual mounting bracket. Between the cost of the dual bracket and this additional hardware it may be cheaper for you to purchase two single monitor mounts and have more control over positioning.",

      "text": "After days of searching, I was excited to get this product only to be disappointed. The assembly instructions are easy, I was able to assemble this and mount it to my desk within minutes of receiving the package. But when I got the monitor up on the mount, it could not hold the weight to keep the tilt at eye level. I tried to tighten the bolt for the tilt up or down on the arm but as soon as I slide the monitor on it tilted down immediately. The product is rated to hold up to 22lbs of monitor weight on each arm, but it could not hold 14.2lbs of ViewSonic VA2703-LED monitor, returning it for refund.",
