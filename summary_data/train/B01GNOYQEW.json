My main reason for purchasing it was to use while motorcycle riding when space is limited with what I can bring so I am always looking for different ways to fit what I need in my saddlebags, etc., which are on the small size. This fits perfectly inside my bag. I can put all of our toiletries in the side pouches and the top \"flap\" and pack my undergarments and probably 7 shirts inside the main compartment. I am thrilled! I respect this company - I have a UV nail light for when I do my own gel nails and it has worked wonderfully for over 4 years now. Quality products for a reasonable price.",

Also using epoxy I beefed up the top part where the upper support attaches to the bag itself. I say this because I LIVE out of my bag. I work group homes and do overnights all week. This bag is outstandingly ideal. Like really awesome. Buy it for a normal person, and if you use it DAILY and FULL do a couple simple mods. Very happy :^)",

After our first outing with this case, we've concluded that we'll still probably have to put our shampoo and conditioner in a separate case. Everything fit, but it didn't zip without a struggle. We didn't want to break the zipper. The bottom piece seems a bit flimsy. But overall, a pretty good deal.",
