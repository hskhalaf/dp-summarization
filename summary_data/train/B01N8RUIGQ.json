Colors were bright and true to the ad photos. CONS: Slipshod workmanship on ladies set! (See photos) Laundered on **gentle** before wearing and the seam on one of the pant legs came apart requiring repair. Strings also protruding from the top in several places. (Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that starts coming apart soon, too.) Very disappointed that these required mending even before the first wear\u2014especially for the price we paid. $50, and definitely not up to the quality expected at that price. We\u2019ve purchased $20 pajama sets in the past that held up better than this.",
