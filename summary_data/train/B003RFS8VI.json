The padding covering the springs is thick. I appreciate having a cover to protect the trampoline against the harsh southwest sun. The Zupapa trampoline we bought has the net outside the springs and replaced one (BouncePro) that had the net inside the springs. We replaced numerous nets on the old trampoline which involved having to thread rope in and out of the enclosure to attach it to the trampoline. The Zupapa enclosure did not involve this time-consuming threading; the Zupapa was easy to attach and is very secure. Totally happy with the purchase!!",

      "text": "The 15 footer arrived quickly in 3 large boxes and items were packed well. I assembled it solo in a couple hours and only needed a hand when fastening the net surround to the trampoline frame. We've had all ages on it and everyone's quite pleased! Quick tip- For the net surround, you have poles within padding like pipe insulation and it slides together into a sleeve. It will fight you every inch of the way. Grab the baby powder. Puff a bunch of it into the sleeve, then powder the padding, and it'll slip right in. The extra powder just falls out when you raise it all up for installation.",

In the description it is recommended to have 2 people put it together and this is true, otherwise assembly is straightforward and easy. Make sure to assemble it close to the location you want it to be since moving it is a challenge even with 2 people. The safety netting and spring covers are essential when kids are jumping every which way. Our kids have been saved from a fall by the netting several times. Highly recommended product and customer service answers promptly to emails.",

But, it's good in theory and can keep the mat cool on a sunny day if it is in direct sunlight. We roll it to the side to jump. We just have to take it off if it is going to rain or snow.

We've had it for a year now and it gets used almost daily during the summer months and it has been holding up very well. Would highly recommend that you stake it into the ground, we didn't do that and wind storm tipped it up on it's side last fall and bent two of the net poles ...with that customer support has been outstanding helping us get replacements. I've very pleased that we can get this fixed without having to throw it out and buy new one! Too many times I find products are throw-a-way; which, is not the case here.",

We have had the trampoline for two years now and it has held up well through snow, rain, sun, etc. Customer support has also been extremely responsive and helpful - I had an inquiry through amazon regarding the safety cover over the springs, and they responded very quickly and professionally. I would definitely recommend this trampoline to others who are interested in buying.",

She (and all of us) were devastated. I emailed the company and they couldn\u2019t have been kinder. They sent all new replacement parts free -that we received 1 week later! I was shocked and amazed.
