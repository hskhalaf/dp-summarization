The BT3500 is supposed to have stereo, 10W (other was mono, 4W), sound in comparison is not much different, though. Deep basses are not what I expected. It's totally fine for indoor-use with neighbors, not really recommendable for outdoor, like huge terraces or even at the beach (with noises around). Positive aspect: it can be in use while charging the device at the same time. Price is lower-end.",

It worked great for a while. One day took it outside because I decided to bbq and it was perfect at full volume until it decided to lower itself to half the volume. Tried multiple devices on Bluetooth and it was doing the same thing. Worked fine again for a few days after and again one day decided to lower the volume itself. Sadly I will be returning this item.",

I liked it so much because I use it as my \"bathroom speaker\" when I take a shower. I love to listen to music when I shower and the size and sound is perfect. Can't find a speaker this size with such a great base sound. All the other speakers this size and price range sound a bit too tinny for me. So I am so glad I found it again on Amazon and at a cheaper price than when I initially bought it a few years ago!",

BTW, my unit didn't come with a manual so I went to the Phillips site, put the model in the search, & a PDF manual pulls right up. Downloaded it to my computer & I'm ready to go should I need to consult it in the future.",
