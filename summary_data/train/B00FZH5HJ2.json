I only have a laundry closet, not room so I need something I can bring out when I need to and not a installed rack. But I am finding I can use it for more than just drying clothes. It works great for this, but love that I can take it outside on days my kids play in water and it will hold their towels and dry them between uses. Used it in a garage sale to display a bunch of blankets. You get the idea!",

It\u2019s still not the sturdiest but it fulfills it\u2019s purpose so I\u2019d repurchase due to the great customer service if I found it on sale and needed a replacement. \u2014 I\u2019ve been using this rack to dry my sweaters for 2 months and it already has broken. The plastic where it hooks on at the top snapper off. It worked great while it lasted but it\u2019s definitely not the quality product I thought I was purchasing. Would not recommend.",

Since it says its rated for outdoor use as well, we use it to hang our towels and swim suits.
