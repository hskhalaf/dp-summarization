I did not tuck in the lining as shown but left it out. While assembling watch the YouTube video instead of the reading the instructions enclosed, MUCH easier!

There was several comments in previous reviews regarding the quality of the wood. We had two boards that were very slightly warped and in attempting to tighten the screw, the board split slightly. A bit of wood glue and some gentle tightening and all seems to be good.",

Easy for two people to assemble in less than an hour, very sturdy design and materials, well thought out. I especially like the ample dimensions and counter-height of the medium size. The height makes it very easy to work in without kneeling, stooping or bending. Recommend that buyers visit the VegTrug website for a 3 minute video that will make assembly easy to understand and accomplish. By the way, it takes about 11-12 cubic feet of soil to fill up what VegTrug calls the medium size to within 6 inches of the top.",

      "title": "Awesome raised bed",
      "text": "We bought this to compliment our square raised beds and to plant squash and zucchini in. The height makes it perfect to check for squash bugs and to keep an eye on those quickly growing zukes. It looks great in our garden and has been awesome so far. It's a little awkward to put together but only took about 20-30 minutes by myself. If I had a second pair of hands, it probably would have gone together in 10-15. Highly recommend using a drill as there are a lot of screws, especially when attaching the side panels.",
