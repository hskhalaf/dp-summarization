I use this thing one night and just right the next morning i can walk like 70% better!! thats when this machine earn 5 stars for me. My wife later used succesfully for a shoulder/ neck pain.",

The warranty does not cover this type of damage, it only covers defective issues or if the product fails. Discussing this with the customer service gets you know where. I will look for a better model, different company and cut my losses as a bad purchase.",

After several sessions, I had much less pain and more mobility in my knee. Then, the unit rapidly became less and less powerful until it was unable to deliver any stimulation at all. I tried recharging the battery, replacing the pads, swapping out the leads--nothing fixed the problem. I'm not willing to pay shipping for this company's warranty, so I'm returning this unit to Amazon. I've already ordered a different TENs device, since this therapy seems to work wonders. I just wish this particular unit lasted more than 48 hours.",

The affects last a few hours, then I can just do another cycle. The main thing I\u2019m loving is that it relieves the pain so I can get up and move. Then movement usually keeps the pain from being too bad. Otherwise, I\u2019m laying in pain, waiting for pills to help enough so I can move. I also love the pressure points list & diagram that shows you where to put the pads for different needs. Many are not even pain related: anxiety, depression that sort of thing.",

One suggestion would be to include 2 electrode pad holders instead of just 1. I did not receive the small size electrode pads-just the large ones. It came in a sealed package so either the web description is wrong or the manufacturer didn\u2019t put them in. Overall very satisfied.",

      "text": "Why oh why did I wait so long to get this?!? After dealing with chronic back pain for months from my arthritis I thought I\u2019d tried everything. My physical therapist suggested I try a tens unit just to see if it helped. I used it 2 days in a row and was able to walk upright again! Now I\u2019m just using it occasionally as needed. The included belt clip is nice but does not hold the unit very firmly. I bent over while wearing it and the unit fell out and cracked the screen. Although the screen is unusable I can still use the unit by just remembering the modes.",

I went with the TechCare model because it is rechargeable and has dual outputs. So far I am satisfied, but have only used it 2 times. I will update the review later as I use it more.",

You have to keep pushing the mode button until you get to the one you want to use, there are 24 modes. I like that there are no batteries and it is rechargeable. Overall for $40 you can't go wrong.",
