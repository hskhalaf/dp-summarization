Few items were packed really well. This item was excellently packed. It had bubble packs in the box to protect the shoes from inside damage. LEBRON SHOES ARE EXPENSIVE IN THE MALL. AMAZON MADE THEM VERY AFFORDABLE. INDEED!!!. It is true to size and very comfortable to wear. The shoes has a very UNIQUE DESIGN. It has tiny tiny rubber spikes in front and back. AWESOME!!!. Burgundy made the shoes a scene stealer. I am very happy and very satisfied with my purchase. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",
