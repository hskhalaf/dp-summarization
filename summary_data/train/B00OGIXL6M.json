Was considering the Vitamix Mixer and separate grain jar, but in the long run, I would rather have a piece of equipment that is designed to do only one thing, with the proper components like grinding stones. Kitchen real estate is a premium, and the grain mill is not only nice looking, but takes up very little space in its storage place.",

Pour the whole grain in and that sound disappears until grinding is almost done. I am too inexperienced a user to know whether or not this is a normal condition.",

      "text": "Beautiful product but we had some problems. When grinding we were forced set the grinding adjustment to coarse and gradually adjust to the finest setting. If we ran out of material and tried to dump more in, the grinder would bind up and stop. If we tried to unscrew the adjustment knob while the machine was running the hopper would disengage from the base forcing us to start the entire process over. The company was awesome with the return, they took it back without a box and were very nice to deal with.",

    "title": "NutriMill Harvest Stone Grain Mill, 450 Watt - Black",
    "description": "Why mill your own flour, when it's so readily available? Commercial mills remove the most nutritious part of the grain in processing, even whole grain flour. Whole grain flours spoil quickly because the bran has been broken which allows oxygen to reach all parts of the grain. Milling your own flour not only ensures that your flour is as nutritious as it can be, it also has a wonderful taste that is lost to commercially made whole-grain flour. The NutriMill Harvest grain mill gives you the control over the quality of food you consume.\n\nWith its bamboo cabinet, the NutriMill Harvest's form matches its function. Its synthetic stone milling heads will grind a full range of textures from cracked grain to pastry fine flour, with an easy-adjust texture control knob, allowing you to make all your favorite recipes with home milled grains.\n\nBuilt to last, designed, assembled and tested in the USA, the Harvest mill uses only the highest quality components to give you many years of reliable service. German quality ceramic grinding stones create a low-heat milling process that does not destroy vitamins and minerals.\n\nThe NutriMill Harvest mill will grind soft or hard wheat, oat groats (dehulled oats), rice, triticale, kamut, spelt, buckwheat, barley, rye, millet, teff, quinoa, amaranth, sorghum and dent (field) corn. It will also grind lentils and dry beans (pinto, red, garbanzo, kidney & more.) It isn't suitable for spices, herbs, oilseeds like flax or sesame, or fibrous materials.\n\nGrind what you need when you need it. Make a blend of grains for hot cereal take your through the morning, fortify dishes with ground lentils for a healthy thickener, or grind pastry flour for a light and lofty birthday cake.\n\n5 year warranty on all parts and factory workmanship.",
