I am extremely allergic to medications so it is always such a trial and error type of situation and very expensive. This wonderful mouth wash cleared it up with no reactions from my mouth and and no complications. I love it and use it twice a day every day. I usually cannot use anything this often, as I am so sensitive. But this product works for me. So am loving it.",

Now that I've found Oral Essentials, there's no going back!!! The combination of ingredients plus xylitol is the key, especially clove. It's so mild, not harsh like commercial brands, swishing 60 seconds 2~3 times a day, really does the trick & lasts! I highly recommend this product, to anyone who's had similar oral concerns.",

This product is supposed to moisturize your mouth, not dry it out. I have enough problems with dry mouth without using something that adds to the problem. So unfortunately, this is something I can't use.",

    "title": "Lumineux Oral Essentials Mouthwash 2 Pack - Clean & Fresh Breath - Certified Non Toxic | Fresh Breath in 14 Days w/o Sensitivity | Fluoride Free | NO Alcohol, SLS Free, Dentist Formulated",
    "description": "Lumineux is the first truly ethical oral care company to emerge on the market in close to a century. Founded on decades of international research conducted by two world-renowned dentists, our products have a back-to-basics approach that use naturally occurring ingredients like Dead Sea salt, aloe vera juice and potent essential oils to handle the source of bad breath, decay and disease without cumulative side-effects, and unnecessary additives. Lumineux is the first oral care product to protect the oral micro biome and neutralize the toxins of bad bacteria, rather than indiscriminately killing bacteria. The result is a clean, non-toxic, and proven effective line of solutions that are backed by clinical and in-the-field studies that are truly head and shoulders above what\u2019s available to consumers. Dr. Kourosh Maddahi, Lumineux\u2019s Founder and CEO, puts it perfectly, saying, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to choose between a product that\u2019s good for you, and a product that actually works.\u201d Lumineux remains the only oral care line to carry the Made Safe certification, as well as Non- Toxic certification for all its products from the LEMI Lab in France, and head-to-head clinical studies against every leading brand from the University of Irvine, California.",
