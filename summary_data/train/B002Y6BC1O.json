The first time using it was unsuccessful, because I didn't get the entire home sprayed. I couldn't reach the 2nd story w/o a ladder. The next time I was able to coat the 1st and 2nd stories and by the next morning all but a couple bees were gone!!! Went from 50+ to 2-3 in a few hours!! Within a couple days had beetles, roaches, and hardshell bugs laying dead on my porches.",

A little expensive compared to the stuff you buy at your local store, but a lot cheaper than hiring a professional, who will probably use this! Built-in measuring cup makes it too easy to mix up, so there is no excuse not to do it yourself!",
