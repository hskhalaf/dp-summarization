I can't even believe how much of a success it was. We had a 14 pound turkey, it cooked in about 2 hours 40 minutes (Stuffed) at 350. We coated the outside with olive oil and some poultry seasoning, and added 2 cups of water to the roaster and that's it! no basting! I don't know if I'll ever try a turkey in the oven, this roaster just worked too well! buy, buy, buy --you'll be happy you did!",

Dial said 210 degrees, liquid was at 143 degrees per my 110 dollar scientific thermometer that is calibrated to be within 1/10 of one degree. It isn't linear either, so if you turn up the dial another 10 degrees, it will go up about 25 degrees in my case. You need to use a different and accurate thermometer as Oster has this thing reading temps way off of reality and no way to predict since the errors are not linear",

Also made 2 racks of pork ribs in 2 hours and the meat was so tender they were sliding out of my fingers. A couple of days ago we made a roast and again, delicious and on the table within 2 hours. The clean up is fairly easy. The only issue I have is that I bought the 22 qt roaster and don't have the sink space to clean when done. The food is so worth it though.",

Even though I left it warming in the roaster for another two hours, the turkey was moist and tasty. You WILL need to invest in one of those thermometers with a wire so you can read the internal temperature without removing the lid. I'll never do a turkey in the oven again.",
