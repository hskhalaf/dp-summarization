I wanted an \u201catomic\u201d clock that kept accurate time, was easy to read, could measure temp & humidity, & was made with metal, not plastic, surrounding the clock face. I have other LaCrosse technology clocks. Their digital clocks with temp sensors still work for time & indoor temp, but the outdoor temp sensors died within a few weeks of putting them outdoors (protected under the roof above our front door). That\u2019s probably due to the high heat & humidity in the area of NC where we live. The only thing missing for me is a second hand. Anyway, the clock has everything else I wanted & it looks great on my livingroom wall.",

Time and humidity are fine, but I\u2019m sad about not having the temperature. Don\u2019t you know we judt missed the return time limit. Sad.",

This one is even bigger so I wanted more than a single hanger, and yes, the clock has three raised mounting pads on the back. The holes in the pads will accept #6 sheet metal screws for a solid, secure installation. I mounted mine on 1/8\" Plexiglass sheet and then screwed that to a couple of 2X4's on the shed. Setting the time zone or replacing the battery means unmounting the clock, but that's not hard. It's huge and it looks great. I've attached some pictures.",

It is on our covered lanai by the pool in north Florida and works fine with time, temperature and humidity. Our temperature varies sometimes from a low the high teens on winter nights to upper 90's with high humidity in the summer. Classy look, large Size and easy to read.
