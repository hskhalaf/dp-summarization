It fit nicely under the seat and also doubled as a gym bag and beach tote. The two outside pockets work well for water bottles or hair products and the zippered pocket works for keys, etc. The two zippered inside pockets are handy and the inside is roomy enough for my swim gear, 2 towels, and shower bag. It is very stylish, roomy and organized bag.",

I do wish there was a back outside pocket, but its not a huge deal. I am overall happy with this bag. The zippers are cheap. Just need to be extra careful with them and not pull too hard.",
