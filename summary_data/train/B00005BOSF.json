Considering that a new one costs well over $100 this was a great choice if you plan on actually using it. I might just end up purchasing one or two more.",

So if you want one of these but want to save money this is a good choice :)",

Thus, I have to either live without force-feedback, or live with an extension cable for my regular corded controller. Tough choice; thanks, Nintendo.",

      "text": "The controller works exactly like a GameCube controller should work. All the buttons feel responsive, and no stickiness. However, the wireless adapter that connects to the GameCube is a little wonky. I've had the signal drop multiple times in the time that I've used it. It's done it so much that I've switched back to using my old wired controller with a wire extender. I got this hoping I could cut the cords from my playing. Turns out the cords were keeping me playing.",
