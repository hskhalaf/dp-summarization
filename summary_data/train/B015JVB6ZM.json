Going back to Windows 7. Maybe Windows 12 will be better. It's going back to Dell. I Hope they keep it. Amazon won't deal with it!",

I run a cloud based case management system and this laptop will not pick up a wifi signal unless I am sitting within 20-30 feet of a wifi router. Absolutely atrocious wifi pickup, to the point I can't use it at all. Dell replaced the wifi card, same problem. I want to get a refund, but I doubt dell will do that. AVOID. AVOID Dell as well.",
