Clean sound with no issues. Here's the thing. To me, nearly all DACs sound the same. People claim they hear all these nuances and differences, calling some DACs open and airy, etc, etc.. That's all nonsense, if anything the difference is distortion levels and their ability to convert the signal without adding artifacts when it's done too slow. Bad: Can't think of any?",

But what\u2019s really important is that it does it\u2019s job, really well. Clean, clear reproduction of the sound source. I mainly use it with spdif optical cables but I\u2019ve tried the usb and coaxial input too. All flawless. Try listening to Neil Young\u2019s website of free stream music in high res off the usb and be floored. Hopefully this thing last. Had it a couple of weeks now and no issues.",
