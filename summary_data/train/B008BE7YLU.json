She spat this treat out fast, growled at it, and walked away. On another note: these also came in the same box as two boxes of canned cat food. These were stuffed in between the boxes of cat food. Most of them were pulverized. Would suggest ordering them separately from anything heavy.",

It looks like it was made for guinea pig not a little dog. I have two small dogs, they're not Chihuahuas but they're small. I have to give them like four or five of them. So I will not likely be reordering the smalls again but the large are great and I love the ingredients.",

      "text": "I purchased these for two main reasons: they are grain free and at a decent price. However, these two reasons didn't matter a bit to my dog who did not care for them. He'll put one in his mouth, then drop it on the ground. Thinking the pieces may be too big than what he is accustomed to, I broke it in half for him but that didn't matter. He still left it untouched. I purchase different brands and flavors on a regular basis so he'll have something new to taste. He has liked the majority of the others but did not care for this one.",
