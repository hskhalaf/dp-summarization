I\u2019m 5\u20192\u201d, 108# and while this carrier is well-padded and engineered, so doubtless comfortable for baby, the straps are really bulky and neither they nor the waist could be adjusted down enough to my size. So it just never felt secured to my body, with everything loose and constantly shifting. I\u2019ve probably tried almost every carrier out there, and in the end found the Baby Bjorn carriers to fit and work the best for me.",

It has all the features I wanted all in one carrier. It has a storage pouch and it is a nice size. It has a hood to block the sun and to cover him when he sleeps. I can carry him front facing in this carrier, which he absolutely loves. This carrier is perfect for me because I am slender at 5\"4' and 125 lbs, and I can adjust it tightly around my small waist. It is perfect and worth every penny!",

I do suggest watching some of the videos. They helped me set the carrier up correctly. It is a shame I had to purchase the protective be teether individually. At this price it should come with it.
