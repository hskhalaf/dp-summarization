Positional audio is perfect as well. -Great battery life, over 16 hours -Lag free wireless -Ecxellent app support -Nice design, doesn't scream 'gamer'. -Microphone is nice and clear. -Feels nicely made and put together. Cons: -Earpad material, I think some velour or microfiber cloth would have been a lot better. The 'sports mesh' isn't the best. But I don't mind too much personally. -Microphone could do with a bit more bass... this headset gets a lot of flak for this but I honestly think it undeserved. All things considered 4.5/5. They sound amazing.",

      "text": "I used to use a pair of Senheiser HD6xx's with a Fiio E10k DAC and ModMic for gaming but got sick of all the wires, so I bought these to go wireless. They are a lot better than I expected. Sound quality isn't as good as my HD6xx but for gaming and ease of use the trade off is worth it. I tried the Logitech G933, which is more expensive, and I hated them. If anything the G533 seems to be a lot better than the G933, especially in build quality. I find myself not even using my HD6xx's anymore just because of the convenience of wireless, even though the HD6xx has clearly better sound.",

Buy. This. Headset. It's a shame because I've enjoyed Logitech products over the years and this has put me off ever purchasing another product.

They look super geeky on top of your head and if that's not your cup of tea you will have to look elsewhere. However, the comfort is amazing for these wireless headphines and the dongle is decent sized. Where as some companies utilise large stands as relievers or super small usb units that are easily lost. This is much better. The sound quality is immaculate although the bass isn't super heavy, it gets a pretty flat tone and the accompanying g hub app is pretty nice.",

Never dropped connection, range is quite good as well and is comfortable to wear long periods of time for me. Can be charged while using but it will not use USB cable for audio, it will still need and use the USB dongle so you need 2 USB ports for it for long gaming sessions.",

Not perfect though- it makes odd beeps, and there's no manual to tell you what that means. The mic can be muted by flipping it up, and it often doesn't unmute when moved down-have to go to the windows sound settings to unmute. Not the greatest looking thing. Biggest flaw though is that there's no wired input. Not the end of the world if you're only using it as a gaming headset on pc, but it does mean you can only use it for that.",

The battery life is god tier, noise cancellation is unrivalled, the range is phenomenal and it stays firmly on your head, unlike other headsets such as the Corsair Void. The one downside to this headset is the microphone itself, which is not the best admittedly but works okay enough when needed. It can be easily moved out of the way however so if you\u2019re like me and just use a different mic anyway, it doesn\u2019t matter. For this price it\u2019s a must and trumps any other headset.

      "text": "The sound quality is really good in this headset, but the reason I have gave it a 1 star review is because after less than a year of using the headset, the microphone starts to only work at certain angles and eventually stops working all together. I believe it is a hardware issue inside the headset, to do with the wires. I have taken great care of the headset and never dropped it but suddenly the microphone stops working after about 6 months. Overall, a good headset for sound but the mic will most likely stop working quite quickly.",
