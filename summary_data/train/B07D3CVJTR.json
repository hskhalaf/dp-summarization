    "title": "Hammer Crown Frescobol Paddle Ball Set (Beach Stripes)",
    "description": "This frescobol paddle set comes with 2 natural wood paddles, 1 ball and a cool canvas bag. The paddles are made with 9 different individual pieces of pine, sapele and beech wood that are bonded together to form this eye catching beach striped design. The handle of each paddle is wrapped with a neoprene grip. 1 Paddle has a black grip and the other paddle has a blue grip. Each paddles weights between 11-13 ounces, so they are light enough to play all day. The paddles have a nice water and sand resistant finish on them. Some people call these beach bats or paddle ball or even beach pickle ball. Unlike pickleball, frescobol is a beach paddle sport where you work with your partner to hit the ball back and forth as many times as you can without allowing the ball to hit the ground. Some other names for this type of beach paddle game around the World are Matkot, Beach Tennis, Smash Ball and Raccettoni. Grab a friend and start playing the fast paced game of frescobol now.",
