      "text": "These didn't quite work for me whilst cycling on the Turbo trainer indoors. Occasionally when I wiped my face with a towel it beeped and switched off the right earbud even though the towel didn't touch it (from what I could see) which was strange. This happened at least 10 times during an hours ride and therefore makes them useless for me. Presumably it might have something to do with the touch sensitive controls on the buds... They are secure in the ears and have decent sound but I have to send them back unfortunately..",

Once embedded in your lughole, they do not move and are really comfortable to wear for long periods. Sound is fantastic and Bass is heavy, though not overly imo. Box is sleek and love the way the lid slides up instead of open. Not tested the recieving calls, etc side of things and probably won't, as most people tend to text me! So look elsewhere for a review of that side of things. Another reason I wasn't interested in the stick type buds. All in all a pretty quality product",

I also attempt to call random contacts from my phone, despite me not having voice activation enabled or saying these people's names. 3 weeks in, and the right headphone has broken and only plays sound at a very low volume.
