      "text": "I absolutely love this set! I really wish Lego would create more sets similar to this regarding exo-suits or robots. I purchased this set to create a Brickfilm using the exo-suit and a simple story line but this set has so much more to it. I've found a number of other configurations you can make with the pieces and its just so darn cool looking. I also like that you get two minifigs that are green space figures and not the generic red or blue. I can't recommend this set enough! My boys were fascinated with it and once I created a simple video using the set they were even more jazzed about it.",

It comes with 2 classic space mini figures and a robot turtle (also very cool). Buy it before it retires!",

You can see on the box how awesome it looks! 2 sweet minifigs and an awesome robot turtle!!!! One thing to note though is how fragile this thing is. It uses so many small, gray pieces you will hardly believe you can actually make this set with them, but you can. It looks so cool on display but my little one gets a little frustrated while playing with it cause little pieces will break off. Amazingly cool set from IDEAS, but be careful if you plan to play with it a lot.",

The green classic space minifigs are sure to hold their value. Like a lot of the new lego sets, this contains spares of a lot of the smaller pieces.",

This is completely made up of lots and lots and lottttssss of small LEGO pieces, so it's definitely not for the younger kids (I can definitely see my 7yo losing pieces while putting it together). The suit poses and stays in place well. There's a lot of detail in this set with all of its smaller pieces - it's rather creative in that aspect. It's about a 30-40 minute build and worth the time and money.",

A lot of very small pieces, so maybe not the greatest thing for very young kids, but definitely a must for any older kids/teens. Can be put together as a quick rainy afternoon project. Love it for display, but keep in mind that its level of greebling (small pieces that add detail to the figure) makes it quite fragile and prone to piece losses even during short moves. Cool male and female space minifigs add a vital touch to any set piece, plus you gotta have someone to get in the mech!",

I felt like a kid again. Nothing beats the frustration of not being able to find a piece, coming to the conclusion that lego messed up and didn't include it, then discovering that you were sitting on it the entire time.",

Probably not suited for a little kid, but any kid with lego experience or any adult who can follow instructions even if no lego experience should be able to figure it out.",
