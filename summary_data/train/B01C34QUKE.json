He loves to control the train with the remote, sending it forwards and backwards. The train is set up around the Christmas tree and is a great accent. Looking forward to seeing how this train holds up over the years.",

Otherwise, the trains are nicely made and decorative. The tracks are a little cheap and don't sit flush on the ground when setup in an oval. The remote has forward, reverse and buttons for sounds.

      "text": "My kids (3&6) love this train! It's a great size and has a lot of lovely little details that make it special. The track can be configured 3 different ways so it's very versatile. My one and only complaint is that you can't turn off all the sounds. While the train is on, it has a constant \"chugging\" sound. It's not terribly annoying but definitely not something I'd want to keep on for too long.",

But once unpacked and set up properly It is a extremly nice train for both adults and kids. We use this train around a tree and are very hhappy with our purchae and look forward to it's use for several years.",

The only problem with this is when the kids try to control it and it just won't stop where they want it to (so yeah it bugged me). Other than that it's a totally fun train to set up with tracks my 4 yr old grandson loved to put together.",

The widest width of 60 inches was perfect to fit around me tree skirt and still have enough room for the train to operate. The bell and whistle gives the train a cute aspect. I like the different sayings from the Conductor depending if the train is moving or not. The large remote is easy to work and has a speed option for both forward and reverse.",
