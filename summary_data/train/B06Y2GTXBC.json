It\u2019s really large, but folds down small. The very bottom part is the cooler and that doesn\u2019t collapse as much, but you can roll the whole bag into that part to pack it. It has one outside pocket with a zipper. It\u2019s a simple bag but will be easy to clean and I love that it has a place to keep drinks and snacks cold. I\u2019ll add to the review after our trip!",
