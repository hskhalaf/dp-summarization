Comfortable, right size and nice padding. I tend to wear them about 10-12hrs a day and I\u2019ve not had a wet foot once nor have I had aches or pains whilst wearing them. I am tempted to buy another pair just in case.",

Could not believe my eyes ... Sent them back and got a replacement pair and they were exactly the same. All scuffed on the front and clearly been worn ... Shocking selling these second hand boots. I hope no else has just settled for this or not noticed. Look at my pictures and you can clearly see what they looked like when taking them out of the box. So disappointing.",

These are actually better without the speed-lacing system of the trainer version. The comfort and fit is immediately superb - definitely go up half a size though, or even a full size if you intend to wear thick socks. The best thing about the Terrex range is the Goodyear sole. Very soft, sticky rubber with immense grip even on wet, slimy rocks. They are as light as a pair of trainers, yet remarkably strong. The Goretex liner keeps everything dry, and they clean up well. I have no hesitation in recommending them 100%.",
