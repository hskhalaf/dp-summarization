      "text": "This tetherball set is well-made, sturdy, easy to assemble, and a great price! Kit comes with everything you need, even the little pump to inflate the ball. Great add-on item! Packaged nicely, and arrived quickly. We sent ours up a little bit differently, we filled a 3 gallon bucket with cement, put a steel pole that was about 4 ft tall in the center and left cure. (the steel pole that was inserted in the cement was a little larger than the tetherball pole, make sure it is a good fit and not to small or the Tetherball will not be stable) After the cement dried, we dug a hole just big enough to bury the bucket. Works great!",

Our soil is pretty loose and rocky, so it does come loose when they really play hard, but we're going to create a concrete base for it with a bucket or tire - there are lots of videos on youtube on how to do that. Honestly, this set has been really awesome for the price, and it's not a big deal tamp the dirt down better when it starts to wiggle. Good quality set - better than I was expecting for the price!
