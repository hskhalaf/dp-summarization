One was dry in the morning after being left outside overnight which usually makes things more wet. Not only that but somehow they absorb water as well as my regular towel, are light, fold up relatively small, and they are soft. I didn\u2019t even know they would have a little loop to make hanging them easy. I\u2019m buying more.",

The sand was easy to shake off of them - I never felt like I was drying myself off using a piece of sandpaper. Also, hanging on the clothesline (or laid out on the beach), they dried relatively quickly (faster, if you hang them single thickness, not just throw them over the line). I would definitely recommend these towels!",

I might order another for my husband for when we travel, since it folds up so small. I gave it 4 stars though because it does feel pretty weird on my skin. I'm not a fan of the texture. Hopefully I'll get used to it.",
