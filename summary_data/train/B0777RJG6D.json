In my opinion even though it\u2019s a great product, you have 50% chance of it not lasting and do you want to spend that much money for a year?! Buy with caution!!",

It's okay, just buy the extended warranty as I did. So I had to turn back to the oven for what I was about to cook that night. But I was able to get a payout for the failed unit.

Even worse, the instructions say unplugging the unit is the only way to clear the programming which doesn't actually work. I think there's some residual charge that holds the programming because unplugging simply restarts the timer where it left off unless you wait for several minutes.

It\u2019s larger than my other one and was nervous because of storage space. It fit into the space with a little rearranging. Good Unit. I think you\u2019ll like it.",

We don\u2019t use it all the time but we\u2019ve made homemade fries, zucchini fritters, egg rolls, avocado rolls, fried wontons, tater tots and other frozen snacks. They\u2019ve all turned out really well. I highly recommend this air fryer!",
