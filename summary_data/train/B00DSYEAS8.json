      "text": "I have a problem with their default of wasting a large amount of tape by using a very large margin on both sides of your type. You can change the margin to save tape (part of the waste is unavoidable because of the placement of the cutter) and Brother support will tell you that it will stay that way until you pull the batteries. BUT THEY LIE! It changes back to the wasteful mode anytime it wants. They are obviously in the business of selling tape and not printers. It fell on a deaf ear when I suggested that they change the default because everyone who see the waste complains about it. Everyone!",
