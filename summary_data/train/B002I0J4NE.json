The other pieces and game works fine, though, but not being able to play it at home kind of defeats the purpose. calibrate",

However it does have some negatives like the camera not being of as good quality as i would like it to be, and the real big one lack of games to support it. As good as it is there just arent that many PS3 games that support move. Hopefully it'll get more support on PS4 with the PS4's Playstation Camera and VR Headset. For now though if you HAVE to have it its not a total waste as it works really well but I say wait a bit.",

I think the price is still little bit higher, and hopefully it will go down. Also you need atleast 2 or 3 controllers so that your family can play together, and whole think will cost you around $200-$250. I have used WII before but PS3 with move is much better graphics, and in HD.",

Table tennis, volleyball and gladiator are really well implemented and you actually can start sweating if you really get into it.",
