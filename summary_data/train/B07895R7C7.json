Besides from all that, it\u2019s a very speedy bike. It\u2019s quick, perfect for communting. I live in upper Manhattan and I cycled all the way to Times Square! I was sooo happy. Honestly this bike is great because it\u2019s simple and made with good quality. Not to mention the color, it\u2019s beautiful.",

I got on it and was spinning then I had power and road home but kept losing power every now and then. Just annoying for it to break on my first ride. Going to take it to bike shop that put it together and ask them for sure what the problem is and try and get my money back. Ill update how that goes.",

After a couple days riding, I tried to go up a hill, the right pedal stuck and then stripped out. I would suggest upgrading pedals pretty quick after purchase. The pedal wasn't cross threaded... I loved the bike untik then. It's a $40 fix, but it's frustrating to spend after only one week.",

Great care went into the packing. Brakes are sufficient. Downsides are that the bike does not come with a kick stand, and the tires do not use the standard bicycle valves. Lucky adapters are cheap and easy to find.",

My dad is 5\u20199 and it was even difficult for him to mount it. I returned it because it is unsafe. The size on the bike is the length of the bar, but the height (tires) is the same in all sizes. Really disappointing... not to mention it doesn\u2019t have a stick to park, but I was willing to overlook that because I wanted it to work for me so badly.",
