Perhaps it's meant for the over the top trolling rods except the drag is not sufficient for such use. Thank goodness Amazon provided a return for it. If only they had said it's base was so over the top in size before I bought it, I wouldn't have bothered.",

Okuma's customer service is unbeatable. I sent them a spinning reel that was grinding due to me having dropped it in the sand. I had it back in about 10 days, good as new, no charge! When I called to order a part, same thing, friendly service and no charge! I can't say anything bad about these guys, they take care of their customers!",
