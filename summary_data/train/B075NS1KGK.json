Then, if you're disappointed, like me, it's $6.95 to return it.",

Also I don't mind the tubing being stiff but it still is hard to bend. That said, it seems to better because it won't leak as readily. I had to put in another rubber washer because my hose didn't twist in all the way due to the screen which is nice.",
