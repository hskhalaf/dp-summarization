I was worried this might be too heavy, but I use a little daily as a conditioner and it leaves my hair soft, smooth, shiny, and tangle free. I love it.",

I love the smooth mask, it has made a huge diff. Blow drys smoother, takes away the frizz and overall healthier. I use a small amount one a week ( focusing mostly on my ends ) and it normally last me about 5 months.",

This is a pricey product and I didn't even get the usual lovely scent that I get with their other products. Nothing smoothing or effective about this product.

And as usual, my hair smelled terrific. I plan to use the smoothing mask like a deep conditioner, after applying the restorative mask which is a protein. Will buy again! It's worth every penny.",
