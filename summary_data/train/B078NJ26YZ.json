Not what I expected from Merrel.",

Now that I've broken them in I've noticed a bump or bulg in the foam/sole of the right shoe that is causes discomfort after wearing them for some time. Not a fan of flat laces anymore either. Overall I wouldn't buy these again, and may not keep them very long. Kind of disappointing. I really like my new Cham 7 wp Merrell though, those are great shoes... These not so much.",

As another reviewer mentioned, the mesh seems to be fake mesh, so aside from being low-tops, these shoes do not vent heat that well; as casual shoes, no problem, but hiking in hot weather would not be the best. pros: look great light weight comfy cons: not great ventilation laces not the best Update 9/13/19: watch out on smooth floors during wet conditions. I found them to be like ice skates in stores and restaurants.",

He has shoe inserts that he is not even going to use bc this shoe supports his arch and is super comfortable! He said they are like walking on air. And the design is so stylish without looking like a tennis shoe. His first time wearing Merrell and won't be his last! One of my favorite brands. This shoe is no longer being offered in this color on Merrell's website so was thrilled to find it on Amazon!",
