      "title": "I like this!",
      "text": "I bought this bag because I started volunteering as a dog walker at the Humane Society and I need to be as hands-free as possible while walking the dogs. I wanted this specifically for the belt-bag/shoulder strap options, the pockets to hold treats and other items, as well as the poop bag dispenser option. I like it! My only issue is the dispenser for the poop bags, it looks like it\u2019s specifically for headphones which I find odd as it seems a lot of people are using it for the bags, so it\u2019s a very small hole and difficult to pull the bags out of. Either way, it\u2019s fine! It will do the job and seems durable.",
