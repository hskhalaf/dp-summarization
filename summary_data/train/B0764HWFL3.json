I have an exercise ball that I use to good effect, it's just not tall enough, so I thought this would be the same, just easier to adapt with a chair. Nope. Back to the ball. The ball is better for core anyway because you have to work harder using it. The instructions say it's ready to go out of the box. Mine was nearly completely deflated. Not sure what that's about. Put some air in & it held well. Just wasn't the solution for me.",

Mine is not inflated all the way, but it's enough to provide support for your lower back and allow you to move your hips around while you are sitting. This helps lessen the pain from sitting for long periods of time. I ordered this because I am teaching from home and it helps a lot during instruction and meetings with students/administrators! :-)",

Ours are very normal midrange wood dining chairs, and we've never had issues with the finish before, so I think this was something about the cushion.

The benefits of driving with it were stunning, and I never would have believed that such an improvement would be possible. It will feel unstable at first, but that is the point! It gently but effectively encourages you to use your core muscles while sitting, thereby encouraging stability and flexibility in the body. Best 20 bucks I have ever spent on a health care product, bar none.",
