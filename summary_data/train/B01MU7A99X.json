These are made for Obstacle Course Racing, specifically Spartan or tough mudder type events, where you will be battle both knee deep mud, and then trying to climb a hill or a wall and need traction. I have not raced in them yet, but they are definitely sized to be worn differently. It\u2019s more like a glove than a shoe or boot. I ended up ordering 3 pairs to determine the one that fit me appropriately. I ended up 1.5 sizes down from my normal running/training shoe. I\u2019m optimistic it will perform well. I\u2019m super glad I\u2019m a prime member, which allowed me to obtain the correct shoe without spending a fortune in shipping/return.",
