The lamp shade is a thick plastic and it stays on once you screw it down like the instructions suggest, it does the job and it looks good standing in my living room, I have no complaints. Its NOT a $30 lamp so stop expecting $30 quality. Its a very good value lamp.",

Kids have knocked it down twice and it's still in 1 working piece. If you're looking for style, this is not it. If you're looking for a basic lamp that does it's job without wasting money, then this is it. I do think it was worth it.",
