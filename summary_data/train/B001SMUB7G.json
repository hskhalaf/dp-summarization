Fourth: Must give copy of police report within 7 days (Like they\u2019re ever going to move that fast for anything but a donut sale). Fifth: If they take your lock with them, don\u2019t count on payment. Blatantly misleading advertising, don\u2019t fall for it or count on it.

Cause that is how your chain is going to come off... without a key. I use this to lock up my 05 GSXR 600 at my apartment. I also use Kryptonite's disk lock with a Dowcow motorcycle cover to creat layers of security. Also register your key or keys (if you have another Kryptonite product) on their website in case you lose a key. They will send you a replacement for a $10-$15 cost (around there). Don't forget to register your bicycle or powersport. Kryptonite granted me up to $2100 were my motorcycle to get stolen.",

It works fine on my Harley XL1200V, but it takes a little care to weave it through to the other side.)",
