Used on brows and results are undeniable. Applying once daily, still on first bottle, and it has been almost 3 months! Only drawback is minor itching, but my skin is sensitive anyway. Years of frustration traded for minor discomfort. Recommend!!",

I read all of the reviews and figured I\u2019d give it a try. What did I have to lose? The price was great. After about two I started to notice a difference bag within a month I couldn\u2019t believe. My new natural lashes are long but when I use mascara my lashes look I\u2019m wearing falsies. The results are outstanding!!!! Finally a product that does what it says.",

Only downside is it can make your eyelids/lash area a little bit itchy, but I usually put it on before bed and don't notice it. If you are in doubt- buy this product!",

The consistency seems a bit more thin, which makes me think it will last longer than the R&F or even L'oreal lash serum (which did nothing for me). Now that I feel my lashes are longer I can skip a night here or there and not feel worried about skipping. Great value, Great product! I highly recommend.",
