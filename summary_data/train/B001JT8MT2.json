I bought this item because I didn't feel like splurging on the Rupes or the ScanGrip penlights ($50+!!), and then I found this model... which runs on AAA's, which makes it loads more convenient. First few weeks of use and this little flashlight is great. At first I didn't think it would be bright enough to find paint defects in direct sunlight, but I have had no problems. I've also dropped it quite a few times and so far it's held up without a scratch! I highly recommend!",

Tapping the light on something would usually bring it back, but as we all know that kind of fix only works for so long. Now thoroughly dead its rolling around somewhere in my toolbox having been replaced by another cheaper, and seemingly better pen light.",

It's long and heavy making the balance while pressing the back awkward leading to a higher probability of dropping the light while operating with one hand. Yes it's durable but what if you drop it in a boiler, engine, between a wall or other space where retrieval is difficult or its fall could cause damage. So, for an everyday spot light, the focused beam is not good. For a specific inspection beam, it's a good value but not the best.",

That said, if you don't mind paying the shipping, and sometimes a small fee, you can return Coast lights, and in about a month, they will mail you a replacement.",

Also, the beam is a nice crisp focused stream of light. Very much like a flood light on a stage. Coast has several other models that appear to be as good like the G19 and HP3.

If you need a floodlight, this isn't for you, but for up close work it's great.
