You should be asking yourself why did I say the worse gift if he loves it so much? Simple, because the only thing I hear in my house ever since we bought this is the bang bang bang bang noise of the ball against the floor and the door since he has not stopped playing! Good quality hook, the ball was perfect too. Really good durable product",

My solution for this was to get a soft foam ball, but it would be much nicer with more support to the bottom.",

This basketball goal seems a lot more flimsy then the one we had before that broke. The previous one had a sturdier backboard and the spring allowed the rim to bend down easier. The backboard on this one bends every time you hit the rim at all and the spring seems really stiff which increases how much the back bends. Hopefully the high reviews on this are correct and it lasts. I will update review after the kids get some more dunks on it.",

In a nut shell the board wobbles all over the place because it can't be secured firmly by closing your/MY door properly. My door(s) in the house and their frames are a very snug fit. You'll need to check the thickness and the spacing of your doors before purchasing. I'll just figure something out over the coming days and go from there.",

When you shoot a full-sized ball through the 10-foot high rim about 1/3 of the time the ball will land on the mini rim underneath. It's been 6 months and there is no sign of this thing breaking. When you shoot a small ball through the upper net you can even score 4 points sometimes with one shot. Unfortunately the net has not lasted. It has pretty much disintegrated in the sun. That wouldn't be so bad but I can't find a six-loop net anywhere. The pictures here show 8-loop rims but it actually only has 6 loops. I guess I'll either learn to weave or do without.",

      "text": "Bought this for my 12 year old grandson to use in their shop area. I looked and looked for an over the door basketball goal that was of good quality, not something cheap that you may get for a younger child. This goal is very well made and sturdy. After reading reviews, I also bought a couple of the foam basketballs as many reviews stated the basketball that came with it made too much noise and was too hard. Those reviews were right! Would highly recommend to others looking for a good quality basketball goal....but purchase some foam balls to go along with it.",

      "text": "What is the best part of a mini hoop? Dunking. What happens if you dunk on this PoS? The spring is completely wrong for the flimsy backboard. Every time you dunk the rim will flex instead of spring. The backboard will snap quickly. There was no hanging on the rim just dunking by an 80 lb child. Why is it so hard to build a properly designed product in 2020?? Thicker plexi and a weaker spring would make this a quality product instead of a PoS.",

I used wood pieces to problem solve for this issue, but the bottom half of the setup is so heavy b/c of the rim/hoop assembly and the backboard is fairly flimsy it creates a lot of movement whenever the ball hits the rim. This creates a lot of noise and makes the whole assembly bounce against the door. I tried to solve this issue by looping a ratchet strap around the door and over the bottom of the backboard, but this still doesn't totally eliminate the nose and bouncing.",

      "text": "This SKLZ Pro Mini Basketball Hoop is a great piece of equipment. This is my 15-year old son's 5th one over the past 5 years. The quality is great! The reason I have had to purchase so many is because my son's friends tend to forget that it is not a real basketball hoop and try to dunk on it; thereby, breaking it! Otherwise, I highly recommend this basketball hoop for indoors.",

      "text": "This review is for the mini version of the hoop. Assembly was pretty straightforward and simple although it was a little annoying using the small wrench that comes in the box. The quality of the metal rim seems pretty good, although the net seems to be fraying a little and the plastic backboard is kind of flimsy. The foam ball is the reason why I got the mini version and the outer coating seems to be peeling and I haven't even used it much. Overall it's still a pretty fun toy to mess around with time to time. If you can get it on sale for around $15 then I would say its a good deal.",
