This one is extremely hard and while it might break in eventually, it might not or not soon enough. Since I ordered one and if I liked it would order 5 more, I just did not want to chance it. For those who are OK kicking an extremely hard back (for the kicker and the holder), everything else about it seems well-made so I still gave it 4 stars",

This pad seems like it will last forever. It is large, hard, and absorbs the force of his punches and kicks. I don't look forward to when he asks me to hold it, but I can do it without getting hurt!

Great product. >>03/30/2016 Comparing this to the Tiger Claw brand at the martial art class, this padding is a bit too stiff, especially for a younger kid. I kick it myself and it feels stiff to the point where it hurts a little. Still, I'm not gonna knock off any stars, it IS well made, wish the padding was not so stiff.",

It seems the rivets are connected to the leather around the body of the bag, so I can envision those ripping one day with enough hits or being used by someone really powerful.

And ASP Kick Shields, this one is better than both because it has the top handle as well as the back handles, so your partner can work on leg kicks while you hold the top handle with the pad against your thigh, as well as push kicks and knees when you hold the pad against your belly. great product!",
