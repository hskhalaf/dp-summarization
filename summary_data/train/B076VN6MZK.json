These are very cool but did not fit my size 11 foot. Had to send them back. Also found that the shoe material is \"see thru\" for ventilation. You can see your socks thru the shoe. Did not care for that. I need them for some winter warmth so a bought a different style Under Armour. The new pair fit good in size 11.5 and I will give them a 5 star review when reviewing them..",

The insert on this shoes is very thin. You don\u2019t have much foot support. If you were to go running on concrete your feet will be hurting you after. You can easily purchase a shoe insert and solve this problem. The material on this shoe is not meant to be put though rough paths, as the material on this shoe can easily rip.",

    "description": "Under Armour Threadborne Blur Running Shoes Designed for speed, the Under Armour Threadborne Blur running shoe features an array of technologies to help you maximise both focus and performance. Threadborne Knit Upper The Threadborne knit upper proves a breathable, compression-like fit to deliver lightweight, directional strength to assist your performance. This helps the shoe to mould to your foot for extra comfort and support without feeling restricting or tight. Working alongside the Threadborne knit is signature Under Armour SpeedForm construction, which ensures a precision fit to minimise distraction and discomfort. Breathable mesh actively and efficiently wicks away the build-up of excess sweat and moisture, leaving your feet cool, dry and comfortable as you strive for the best results and performance. Additionally, cool air is encouraged to circulate, creating a drier, healthier environment for your feet to thrive. The tongue is attached to the footbed by stretchable support wings to increase support whilst maintaining a snug fit throughout the foot. Traditional lacing offers a secure, locked-in feel for your feet while the embedded sockliner sits comfortably against the skin for added cushioning and seamless comfort. Lightweight One-Piece Midsole The lightweight, one-piece midsole is made from a foam compound to deliver an extremely responsive ride and provide ample cushioning to improve comfort. Also, the midsole lessens the impact placed on the knees and joints by attenuating shock to reduce the potential risk of injury or discomfort. As the midsole is exceptionally light, you will be able to move with freedom without being restricted or held back by the shoe, ensuring optimum performance time and time again. Blown Rubber Outsole Blown rubber comprises the outsole for durability, grip and traction. This helps to deliver a firm, assured footing and total confidence knowing you have a shoe in which you can truly rely upon. The blown rubber is lig",
