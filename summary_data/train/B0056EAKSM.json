I usually squirt a little bit into my pets' ears and then massage at the base of their ears to get the product into all the crevices and mixed around, then I use cotton balls/pads and put them in and massage at the base of the ears again to get out all the gunk.

I believe the bubbling action gets deep down in the ears alot better than the alcohol based or non-foaming cleansers.
