I have a much smaller vortex fan that's about 8x as powerful. Also the blades are flimsy plastic. I probably should have looked at wattages or something before buying. I recommend opting for a better product, even if its a bit more expensive.",

Only downside is I wish they did not use a screw in blade cover, makes the cleaning take a little longer. For the reviews complaining about a noise or rattle, if mount is installed correctly simply bend the catch in the back of the fan a little more towards the fan. Will be a little harder to get into wall mount, but will be much tighter and eliminate any unwanted noise.",

If you don't like loud fan noise when you're sleeping, it's not for you. The air flow capacity is excellent, although I have it mounted in a small office so I can't speak to larger rooms. I really like the pull strings for the controls, makes it easy to change speed/oscillation in the dark. If you place it high near the ceiling, you will need an extension cord to reach a floor level plug. Wish the cord was longer, but not a deal breaker because the fan works very well.",

I have purchased a Homes heater several years prior and it work satisfactory and therefore had no problem purchasing this fan. I was considering a much more expensive Air King that did not oscillate, I am glad I opted for the less expensive Homes fan.",
