Update 7/29/18: Finally wore a hole in one of the gloves. I was weeding the curb and sidewalk cracks, so I think it's from scraping against the pavement. It's such a small hole that I'll probably continue to use them for a while, but I'll be ordering another pair. I love these gloves.",

It's like when they manufacture these gloves they dip them with palms relaxed. I wonder how dipping them while palms stretched open would change the performance. Obviously it wouldn't have the resistance issue, but maybe when the fist is closed there's extra material that would bother the user, but extra material there could be plus because that area tends to tear first. It doesn't hurt to make the experiment. When it's improved I'm buying me another pair. I like these, but that tightness, although present on almost all of these nitrile gloves, in this one is exaggerated.",

      "text": "I bought these gardening gloves in January. I figured they would not be put to the test until Spring. Because of warm weather I decided to tackle a briar ridden garden area I planned to reclaim. These gloves worked great! I work carefully around briars but am clumsy enough that I usually suffer from multiple thorn pricks. These gloves gave me enough protection that there was no blood spilled. They are comfortable. Although the rest of me was covered in mud, my hands were clean. I am very pleased with this purchase.",

I've been using them now since I got them, maybe a week or two, and no dirt, Still totally intact, no holes. Like I said LOVE THESE GLOVES !!!",

I don't do heavy gardening stuff, some digging with a pickaxe, taking out plants from pots and planting them in the hole, and then the usual lawn mowing. These gloves are fabric (?) and some soft of a latex covering on the inside of the gloves. This has made the gloves so nimble, and they are great for gently taking out plants from the pots, and then transplanting them carefully, with the rootball intact. I am fairly impressed, esp at this price point. AND THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT. THEY ARE MADE IN KOREA, NOT CHINA!",

I used them heavily on two occasions to dig holes and move dirt to plant a couple of fifteen gallon trees, and later to move heavy logs from a dead birch tree. It has been less than two months since purchasing and, sadly , the rubber coating has worn thin and the tips of the a few fingers have developed small holes (see photos). It seems to me that the rubber coating could have been thicker and/or more durable (but then maybe that would make them less flexible and comfortable).",
