Ive tried other masks but have never had such a wonderful tingling sensation throughout duration of mask. Pores are getting noticiably smaller & acne has improved quite a bit!! In 3 days. I'm very tempted 2 use this every day but I will follow directions & only use 4xs a wk. Maybe overuse creates unpleasant outcome-dryness or something similar. Love it.

She says her face still feels clean 2 days after using the mask. My Mom and I will be lifelong customers. :)",

They claim that this is good for all skin types, but it really dried me out as a normal-dry skin type. It felt very tingly and invigorating on the face, but just made my skin feel tight afterwards; I cannot imagine using this more than once a week which is what they recommended. One thing also worried me: on the box, it says \u201cwarning: the safety of this product has not been determined.\u201d I don\u2019t think this product would be good for dry and sensitive skinned people",
