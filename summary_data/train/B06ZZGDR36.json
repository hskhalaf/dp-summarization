As far as quality, it feels great, slides on easily. He swims on a year around team, and was freezing in the water of the indoor facility. He was actually shivering a few times so much his coach had him get out and warm up. This suit has made a HUGE difference and he is fine now!",

They keep the kids warm but do not impact stroke development. I had read they are on the small side, but was hesitant to risk buying a size up as it needs to be fitted. End result - we will get several months\u2019 use out of them before having to buy up a size. I still consider that worthwhile for the price and weekly use. Will buy again.",

My son is 42\u201d tall, 21\u201d chest, 19\u201d waist and the 4 fit him well. My only dislike is the logo/name across the chest, as I prefer no logos, but I get it and all companies do that.",

After that, I removed the Velcro so that the suit wouldn't get ruined in future washes.",
