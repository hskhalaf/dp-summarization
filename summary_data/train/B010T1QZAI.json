Then there was a burning smell & the roller stopped turning. Going to take it apart, guessing it's the belt, will update review when I know. But really? I used it less than ONE HOUR & it broke? Don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting the performance of a $500, I understand I purchased a lightweight, inexpensive vacuum. But I thought it would last longer than an hour without requiring service. Very disappointed, but now I see why they included a free belt in the box.",

It is small so you will have to empty frequently and I wish the canister release was different as your hands get a little dirty during manual release of that latch.
