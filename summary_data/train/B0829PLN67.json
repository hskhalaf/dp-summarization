      "text": "Brand new, $700 stroller arrived over a week ago. Front wheel was missing. No answer at Bob on the weekend. Called on a Monday, they shipped out a wheel. Arrived 4 days later w/ no parts to attach it. Even though we discussed that it would be a full kit w/ some assembly required. So waiting... hope I like it after all this. I have a Thule Single Jogger and an UppaBaby. Sort of regretting this decision to try a Bob. Amazon did offer to replace the full stroller but I thought just getting the part was easier than sending the other one back. And since it's now on back order the brand new one wouldn't come for another month.",

It is easy to manuever around and relatively easy to fold and fit anywhere. I hate that everything from snack trays to cup holders have to be bought separately. For the price of the stroller- I really think they should be included. I also wish there was a way to have the snack trays be separated so I could take off one side or the other.",

There's a see through window so I can see over the top of the stroller without having to pull it back. Quality on this stroller is top notch, no comparison when comparing this to my previous stroller. Makes it fun to jog with. Have used it for a few days and love it, little pricey but I think so far it blows away my previous stroller.",

The only problem I had was the other day when it got super cold the front wheel actually froze making steering impossible. I ended up fixing it with WD 40.
