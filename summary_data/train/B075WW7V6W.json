Also, the place where the edge stitching stops is very noticeable and almost seems to be coming out. I hope it is knotted and that the string poking up is just excess after the knot.",

Not so for this one. The seams are raised and will stop your mouse as soon as it comes into contact with a border, which limits the range of the mouse. This is of course partially compensated by the large area of the mouse pad, but it's still bothersome to a degree. Also mine had a very small stain on it, indicating it was used even though I bought new.",

      "text": "It's a smooth thin mouse pad of office-compatible size, nothing fancy. It works better than a notebook and is perfectly functional for everyday use. I am not much of a gamer, but when I play I sometimes find the mouse moving out of the edge. Not a big problem for me, but it would be frustrating for intense combat games. No slippage due to the backing, that doesn't stick or damage a wooden table. No wrist support or other niceties. You get what you pay for. It could be worse.",

The mouse experience is nice overall but the mouse pad itself does not give any rest to your palm. So if you use a mouse for a long time, this may not be the best option. But for the budget, this may be one of the good options.",

Its as thin as one of those old rubber jar openers, so my wrist does get a bit achy after a while. I'm using the Anker Vertical Mouse and I love it, so I was hoping for a better experience with the mouse pad.",

Gaming takes some getting used to, though that's coming from someone who hasn't used a mousepad since like 2005 so my testimony is probably not worth anything. Overall, I would recommend this. I feel like even if I got only 6-7 months before this started falling apart, it would still be worth it for the price. Though I expect it to hold up longer than that.",

Personally not a fan since I'm big into shooters and such with a lower sensitivity so I prefer a smoother and faster glide than this mousepad offers. Overall if you're a competitive player I'd opt to just spend more money on a better mousepad, but if you're on a budget or don't play at a low sensitivity than this mousepad will be fine.",
