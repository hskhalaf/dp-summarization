Whatever the machine does, you can do better with a router. Instead of this machine, I find myself using my router or just chisels. If you are doing production work, by all means , a mortiser can help - just get one that tilts and allows end grain mortises. This one doesn\u2019t.",

I can see how having a heavier unit with a longer handle might be helpful, and I wish there were an easy way to align the chisel portion of the bit so that it's perfectly square. However, a couple of test punches lets you see any adjustments that are needed. A bigger back fence with a clamping system would be great, but again I think that probably comes with the more expensive units.",

Tried lubrication and silicone spray too, but without any changes. It drills square holes, and that's what I wanted it to do.

It doesn't give me that sense of confidence at all times as far as whether or not it'll stay put...but it has so far. Personally, other than the hold down, I love this tool! If you're drilling holes and chiseling the waste wood or routing...well if you've got the dough (and in this economy, it's an understandable consideration!), give the Jet a looksee!",

    "description": "Bench Mortiser Motor HP 1/21 Phase, 115.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\n\nIdeal for professional furniture makers as well as for home woodworkers, Jet's affordable 708580 JBM-5 benchtop mortiser features a 1/2-horsepower induction motor and is designed to take up to 1/2-inch chisel bits. The dependable rack-and-pinion head adjustment gives you accurate drilling control, while its heavy-duty cast iron and steel construction provides durability and stability for years of use.\n\n\n\nDependable mortiser for home woodworkers or professional furniture makers (view larger).\n\nFEATURES\nAt only 44 pounds, the Jet 708580 is sturdy but also easily maneuvered, plus it reverses on its base to allow for mortising in long stock. The 4-3/4-inch head stroke is great. Bits are easy to change. Just flip open the steel door on either side (other models on the market often have doors made of flimsy plastic) to gain easy access to the chuck. And, thanks to the 4-inch chuck key, there's little chance of banging or scraping your knuckles while switching bits.\n\nThe mortiser's feed handle adjusts so you can choose the most comfortable position for each application, and it also offers a quick-setting depth stop and a removable toggle switch that prevents accidental or unauthorized use of the tool. It's set on a heavy-duty cast-iron base with four predrilled mounting holes. Other features include a three-jaw drill chuck that keeps a positive grip on mortising bits for chisels up to 3/4-inch in size, two hinged side doors for easy access to the chuck, and a reversible column for mortising larger stock. It's backed by a 5-year limited warranty.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\nOne Jet 708580 JBM-5 benchtop mortiser, one hydraulic cylinder, one handle, 3/4- and 5/8-inch chisel bushings, one spindle extension, one chuck key, one table, hold down, fence assembly, screws, and owner's manual.\n\n\n\nCombines 1/2-horsepower motor for solid performance and a heavy-duty cast iron and steel construction.\n\n\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nFor all the projects you do that require mortising, get solid performance and trouble-free operation with this 1/2-horsepower, 115-volt , benchtop mortiser from JET. The rack-and-pinion head raises and lowers for positive drilling control while the long, multiposition splines permit repositioning of the feed handle for perfect handle position. There's a three-jaw drill chuck with an extended chuck key for positive grip on the drill bit. Two hinged side doors allow for complete drill chuck access while the heavy-duty cast-iron and steel construction adds durability and stability to the base. A removable toggle switch prevents accidental turn-on. 1/2-inch chisel capacity and 4-3/4-inch head-stroke. This set comes with three bits: 1/4-inch 708590, 3/8-inch 708592, 1/2-inch 708593.\n\nSee more",
