The Potek runs a 12v power supply and will operate until the battery voltage goes to 11v. This keeps the refrigerator running all night. The fan only turns on when it gets too hot. It is silent mostly, and I'm not interested in sleeping next to a vacuum cleaner, like some of those other inverters. I bought 2 500 watt inverters already. One for my boat. One for my van. I'm buying a 750 watt for my home refrigerator. I wouldn't buy 3 if I didn't love 1.",

Used it for the laptop without issues and charged all the kids mobile devices too. On my SUV there is a rear port at the back of the armrest console and I plugged it in there and kept it on the ground under the seat. Didn't get too hot and was accessible to the kids the whole road trip. This is pretty much a must (especially during the pandemic) because it accelerated the charge rate of all the devices.",

EDIT: After contacting Potek I was informed that opening the unit only required removing the 4 visible screws. I'm used to devices hiding screws under stickers, rubber feet, and even sonic welds. I reattched the lock-washer and nut firmly and resealed the unit. Unsure if doing this voided any warranty, but apart from this mechanical failure I feel this unit will live a good long life.",

The digital display is useful to monitor battery condition. The cooling fan only starts under heavy loads. During moderate use, the unit hardly warms up. I am happy I purchased this product.
