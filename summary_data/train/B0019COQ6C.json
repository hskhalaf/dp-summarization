I hated changing the grease in my trucks and trailers because my hands would ache from squeezing the pump so many times, especially with my trailer axles. This unit makes it so easy and simple. Its now a 10 minute job to do both axles on my trailer where it would take almost an hour before. Awesome unit!",

I used a wrench and pliers to loosen the two sections. The pieces are tightly fitted together. Do this before you use it. Now it works great. You can now adjust it to properly fit your grease fittings .",

After talking to some people and reading reviews online i bought what everyone said is one of the best guns out there. As soon as I took it out of the box I could tell it was a quality item. I immediately loaded it up with grease and snapped the hose onto a zerk. a few pumps and grease was flushing out like it was supposed to. Made the greasing chore so much easier. I tossed my generic gun and now I look forward to greasing my toys.",

The one they sent was a whacky one. I had all of these things on the shelf so it was no problem for me. So far very happy. It sent grease in fittings my manual would not. I highly recommend.",

The accessible check valve allows for easy cleaning and removal of hardened or contaminated grease, and the combination filler Coupler and air bleeder allows users to bulk fill the grease tube then easily release any trapped air to keep the grease gun primed.\n\nAt every farm, construction site, automobile repair shop and industrial plant, maintenance professionals need high quality lubrication equipment and pumping products. Lincoln offers everything you need for lubrication.
