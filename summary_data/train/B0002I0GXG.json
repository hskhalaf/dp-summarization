I checked out the food I got on Amazon before feeding it to my puppy and realized it's the smaller kibble variation that has been reported to give puppies diarrhea and a reluctance to eat. I will absolutely NOT be feeding this to my puppy. Furthermore, I have lost confidence in the Wellness Complete brand since they seem to be trying to pass off an unsafe, subpar product as a premium product on Amazon.",

I tried switching back to this food when I ran out of the better stuff and his poops reverted back to spontaneous wet poops. Although some people would say it was the \u201cchange\u201d that caused this, I\u2019d point out that he didn\u2019t have any problems changing away from this dog food.

      "text": "My puppies love this food. I started buying Wellness after reviewing the different dog foods online. Wellness was consistently the top-rated food for protein content and protein/carb ratio. So, I gave it a shot and my dogs could not be happier and neither could I. They love the food and I get the peace of mind knowing I am giving my dogs quality food to help them grow strong and healthy.",
