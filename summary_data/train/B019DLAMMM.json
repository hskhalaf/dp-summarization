This boot could have received more 5-star reviews if it weren\u2019t for its lack of traction and somewhat questionable durability. Favorably, this boot managed to acquire commendations attributable to its comfortable in-shoe feel and lightness. Overall, the New Balance 1400v1 may seem to meet the basic needs of day hikers; however, it must be watched out for early signs of fraying. Also, paying a visit to a local retailer to get the best fit can help amplify its good points.",

It was a very rocky trail that included bouldering. and I felt confident in them during the climb. I've had other boots that I've waterproofed and they still got soaked, but not these. They stay dry in rain, puddles, dew. I plan on doing many hikes in these!!",

Perfect for my foot. I can wear them all day with no problems. I verbalize the virtues of this shoe constantly. For me it is perfect and I'm going to buy another pair.",
