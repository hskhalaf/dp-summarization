He had Parvo and thankfully survived, but has had stomach/GI issues ever since. He would be fine some days and bad other days; refusing to eat and having severe vomiting and diarrhea. This product has completely put him back on track. As long as he has his probiotics every night with dinner, he is as happy and healthy as can be. I swear by this product and highly recommend it to anyone who's dog suffers from gastro-intestinal issues.",

I knew that changing the food again was just going to cause more diarrhea, so I asked. They went with the idea and it worked perfectly. Within 24-48 hours no more diarrhea. Once the worms were gone, I weaned her off the probiotics and now I have a healthy dog with normal stool again. I recommend this hands down.",
