The first time I used it I noticed that after spraying and scrunching my hair, my hands had nothing on them. Like I had simply put water on my hair. Then my hair fell out after just minutes. So I sprayed it directly on my hand. It is almost nothing but water. There is a little bit of product so you have the correct smell, but this IS NOT Paul Mitchell sculpting gel. It is was an Amazon choice. Not returnable. Great scam!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
