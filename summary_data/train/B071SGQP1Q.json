Then after i confirmed it worked with 0405 i upgraded to 0502 and they didnt work, cleared the cmos and now they work? Asus needs to share some focus on this board instead of only on the crosshair..",

One item that set me back a bit was how to mount the fan, instructions were vague on the two existing plastic mounts. When using the AMD Ryzen 5 2600 CPU, the two mounts are removed and the fan screws into the mounting plate on the backside of the motherboard. The 4 existing screws are in tight, so be careful, but they will come out.",
