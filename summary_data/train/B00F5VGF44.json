      "text": "Sadly, New Balance shoe quality is really going downhill. The \"higher\" number NB shoes have historically been of high-quality, with firm suede/leather sides and nylon mesh, with very sturdy soles. I've worn them for years, and love them. HOWEVER, this pair of shoes feels flimsy... arch support is much less than older models, and overall, the shoe feels more like a nylon slipper for the beach instead of a first-class walking shoe! If this is what NB is selling as a MW877, it's the last purchase I'll ever make! Very disappointed...",

I have owned multiple pairs of the 577 and my only complaint is that my feet get hot and sweat, not with this shoe. It is very lightweight and airs out well. Supreme comfort, looks terrific too. I wish New Balance would make this shoe in solid black, I expect to be buying many pairs of these in the future with the amount of walking I do. It is also one of the only shoes that New Balance makes that actually fits people with wide feet as a 4E shoe is expected to fit.",

I am flat footed, have extreme neuropathy in both feet, hammer toes, recurring callous buildup on tips of toes and bottom of feet. Must be regularly treated by a Podiatrist every 6-8 weeks. If you suffer from the same types of pain/discomfort that I do these walking shoes may work for you. No promise. However, I highly recommend them. Received a new pair last Friday MW877GT, 11.5 2E from A Perfect Dealer (thru Amazon) for $89.00. Shoes strings finally shortened and they wear well.! Good luck!",

So far I've only walked 20 miles in my new 877s but so far so good. I can definitely tell the difference from trying to walk in running shoes...much smoother and much less foot movement in these shoes.

He also likes that it can get wet and does not break like his other more expensive shoes. NB is one of few companies making 4E extra wide. So this why he has been wearing these for the recent years.",

As other reviewers have noted, the 877 is rather wide in the front; looks a bit duckish, if that matters to you. But my main problem was that the heel didn't grip my foot properly, and with every step felt like the shoe was going to come off. Tightening the laces didn't really help. So I sent them back, and bought the 990 model, which is pretty much the same as the old 993.",

I understand that these are \"walking shoes\" but that doesn't mean they need to look like an 80's orthopedic. Everything, from the overly rounded tip, to the green \"N\" make this shoe look like a clearance rack reject. Sometimes half the battle of exercising is to feel good.
