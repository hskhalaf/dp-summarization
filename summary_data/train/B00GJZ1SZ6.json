The software: An entry-level software engineer wouldn't develop it that way, it has very limited information, it don't display the body temperature, it don't show you a curve for your heart rate for the period of the workout, it just provide you with your average heart rate, it don't provide a curve for the calories expenditure, it just gives an average. I wouldn't pay a penny for that product.",

Note that some earlier reviews mentioned lack of Android support, which has since been rectified, but the temperature tracking just plain doesn't add much to justify the extra effort. Probably a hard core athlete might find this useful. I will stick with an armband.",

I am not in love with the forehead wearing either, but I did find it to be less moody that the chest strap systems.",

Neither records body temperature, which really is not a big deal. What's more of a problem is that both the Android and the iPad recorded the data inconsistently, and cut out mid- workout. Maybe this works great with an iPhone. But it doesn't work great with the non-Spree apps through other devices.",

However, the Spree is 1) dorky-looking and 2) technically just not ready for primetime. I immediately had pairing issues and while customer service was responsive, I was never successful in syncing it to my iPhone. To be honest, I can't say I'd be terribly eager to run around town wearing this thing anyway.",
