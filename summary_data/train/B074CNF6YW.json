The XS rear camera is slightly wider than the X, so it doesn\u2019t work! Come on Spigen. What happened to you...",

The texture of this case makes it grippable and the edges of the face are raised so that the screen protector doesn't even touch when the phone is placed face down. I have dropped the phone several times now and no damage.",

I can't comment if the XS camera position/size is different than the X, but i can confirm that THIS CASE FITS THE XS. My guess is that maybe some of the late September 2018 reviewers received an old batch or something but i ordered mine like 2 days ago and it fits as described. Hope this helps!",
