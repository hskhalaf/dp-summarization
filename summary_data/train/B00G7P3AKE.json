It would have been nice for the back to have recesses. You could substitute a flatter anchor instead. I\u2019d recommend a different anchor anyway, as the ones included are the cheapest variety. Second, two of the front screw hole recesses are too big for the included plugs. They will not stay in by friction. I suppose I\u2019ll glue them in. I\u2019m not too concerned with either, as this bar is at a utility sink.",

You will leave indentation mark through the side of the entire roll, possibly crushing/mutilating the center tube in the process. Once it's on, it works fine though. There is enough clearance on all sides for the roll to rotate freely.",

I have given this seat only 3 stars, because the lid has black knots in it. The knots may add interest in other places, but black \"spots\" on anything in the bathroom does not look clean and sanitary. So, even though we will keep this seat, it would have gotten four stars for appearance and maybe even five stars when we determine how it holds up. For now, three stars is the best I can do.",
