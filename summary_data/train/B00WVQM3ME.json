It is advertised as unlocked, but when I arrived in Niger, West Africa 2 weeks ago, put in a sim card, it does not work because it asks for an 8 digit code to unlock the phone. I thought it was from the sim card here, but it works in every other phone I try. So, there is 250 bucks spent on nothing and I can't even send it back right now. Hence, I am frustrated.",

When it arrived the volume down button didn't work, but I decided it was something I could live with since I needed a phone badly. The battery seemed to drain way too fast as well. Now not even a month later and the power button is starting to not work and I'm having lots of problems with the touch screen. I can't click the q on the keyboard and it goes through phases where it randomly clicks all over the screen opening things up and changing settings. Absolutely no way this phone was new!!!",

My phone did the same thing with the original charger. Then I purchased a Qualcomm quick charger and cable from Amazon as well. POOF! No more problems! it is upgrade-able to Nougat 7.0 (T-MOBILE) so it still has its freshness, and is it fast. Just compare specs to one of the other flagship phones and you'll be impressed! Finally the dual stereo speakers powered by Dolby...Need I say more! so -1star for the charger. 5 for the Phone!",
