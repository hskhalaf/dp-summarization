I also found that a few of the panels needed to assemble the drawers were not in my box I received.",

I used a rubber mallet to get them into place and they all have remained stable after multiple nights of rest. My dad and I even drilled my old headboard into the frame with 4 lag screws and it holds very well. I would definitely recommend!",

Mine is missing footers but doesn't seem to affect anything. The king size is great, and holds my mattress well. At first it looks like the frame is to big but after you add your bedding it's perfect. Would purchase this again. Very pleased.",
