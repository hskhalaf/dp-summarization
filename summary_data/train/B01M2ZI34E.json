Night light isn't bright enough and doesn't help me where I need to go. Definitely don't want to turn on the main lights and risk blinding myself. Cue in this little toilet light thing. Saw something similar on Shark Tank and knew I wanted one. Can't speak to battery life but so far, this thing has been working perfect. Detects darkness well and catches sligh motion only by the toilet itself. Huge help for half-asleep aim! Plus the colors are pretty fun too.",

Who would have thought that having a soft, subtle, luminescent light inside the toilet bowl that sees you coming and shines while you do your night time business was a good idea? Kudos, my dear inventor. You have just created a decadent luxury, totally unnecessary but so appreciated. No more stubbing my toes on the vanity, no more missing the bowl center during my nocturnal bladder emptying. And so reassuring that I made it to the loo and not the kitchen. I need it and I am so glad and proud to own it.",

I would buy again. 6/11/19 update: After using this product, I\u2019ve found it does not project enough light for me. My last one automatically illuminated light on the outside of the product as well as inside that really helped to project more light. There are too many dark colors. Hard to see.",

I took other people's advice and put it on my shower curtain rod which works perfectly. The motion detection works exactly as described. It's nice that it only turns on when it detects motion and therefore preserves the battery. It's super easy to adjust the colors and brightness. Haven't had any issues with it. I highly recommend it!",

After seeing mine, my neighbor, Nana, and several friends have purchased one as well. Four simple recommendations 1. Don't use the batteries that come with it. I use Energizer rechargeables and get about 4 months of use. 2. Move it as far to the back of the rim as possible to lessen false activations. 3. Don't throw away the instructions. 4. Use a sanitary wipe to clean it, it doesn't appear to be waterproof so why take a chance.",

After a little adjustment period, I have it in a sweet spot where it only comes on when I walk up to the toilet (sometimes have to wave my leg in the general direction to make it come on). I set it to the blue light and lowest brightness setting to preserve battery life. It's enough to see the target without being overly bright.",

Works fine that way but depending on your model of toilet, just bending the led piece doesn't necessarily keep it in place, you may also need to use some tape. But colors are excellent and motion sensor works great. Terrific if you like your bed/bath area dark as you can see the toilet without turning on any lights.
