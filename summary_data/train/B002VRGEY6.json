After a week we stopped putting the end caps back on. The top step is quite tilted. Not sure if that is intentional and if so, why? Would think since the ladder itself is tilted toward the trampoline the steps themselves would lay flat when the ladder is laid at the slight angle. Not quite. All in all, it's better than nothing and my kids are able to maneuver with it. They are 16, 12 and 9.",

Skywalker makes one, but has poor reviews because when kids would climb it, their bare feet would because the rungs were thin round metal pipes. THIS has wide steps!!! My 2 & 4 year olds have no problems going up & down it. Neither do i by the way (260lb man). Spend the extra money and buy this. I PROMISE you will be MORE than pleased.",
