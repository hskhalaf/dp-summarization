They are hard plastic. not cheap - so doesn't crack . i've used for few weeks now and they're holding up well like the first day. my 2 year old and 4 year old cannot turn the knob with the covers on. so these work very well and does the job. these are \"large\" really. larger than the normal ones. fits my GE Professional series stove. very quick/easy to install. takes 5 minutes. pop out the stove knob. Fix these covers and knob in it, and close it. using them is very easy for adults too. no complaints. would recommend.",
