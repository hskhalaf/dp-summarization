      "text": "If you've used the dual-blade disposable razors, you know a big problem is that the blades get clogged as you shave and are very difficult to clean out. This 3-blade razor rinses clean so easily it's fantastic. For this reason, I'd recommend against the 5-blade razors as I've read they are as difficult to clean as the disposable ones. They also provide a great shave, and the blades last much longer than disposable razors. Great product all the way around!",
