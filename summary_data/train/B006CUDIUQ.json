I myself used some 550 paracord, and even implemented some clever knotting in order to quickly adjust the height/tension of the bag. The bag itself is very well made and the bladder has held air just fine since I set it up last week. I've put in about 5 hours total on the bag so far, and have had no issues at all! I am very pleased and will probably go ahead and order the 5\" and 9\" bags as well for additional variety.",

      "text": "Overall, the bag functions great. I'm rating it as 2 stars because it definitely leaks air. I'll pump it full and it gets nice and hard, but by the next night, it's all soft to the point where the bottom of the bag is visible deflated and has lost it's round shape. It's annoying to have to pump it up every day when I want to use it but I guess for the price...fine.",
