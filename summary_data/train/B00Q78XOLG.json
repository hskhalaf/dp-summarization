      "text": "I bought this because it's beautiful (blue is my favorite color), and it was lightweight. I highly recommend measuring that this will be the right size for you before buying. I am about 5 foot 5 inches, and this was way too short and not functional for me, so I had to replace it. Not hating on the quality or product at all, just want to caution people to pay attention to size so you don't end up having to purchase something new :)",

But I feel that once it is steep enough to really need it, then the length is good. I love that it is small and light, cause there is a ton of time that you are not using it.",
