Perfect for a \u201csouthern\u201d winter (40 degrees and higher). My baby does not like to be layered in hot clothing and blankets and stuff so this is perfect! It blocks out all air from getting through so I can just cover baby in a light blanket and hat, even when it\u2019s cold outside! Fits my Graco click connect car seat just fine.

Very satisfied customer. I have had a few months. Had those covers that go over handle. I returned. This is a wonderful product. Picture is one baby at a doctor appointment. So glad I can seal him up. :)",

You can easily put the handle up or down without much restriction, just open the zippers and put back the flap first so the material isn't next to their face when it's down. It is thicker for cold weather but still has breathability if you leave the top open a little with the flap behind it. It's super soft and great quality and fit our Graco Snugride Click Connect perfectly. A friend recommended this and I have since recommended it to others!",

The material keeps baby safe from the elements, but is breathable and the design is adorable and gender neutral. A bonus was the top pocket, which holds my wallet and phone perfectly for quick grabs.

It fits pretty well but does get loose in the back and touch baby\u2019s head so I just pull it tight each use. He\u2019s not able to kick it off. It keeps him warm, almost too warm at times. We have to use a very thin blanket or not blanket at all, so very useful for winters. I do love that I don\u2019t need to take it off every time the opening is big enough. Good product would recommend.",

Terrible, just terrible. Always hits my baby in the face. All in all not a very helpful product",

Material definitely on the thicker side, still ok for warmer days IMO. For winter months, baby would still need a blanket.",
