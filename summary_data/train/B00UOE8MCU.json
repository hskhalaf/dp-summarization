I prefer stainless steel since you don't have to worry about any plastics leeching into your water, and you can also boil water if you end up in a bad situation without a water filter. If you do have a water filter a lot of them will just screw on to this wide mouth version, the wider mouth also makes it much easier to clean. As you can see the cap even has metal in it so your water is never touching plastic.",

My one complaint is that they are easily dented and the bottoms can get so distorted from use that they cannot stand upright. Also, the lid can be a little fussy to put on and off since it is threaded. But overall, a very good and highly durable piece of equipment.",

The paint drop, the bottle dent easily and it look rugged after only a few weeks of daily usage. In fact during shipping, 4 - 5 of them got dented. I broke a few glass bottles before deciding on stainless steel and I believe most stainless steel bottles have similar issues. Be sure to check out other similar brands like hydro flask etc and let your usage and cost justify the purchase.",

I'm always on the look-out for the perfect lunchbox and thermos combination: easy to open, clean, fill, and carry. The 12-ounce Klean Kanteen is the only bottle that fits in all of our favorites. I subtracted one star because of the lid: my six-year-old has a hard time tightening it so that it doesn't leak, and you can't submerge it to clean it (i.e., no dishwasher). But we continue to use it because it's great in every other way. P.S. It fits perfectly in the outer pocket of the.",

Using regular plastic bottles can lead to chemicals seeping into the water due to leaving the water in the bottle for prolonged periods of time, thus deteriorating the plastic.

Cons: Since the inside is not coated, like say a Sigg bottle, and it isn't super smooth, it is a little more difficult to get staining substances 100% out on the first try.
