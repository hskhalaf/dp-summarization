I also have the 30 pin adapter, but that's not what I mean by bad a fit. An iphone 6 is just to tall and wide. You can loosely rest the phone up top in the trough underneath the handle, but it's awkward. With power from the wall socket the FM digital reception was very weak on every station, even outside. I'll be returning this. I see 'new' ones are being sold for around $700., in 2009 the MSRP was $300. I'd give this 2.5 stars if I could.",

It came with 5 adapters for different model iPods but my new classic fit fine without one. One other thing of interest is there is a sliding bar that goes over the iPod helping to secure it so you can move it around without fear of the iPod coming loose. It is a sturdy well designed piece of equipment.",

It's also not as bulky or heavy to transport as others might suggest. I thought, and still believe, this product was an absolute steal at $200.",

SUPER GREAT SOUND.....Treble, BAAAASSSSSSSS and mid well balanced and lot of options to custom your favorite set up of sound. Altec Lansing made it again!!!!!!!! The price ($172.00) is amazing. Much better than the $600.00 Bose new dock and with much better sound!!!!!!",

I would have thought that for its size with the power plugged in it would generate deeper bass and better sound overall but that i guess would be an ideal product. iPhone4 works absolutely fine with it. it has 3 audio sources plus a tuner so that is real handy as well.

I then purchased the inMotion MIX and used it for less than 3 weeks and it too broke again due to bad power supply. Luckily Amazon took it back for a full refund but I will not buy Altec Lansing products any more. Bad quality - they sound great at first, but will break on you after minimal use.",

    "description": "The Altec Lansing MIX Digital Boombox Speaker System was developed for the \"DJ lifestyle\"--for those people who know music and like to pick the play list to liven their scene. Multiple people can jack in their iPhone, iPod or other music device, and the MIX lets you toggle between sources on-the-fly. There's a 30-pin dock connector for the iPhone/iPod and two front-facing 3.5mm jacks so everyone can enjoy their tunes.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe Altec Lansing MIX Digital Boombox Speaker System was developed for the \"DJ lifestyle\" -- for those people who know music and like to pick the play list to liven their scene. Multiple people can jack in their iPhone, iPod or other music device, and the MIX lets you toggle between sources on-the-fly. There's a 30-pin dock connector for the iPhone/iPod and two front-facing 3.5mm jacks so everyone can enjoy their tunes. The result? A party!\n\n\n\n\nMIX iMT800 Digital Boombox Speaker System offers: \n\n * Retro \"Boombox\" styling with advanced digital performance\n * Inputs for iPhone/iPod, and two additional aux-in jacks\n * Brightly lit LCD display for track information\n * Big natural bass, enhanced with XdB technology\n * AC and battery powered\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversal dock is compatible with both iPhone and iPod, and recharges while it plays your tunes. View larger.\n\nHigh-contrast LCD lets you know your beat, track, artist, album and station display. View larger.Booming Stereo Sound\nOf course, the combo of \"DJ\" and \"party\" requires loud and booming sound, and the MIX will deliver. Loaded with a 5.25-inch side-firing subwoofer and 5.25-inch tuned passive radiator, the MIX pumps out big natural bass, further enhanced with XdB technology for extra heavy punch. The sound is complete with a pair of 3-inch full-range drivers, a pair of 1-inch silk dome tweeters in a horn-loaded configuration. Beyond looking cool, the front-facing horns are engineered to disperse the high frequencies -- which are otherwise highly directional -- for great sound throughout the entire room. Quite frankly, the MIX gets loud.The MIX also features a brightly lit LCD display that tells you the track, artist and album being played from your docked iPhone or iPod. Also, FM station data is displayed when the radio is playing.\n\nTailored EQ\nThe MIX has various EQ options that allow the user to tailor or personalize the sound. The simplest and most familiar is an adjustment of separate bass and treble controls. For more technical tuning, a digital 7-band graphic equalizer allows custom cutting or boosting of specific frequencies. Or, there are four EQ presets where just a touch of a button will tune the EQ for specific music genres, either for rock, pop, hip-hop or simply flat.\n\nFM Radio Tuner\nFor entertainment beyond the iPhone and iPod, the MIX has an FM radio tuner with four station pre-sets.\n\nMoves with the Party\nTrue to its retro boombox roots, the MIX runs on AC or battery power. You'll always know how much battery life you have because the MIX will tell you on its display. You can expect up to 30 ours of play with eight \"D\" sized batteries. And, the MIX has nicely weight-balanced handles so you can take it on the road or around the house just as easily.\n\nThoughtfully Designed Remote Control\nBetween parties the remote control stows away in its own cubby so it can always be easily found. At party time, use the clip-on carabineer so the remote is always handy to command the jams. The remote allows you to toggle between all of your music sources, including the FM radio and lets you control the on/off power, volume minus, volume plus, track back, track forward, EQ, play/pause, and the four preset buttons. The four preset buttons are used for both the FM preset mode and the EQ preset mode.\n\nThe MIX is covered by a one-year limited warranty.\n\nWhat's in the Box\nMIX stereo speaker system, remote control, AC power adapter, two (2) 3.5mm connection cables, Apple universal well inserts, and user's guide.\n\n\n\n\nAltec Lansing Speaker DocksOrbit MOctiv MiniOctiv DuoinMotion CompactinMotion ClassicMixUltra-portable sound for MP3 players or mobile phonesCompact speaker/charger/\nspeakerphoneDesigned for multiple iPhone and iPod playersPerfect speaker for hotel, beach, or backyardIdeal speaker to take around the houseThe ultimate party speakerKey Features * 360-degree sound field\n * 2.5mm adapter for use with mobile phones\n * On/Off button and battery life indicator\n\n * Fits in nearly any space\n * Wake up to music with free Alarm Rock app\n * Makes video calling easy\n\n * Dock, charge and play two players at once\n * Shuffle tunes from two players with free Music Mix app\n * Wake up to music with free Alarm Rock app\n * Fits neatly in tight spaces\n * Built-in USB port lets you charge a third device\n\n * Integrated cover protects music system during travel\n * Cover folds back into a stand\n * Ported drivers deliver deep bass\n\n * Built-in digital FM radio with At-A-Glance LCD\n * Rechargeable battery allows for portability\n * Kick-stand flips up into a handle\n * Class D amplification\n * Advanced audio Digital Signal Processing (DSP)\n\n * Specially engineered horn-loaded tweeters and mid-range drivers\n * XdB bass-enhanced side-firing subwoofer\n * Built-in digital FM radio with 4 station presets\n * 7-band graphic equalizer\n * Convenient grab handles\n\nSound Enhancement TechnologyAudio AlignmentAudio AlignmentAudio AlignmentAudio AlignmentAudio Alignment, Waves Maxx AudioAudio Alignment, Xtreme Dynamic BassOnboard ControlsPowerFully iPhone or iPod controlledPower, Source, VolumePower, VolumePower, Volume, Track back, Track forwardPower, Volume, Track back, Track forward, Source, EQPower Type3 AAA BatteriesAC OnlyAC OnlyAC, 4 AA Batteries AC, Li-Ion Rechargeable BatteryAC, 8 D Batteries Orbit MOctiv MiniOctiv DuoinMotion CompactinMotion ClassicMix Wireless Remote iPhone & iPod CompatibleAudio Inputs2-channel analog (stereo)Universal dock for iPhone & iPodTwo universal docks for iPhone & iPodUniversal dock for iPhone & iPod Universal dock for iPhone & iPodUniversal dock for iPhone & iPodSecondary Aux In Jack Shielded for Interference Speaker ConfigurationOne 1.5\" full-range driverOne 3\" full-range driverTwo 2\" full-range driversTwo 2\" full-range driversTwo 3\" full-range driversTwo 1\" tweeters and two 3\" mid-range drivers;\n5.25\" subwoofer and 5.25\" passive radiator",
