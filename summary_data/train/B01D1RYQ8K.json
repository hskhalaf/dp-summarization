We haven't hit the scalding temps expected this summer but so far the fan and panel have performed admirably. We installed the panel on a portable board that we can turn toward the sun when we are around. It is very sensitive and the slightest shadow will slow the fan considerably. Works great and moves air when the sun shines and we are very happy with the entire unit. Our tiny plants are happy as well and we look forward to a bountiful tomato year.",

Only minor gripe was I had to splice in another 20' of wire to make it to my desired panel location. I also spent a while fabricating brackets due to a tricky tight location I picked. I think a simpler way would be to use long bolts with some sort of a sleeve tube (small pvc?) to hold the unit off the roofing, but I had some aluminum angle in the garage....",

The fan spins but seems underpowered and hardly moves any air, I have to put my hand up to it or stand super still under it for a bit to even feel it.

The fan has quite a bit of power and works well when u run it off a battery, the solar panel is absolutely trash and not reliable at all.
