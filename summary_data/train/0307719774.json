Weird quirk though, the cover of the book was applied upside down to the pages inside the book, again not a big deal as it still functions properly, but hit my minor OCD nerve inside. Thought it was a cute gift idea!",

The questions are really good, you can tell the authors put a lot of thought into them. I would recommend it for anyone who has trouble coming up with journal ideas and works well with journal prompts. The spaces are small, so it is also a great choice if you don't have a lot of time to journal. I highly recommend this for people like me - forgetful about journaling, not enough time to write huge entries, easier to respond to prompts than to write freely.",

I think it's really great to see how your responses change over five years. My mum really liked this journal so I ordered her one too! My only complaint is that it can be a little hard to write in due to a combination of the stiff spine and small size of the nook",

The small spaces force you to keep your entries succinct. I echo other reviewers, however, that the book would be even better if it was a little bigger.
