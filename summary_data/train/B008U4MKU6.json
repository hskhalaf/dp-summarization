It can be hard to steer sometimes especially going over bumps and you must push with 2 hands at all times. Also the straps to secure your car seat to the carrier get caught in the hinges when unfolding the carrier so you have to be mindful every time. Overall it\u2019s a decent stroller for every day, light use. It is lightweight to throw in your trunk but definitely cannot suffice as your only stroller option.",
