      "text": "What a wonderful product! I have a hanging lamp with no switch and it is not on a wall switch so this was a wonderful solution. I can keep the lamp plugged in and now have the light programmed to come on and go off daily. Wonderful! Extremely easy to set up although I did have to put the lamp right next to the router for the original set up as it said it could not reach the network unless it was closer (and we live in a small apartment). I love that I can use my smart speaker (Google) or my phone to control the light.",

I just wish these bulbs would come down in price and that TP-Link would come out with an outdoor Par38 flood.

There are easy to follow instructions that the lightbulb comes with. For the price, you can't beat it. My one complaint is that it does say it shouldn't be used with a lampshade that uses metal to connect to the bulb. Not sure why, or if that's general for bulbs. Other than that, I love it!",

After a couple of weeks working with the TP-link customer support (not very good) and making all kinds of changes to my router per support instructions, nothing was helping. So, I broke down and purchased a newer cable/modem (NightHawk Netgrear C6900). Once installed and bulbs were re-connected to the newer router, everything works. Alexa works very good with the bulbs. My older router was installed by my ISP Time Warner Cable, Technicolor Model TC8717T Hardware ver. 1.1. Hope this saves some you some misery when trying to get the bulbs to stay on the WIFI.",
