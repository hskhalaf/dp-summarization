Great product, worth the money if you are going to use it more then once or twice a year. My only suggestion would be to buy a better set of stakes. The 8 plastic stakes that come with it are not that great. Also, they only give you 8 stakes when 10 can be used if you are going to stake down all sides and front flap.",

(Since it is indeed lightweight, be sure to anchor it properly either with sufficient items like coolers or boom boxes inside or you will watch it blowing out to sea in a moderately heavy wind.)

Not to say we will be using the cabana in the rain, but it would be a wiser construction in my opinion to at least have the option of the window shade panels on the exterior.",

This one you actually have to press the two pieces together so it is much harder to set up and take down, especially in the wind. The legs all turn different directions, rather just pulling the string attachment and it popping up. It is still a great shelter from the rain, in really cold soccer games it helps keep you warmer and blocks the wind.",

One of my favorite features is the fact that the tent has pockets on the bottoms you can fill with sand that weight the tent down on top of the other pull down straps. The weighted sand pockets have been great for surviving windy beach conditions in Chicago. This is definitely the best sun tent I've used.",

It's big, blocks the sun, and provides much needed shade at soccer games and at the beach. It seems well made. I've used it twice, once in some SERIOUS wind, and even though the stakes started to pull out of the sand a bit, the cabana held its own!",

As far as the functionality is concerned, this shelter will not only block light, but does an outstanding job of blocking wind (and sand in my face) and the footprint keeps the sand off your beach towel. Every aspect of this shelter has been thought out perfectly. For anyone who likes the outdoors but want's to stay out of the sun, buy this now. You won't regret it!",
