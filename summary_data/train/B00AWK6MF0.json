      "text": "So this is the best dry shampoo I've ever used, but I discovered that Eva NYC is literally the exact same. Amika says they are salon exclusive so I guess rebranding allows them to sell their products outside salons. Well, the Eva products are cheaper and there is no difference except the name & design of the label. So while this is my favorite dry shampoo, and I would highly recommend it, I will not repurchase the Amika version. Both Amika & Eva are cruelty free which is a huge plus!",

Don't judge - you all are here because you're also lazy with your hair washing routine lol",

From Amazon, however, I think it's an old product, as it does not smell the same (it still smells close to the Amika product), and it has a less favorable consistency when applied. As for the original Amika Perk Up dry shampoo, I frigging love this dry shampoo. I bought this a second time over the Oribe dry texturizing spray. They're both great products, but the scent of Amika is way more intoxicating and the price point is phenomenal.

Shook it a lot more & the powder finally came out. To make an actually difference you're shaking & spraying for so long you might as well just wash your hair.

Be sure to shake well before using. Also, it can make hair look powdery similar to using baby powder if you apply too close. Price on amazon is cheaper than I've found elsewhere including BirchBox (and I tend to check around prior to purchasing).",
