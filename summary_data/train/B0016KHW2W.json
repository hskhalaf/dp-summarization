You basically have to shove your thumb nail in between the metal frame and push extremely hard while trying to twist in the opposite direction with your other hand hopefully providing enough force to unlock it. I wouldn't mind it taking two hands to close if it were much easier, but this is absurd. I'd recommend buying something else because this product sucks.",

Also, after three months the entire folding mechanism feels like it's getting loose. Overall very dissatisfied. On the plus side it is very small and minimalistic and you can easily forget that it's in your pocket.",

It uses replaceable utility blades, so you don't feel bad when it gets nicked. There's a lot of talk about \"everyday carry\" -- but this is a knife I really do carry every day, because it does the job, and if the blade snaps, oh, well!",

I carry this and a Micra instead of a Benchmade/surge combo when I'm at the office. Far lighter and nearly as versatile. Blade affixes with a screw, which could be a negative if you don't carry a dime or multitool on you.

It's not easy to get a good purchase on the blade carrier to open it but it nicely sized and convenient. Would probably function best as a money clip but it rides well clipped to the pocket. Swapping blades isn't too difficult but it does require a screwdriver to do it. It would pair well with a Victorinox or a multi tool to serve as a utility blade. (Obviously) Not intimidating so great for sheeple dense areas of carry :p",

Plus all the other folding razor knives are too big and bulky to carry in my pocket. This little knife is just what I needed. The only downsides one might see is the small size would inhibit safely cutting any heavy duty items; and the set screw has to come out in order to change the blade and could get lost easily if you are not careful. That being said, I still give it 5 stars because it is perfect for what I need.",

The blade is secured with a thumb screw which can easily be unscrewed with any U.S. coin, so you don\u2019t need to have a screwdriver handy if you need to change the blade. Would recommend to friends, in fact I have recommended it to many of my coworkers. For the price you can\u2019t really go wrong.",

    "description": "Like the men and women who carry our gear, Gerber is Unstoppable. Decades of innovation and dedication have put us here. Renowned as a master of knives and tools, Gerber's problem-solving, life-saving products are designed with the unique needs of specific activities in mind. Today that includes much more than a blade.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nThe Gerber 22-41830 E.A.B. Pocket Knife with Exchange-a-Blade is a safe and lightweight alternative to the traditional box cutter, and because it accepts standard utility blades, you will always have a sharp knife handy.The pocket clip doubles as a money clip, and the liner lock construction keeps the blade safely open while in use. \n\n \n\n22-41830 E.A.B. Pocket Knife\nwith Exchange-a-Blade\nAt a Glance:  * Lightweight and slim flip blade stores comfortably in pocket\n   \n   \n * Accepts standard or contractor grade utility blade\n   \n   \n * Locks into open position\n   \n   \n   \n * Pocket clip doubles as money clip\n\n\n\nWhen one side of the blade gets dull, just turn the blade over. When both sides are dull, simply replace the blade. View larger. Durable Stainless Steel Construction for Long Life\nMade from durable stainless steel, the Gerber E.A.B. Pocket Knife will stand up to daily use as a box cutter, pocket knife, or as the back-up knife you keep in your backpack, purse, or car.\n\nReplaceable Blade Keeps Knife Sharp\nWith its handy exchange-a-blade feature, the Gerber E.A.B. Pocket Knife will always be sharp. Because it uses contractor grade or standard size utility blades, you can cheaply and conveniently change blades as often as you need. You won't have to worry about ruining the blade when you cut through tough surfaces--just replace it and keep working.\n\nWhen one side of the blade gets dull, you can still use the other side by turning the blade over. When both sides are dull, simply unscrew the stabilizing screw and replace the blade.\n\nLightweight Knife Stores Comfortably in Pocket\nAt only 2.2 ounces and 2.4 inches in length when closed, the Gerber E.A.B. Pocket Knife stores easily and comfortably in your pants or shirt front pocket, keeping the knife nearby for frequent tasks. A convenient pocket clip doubles as a money clip and allows the knife to rest on the edge of the pocket, increasing accessibility.\n\nSafety Features for Worry-Free Use\nLiner lock construction locks the blade solidly in the open position, so you can apply pressure without worrying about the knife closing on its own. A finger guard over the blade keeps your fingers safe, and the shape and heft of the knife keep it from wobbling or slipping.\n\nThe Gerber E.A,B, also makes a great monogrammed gift, with its flat handle and slim profile.\n\nAbout Gerber: A History of Innovation\nSavvy. Moxie. Craftsmanship. Attention to detail. These are just a few of the company traits that have contributed to Gerber's emergence as a world leader in outdoor gear. Joseph Gerber started Portland, Oregon's Gerber Advertising back in 1910, and one Christmas, he hired a local knife-maker to craft 25 sets of kitchen cutlery as client gifts. The knives were so popular Mr. Gerber ultimately left his agency to launch Gerber Legendary Blades in 1939.\n\nIt makes sense, really. An idea man gets the idea of a lifetime and turns it into a major outdoor brand--one that commands respect among knife lovers and knife makers alike. And now that same high regard is spreading in new directions, in the form of many outstanding products such as tools, personal L.E.D. lighting, and more.\n\nWhat's in the Box\nGerber 22-41830 E.A.B. Pocket Knife with Exchange-a-Blade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe Gerber exchange-a-blade pocket knife uses contractor grade or standard size utility blades that can be easily replaced as necessary. The stainless steel handle works well as both a pocket or a money clip and liner lock construction keeps the blade safely in the open position when in use. The blade screw is raised for easy opening.\n\nSee more",
