I noticed that the course side is very powerful and will easily remove metal shavings from the knife edge when pressure is applied while pulling a knife through the slot. Accordingly, I suggest caution when using this side. Easy on the downward pressure. I suspect that it is not necessary to use \"course\" each time. This is not a bad thing, just something to be aware of. Certainly a great feature when sharpening dull knives but should be used sparingly on reasonably sharp knives. Now that all my knives are quite sharp, I plan on mostly using the \"fine\" side for most of my resharpening.",

As with many of these types of sharpeners, depending on where the handle comes in contact, you cannot always sharpen the entire length of the blade. The same goes with scissors, some fit well in the sharpener and others are more problematic getting the cutting surface seated properly to sharpen well. But overall, easy to use, doesn't take much pressure, and puts a good edge on the blades.",

Also, it would be nice if the ceramic rods could be swapped out and/or rotated to spread out the wear areas and extend the life of the rods (granted, that's a lot to ask of a $10 sharpener).",

I have sharpened several older knives that i have had, and they cut through a tomato with ease. Just like the ones that advertise on TV. The only thing i would suggest is that you were a glove on whichever hand you do not have the knife in, just in case it slips off. Some of the more expensive brands come with a glove, but i just used one of my own.",

My STRAIGHT edged Wusthof - Gourmet and Classic - knives sharpness was restored on the COURSE slot in about 15 passes. The FINE slot was used to smooth surfaces. NOTE: The instructions were good but perhaps the words FINE and COURSE should be in BOLD font.",

      "text": "I have only sharpened a couple knives with it but thus far but works great! One was bad enough to use the rough sharpener first then the fine and now it is like cutting a hot knife through butter as they say. I will continue using it on the other blades in my kitchen and have no doubt it will change my cooking/preparing experience. I cook 80-90% of our family meals and having a sharp knife as we all know makes a world of a difference. Further more it was at a great price that was very reasonable, producing sharp results.",

If I could make one suggestion, it would be to include a little more specific instructions, especially on serrated knives. I realize there are instructions on the box but some of us don't have a lot of experience with sharpening. Perhaps you could consider including more detailed instructions, such as the angle to hold the blade, perhaps to include drawings to illustrate important points. I very much appreciate your efforts to provide a superior product and great customer service. Keep up the good work!",
