I thought it'd be a great idea to spend all my money on a sniper rifle and ammo then swim around to that junk ship and climb the sail then pick off all the pirates. It turns out that even though they can't shoot you from up there, they can see you and you lose. After getting stuck here I stopped playing. I should have done some side missions to get something other than a sniper rifle and just tried to brute force it but I never got around to it.",

I have never played any of the other Far Cry games and this game just happened to be in my recommendations on Amazon. It got rave reviews and it was very cheap so I took a chance and bought it. I have not regretted that decision since. Don't think about it - just do yourself a favor and buy this game!",

Far Cry 3 is a masterpiece that I can keep playing over and over again. Don't bother with the multiplayer mode, though. If you go multiplayer, it will be just like every other first person shooter out there. The single-player mode is what makes this game such a joy to play.",

This game follows that trope but excels because it uses the environment to host multiple facets of gameplay. There is an extensive ecosystem full of animals to hunt, there are bases to conquer, and there is also an interesting plot which work together nicely. Though the story's sense of urgency and the at-your-convenience exploration are at odds, the shooter and stealth assassination gameplay keeps you captivated through the experience.

You get new items by climbing a giant tower in the same way. The loot looks the same. Read the details for the items. These guys are funny and quirky. Although, I might just be amused because I am also an animator that just headed down the design path instead of games. Anyway, it's a great game.",

The storyline is exciting, just like a movie so you get excited to play the game just to see what happens next. The graphics is great but is worse than Ubisoft's other game like Splinter Cell.

FPS/RPG elements of Bioshock/Skyrim. The story is very well done and engaging. Combat is great, similar to COD or other polished FPS. I think the use of successful mechanics/ideas from other games is really the reason Far Cry 3 is such a great game. So many games try to set themselves apart from their competitors when they could be taking successful elements and incorporating them into their games. Look forward to the next Far Cry and hopefully they add more depth to the hunting/crafting system.",

Most of the major story intersections removed you from the world and core gameplay elements and thrust you in psychedelic trip scenes that usually left me wonder how whatever just happened actually happened.",

Coop is a fun alternative to play with people, it feels more like COD than the single player campaign. It has linear battles with minimal exploration.

I found the game to be fun, with great scenes and a great feeling of adventure. The side missions are repetitive but the world is huge and engulfing. The graphics are good, the video graphics are great; Keeping you in the same world and same look but giving great performaces of facial expressions and feelings. The main antagonist Vaas, who you meet early on, is great and makes the game worth every penny. This or Xcom for game of the year 2012.",

All in all it was a good game and worth a look at, but I wasn't complaining when the story ended. Good gameplay, okay story, good graphics, and good voice acting. Like I said worth a buy because it is fun to play.",

The environment is beautiful and genuinely fun to explore, the enemies and animals challenging, and the missions themselves are vast. My only issue is the way some of the voice acting sounds a little filtered or muffled, but those are only around the NPCs. I recommend this game for anyone that enjoys shooters but also likes to take some time off and just explore. The multiplayer and co-op story modes are fun as well, though the former does resemble COD a bit (as do most FPS multiplayer games now). 5/5.",

You can approach missions in a very stealthy manner or in a more confrontational and action oriented way. It's a good time.",
