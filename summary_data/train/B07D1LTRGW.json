I especially enjoy making my golden, crispy samosas in it. The timer and temperature system is a joy to use. It has a pleasant notification sound once food is ready. The safety system is great also in that it automatically stops if you open the fryer. In terms of cleaning, it couldn't get easier. I just place it in my dish washer every now and then. Highly recommended product.",

Perfect size for a large family. My only criticism is the finish of the design around the joints - could be sleeker. Having said that, it does look good. I do place it on a heat resistant surface as I read that it heats up, however it doesn't get too hot imo. Easy push control system with blue LED light. Highly recommended. Great buy.",

I\u2019ve had no issues at all with this item and really recommend it if your looking for an air fryer. It\u2019s really easy to use and if you don\u2019t want to use the pre set cooking time and temp for foods you don\u2019t have too as you can change heat and time to fit what you need.",

Also it doesn't stink up the house as there is little to no oil required.",
