After a week, my nails still look good with no chipping at all. The base coat is still sticky after curing and I wasn't aware that it would be like that but I'm sure that was because I didn't know better. I cured the pink and white for 60 seconds each and the top coat for the same amount of time. The top coat is super shiny and turned out perfect.",

The nail polish colors were to light so I had to apply at least 3 coats which caused them to chip so I eventually peeled all of them off.

Both times I've done a full set, at about day 10 I've needed to redo one or two nails. Then I get about another week to 10 days before I do the full set again.
