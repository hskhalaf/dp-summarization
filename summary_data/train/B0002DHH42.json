I thought I may as well buy one that is made for dogs nails and is powerful and quiet. It's not very powerful unless you turn it all the way up in which case it is as loud as my 110V dremel tool. When you have it turned up to about 1/2 way or full out, it sounds like it is going to fall apart with all the rattling. I'm too lazy to return it and haven't found my Dremel yet so I'll keep it and use it as a spare.",

They prefer to clip away so I had to invest in a nail grinder. I had another brand which lasted about a year before the bit holder gave away. This one has adjustable speeds and did the job very quickly which is the goal, to minimize the time for dogs that are fussy about their paws. I like it you don't have to keep it outside to juice up before using them. Just plug and it's ready to go.",

The high speeds are very high and the noise does step up. The size and weight are comfortable to hold. The charger is of a newer design and the cord is appreciatively long. It is just the right size for easy holding. Another plus is the carrying case. As with all electric grinders, one should grind nails in small spurts. If held too long the heat build-up is fast and painful to the pet's nail.",

I have been doing short, but frequent sessions to get her accustomed to it. In any event, it is much better than hacking off the nail, and possibly the quick as well!!",

I foolishly thought this one would be better since it cost more and was a plug in tool. Wow! Was I mistaken!! Very frustrated with Entirely Pets as they will only give me \"in store\" credit. Yeah, like I'll be doing that!! I'll take it back to Petsmart and see what they can do! Never again!!!",
