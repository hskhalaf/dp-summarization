One negative I will say is I don't get much from the advertised battery life, bearing in mind I have alot of media usage.",

Especially with the new Ice Lake processor in it. However, if you're an artist/user of Photoshop it can be very slow and has performance issues. so, as an artist I wouldn't recommend this version of the machine, I'd go for the i7 or the 16GB version. That's the only reason I returned it. If you're going to use it for light productivity, social media, and watching Netflix etc on, then it's great.",
