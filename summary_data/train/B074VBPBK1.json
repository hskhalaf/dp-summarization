It has multiple sizinf included but the smallest is perfect for a lady. A lotnof headphones are sized for guys and I my ear gets sore... there are amazing, I practically sleep in them. UPDATE: it\u2019s been a year, I just love these headphones. They are very lightweight but good at isolating sound. They are so comfortable I can wear for hours without ear fatigue. My only peeve is the battery life. For long hauls battery life is about 4-5 hours.",

I have used these almost every day for the past month and so far no problems, clear sound and a very durable cord. It does have some memory though so I wouldn't pull on it a lot, but the material feels like it will last a while. Ear pieces fit nice and come with three sizes that hold well and are comfortable, controls are easily learned and not overly complicated, even if the battery/control piece is a little larger than most others. Would definitely recommend!",
