It\u2019s a solid option for mid-tempo training. Though it received a few negative feedback, the shoe has still proven to be an excellent road partner.",

        "The Open Mesh of the Type A 6 ensures a lightweight and breathable coverage that\u2019s comfortable",
        "Flex Film is a set of overlays that are inconspicuous, yet efficient in securing the foot in place, according to a few testers",
        "The SSL EVA is a premium mid-sole unit from Saucony that\u2019s lightweight and very capable of providing durable support and rebound",
        "The XT-900 is a carbon rubber material that can be found throughout the outsole unit and it gives traction to the runner",
        "The IBR+ or Injected Blown Rubber offers additional cushioning in the forefoot area of the outsole, making sure that every toe-off is as efficient as possible",
        "The men and women\u2019s versions of the Type A 6 have lightweight natures",
        "It has an affordable price"

      "cons": [
        "The Saucony A 6 works well for many activities, but its durability was criticized by some reviewers when taken to longer races",

The first time I wore them, they pinched my feet, causing top of the foot pain that lingered for days. I have read reviews that say the sole is better on these. Maybe. The A5s have very poor traction when wet. I haven't worn the A6s in the rain, so I can't really compare. I hate them.",
