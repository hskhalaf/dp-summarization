False, it\u2019s just like the Australian pink clay face masks. It is tight and uncomfortable. Not just that but it has made no difference to my skin. Yes I have used the entire thing, so I gave it a chance. I\u2019m sticking to Lira and anyone with stubborn skin should do the same!",

Because of my sensitive skin I was a little concerned but this product does not irritate my skin in any way. I\u2019m almost emotional about it because my skin was really starting to do a number on my self esteem. Love this product!",
