I started shedding a few days before he did, but we both had so much dead skin just peeling right off in 4-7 days; it was fascinating and gross at the same time! Definitely wash your feet well before you apply this mask. (If you have any lotion on your feet, it won't work very well.) Also, don't forget to moisturize your feet really well after your skin starts peeling; they'll stay softer for longer that way!",

      "Say goodbye to your dry rough feet: Liberex foot care treatment can effectively soften the aged cuticle, remove dry dead skin and repair your coarse, cracked heels",
      "Baby your foot naturally: Contains milk extract and a variety of plant extracts, like aloe, rose and tea tree essential oil etc. Mild and non-irritating, Liberex foot pedicure mask peels your hard foot skin without irritation or discomfort",
      "Important Tip: A sensibility test is highly recommended if you have sensitive skin due to the exfoliating nature of the mask. Get some liquid from the mask and put it on your ankle or on the top of your feet. Then wait 10 minutes to see how it works",
      "Important Tip: There will be nothing to peel if you do not have callus or dead skin. Daily foot soak for 15-20 minutes 48 hours after the application is highly recommended for the best results. Generally, the peeling will begin at Day 3-4 and the whole process lasts about 7 days",
      "Studies have shown that most individuals have positive results. Please note that results may vary based off thickness of dead skin or skin sensitivity."
