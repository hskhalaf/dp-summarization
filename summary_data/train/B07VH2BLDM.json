My only negative is that the phone must be connected to data or wifi for item to work. I recommend product.",

      "text": "This product is a cellular data-driven device. Effectively, you have a \"remote\" in your hand so the device live translates what you said into a language that the software supports (only a few languages available so make sure you double-check). Seem to be useful, but you really need to field test the product in a foreign country to test its capability. I toyed with Chinese <-> English and it works well. Will update review as needed.",

Once it is set up (which takes about 2 minutes or less after downloading app), in the app you only need to choose which language you want to translate to which language. That is it. After that just pass on the remote when you speak, hold the button while speaking, release the button, and whatever was spoken would be translated. I am happy with the purchase, and would recommend the product.",

It doesn't translate slag well, but it does help that it not only says what is needed to be translated but writes it out so it can be read. The PLUS is that it saves everything that's said until you delete it. This is great to use as reference for later or for note transcripts. The battery life is great and its small enough to fit in your pocket as well. Worth the money.",

I tried it at a couple local places translating Spanish with similar results. Super easy to install and use (one caveat, I couldn't find the app on Google Play Store so I had to use the RFID from the manual and install with special permissions) but other than that it works like a charm. Cant wait to use it on my next international vacation.",

My Hispanic roommate spent a good amount of time using and he said the translations are spot on. I believe this could be very useful when traveling abroad to another place that has an unfamiliar main language. The device itself has a very good feel without feeling cheap or too lightweight. Overall I would recommend this to friends and family and would buy again without any remorse.",
