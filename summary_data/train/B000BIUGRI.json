I used a moisturizer flattening iron along with some light holding spray, and then my hair was full of static. This product is best what it says- it helps to soften, nourish, and shine hair and does not have any damaging drying ingredients. Love it!!",

I just wash my hair, pat it with a towel to take out some of the water, and spray this on. My hair brushes out easily, detangles immediately, and is ready for the next step. Easy, effective and quick. It may seem pricey but lasts so long and works so well that I don't give the price tag a second thought.",
