I'm using mine on a Britax Affinity and it works just fine with the seat facing in or out. The cup holders look small but they can hold at least a liter sized bottle! Which is typically the size of sparkling water (or wine...just kidding!!) There's plenty of storage in the accessory. I'm glad I got it when I ordered the stroller.",

      "text": "This is a great stroller organizer. Pretty basic, but fits well and the cup holders hold anything from a plastic water bottle to a yeti-- probably not anything bigger. On piece of advice, it does just attach with two loops, and it is a stroller, so if you are putting a takeout coffee cup or something without a lid in there, be care because it will slosh and spill out. Definetely not a reason not to buy!! That would happen with any organizer like this. I really like the middle magnetic pocket, it fits a lot. I also like the open mesh pockets in front of the drink inserts-- they are tight enough to hold keys or chapstock, etc.",

I saw lots of reviews for the Select or Double, but not the Single, so I had a hard time choosing just looking through reviews. I'm really glad I purchased this because it's perfect for us! The coffee cups pictured are both Starbucks Grande cups so the depth is reassuring. I love that there's actually a metal frame structure so it feels sturdy, but we can still fold the stroller with the organizer on. Highly recommend!",

The straps that connect it to the stroller handle are wider too, which helps to keep it in place better. It fits perfectly on my Vista, and I do not have to remove it to fold the stroller.",

The Baby Jogger also has only one net pocket in the front while this Britax has three. The Baby Jogger is shorter making drinks stand up more and more chances of falling out. Seems like the Britax is a winner given all the deficiency to the Baby Jogger. But. The Baby Jogger velcro is much much stronger. It is really difficult to remove. The Britax velcro is too loose in comparison and when you put something in you hear the sound of the velcro coming undone.",

I use the center storage compartment for my keys/phone and use the sides for drinks. I'm able to fold my double stroller no problem while the organizer is on. The quality is excellent and the velcro really holds up great! Very happy with my purchase and highly recommend this stroller organizer!",

The cup holders are a nice feature as well, but be wary of placing of top heavy, jumbo sized water bottles - just didn't seem stable enough for me with my giant water bottle. My only critique would be the fit with my diaper bag. My bag attaches to the stroller nicely by stroller straps, which pushes the stroller organizer up and crowds the space. Would be nice if they could both fit on the stroller in harmony, but definitely not a deal breaker.",

I do have to be careful grabbing coffee cups in and out so that the lid doesn't pop off and spill. I like that there's a few small pockets made of netting in front. I use that to slip in my phone in sometimes. And the middle compartment is quite large and closes with a magnet. It's very functional and worth every penny.",

      "text": "This has been extremely useful and we can't imagine our stroller without it! The two bottle holders are nice and deep and the closing compartment (with a magnetized lid) is very useful for stowing away items you don't want to be visible or fall out. The net pockets at the front are great for tissues, receipts and my phone. The only criticism I have is that it gradually slips down the handlebars over time and so I periodically have to pull it up and reattach the velcro.",

Most importantly it does not affect the collapsing of the stroller so you can just leave it on. It fits two bottles/cups and has a small compartment with magnetic closure in the middle that you could fit a cell phone in, or pacifiers and other small toys. The padding also feels like it would keep drinks cool but I have not tried this yet.",

The middle portion uses a magnetic closure, so we have never had issues with smaller objects falling out.
