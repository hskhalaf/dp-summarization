I usually stop down to 2.8 anyways to keep faces in focus, so perhaps the extra stops to 1.8 are wasted. Downside is the weight to this lens. It's large for a 1.8 lens and it's dated (I think it was released in 2013). Would be nice if Sigma released an update with IS and Sony e-mount compatibility so we don't have to use the MC-11 adapter.",

I don't think that this is necessarily a bad lens, but I think I got a defective product. (using a Canon\u200b 80D)",

The AF is lightning fast in all but the darkest scenarios and it's nearly silent. The lens is a bit heavy but clearly well built and easy to use, with the focus rings gliding effortlessly. Have used for personal nighttime shoots and professional nighttime and indoor shoots, and the quality is incredible even paired with a simple Canon T3i.",
