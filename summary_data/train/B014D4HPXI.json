      "text": "As my son got bigger, he grew out of his baby rocker but couldn't quite sit up yet. This is at a perfect incline so he can see what is going on around him but also take a nap if sleepy. The removable toy bar is perfect when I need him entertained while I do chores. The seat easily detaches and can be thrown in the wash. It was also a lifesaver when he got his first cold and ear infection; laying flat was very uncomfortable for him and this allowed him to get much needed rest during the day. Oh, and it vibrates! He'll grow out of it quickly, but for the price it is absolutely worth it.",

The toy bar also goes on and off very easily and it's great for moving from room to room!",

When not in use the chairs easily stack on top of each other. I would definitely recommend these over any other more expensive chairs.",

I took off the toys on top for now because he\u2019s only 2 months and isn\u2019t interested in them. It makes it much easier to put him down and pick him up. The toys seem nice so hopefully once he starts playing with toys he will enjoy them.",

The worst part is the legs which splay way out, causing many in the family to trip over the bouncer. (I suppose that is to make sure the bouncer does not tip over, but I have never had trouble with any of my other bouncers tipping over.) Also, I am not interested in using the battery-powered vibrator, but there is no way to remove this in-the-way box from the bouncer. If you are looking for a lower-cost bouncer, I recommend Bright Stars Playful Pinwheels Bouncer.",

The incline is about right, and she feels like she\u2019s hanging out with us. The bounce also sends her to sleep gently which is a bonus. It\u2019s also very easy to assemble and well made. The seat supports hart neck so that it doesn\u2019t tilt forward or sideways. She can support her head a little better now but I imagine this would have worked for her at a younger age. Price is right and it\u2019s a simple but well made product. I\u2019d recommend!",

      "text": "This has been a lifesaver as an additional place to set baby down to play while you inevitably have to do other things (i.e. shower, eat food, fold the endless amounts of laundry). It is easy to move from room to room, easy to travel with, keeps baby entertained and can be used longer than I expected. My son is 6 months and he still loves it, wish I had purchased sooner - he became bored with his swing and boppy so this is nice to add to the rotation. For the price point, it's worth every penny.",

Yea it comes off but not super easily. The fabric of the material is really nice too. Not cheap. Takes D Battery which I wish I paid attention to before buying so I could have one ready.",

      "text": "After trying the mamaroo with disappointing results (my baby hated it), I decided to try a much cheaper bouncer. This little thing is amazing. My son is now almost five months old and he absolutely loves it. The vibration is a nice feature which helps calm him down and sometimes help him fall asleep. He enjoys batting at the hanging toys, and like holding on to the frame the toys are attached to (probably because of the vibration). The chair bounces whenever he kicks which is another added bonus. It is lightweight and easy to move around the house which is convenient for seeing baby wherever you are. Batteries seem to last forever, even with every day use. Great buy!",

I highly recommend using a boppy noggin nest of similar flathead pillow with this to prevent flattening of baby\u2019s head. We learned the hard way that baby\u2019s heads are very susceptible to flattening and measures like pillows need to be taken to reduce risk. As always, baby needs to be monitored if using any type of pillow. Hope this helps someone reading this as we didn\u2019t know before!",

She\u2019s 4 months now and we\u2019ve had it over a month. Well worth the money over some of the fancier bouncers in my opinion.",

Just a word of caution, watch carefully when putting on the safety straps, the leg skin can get caught on the buckle and pinch baby's skin. If it happens, the entire neighborhood will hear the screaming.",

It\u2019s easy to bounce with one foot, the vibration is great, and it\u2019s so easy to move all around the house. The cover washes well and the toy bar is a good addition. Our third daughter is three months old and it\u2019s her favorite place to sit! Highly recommend. (I also got it for an absolute STEAL around Christmas)",
