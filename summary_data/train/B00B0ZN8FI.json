It came packaged nicely so if you wanted to give it as a gift it is lovely. I'm thankful I had a gift card to help me with the purchase otherwise I would have been reluctant to purchase it because of the price. I'm a believer that you get what you pay for, but I would rather have less packaging and the piggy bank and a lower price than the price and the piggy bank as it's offered now. Overall I'm pleased with the product.",

I guess that makes it easier for little kids to lift it, but I think it also might mean the walls aren't very thick, so it may break if hit ever so slightly. I have another piggy bank similar to this and it is substantially heavier. All around, I am happy with this purchase!",
