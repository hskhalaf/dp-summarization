A fair amount of room up front to bring in your boots, socks, a small light, etc. Having used a half dozen other one man tents and bivys in the last decade, I will say this is the best yet.",

You cannot set up the tent without using the ties to stake it into the ground, the poles are not self supporting. You can use the mosquito netting portion of the tent without the rain fly. The entrance to the tent is somewhat strange, you have to enter through the front of the tent and only unzips halfway down the center. This tent would be better described as an oversized bivy bag. There is no vestibule space as the picture may imply. If you understand how the tent functions you should be pleased with it.",

I will be using this tent on my cross country bicycle trip next year. I am 6' 1\" and 220 lbs, I had plenty of room for me and some gear. You can't sit up in it but that is not what it is made for. Worth the money, enjoy!...(several months later). I have used this tent on a lot of trips and have found it to be excellent. It keeps the moister out, I do my camping near the ocean so this is important. It also goes back in it's pack easily.",

It handles wind and rain with no issues and does a surprising job keep the warm air in the tent but allowing for good air exchange. I wish the including a loop at the top to hang a glow stick at night. Other than that... you are crazy to buy anything else if you are on the extreme side of the being in the outdoors.",
