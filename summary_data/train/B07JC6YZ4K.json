You can probably hook it up to an old tube tv if you wanted to! I can't complain. The remote could be updated though.",

This is very annoying, because I do not want to have a high sound volume when I am alone. Thus, the speaker stops in every a couple of minutes. You must tune the volume again to retrieve the sound. The supporter webpage provides a firmware to tune this feature off. However, I tried multiple times to install and remove it following the instruction. It never worked. I eventually had to return it. The seller refunded me but the product wasted a lot of my time.",

For 80 bucks i wasnt expecting anything crazy, but in terms of quality, i was let down by a brand i knew well. Is it intolerable? No, not really, once i put it in place and i usually only use it for gaming so i barely notice it. For the 80 bucks, invest it in a slightly more expensive model or brand.",

I can fix this feedback by unplugging the power cable then it works fine. I tried changing the cable with two different cables and end up with the same feedback. The rest of my cables on the computer are shielded so I am not sure where it is coming from.",

The only issue I have, which is a pretty big issue to me, is the ERP regulations regarding its settings. The sound literally mutes when It does not detect enough transmittal. Its not within minutes of detection, its seconds. So watching a video with minor peaks and valleys in the amount of sound being produced you will constantly hear the cutoff. If you watch or listen to anything at high volume you wont notice. But I like watching and listening with it attached to my computer and not at a level my neighbors can also listen too.",

      "text": "I purchased the Creative Stage Air Portable and Compact Under-Monitor USB-Powered Soundbar for Computer, with Dual-Driver to be used as under monitor speakers hardwired. They work great. I plug in the headphone adapter and USB (fro power) from monitor to speakers. I had to update the firmware so that my speakers wouldn't turn off after 15 minutes, but a simple download from Creative.com put onto a USB flash drive and it updated easily. Now it shuts off after 6 hours. Perfect!",

Don't try to email customer support. Set up solely for non-US citizens. 5. Customer chat offline. 6. Do not recommend for TV or monitor. Only small incremental improvement in sound quality. Returning unit to Amazon for refund.",

The hiss is SO LOUD on this thing its disgusting, you know its on! And last but not least the IR remote actually mixed signals with my RGB LEDS and every time i change the volume up or down my LEDS change! This unit is a total waste of time and money.",
