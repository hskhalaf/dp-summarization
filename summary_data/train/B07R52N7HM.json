My SmartTV, which would frequently choke on starting OnDemand programs (usually from iPlayer) is now smooth as butter. Everything is more snappy and fast, and this product gets the thumbs up from my wife who is normally unfazed by technical things. Very impressed!",

I purchased a second one to use as an access point in the mancave. All is working superbly! Tip. Turn mimo on. Turn Qos off if you want full speed everywhere, on if internet fluctuates too much and if using more than one make sure ssid and password is the same on both.",

The instructions assume that you are using it as the main router but when it is an access point, extending an existing network, it gets a different IP address. Once the tether app showed me what that was, I could configure from the app or the browser interface. Works fine - getting perfect signal and 200 mbs to internet which is limited by the broadband supplier.",

After I hooked this up my pc gets 240 mbps and my phone gets a shocking 220 mbps via wifi and thats an amazing difference. Also parental controls are great. I love this thing.",

Whilst the build is light and plasticy the unit looks good and fairly solid and as long as it's mounted in a safe place I wouldn't worry about being broken. Great choice, would recommend!
