For instance, I was able to put together a heavy duty office chair a bit faster using this hex key set than if I was using the in box wrench. I couldn't be happier with this purchase and the quality of Stanley products makes me believe this set will last me a lifetime.",

If you're looking to build your own basic set of tools (as I was) there are some homeowner's kits here that appear to be more cost effective than building your own set, and also come with a tool box/organizer.
