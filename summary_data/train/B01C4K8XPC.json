The XL was way too small for her, the fit was trrrible, and the tiny pieces of Velcro holding the pizza slice to the body suit were worthless. I had my other dog in a hot dog costume that lasted all night, while the pizza costume barely made it 20 minutes. Don\u2019t waste your money unless you only need it for a few minutes for pics. It also might do better on calm cats.",
