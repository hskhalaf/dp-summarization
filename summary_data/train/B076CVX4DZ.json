I took the thing inside and trying to program it 3 feet away from my router and no luck. I tried calling the iHome support and that was no help. I contacted them via email and as I leave this review (7 days later) I have not heard one thing. I would avoid this product and probably the rest of the iHome product.",

You might get a day or two of regular use out of them but then no response. I've had to go back to a manual outlet. Very frustrating. Save your money and look elsewhere.",
