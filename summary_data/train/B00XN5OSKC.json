It has very poor heel support with leather-like pieces not quite coming together, with a seam of heavy stitching holding the fabric together in the middle. It will literally rip the skin on your heel apart. I thought it might just be my tender heels (which they aren't) so I put on heavy bandages. Even with that, it ripped open new blood blisters on them. This goes down as a disaster in the history shoes in my book.",

My son is rough in shoes but for the amount of money I paid I would have expected them to last longer and not fall apart after a few weeks. My son has high arches and there wasn't great arch support so we had to buy gel insoles with better arch support. Pretty disappointed considering it's always been a good brand with a reputable product.",
