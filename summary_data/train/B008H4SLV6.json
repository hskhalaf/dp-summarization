I saw a video and she used frozen grapes. This does not even compare with what we had been using. Just love it....",

The prep and cleaning time went from 1-2 hours to only 10 minutes. The taste is actually much sweeter than juicing. The consistency is smooth like chocolate milk.

I put handfuls of frozen fruit and vegetables in the vitamix and the blender easily blends them into a smooth drink. No chunks. No bits of fruit or veggies left over. Pure liquid. I will say that one time my vitamix did overheat because I put too many frozen vegetables in it. However, after thirty minutes it cooled off and is now working fine. The shut off automatic mechanism in the blender is very helpful if it gets overheated. Overall, I love my vitamix and recommend it to anyone who makes smoothies or juices regularly.",

But you won\u2019t just find us in restaurant kitchens. You\u2019ll also find us in home kitchens around the world. Because whether you\u2019re interested in the culinary arts, making healthier choices, or enjoying restaurant-quality smoothies at home\u2014when you\u2019re ready to move on and move up, when you\u2019re ready to invest in your passion, you\u2019re ready for Vitamix.\n\nBuilt to Last\nA bargain blender's not a bargain if it doesn't last. We know purchasing a Vitamix blender is an investment. But Vitamix blenders are built to last, helping you buy dependable, not disposable.\n\nEasy to Clean\nJust blend warm water and a drop of dish soap at your machine's highest speed, and watch it self-clean in 60 seconds or less - no disassembly required.\n\nThe Difference Is in the Blend\nSince the number-one reason people purchase a blender is to make smoothies, it\u2019s important to get them right. Whether you prefer an icy blend or a perfectly smooth pur\u00e9e, nutrition-packed with veggies or a light, fruity treat, Vitamix smoothies give you a delicious, even blend in every sip. \n\nPower\nWe don\u2019t aim to have the highest horsepower. You don\u2019t need more horses; you need trained ones. The focused power of our complete blending system causes every component of the Vitamix machine to work together, creating faster, smoother blends packed with flavor. \n\nThe Universal Tool\nMake smoothies & juices, hot soups, flours & dough, nut butter, frozen desserts, batters, dressings & sauces, non-dairy milks, and more. \n\nManufactured in Cleveland, Ohio USA \n\nTroubleshooting All Vitamix Blenders include thermal sensors designed to shut the unit off when overheating. When this occurs, turn the power off for up to 45 minutes, allowing the blender to cool down or reset. Always check your speed: Vitamix blenders perform best on High speed to pulverize food and process thick mixture. Check the quantity and density of your blend. Follow the order of ingredients. Use the Tamper. When in doubt, refer to your owner\u2019s manual for tips or visit the Vitamix homepage for techniques videos.\u201dHP: 2-peak.",
