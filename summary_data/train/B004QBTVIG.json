The buttons tend to be stuck and hard to push. When going up the hill there would be a straining sound on the metal rail. I would giv it 4 because of its difficulty with the buttons",

They learned and adapted to the motion needed to let it move forward without any problems. They prefer it over the standard scooter. Highly recommended.",

I would strongly suggest wearing a helmet and pads for smaller kids.",
