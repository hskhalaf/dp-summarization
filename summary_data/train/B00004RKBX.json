It's very inconvenient but I could not carry a ladder home with my sedan. Eventually I found out this and brought it home through Amazon. It is reasonable strong for my weight (160 lb), but might be somewhat not sturdy enough for a 200 lb guy as it claimed. I had been use it for few years, and felt it's a good time to write a review for its durability. Nice to have one for any home.",

It is rated for 200 lbs, I am 175 and I did not feel any give at all in the ladder. Nicely constructed and made of aluminum, not too bad to move around.

In reality I would probably give this ladder a 3 or 4 star review because I don't think you should buy a 200lb capacity ladder. To me 250lb is the minimum with 300lb preferred.",
