I\u2019ve installed shower heads before so it wasn\u2019t hard - but no matter what it leaks water when it\u2019s on. After the 4th try I even tried to tighten with a wrench and cloth so it wouldn\u2019t damage the finish - still leaking. The concept is great, and it will definitely reach even my dogs feet, as long as I can get a non leaky one. I will return it for a replacement and hope that one works so I can modify my review.",

I wanted to let others know because I saw at least 2 other people who had made the mistake I did. Obviously the company cares about its feedback because they contacted me right away.",

Even tough the shower head part is plastic, it seems to be pretty durable. It came with plumbers tape which made the hubby happy. The only thing keeping from giving it 5 stars, is that is does cut the water pressure to my current shower head a little. Not a HUGE difference, but it\u2019s def not as strong.
