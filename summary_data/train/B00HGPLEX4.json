This makes it impossible to use. There are MANY reviews sharing this same issue so I know it's not just my unit. Spend your money elsewhere. UPDATE I decided to try to get mine working so I wouldn't have to go through returning and buying something else. I pulled the foam off, sanded the powder coat and used plasti-dip to coat each handle. This works great.",
