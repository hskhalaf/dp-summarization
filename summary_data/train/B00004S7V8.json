Both the rubber bottom and sheath were listed in the feature details so I'm sending this back. It might be counterfeit to the microplane brand.",

I imagine you can use this to grate nutmeg, ginger, and create chocolate shavings.",

These graters are a billion times better than any other brand. They use a special manufacturing process that etches the holes in the blade rather than punching them, which leads to a stronger, sharper edge. The result? This thing will breeze through difficult to grate items with almost no effort. I use mine mostly for parmigiana cheese and whole nutmeg, but I have also found it incredibly useful for grating those fibrous ginger roots.",

This keeps all the zest inside the grater until you are ready to empty.

Zest adds flavor to vinaigrettes, stir fries, salads, and baked goods! Grate Cheese: Grate parmesan into fluffy mounds that melt quickly and look beautiful when treating yourself of family to rustic bowls of pasta. Sprinkle fresh parmesan over eggs, salads, or any dish for a burst of flavor. Surgical Grade Stainless Steel: this material stays rust-free and maintains sharpness over time. True stainless steel is magnetic, so this item can be hung on your magnetic knife strip. Dishwasher Safe: The tool is easy to clean, simply rinse immediately after use. Use a kitchen brush on the underside of the blade to clean out tough to reach particles. The zester/grater can also be placed in the dishwasher. This tool is normally used to grate citrus for perfect lemon, lime, and orange zests or to create pillowy mounds of Parmesan cheese. Microplane Premium Classic Zester Graters A versatile must-have tool for the kitchen! This tool is normally used to grate citrus for perfect lemon, lime, and orange zests or to create pillowy mounds of parmesan cheese. However, it is also a great tool for grating spices like nutmeg, cinnamon, and even chilies into fresh ground powders. If your dish requires fresh grated ginger or garlic, this tool will do that job as well. Customers have let us know that they even use this tool to remove burnt edges from cookies and bread. What will you use it for? What is the difference between Original Classic and Premium Classic? The Premium Classic Zester Grater by Microplane provides a soft touch handle, instead of hard plastic. In addition this line provides a choice of handle colors. You can expect the same grating or zesting experience with either tool. Why is Sharper Better? Food is grated or zested without ripping or tearing which improves the look of the final dish Food is grated or zested without bruising which improves flavor and aroma Less pressure is required while grating - making the task faster and more efficient What makes Microplane so sharp? Microplane Blade Enlarged 50x View larger Do Chef's use Microplane? The Microplane is the standard for sharp, efficient grating and zesting in both home and professional kitchens - just ask any chef if they use a Microplane! Dining out anywhere will usually lead to a Microplane sighting. Photo-etching and surgical grade stainless steel Microplane began using this signature technology in the 1990's. Most tools use stamped or cut metal. Photo-etching creates a much finer point, which means your Microplane digs in and performs better.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nFor fluffy, evenly sized cheese shreds, this is the perfect grater. Its design is based on that of a rasp, the small and efficient woodworking tool. The cutters are especially sharp, which guarantees easy grating. But this also means you'll need to exercise extra caution--no one likes grated knuckles. The large handle allows for a firm grip, and the completely flat grating surface makes it easy to move the cheese across the blades. Carrots, onions, and medium to firm cheeses all worked beautifully with this grater. It's also an excellent choice for larger strips of citrus zest or ginger. --Jill Lightner",
