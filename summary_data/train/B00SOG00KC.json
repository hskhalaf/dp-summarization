One of the smaller swords would not turn on and It took a couple of whacks in my palm to get it to work (don\u2019t judge). The buttons for those smaller swords are incredibly flimsy and cheap feeling, like a dollar store find. I wouldn\u2019t buy this again and I won\u2019t buy any add ons for it but my son does love it and is entertained for a long time with it.",

Only downfall is that it does take a lot of batteries (but what doesn't now a days!). Overall, great product and my nephew was very happy with it.",
