Getting back to Ohio after changing the blown tire, I took a look at the tire that held and cannot believe that I made it back to Ohio without having to change the other tire. Outstanding RV tires.",

HIGH QUALITY - DURABLE - - LIVE UP TO REPUTATION OF COMPANY. Recommend immediate replacement of any OEM CB tire on an RV trailer before you have $2000 damage or more from a blown tire, not to mention that accident from blown tires is VERY HIGHLY LIKELY TO OCCUR!!!!",
