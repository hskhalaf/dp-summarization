Shown above was my original review. The vendor emailed me to point out that THERE IS A FORWARD AND REVERSE function in this device. It's a little tricky, but it is functional. Therefore, I changed my two-star rating to FOUR STAR rating.",

Audio quality is excellent. Use of controls requires practice as several buttons have multiple functions depending on what you are trying to do. Keep the manual handy for reference until you become familiar with the sequences you are using. For the price, this unit has quality far above other units I have and nice small size with excellent batter life. Highly recommend this unit for purchase.",

Great little recorder if you don't have the need for it to run for hours or need instant feedback. I have had for almost a year and will continue to use.",

Long battery life on Dictapro, no batteries to worry about as it plugs into computer via usb port. It charges as it works. When you pair it wuth Dragon, you export your voice recordings into Dragon, it converts to text, you're able to edit your work with lightning speed. It has vox as well as manual on/off. Lots of neat features. Excellent gift for students.",

My one complaint is that I do not find it easy to play, stop, fast forward, etc on the recorder itself. I usually transfer the wav file (super easy) to my pc and listen/navigate through Windows Media Player. Other than that, I have found the battery life and other features to perform quite well.",

I recorded it in the mp3 format that was recommended. I received a message from the seller asking me how did i like it. I explained it to him and all he could offer was a generic email to do a reset to possibly fix the problem. There is a learning curve to use. So disappointed",

It will run correctly and save when I stop the recording, but when I go to listen to the file it says it is an unsupported file system, even though I haven't altered it from the device and it is in a supported WAV format. It's also not very responsive when I try to play directly from the device. Overall, a very annoying product.",
