Wife wanted more minimal look in the place and we dont need the full woopty beat anymore with young human spawns destroying our life. The sound bar is 99% used for dora, daniel tiger, and lots of other animateds, but sometimes when i have the house to myself i liek to drugs and alcohol super hardly and pretend my life is awesome with loud rap music (also im hella gangster in my pretend awesome life). This speaker helps facilitate thug life success almost as gangsterly as my 5.1 system. Hits pretty hard for the small package.",

With the Vizio, we found ourselves turning up the volume because we had trouble understanding the dialogue. I have Kilpsch speakers and subwoofers in 3 different rooms and decided to give one of their soundbars a chance. It was such a major difference that even my wife commented on the difference. Normally, she just smiles and nods when I change out speakers and such but she really noticed a difference with this. Sounds great with TV shows, movies and with music. The bluetooth connection for music really works good.",

The pictograms do not clearly show how long (a few minutes) one must wait for the bar and woofer to link. After the link with the woofer is completed it is best to turn the system off and back on again before continuing with the device pairing. Subsequent device pairing has been flawless so far.",

When played louder the quality is just as strong as well. The only down fall is the lack of indication of where the volume is set to. You have to listen and decide if you want it louder or quieter without knowing how far you have to choose from.",

      "text": "Pros: Easy to setup, Sounds perfect when working, Enough bass for movies and sports, Price, Bluetooth, Loud. Cons: Subwoofer, Cheap small remote control broke in 2 months, Soundbar would randomly turn off when scrolling through apps on the Roku, Apple TV and Xbox one- to the point it was annoying and that's what gave me the desire to return it. Overall I would only recommend it if you do not mind turning the sounbar on constantly after scrolling through apps, (i.e. Going between Netflix, Hulo, HBO go and movies in those apps). If you do purchase I highly recommend you purchase insurance for it and a universal remote control. May you have better luck!",

I tried it out last night worked fine on the test run for a few minutes then went to use it today and turns on but will turn off by itself after a minute. Will be getting my money back for this P.O.S.",

      "text": "This product is not worth the 200 dollars I paid for it on Black Friday. It has absolutely no mid range sound. You get some bass and all of the top range of music and TV shows but things like the melody of songs are almost mute. I have a plug in speaker that cost me 30 dollars from Altec that is louder and clearer in sound with exception to the bass from the provided sub woofer which is sub par at best. I had this out of the box and plugged in for about 10 minutes before it was back in the box and ready to be returned. Don't waste your time, or money at any price point.",
