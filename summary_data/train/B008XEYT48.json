The removable audio cable is a nice touch, and the customization options available are awesome. But the killer feature is the adjustable bass port, and that's what really makes these stand out. Worth checking out, for sure! Enjoy the video! PS - You should totally subscribe to the MKBHD YouTube channel ;)",

      "text": "These headphones are probably the best headphones I've ever bought. With the adjustable base ports, you can quickly adjust how much base you want to tailor to the type of audio you're listening to. The amazing thing is, because its opening physical air ports, the base doesn't sound muddy or distorted as you increase it, it just gets louder, all the way open will produce head-rattling base. The only downside to these headphones is that they have a lot of clamping pressure, even with stretching them out and adjusting the sliders. Tragically, I ended up selling these to a friend because I get headaches from the external pressure, so keep that in mind if you also have this problem.",

The option to increase the bass is the reason I decided on this pair of Beyerdynamics after deciding I wanted this brand and it was a great decision. I am a drum student and the increased bass settings help to hear what is going on in a song with the drums. The clarity and setting options have me spoiled and I'm loving it! I'm hearing things in songs that I've listened to for years that I hadn't heard before. Would have never guessed that I could have become more excited about music then I was before these headphones, but that's exactly what happened!",

You have to remove the casing (it just threads off) on the end of the cord to get it to work with what Beyerdynamic tried to make as a proprietary fitting at the headphones, forcing you to buy their more expensive cable.",

They are made in Germany, not China, the latter being the origin of stink bugs and most consumer electronics. Music sounds great, and these headphones add a sense of immediacy to the spoken word (audiobooks). I really have enjoyed them so far. My search is over.",

Having read the reviews on Amazon and done other research I opted for these headphones. I expected exceptional performance from them but was disappointed to get a poorly balenced soundstage and a bass that was far too dominant on even the lowest setting. I found them totally unsuited to the music I listen to - rock and acoustic. They are also extremely uncomfortable to wear with a tight fit that pinched my earlobes. I have sent them back to Amazon and ordered a trusty pair of Sennheisers instead.",

The massive headphones perfectly seal so they keep any disturbing noise outside. What's even better is that you don't disturb your environment as virtually no sound escapes. I like the removable parts that really give you the freedom to customise your headphones to your individual needs. GO FOR IT!!! :)",
