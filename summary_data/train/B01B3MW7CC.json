Projecting on the house, etc. We all remarked that this was the best set-up yet for us. We have found this to be very good overall. One thing we don't really like is that we frequently notice the projector light from the rear projection. I guess that's unavoidable, maybe. We like this product overall and would buy it again. We are concerned about tears forming in the fabric...they provide back-up patches which tells me this must happen enough for them to provide it. We shall see.",

We have a small home theater in our bonus room, so we wanted something really big to justify not watching indoors in comfy chairs. This screen made the fact that we're watching football at home instead of in a stadium a little better, and it was the centerpiece of a great night with friends.",

The blower (though isnt loud) is too loud for most projectors 2-8 watt speaker. This can be fixed by adding speakers. Ive used mine kn the wind without the tiedowns it comes with and t holds up.

The only nit is that the manufacturer does not give the screen size - just the 16' diagonal of the entire unit. Still it takes a 16:9 screen image. Enjoy!",
