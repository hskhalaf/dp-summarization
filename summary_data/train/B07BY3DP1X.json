This litter box definitely solved the problems with thrown litter. She likes it better than her old box. She seems to enjoy her privacy. If she wants to play, she jumps on and off hood. I would definitely recommend this litter box and would definitely purchase again. It is very well-made so it should last a long time.",

Also, the plastic snaps break easily and the swing plastic odor trap can get stuck and trap the kitties inside so I remove mine.",

It does clean easily, and it helps keep the smell down a little from what we were used to. All around its just alright. Again, the locks suck.",
