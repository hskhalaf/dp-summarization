It is extremely fast and no more buffering issues. Certainly pricier than other options, but well worth saving up your pennies to get this!",

      "text": "I have several streaming devices and to tell the truth this one provides the best picture of any of them. I have a 4K tv and it looks great. And now that Apple has opened up to some apps of other providers, this is my go to streaming device. The only thing I would ding it on is the remote. In Apple quest to be streamline, and I\u2019d say minimalistic on the function of there devices, you lose some functionality. It does everything you need it to do, it not always easy doing it. If you want great picture and sound quality then this is the one to use, as long as your okay with the remote.",

As with all Apple products the setup is as smooth as it gets, the video quality is amazing and beats the FireTV easily. But I returned it because the remote is too complicated to use. The touchpad just sucks, it makes it difficult to navigate in the menu, sometimes you press the touchpad accidentally and end up in a different menu or start a movie you don't want to watch. This is not what I'm expecting from an easy-to-use and intuitive product. The remote takes away all the fun and benefits that come with the AppleTV.",
