I usually keep whiskey in it for no more than 3 days at a time. I haven't noticed any change in taste. Afterwards, I empty it out and flush with white vinegar and warm distilled water, then dry upside down. Just as a test, I flush it one more time with distilled water and pour it into a cup to check for particles. So far, so good! It's well worth the money to drink clean, uncontaminated spirits.",

He lost the tiny funnel from the first one so having the top attached and the funnel has made it so much easier to use, keep with him, and enjoy.",
