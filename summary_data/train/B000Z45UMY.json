As far as sanding, it does an excellent job, you just let the sander do the job and guide it. don't need to put pressure on it as it is heavy enough to sand. One of the best tools I own.",

It did not take long before we were unhappy with both of them (belts didn't track well or tended to catch and shred; sanders didn't collect dust well, etc. It is already obvious the Hitachi surpasses their performances.",

This is my third belt sander purchase this year, the first two were less than $100 sanders and a waste of money. I finally decided to invest some money and glad I did. This sander cut my sanding time in half, does not easyt the belts like the cheaper sanders and actually puts the sawdust in the bag. Wow what a change. I used to get covered in sawdust and never had to empty the bags. Not anymore. This is a great sander - buy it.",

      "text": "I went through a lot of reviews and went with this. I have no idea where other users have a problem with it \"digging in on the motor side\". I don't think they've ever used a belt sander before. Never have I seen nearly no dust and this felt light and super easy to use. The window to watch the belt I have no use for. The only thing I wish they did differently was put the belt control knob where I could see it. Not much for reaching under where I can't see when it's running. Time will be the biggest factor on how long it lasts. The prior Craftsman went forever til I let my GF use it.",

    "description": "Style:Hitachi SB8V2Hitachi SB8V2 9-Amp Variable Speed Belt Sander, 3-Inch by 21-Inch.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe Hitachi SB8V2 9-Amp Variable Speed Belt Sander features a powerful 9.0-Amp (1,020-Watt) motor for the toughest material removal applications with a no-load speed of 820 to 1,475-feet per minute. Ideal for wood, steel and paint removal, the SB8V2's service life is 2-times longer than standard belt sanders thanks to a wear-resistant V-belt. Corner sanding is improved because the dust bag is now located on the left side of the tool and the main body is flush with the belt pulley on the right. Other upgraded features include a variable speed dial, clear front cover and soft elastomer covered grip on both the main and sub handles. A dust collection bag reduces airborne particles and keeps the work area clean. The Hitachi SB8V2 9-Amp Variable Speed Belt Sander is warranted to the original purchaser to be free from defect in materials and workmanship for a period of 5-years from the original purchase date. Hitachi Power Tools (Hitachi Koki USA, Ltd.) provides professional-grade power tools for a variety of applications, including woodwork, metalwork, concrete, drilling, cutting and fastening. Since its inception, Hitachi has pioneered innovative technologies that have improved the quality of craftsmanship worldwide.
