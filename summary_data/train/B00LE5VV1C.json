I'm talking about jewelry store sized tags - won't do it. So while it would be fine for larger codes, it is useless to me. Edit: I hate when people leave bad reviews when there are circumstances in which the product performs well. Because of this, I am changing my review from 1 star to 3 stars. On our larger shipping boxes it works well, it just doesn't work for jewelry price tag sizes bar codes.",

I'm using the scanner for several home projects where scanning item barcodes was a central element. The scanner needed to be versatile and work with my PC and Android tablet. The WN3300 works in all accounts and my projects have been moving forward. Due to my clumsiness I damaged a component and emailed tech support. They responded in a timely manner and arranged for me to obtain the part I damaged. In addition to great components there is also great service supporting the customer. Totally satisfied with WN3300 and the support.",
