First of all, it's very runny. (Yes, I kneaded the package first). I guess I thought it would be a thicker consistency like peanut butter or almond butter. It's not. Second, there are tiny bits of macadamia nut that you will never get to unless you cut the package open. They stay stuck at the bottom! The taste is just ok to me. So, I will finish the ones I bought, but I will not be re-ordering. I guess I'll just stick with whole macadamia nuts.",

I can but almond or some other nut butter for around $7.00 for a 10 oz. jar and scoop a tablespoon or so into a small container. Not impressed by this product. Sorry Charlie",

Keep in mind nut butter experiences phase separation, so oil squirts out when you first open package. The remaining nut butter is so thick that it will take you multiple, frustrating squeeze attempts to get 80% of the remaining product out, leaving you 20% stuck unless you completely rip apart the package and lick off the remnants. This is very different than the goop I used for carbo loading during runs. You're far better off getting a container is almond butter from Costco and sugar free chocolate from Trader Joe's",

If you don't take the time to knead it before opening it, then you're going to end up with a partial liquid/partial chunky product. Other than that required action, which I don't think is a big deal, the packets are perfect, and they have made keto much easier for me to follow successfully.",

I tried kneading them first and then putting them in the fridge to harden up a bit and that worked okay, but the whole point of these is that you're supposed to be able to throw them in your briefcase or backpack or purse for an easy on-the-go snack -- so refrigeration isn't practical.
