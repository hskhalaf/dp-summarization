I can now just plug this little guy into my 12v car outlet and I\u2019m good to go! The power in this vacuum is as good as it\u2019s going to get for a car vacuum so if you want extreme suction - buy a shop vac. Also the attachments are fantastic. P.s. I own 3 dogs- it picks up hair. The spots with sand in the picture are not vacuumed over yet to compare.",

Does not have a regular plug - plugs into lighter outlet in your car, which could be handy for some. The only thing I found this good for was to reach in between front seat and console. But, like, I said, it only picks up very small pieces.",

I tried the vacuum both not starting the engine and starting the engine during operation. When not starting the engine suction is very lackluster, however when the engine is started proper voltage is transferred to the vacuum resulting in a robust suction; probably more than double the suction power.

Used it again last week, it totally drained my battery again, shorted out the cigarette outlet it was plugged into and blew a fuse in the panel. Had to take it to the dealer to these things replaced. And I had to replace my battery for $150. So this vacuum cost Me quite a bit of money and quite a bit grief. The mechanic said it was drawing too many amps.",

I didn't expect much as far as the fur pickup, but I was pretty disappointed, this vacuum could barely pick up small granules of sand. There is still plenty of fur left in my car. The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because the attachments actually get into the small nooks and cranny's. Though it doesn't pick up much. Wish I hadn't wasted $40 on this.",

Also the directions say not to use longer than 10 min before giving it a break. I switched over to my house vacuum to do the first round after using an upholstery brush to loosen the hair. I did a second round with this vacuum to get into the cracks and crevices my household vacuum could not reach. Overall I thought it was a big help with detailing but not strong enough to tackle the car alone for pet hair.",

I love having a vac which plugs in to the vehicle lighter plug so I can use it anywhere. This Worx TWC-01 has ample suction power and feels well made. It is light enough to complete a full cleaning of our Expedition EL. My previous vac did not have removable filters so this feature is a huge plus. Hoping the filter replacement cost is reasonable.I am very happy I came across this vacuum.",

If your car gets DESTROYED on a weekly basis, use a Shopvac. Not this, it's not meant for that. It's also orange and black, which matches my Bolt perfectly and was a nice touch.

Emptied out the filter area twice and cleaned the paper filter after. Was thrilled and amazed at what this thing picked up. You can keep this in the trunk or in the closet. All the tools you'll need.
