The sticks are very easy to use- all of the kids could extend them to a length they were comfortable with near the fire, and the ends are blunt enough that I didn't have to worry about accident stabbings. Cleanup was super easy, just pulled silicone grips off and threw them in the dishwasher. No gooey marshmallow residue at all. Have used them several times so far and they still look new. Great product.",

Cons: The hot dogs did not stay on the skewers. As the hot dogs roasted and shrunk, they repeatedly popped off and dropped into the campfire. We had more success roasting marshmallows. One of the skewers in my set did not have pointed tips. Instead the metal ends were blunt. Also, one of the skewers came apart the first time we extended it, but we were able to figure out how to put it back together.",

My only real issue with them is the configuration of the two tines. They are bent outward so it is very difficult to spear a hotdog on it. Marshmallows are fine, since you do one on each tine. But I think I'll be bending them closer together to make it easier to poke a weenie on it. A few have complained about the holding bag. It is kind of cheaply made, but ours seems fine (for now).",
