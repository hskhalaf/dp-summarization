Just a word of warning: if you don' have it over an open flame it will simply take too long to cook. Otherwise, I had no issues with it, other than as others have noted it would be nice if the \"food tray\" had some small handles to make it easier to remove. Also, it will get charred and grease smeared right away and there's nothing you can do about it. I would just live with that, though. No big deal",

It'/s slightly larger than the opening of the side burner but a piece of 1/4\" metal under three spots on the grate make the grate flush with the sides and a perfect solid fit. It works well and I will probably use it inside during the cold winter months. I have a wood shop and a planer and an assortment of hardwoods so I can run something through my planer and make my own fine chips. Also going to try buzzing some normal size chips in this mini food processor that I have.",
