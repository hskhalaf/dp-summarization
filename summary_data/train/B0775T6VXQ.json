It saves me a lot of time and makes it possible to use the paper toweling as a cage floor cover at least twice as long. Caterpillar frass (poop) is pellet-like and dry so the vacuum is perfect for it. The small size, suction, and the cordless feature make it easy to get into the cages (15 x 15 x 15 and some larger). I am amazed that it holds a charge for so long, at least a week in my experience. If you are raising caterpillars to save the Monarch Butterflies, consider this.",

I was not expecting much since it was only 20 bucks but this thing should be sold for 5 bucks as gag gift. If you use the precise attachment and hold it onto your skin it won't even leave a suction mark. It failed to suck up cat hair or the dust in my keyboard. It can't even lift a light plastic sandwich bag or one square of tissue paper. Save your 20 bucks and buy air duster and lint rollers.",

      "text": "The vacuum surprisingly picks up more than what I would expect... The soft sweeping nozzle is very useful. However, the gel is not as effective, mainly because I cannot use it to do deep clean after I take the keycaps for all my keys. The gel is not cohesive enough to stick together to itself more than my laptop, so it's easy to leave remnants of the gell on your inner keyboards, without the caps on. Regardless though, I still like the gel very much. It is not suggested, be cautious, to be used with mechanical keyboards with caps taken off!",

The filters are reusable so all you have to do it flush the dust off with water and let it dry until you need it again. When you run low on batteries you can recharge it with any micro usb, as long as its plugged into power.",

One twist and the tank is easily emptied over the garden wall. Very pleased with the purchase.",
