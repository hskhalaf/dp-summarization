It was rhen that I found out two problems with this company (Roku):1- it is virtually impossible to have direct and personal contact, though I could with HULU and 2-, through HULU, I was informed the Roku model I own has been discontinued and that was at the root of my original HULU problem. Hence I Am stuck needing a new device and still being charged a monthly fee by Roku. HULU CREDITED ME A MONTH\u2019s fee!",

If I remove my cable box cord and plug into the yellow input, then it is in color, but no volume. I'll have to figure this out.",

I bought this for a smaller TV so I am not hugely disappointed. This is my first Roku so I am not sure if the other versions are equally slow. Anyway, it's OK.

My cable doesn't provide anything better than 720p or 1080i, so I'm not sure why consumers need anything with a higher resolution or performance. I also have a Roku 2, and the Roku LT is just as good. Try a Roku LT, I think you'll like it,",
