I first purchased a large after measuring my dog's neck at 14\" but reading another review that said the mediums were extremely small. The large was so big even on the tightest hole it could be pulled off. So I then ordered the medium, thinking that it would fit him since it's 16.\" However that one is too small and the size difference between the two is huge. (I included pictures). While I think this is a great product, it's not going to work for me.",

The rolled leather is needed for his thick coat. Holds up nicely. So far a bit of moisture does not create bleeding from leather which indicates it was tanned and dyed correctly. Will buy again once this one wears out (which may be several years).",

My only concern is the loop that a leash should clip to is not very strong. Our first collar actually broke while his collar was attached to the loop (he's little but strong). I was sent a new one right away at no charge and now we just clip his leash to the collar itself instead, which is just as easy. Overall this is a great collar and my Rocco is much happier without some bulky collar around his adorable little neck.",
