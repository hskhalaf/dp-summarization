The blade is so dull, you might as well use a butter knife. It says self sharpening, but it doesn\u2019t work and every time you pull the blade out, you have to wipe off metal dust before you can use it.",

It's got a nice sharp blade (and I mean sharp, I was rinsing it and accidentally cut my finger pushing some tomato seeds off--totally my fault, of course), and the handle is a good shape and size. I can't speak to the sharpener case yet, though I haven't noticed any dulling of the blade, so maybe it is working? If not, knives are easy enough to sharpen, but since the knife is so sharp, it's a good thing to use when putting in the drawer so that no one accidentally cuts themselves reaching for something near it. I would buy this paring knife again if I hadn't already.",

It is amazing going from dull knives to sharp ones. They cut through a tomato without squishing it. Slides through the fat and gristle in meat. I am 100% satisfied after 2 months of use. Oh Yeah, did I mention I cook dinner at home approximately 350 days a year?",
