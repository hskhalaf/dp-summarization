However, during the very next set a minute later the other handle broke. I now use the rope by itself without the handles, which actually isn't terrible. However, it is clear that the quality of this jump rope is subpar, to say the least.",

It's also extremely long and hits your feet every time you try to jump. Got to the point where it slowed down my workout and just threw it away.

Update after one month minimal use: lost one of the screws that holds the rope with the handle two weeks ago. I tried to find a replacement crew, but it's difficult to fit well. As a result, it basically become useless now",

When you hold the rope in 2 hands, it no longer forms a nice U shape. Rather is forms a U shape with a kink. Therefore, I end up whipping myself when doing double unders. The whip marks make you look bad ass, but they really hurt. Overall, this is a reasonably priced rope great for beginners.",

Cutting it was tricky, I had to pester 3 different people before someone could score me something strong enough to cut through it. Cutting it is also permanent.. So folks don't make the same mistake I did - I cut it like.. an inch to short and now I can't use it at all.",
