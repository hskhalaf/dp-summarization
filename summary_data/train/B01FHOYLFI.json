But it is quite large so I\u2019m sure it would fit over a king size bed just as well. My bed is a full size. I also included the size of hole it leaves if you end up moving it. If you\u2019re installing alone, I recommend screwing the piece in just a tad and hanging the canopy to see if it\u2019s the right place before screwing it in all of the way.",

Their nets are the nicest I've seen -- and having lived in Asia for many years I have seen many nets. The silky fabric around the bottom allows me to tuck in the net so it doesn't blow in the wind.The 2 openings means its easy to get in and out. It looks great and provides an air of mystery to my South East Asian themed outdoor area. When I get everything finished, I'll send a picture.",
