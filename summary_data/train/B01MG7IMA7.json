But this fits really well there is little flaps for your side view mirrors and a strap to hold the cover together from the bottom. There's also little reflectors on it so it's has more visibility. The material feels very sturdy. I've bought other car covers in the past and they were really thin and eventually ripped. Overall a really great car cover it's going to help me Preserve my car wash.",

It comes with two securing straps underneath which will keep it from lifting off in the wind, I wish they made the straps a little bit more durable but they accomplish the job.
