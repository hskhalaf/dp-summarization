At the price, and after reading some reviews, I purchased. Glad I did! Phone in case fits snugly! The home button of the phone sits a little higher than the cutout on the front of the band, but it hasn't been an issue. Very pleased and would buy again.",

I admittedly use this band 4-6 times a week, I sweat A LOT, and it's even been with me through some pretty heavy rain storms, so I guess that's to be expected. As I mentioned before, this is still my favorite armband, and it was worth it to me to invest in a second.",

I\u2019m a runner & had none of the issues I\u2019ve had with other brands. The armband is comfortable, did a great job with its moisture wicking capabilities in today\u2019s 93 degrees I ran in and I had zero issues navigating my screen through the case, a big issue with other brands I\u2019ve had. I have an I-phone 8 and it fits very well, no bouncing around.",

My house key is secure in the key compartment, and won't fall out. Cons: After several months of wear, the nylon has completely separated from the neoprene on the top flap (see picture). It's starting to peel away on a second area. It's awkward to adjust the band one-handed, so I've ended up leaving it at the correct size and pulling it on and off my arm. My sweat gets wicked inside the armband where my phone sits, resulting in a very sweaty phone.",

I only see this problem growing worse with any amount of sweat on my fingers. I'm not impressed. I won't be using it. And I won't be returning either, because the shipping cost would outweigh the annoyance and hassle. Verdict: I think I'll stick with my FlipBelt for now.",

However, the sizing is perfect and the velcro closure is secure. While I use wireless earbuds, it's SO nice that there is a little flap that will keep your earbud wire contained. There's also a key pocket, but I haven't used that, either. Great color options, and I assume that this is machine washable. Would highly recommend, and would definitely purchase again!",

The only minor quibble I have is that sometimes it takes two tries to get my phone's touchscreen to respond but I can live with that. The real test will come when I stop long sleeves as it gets warmer. I tend to sweat a lot and it is pretty corrosive :). WIll the armband stands up to it.",
