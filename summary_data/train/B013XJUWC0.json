The feel is nothin close to the Beauty Blender. The size is also far too large. It's a little overwhelming on the face. It is okay at applying makeup but is most definitely not a good dupe to the Beauty Blender. Left is Beauty Blender, right is aesthetica sponge",

It's perfect if you are going for minimum coverage or want to build on your foundation. If you want straight full coverage, I would recommend using a blending brush vs sponge. Don't get me wrong, you can obtain full coverage with this but it would have to be built up, which is my preference. I like to control the amount of foundation applied.",

The foundation sits on the surface of the sponge without being totally absorbed by it. I\u2019m very satisfied with it.",

I would have areas where the foundation would clump up and would appear uneven. I have neither problem with this sponge applicator. I am happy to recommend this product.",

The shape when wet is a little different but I didn\u2019t mind. Would recommend 10/10. I did look on their website of the brand and they are more expensive there.",

So, I was very skeptical about trying a different sponge. However, I noticed a beauty influencer that I watch regularly on YouTube use this sponge and she had great success with it, so I thought, why not? Not only did this sponge out blend the other sponge I had been using, it is much more durable and cleans up so much better. I'll definitely be back for more - thanks for making such a great product!",

I also had to use 2 pumps instead of 1 and I still had less coverage. I'm pretty certain it sucked up a bunch of the foundation. Lastly, I think it sucked up my day cream, because I felt very dry all day. I am rating this two stars, leaning toward one. I think my cats would find greater use from this as a cat toy bopping it around the bathroom floor, but they would probably eat it.",

UPDATE: This most current sponge is a different material/feel than the previous ones from this company. They no longer break down into pieces like so many others have experienced with this product. I might even go as far as to say it\u2019s bigger in size!",
