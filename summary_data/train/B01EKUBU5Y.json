I put it all over my face--including my eyes--and I absolutely do see a difference in lines, firmness, texture, glow...all that stuff we talk about.

If the smell is due to its components in the serum, then I think they need to add some kind of fragrance to get rid of the smell.

TruSkin on the other hand worked wonders and proved itself as the best product for my skin. Customer support team is also doing a wonderful job responding very attentively to each and every email.

Week before my wedding I was stressed and breaking out, so I went back to the truskin serum and within days my face looked so much better! My wedding pictures looked great and I think truskin serum had something to do with that! \ud83d\ude00 Recommend a 100%! I hope to try more of their products!",
