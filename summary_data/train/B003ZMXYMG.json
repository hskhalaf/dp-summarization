The peanut butter Larabars are definitely my favorite, the taste is good and oddly, the texture is probably my favorite part of the bars. They're just fun to eat and brings back memories of the Before Times when I could pretty much eat anything I wanted without having to worry about my intestines rotting and my skin turning into what I can only describe as 'lizard-like'.",

This was an excellent purchase and I was worried about them being melted or as much as they could be because of the summer heat. They arrived just fine! I also want to say that I had 2 day shipping so if I ordered this again I would again get 2 day shipping instead of it being a week or more in shipping.",

I probably should've bought a single bar before I purchased a whole box.",

But, if I'm going to eat sugar, let's make is super yummy with super clean ingredients! Looking for a non-chocolate or non-peanut alternative? I also am a fan of pecan pie and the blueberry muffin flavor! Really, I don't know if I've ever had a Larabar flavor that disappoints!",
