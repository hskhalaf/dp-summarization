So if you've had any kind of back injury use with caution. I unfortunately had to return the product.",

I found the design to be sufficiently firm and not spongy or too squishy, but if you have a relatively weak, inflexible, or sensitive lower back there may be some temporary discomfort.

I find that when coming back up, that the abdominal mat keeps the cure of your lower back in place which then causes your tailbone to dig more into the floor.",
