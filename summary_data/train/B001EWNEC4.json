You can never be too safe, and the fact that she is a petite mom typically tending to two kids, made me purchase this for her safety. This was a replacement for the exact same Sabre model she's been carrying for the past few years. Im happy that she's never had to use it, and I'm even happier that before disposing of the old one I was able to test it and it still worked perfectly after many years! I rate this a perfect 5/5!

I do not know how well the actual pepper spray canister will fire, but the practice model is great because it allows you to get a better understanding of the how to use it. If you want to make sure you can respond appropriately in an emergency situation, it's good to practice before hand.",

Wouldn't that be just fabulous. But, I love that it is pink and can attached to my key chain. Just the chance of accidently spraying myself has me keeping it in my purse and not using it on my keychain.",

We haven't sprayed it yet to test as after reading some reviews the back fire or mist can still hit you we do not want to experience. But after reading the reviews I feel confidant that it will do as advertised.",

It would be great if it had a little more tension or something to block it just a little more. I swear I may set it of when I grab my keys one day.",

I keep mine in a cellphone sized pouch on the front-left strap of my school backpack (since firearms and knives are prohibited at most college campuses). The \"safety\" has stayed in place despite being moved in and out of pouches and the packaging. This likely means no chance of accidental spraying. On another note, I can confirm that CS gas is very effective. This is based on US Army gas mask training (which I was unfortunate enough to have to run through three times!).",
