Sadly, I don\u2019t know if the oil itself is good.....shipping preparation obviously isn\u2019t a priority. I\u2019m irritated about the mess and how my other items are now \u201chighly moisturized.\u201d Unless the shipping department can guarantee they will wrap and secure it, I\u2019d advise skipping this purchase. The mess isn\u2019t worth it not is the early morning doorbell from the postal guy who wasn\u2019t very happy handling this mess too.",

But this is definitely the one! Try dipping some good bread into some of this with a little balsamic vinegar and I'm sure you'll agree it's a taste worthy of serving with a fine meal!",
