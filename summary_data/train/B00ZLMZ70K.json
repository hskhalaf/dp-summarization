They really grip the trail and I didn't have any problems on wet and somewhat icy rocks, which was a big concern for me. My other boots are definitely wore out and I have issues with severe foot pain in both feet, so to be able to hike again is wonderful. Condition of these boots is excellent and they seem to be very durable and sturdy. They also prevent me from feeling sticks and rocks underfoot. So far, I've not one complaint. Very satisfied with these boots!!!",

Also, it helps to really kick my heal into the back before locking the laces - that way it holds but I don't have to over tighten things. I might try Salamons for my gym shoes next! I bought these after my second pair of Keen's fell apart before 2 years. These shoes are in a different class from Keen's - much better quality.",

I have so far tested them in Northern Europe, sub zero temps, snow and ice, NorCal pouring rains, and hilly, rocky hikes along the coast. These shoes give great support, keep your feet warm & dry, never sweaty or too hot/cold. They were a little on the cool side when it dropped to -10C, but these aren't meant for winter conditions. As long as you wear wool/smartwool/other well wicking sock, you can hike hours without blisters or any discomfort. Round laces are not my first choice, but they are easy to change.",
