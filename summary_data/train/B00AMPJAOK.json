You just cannot get a good crisp focus which results is a blurred image. Very limited adjustment for eye width. If your eyes are close together or far apart you cannot get enough adjustment for proper viewing. On the plus side, they do look good. Sending them back to Amazon. Overall, I would not recommend these to a friend.",

      "text": "These Bushnell PowerView 10x50 binoculars themselves are pretty decent for the price, but the canvas carrying case that ships with it is worthless - its way too large for a snug fit of the binoculars (they flop around inside the case), and the velcro on the inside of flap that folds over the front of the case for closure doesn't even line-up with the velcro on the body of the case, hence you can't secure the flap. Its basically a joke! The binoculars themselves are worth a four to five star rating, but the case rates a 0-1 rating, so the best I can offer on these is a four star. Sorry Bushnell!",

You can definitely tell the difference of birds, or how many tines on the buck at 150+ yards no problem. The adjuster is a little different to get use to but it\u2019s quick and easy. The strap is kinda cheesy, only about 3/4 inch wide and will definitely cause neck fatigue for any extended period of hiking or glassing. I bought the chest harness that Bushnell makes and it feels very comfortable with these binos. All in all VERY good for low price!",
