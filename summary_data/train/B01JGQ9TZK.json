Everyone who rides in my car asks me about them and several of them have purchased them, as well. Great product!",

But-- the image you see is small and sometimes misleading compared to the normal-sized mirror- so you always need to be aware that the smaller size does not mean further distance! Also I found it to be useless for night-time driving - the mirror and image are too small to easily distinguish cars in your blind-spot. I guess I would weakly recommend it. (The price is quite good also).",

These little mirrors fixed that, now I have both views, wide angle and normal with detail. Now I have the best total rear view possible.
