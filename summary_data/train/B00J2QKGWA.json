When I came back after 10 min, I couldn't even tell where I needed to wipe because the stains were already gone! I was hesitant to spend $40 on carpet cleaner when resolve is like 5 bucks, but this is definitely worth the $$!",

I stopped using the mask after half of the floors were treated. In addition to the incredible odor eliminating quality, it is an excellent cleaner too! It has a very pleasant smell (kind of like bubble gum) and it absolutely works. Treated entire 3 bedroom house with 8 gallons. Will buy more for adding to laundry-tub to deoderize curtains. It really works. Everyone that returned to the house was amazed!",

It hurt my lungs and put me into an immediate asthma attack (which rarely happens) after applying to the spots. The fumes are almost caustic. Worst part was as hard as we tried sucking up all the suds from the spots, they just kept coming. As far as removing smells, I'd say it removed about 60%. After using this products , I purchased Rocco & Roxie. Not as caustic, but still very strong and hard on the lungs. However, it removed all new smells and the ones Bubbas left behind 100%. Worth it!",

You will see the old stain wick into the paper towel as you treat the stain and repeat the process!

I've only had to use it once on every spot (hardwood floors), and he's not been back to those spots in the last week or so. Fingers crossed this sticks!

Laid out a tarp and sprayed the backing first. Then flipped over and sprayed the pile. Left the carpet to soak fir 24 hours. Then power washed carpet until water ran clear. So happy with the end result. Saved us a lot of money in not having to replace our carpet!! Very happy with the results.",
