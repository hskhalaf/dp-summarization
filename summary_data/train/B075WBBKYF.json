The extendable ones (I despise) never stagnate and always need constant adjustment. I've had this pair a year now, they are sharp and get the job done. They seem durable. For, me I have no negative comment. Yes, I highly recommend.",

I use it to cut hedges, and especially to cut the branches in smaller pieces. The previous hedge shear lasted seven years, so perhaps that is the right time to buy a new one anyway.",

I decided since I have to stay home due to Covid this was a good time to purchase new shears. This was a very useful and worthwhile purchase. They have really made trimming/shearing bushes a lot easier and almost enjoyable if that's possible. Would highly recommend. Thanks for such a quality product.",
