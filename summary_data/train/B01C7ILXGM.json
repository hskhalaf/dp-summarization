This case is well-made, BUT a) the external pocket isn't big enough to do much, and b) the ABSENCE of internal pockets (a key feature of the SAS case) prompted me to return this one. Perhaps the biggest reason for the return, though, is that I got my wife a RED quiver, so she couldn't believe I didn't get her a RED bow case to match. What was I thinking...",

The case has not pickets but sleeves for the limbs. The case is merely a folded padded case. There is a photo of it on the label but not on any advertisement description. I suppose it would deter from potential sales.",

For the price, this case easily holds my 66\" take down recurve bow, it has sleeves in which to place the bow limbs and is easily roomy enough to also hold my shooting glove, arm guard, the bow string and the stringer that I had purchased. I have an arrow rest attached to my bow and it fits nicely without having to remove from the bow.",
