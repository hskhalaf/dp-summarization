It appears that the cup should be about half full to provide an even grind. The lid appears to not completely seal the cup resulting in the grind running up the cup and then to outside between the lid and side of the cup thereby losing the grind and creating a mess.",

Gets an adequate grind for a cone filter in about 15-20 seconds. - Grinds very evenly - Removable / interchangeable bowls make for easy clean-up and an easy way to pour your ground up beans into your coffee maker Con: - There's a bit of a gap between the bowl and the plastic cover which does cause a little coffee dust to get onto the inside of the bowl and onto the grinder base. But it's all easy to clean up.",

What I like about this grinder: powerful can reduce whole spices completely, easy to clean, two inner stainless steel cups one for spices and one for pastes. I made salad dressing in the paste one today, only a little not too full! I've been quickly mincing garlic and ginger. i can grind whole spices, then add them to a Thai style paste using both cups. I'm a professional cook, so this grinder is getting a lot of use.",

Had a cuisinart prior and paid twice as much abd it did last 5 years. The cuisinart was always a mess after use. My new Secura is mess free and is powerful plus you get a spice grinder aside the coffee grinder! My experience has been great so far. I hope it lasts 5 plus years!",

This unit replaced my dead Braun Coffee Grinder and I have to say I like this one much more.",

I find this disconcerting. Design of the metal cup requires use of some sort of tool from your utensil drawer to get all of the grinds out each time. Is this the best you can do, China?",

Definitely not worth doing it considering the product was faulty!! And cheaper the cost of the unit then the item itself... Can anybody help???",
