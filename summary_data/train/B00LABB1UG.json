I have a standard size case (not an otterbox or life proof, just a sleeve) and I have to somewhat force it in the purse. It will not shut with much else in the purse. The photos are shown with the purse closed and the iPhone plus some gum and lipstick inside. I love MKs because you know you're getting long lasting quality. The design on this purse is very well done and the minimalist will appreciate it.",

I also can keep Chapstick, a pack of gum, cards, cash and tampons in it all at once. It's tight but that's what I wanted, something small and compact and this is exactly that! Very happy with my purchase.",

      "text": "Everything looks good. Except that the one I received has 6 card slots (3 side by side). I'm not complaining, cause I actually like the side by side over the single 5 slots in the middle- which was what it was shown on Michael kors site. I also noticed that zappos also shown the picture of 6 card slots instead of 5. And this does question if what I paid for is authentic or not. Or maybe it's just a different model. But overall, I'm happy with the bag atm.",
