A simple hardware reboot isn't adequate - it needs to be physically disconnected from the power source for several minutes. We get to do this several times each week. I'm still waiting for an explanation from Linksys. Additionally, I'm convinced that the reset button is there for appearance only - it has yet to do anything for my system!",

I have the device in a corner of my house and when I am on the opposite end of the house (as far as I can be away inside) the signal quality is poor, almost to the point of non-functional. This is no where near close to 300 feet distance I am talking about, maybe 80 feet. Other than that, the support was good, the setup was easy, and I have two PCs running through mine and can add a couple more, so I'd say this device meets my needs and the company stands by it.",

The configuration options are rather basic; if you have a networking background (e.g., your former firewall was a Linux or BSD box), this is probably not the box for you. Finally, it (like most other home routers) only supports one IPSec pass-through session. Instead, I highly recommend the Nexland ISB WaveBase.

That would really be the only con, and I would have to restart it o fix the problem. Overall, I give this router a 4 out of 5.",

      "text": "This router isn't bad if you don't use the wireless option or plan on using VPN. But if the wireless option is poor, save yourself some bucks and get the much cheaper non-wireless version. Basically, my beefs are as follows: 1. Wireless... very poor reception... unless you are working within 15-20 feet of the router. 2. Use with VPN... constantly loses your connection... doesn't help with productivity at all.",

Used \"Network Magic\" program in the set-up procedure and was connected within a few minutes. Installed the Linksys WMP-11 PCI card in my wife's computer. She can now use the wireless connection to read her e-mail and play games while I am also on line. We have separate screen names on AOL. GREAT!!",
