Measurement markers on the side of the container are great, Spout is secure and pours onto salad well. No leaking when I shake the bottle. And, my favorite part is the mixer. I have a couple recipes that call for honey, which tends to drop to the bottom. The mixer blends all the ingredients to perfection. In fact, I like it so much, that I just ordered a second one. Love it. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",

      "text": "This seems to be decently made but it's really not meant for anything like a thicker ranch or caeser dressing. The mixer in the middle doesn't have enough mass to move on its on without extremely vigorous shaking. The other issues are related to the pour spout: Namely that it doesn't pour anything thick very well. It is hydorphobic but unless it's an oil/vinegar based dressing all of it will never run back down into the bottle and you'll have residue stuck in the hinge mechanism which leads to all sorts of issues.",

Doesn't leak, just a bit of shaking with that thing inside mixes everything up nicely without excess froth and no formula clumps, pour spout is very nice, washes easy without weird areas of gunk forming.

I've not tried creamy dressings in it yet, but this it true for the olive oil dressings I've made in it.",

The wide-mouthed pouring spout makes it great for creamy dressings. You don't have to pump the handle up and down to mix--just shake. The seal is tight and nothing leaks. I don't even buy bottled/packaged dressings anymore. Just make your, avoid all the chemicals and use healthier oils! Also great for pouring sauces over desserts (though not exactly classy-looking. But no one at work cares!).",

      "text": "Worked well for several months; now after months of use, the top leaks whenever I shake dressing in it. Could be made to last longer, as I'm already shopping for a new salad dressing bottle. Would not buy again, do not recommend unless you want to buy another after 4 months.",
