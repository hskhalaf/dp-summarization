Returned item, and because it's \"a large item\", my refund can take up to 2 WEEKS. Usually items purchased from Amazon they give you refund once in transit. But not on this item. If you have a set budget, don't purchase unless you are sure you'll gonna keep it. Otherwise, Amazon will hold on to your money for up to 2 weeks. Was doing this renovation for my 87 year old Mom. Who is currently fighting lung cancer. I was trying to lift her spirits and adjust bathroom to make it easier for her to use.",
