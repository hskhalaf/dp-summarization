This look classy and will be a perfect addition to your bar or for your event. They look very high end. I did have a problem with a glass being chipped (They are glass, it happens) and the seller immediately contacted me to rectify the situation! I could not be more pleased with the seller and the product! I will purchase more as I have requests/orders for more custom orders! Thank you",

Perhaps there had been some sort of \"quality control issue\" but if so this is no longer the case, so my position is to encourage you to buy this item if this is what you are looking for, as I am a most happy curstomer!",

When the set of six arrived, one of the six was broken, cracked between the heavy base and one side of the glass. I figured that I did not really need six glasses, so that was OK. We do not use shot glasses very often, not even once per month. This past week, we were using the remaining five glasses, and discovered two of them were broken in the same manner as the first one. I am quite disappointed and am in the market for more durable shots now.",

The shape of the Chimes fit inside these shot glasses perfectly, and the clear shot glass allows the color of each Chime holder to come through for enjoyment, and the melting wax is captured by the shot glass so you don't get wax all over everything. You can also use these shot glasses as small planters for air plants or small bouquets of flowers to put at individual table place settings.",
