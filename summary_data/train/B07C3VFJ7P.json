I purchased it because of it's size and depth. I have enclosed the pictures of the first bag.",

A month ago I noticed that the skin had cracked and separated along the fold of the top cover where it bends when you open the case. You can't get around using the fold because that is where it folds upon opening. Additionally, the latch on the front pocket broke after three months and the flaps on the external side pockets began to curl. Maybe I just got a bad case but it really looks bad. I would give this a zero rating if I could. I am really dissapointed in this case and cannot recommend it.",

The top latches stopped latching with ease as well. For the price, it's easily replaced after 4 months. And if you don't plan to use as an everyday attached, it will surely be a fine choice.

It was very hard for me to get my laptop in there. I had to ask an acquaintance to hold the flap for me. Other than that, I do love this product. I think mine was just an isolated case. The manufacturer just needs to have better quality control.",

Looks professional, I had to bend down and sniff it, I thought it was leather, actually probably poly, a more durable material. It has more pockets than a high end purse and versatile in actual use. I stuffed many various sized items inside. Can use for digial projectors(most brands), laptops,tablets of course, and files, presentations, and use as luggage for 1-2 day trips. Enjoy! ...on the road again.",

Away don't plan on being able to sneak up on anyone or sneak in late to anything, you will be heard long before you're even seen.",
