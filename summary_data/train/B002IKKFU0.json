I just tweak all the settings myself instead of letting the unit figure it out. Had for a month now. Truly awesome sound and interface through hdmi. Remarkable video processing/upgrading as well. But the sound is just so warm and full. Movies are best realized in 7.1 with a great sub. Would prefer better connections for my iPod but whatever, I'll spring for the dock at some point. Very happy.",

The only issues I have with the AVR is that renaming the source is a little tough and you have to have the Bridge adapter to hook up your ipod/iphone to the AVR.
