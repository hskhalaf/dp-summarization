It simply does not compare, and for the few dollar savings it's simply not worth it. Also, I read the one star reviews and I think these people are kookoo.

Instead of looking down on the table as I have been all my life, this stand props the book up so im looking now forward instead of down. (I have minor neck problems, and am forced to look down for my job, so reading is better and no longer adds to the time im looking down. It also has 2 little prongs to keep the pages from turning. Easy to set up and break down. I bought the big size, and am happy with the purchase.",

The instructions consist of a series of color photos and a few instructions. The arms work perfectly. I have used even large cookbooks with the smallest stand and even though the sides flop over the edges of the stand a little it still works very well. Liked the small stand that we bought so much I turned around and purchased the medium and large stands. These are by far the best bookstands I have ever had.",

The shelf on this book stand is only 1 5/16\" inches, so some of the pages fall over the front of the stand from time to time. Unfortunately, there doesn't appear to be anything on the market that is the depth I want (all the ones I've found--though labeled as if from different companies--seem to have the same dimensions and shelf-folding mechanism), so I don't really have another option. But the high quality at least makes it worthwhile most of the time.",

The clips on this book stand keep the pages locked down without obstructing any text, without making it cumbersome to turn the page, and without adding too much heft to the book stand itself.
