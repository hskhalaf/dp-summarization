I tried in all environments without any other bluetooth active. Not happy about this watch at all except that when it worked it was brilliant then it died. Returning this immediately.

The pros are: it\u2019s light and comfy, the battery last longer than any other watch and It gets the job done cheap and easy . This is more of a fitness tracker that can also tell time and weather not so much a smart watch with very few nice clock faces.",

Most of them are military time and even the one that I found that isn't military time uses 0:01 for midnight instead of 12. It's odd. All and all, it's not awesome. But it's okay.

The Battery Life alone, makes this a worthwhile purchase. I have had a few $$$$ smart watches that have died over the years. At this price I won't shed a tear. The screen isn't much to talk about, but the sleep and GPS function are damn good.",

Unfortunately after 6 months the GPS elevation tracking went loopy. A ride around my neighborhood showed an astonishing (and false) 2,000 foot elevation gain. Two months later, all fitness functions failed if GPS was turned on. Performing a full reset resolved the crashing issue but did not fix the buggy elevation readings. Great product, but ultimately disappointing. I still wear it (hence generous 3 stars) but looking for better.",
