      "text": "Above all, this machine makes excellent coffee!! . . . . . Better than my Gaggia Academia which died in 4 years and better than my previous Jura which ran fine for about 20 years. We don't drink expresso, just coffee and I drink a large cup that takes two of the largest cups possible from the A1. I wish I could make one large cup from 2 initial button presses like the Gaggia. This machine also seems to use less coffee than previous machines which is a cost benefit. The water tank is too small and needs to be refilled after 2 or three cups.",

However, we have had our machine for just over a week and it seems that there is always a light flashing that indicates some type of maintenance item -- the majority of which are refilling the water container & emptying the grinds. The coffee is not hot and the sizes do not allow for a full cup of coffee. The quality of the coffee is great however the continual maintenance of the machine does not justify the $800 purchase price.",

I also love that this machine self cleans itself evey time it is turned on; and without using a TON of water. I also love that it has auto shut-off. So I dont have to worry that someone might leave it on overnight, or not clean it. I only wish it had a bigger water tank so I didnt have to refill as often. I highly recommend this, and will be getting one for home.",

I wish the water reservoir were a bit larger, but refilling it every two days doesn\u2019t bother me. My only complaint is the cleaning I have to do because of spilt coffee grounds inside the tray. Since the first day I used it, I noticed that it spills coffee grounds onto the tray insert (as opposed to all of the grounds dropping into the dredge basket). Not all the grounds spill, but enough do that I have to constantly scrub the tray to get the grounds off. This doesn\u2019t seem to be normal behavior for a Jura.",

The only down side I would say is the water tank size, but I did order the Jura A1 which is the smallest, so I understand its limitations. Overall, an excellent cup of coffee every morning!!",

      "title": "Designed to wear out. It only lasted  about 1 year",
      "text": "Mine lasted about a year before the coffee started tasting weak and the grounds were more a slurry than a puck even at the finest grind setting. A Google search says this means the grinder burrs have worn down and need to be replaced. Unfortunately, the burrs are not available as replacement parts. The only option is to replace the entire grinder assembly. I was quoted $450 for the repair. I thought I was buying a robust unit that would last for many years based on the brand reputation. Unfortunately, it seems it\u2019s a cheap disposable unit due to the lack of replaceable burrs. Disappointed!",

      "text": "Like all Juras, this produces amazing coffee and espresso. Also, it is more efficient with beans than our Impressa. Two negatives - the small water tank which is located on the back. It needs to be filled multiple times any given morning and because we have the machine on the countertop, under the cabinet and the tank is on the back, filling is difficult. Second negative is that 8oz. (And that is a stretch) is the max for a cup of coffee.",

Make sure you keep the instruction manual handy though; there are 11 symbols that light up to signal various things and they are not always obvious what they are telling you.",

It is a fast start-up and fast brew. The number one feature is the taste. A wonderful cup of espresso every time. It is also easy to maintain with the cleaning pellets and the filter for the water. My only small negative is the smallish water tank but that is minor. Also, love how you can have three different sizes and then be able to precisely determine how much coffee is dispensed for each. Overall this machine is perfect if you like quick tasty espresso in the morning!",

It is easy to set up, easy to clean and takes up very little counter space. The cup size is rather small at first but you can adjust pour size easily...or just brew two cups. I use Stumptown beans and each cup is as delicious as the last. We have a larger Jura machine that has been cranking out cups for the last three or four years - sometimes up to 8-10 cups per day. The math works out for me, especially given the taste of the coffee.",
