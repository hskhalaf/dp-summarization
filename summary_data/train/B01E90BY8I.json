      "text": "These pedals are great for the $30 price point. I put 1300 miles on them last year (my brand new road bike), not a single problem. I simply lubed the pivots with bike chain lube and wipe them clean. You have to take of your machines if you expect them to perform, yes this is machine!. I'm buying another pair for my wife's new bike today. Clip in/out operations are very dependable, never experienced any problems. I actually have the same pedals on my Triathlon bike and did a full Ironman and well as 2 half Ironmans and they have held up great! No need to spend hundreds on fancy pedals and shoes.",

      "text": "One pedal broke off of the welded portion within the first three months. They are recommended by Peloton (for their Peloton Bike) if you want to switch out to SPD's. These pedals are not strong enough to withstand the intensity of the workouts and I've been riding/spinning for over 10 years. I went to my local cycle shop and purchased a stronger pair (at 4 times the price) and it was a better fit for me. The seller did get back with me right away but I told my cycle shop to throw away the broken pedal. So I could not provide a picture of the broken pedal for a refund.",
