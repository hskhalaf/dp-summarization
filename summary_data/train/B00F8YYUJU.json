      "text": "I bought this vacuum cleaner 3 years ago and was using 3-4 times a week. It still works like in a day one. Why, because I constantly clean filters, its very important. Suction power is 5of5 in hard floor and 3of5 in carpets. Canister container is pretty small. I had to empty it twice during the cleaning in my 3 bedroom house and once in 1 bedroom house. It cleans perfectly all my dog hair. Looking back in three years, I would definitely get it again.\ud83d\udc4d",

I have purchased other Bissell products in the past and always found them an exceptional value as well as long lasting and durable. This vacuum surpassed my expectations. It is smaller than I anticipated but the amount of power and suction is truly amazing. It picks up the finest dirt and sand. The beater brush ( for bare floors) makes cleaning a pleasure. It also comes with a rug brush attachment that works great on my low pile area rugs. Another great product added to my Bissell collection.",

My only complaints would be the short cord (I have to plug it in in each room), the hose attachment is a little short for cleaning up high but the canister is really light and lastly the brush attachment is a little course. I would be worried about it leaving scratches. Thankfully I kept my old brush attachment. All in all I am very pleased with this vacuum.",

I am so tired of lugging around heavy, loud vacuums that do not work. Time will tell how it holds up but it is looking pretty good so far.",

      "text": "This is a GREAT product. If it gets to where you do not have good suction just order new filters. It happened to me and I took a chance and ordered the new filters and it works like it did when I first purchased it. Keep the old filters and clean them. Then you will have two sets and can switch them out from time to time. I LOVE it. Best vacuum cleaner I have ever owned and trust me I have owned a lot. Best for wood floors that I have ever had. The cord is short which is a pain but I just use a drop cord with it and it does GREAT!!",

Unfortunately I'll have to add electrical tape or something of the sort to keep the batteries secure and out of curious hands. Additionally, the cord is not very long. I can't even make it across our living room before needing to plug it in to a different outlet.",
