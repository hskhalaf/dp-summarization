      "text": "We have owned this projector for 3 years now, and we've found it to be an outstanding value! We use it pretty much every night and still have not had to replace the bulb! We use it on our wall at about 3 feet tall and 5 feet wide, and the picture quality is good. I have also used this to blow up images for large-scale art projects where I pulled the projector way back and made the image 7-8 feet tall, and it was very helpful for that, as well. Overall, this has been a great buy for our family that I'm glad we made!",

Consistently get compliments about the quality and asked where to buy it. Use an HDMI to run from a laptop and plug 2 desktop speakers through the standard audio jack. Broadcast the movie on a 15 foot, yeah 15 foot, white blackout screen. The massive picture is practically identical to my 55\" 1080p HDTV in sharpness and quality. Going on 3 years and it still works like it's brand new!",

I don't think I've ever given a 5 star rating to anything on Amazon before and this is getting 5 stars. I know the cheaper lower resolution ones are more alluring, but let me put your mind at ease: spend the extra hundred on this one, you will never regret it. Plays movies and games flawlessly. Just do yourself a favor and ensure you have some kind of audio kit available because the built in speakers on this suck. I'll update my posting when I get to test the 3d viewing.",

Not sure about clarity with a video game though.

It is extremely quiet, and the heat discharge is minimal compared to some other projectors. I have not tried the 3D functions yet, but the HDMI is crisp and brilliant even in a room that isn't totally dark. My only complaint is the height adjustment. There is a single leg at the front of the projector which is fine, but if you have a slightly un level surface there is no way to adjust the projector without stacking carboard etc under the back corners to level the image.",

When I got the projector, I did a few test with it during the day and also at night. I was blown away by the quality of the image. At a throw distance of (roughly 20-25 feet) the picture was probably close to a 300-inch screen. NOTE: I don't have proper measuring tools, so I apologize in advance if my measurements aren't precisely accurate. The image was also clear and bright. I will be using this projector for movies and gaming, and family events. Hope this review helps a little. That is all.",

My wall is too small, so I have to move the projector closer to the wall to fit the image to the space.

The mount really was universal; it just had a little more adjusting required. The fan is not silent, but we tune that out in a few minutes. Go to projectorcentral dot com to read about screens. We painted our wall with some good Sherwin Williams flat paint instead of buying a screen, and it looks great.",

The built in speakers are not the greatest, so I would recommend having some sort of external audio device to fully enjoy the projector to its fullest!

      "text": "It's too early to tell. I've used it once besides setting it up in my computer room. The projector was plenty bright. I used it on a table and the adjustable foot barely raised the picture above the heads of the audience. The users manual on the DVD is adequate but I found it difficult to locate information without scrolling back and forth. The quick start booklet was of little help and I had to access the DVD to understand how to get the projector connected to the computer and projecting the computer input. The input auto detect function worked very well.It has a lot of features but i have only used it to project a power point presentation.",

If you never used a projector instead of a TV, this one will be a great first experience.",

The PJD5533w is designed to provide an amazing 3D visual experience for classroom, office, and even home environments.\n\n\n\nPACKED WITH FEATURES\n * 6-segment color wheel design improves color performance and accuracy to provide natural, vivid colors\n * Auto source detection senses the source input and syncs with your computer automatically\n * Supports wide range of digital signals from SD (480i/480p) to HD (720p/1080i/1080p)\n * Integrated speaker ideal for multimedia applications, videos, and audio-enabled presentations \n\n\n\nDYNAMICECO TECHNOLOGY FOR TOTAL CONTROL OF AUDIENCE\u2019S FOCUS\nWith the DynamicEco button on the remote, take command of presentations by dimming the sceen brightness by 70%. This feature allows presenters to easily shift the audience's focus when the projector is not in use. When idle, the projector will auto-activate DynamicEco as well. When DynamicEco is activated, the lamp's power consumption is significantly reduced- a great energy-saving design for low total cost of ownership (TCO).\n\n\n\nPC 3D-READY / 120HZ REFRESH RATE POWERED DLP LINKTECHNOLOGY\nWith support for DLP Link technology, you\u00b4ll have amazing 3D capabilities at your disposal.
