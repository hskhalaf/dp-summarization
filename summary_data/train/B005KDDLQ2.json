They are holding up well with regular use on my outdoor seating area. They have a pleasant natural scent and are a good alternative to the plastic trap many of us find ourselves in. Nice price point.

You really just need to tip these back a bit to prevent that, the lip does nothing helpful imo. It just annoys me and makes it difficult at times to dump out the dust / debris.
