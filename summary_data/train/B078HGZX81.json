      "text": "This is my fist battle rope. For what it is, 30 ft of thick rope with 2 plastic shrink wrapped handles with a cover, it is pretty expensive at over $40. The plastic on the handles is pretty weak. After only a few uses, the handles already look roughed up. This makes me think they won\u2019t last very long. The rope itself seems decent, but you cannot tell if there are issues because of the cover. The cover keeps the rope clean, which is great since I mostly use it in the grass or near dirt.",
