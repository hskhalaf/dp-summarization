I'm sorry for not comparing it with the Mooncup in the photos. I threw it out in a feat of rage haha",

The instruction manual is very helpful for a first time user and I will actually give a personal tip for those who are maybe struggling: removing the cup is VERY easy, but what the manual doesn't tell you is that it is much easier to pull out if you 'push' and also pull the stem of the diva cup. As you would expect proper hygiene is extremely important also in order to keep it lasting",

Other times, I have literally felt it pop open, which is a little strange! Other menstrual cups I\u2019ve had have not done this. On the other hand, when it is open it is nice for heavy flow days. The bottom handle is hollow, which may make it stretchier and easier to grab but that also means that it catches stuff. That\u2019s a bit gross, in my opinion. Overall, I am just not as pleased with this brand or model.",

I don't normally cramp much during my cycle, but I've been suffering pretty badly this time around and there's no question that the cup is at fault. The Diva cup holds a smaller volume than the other cup I tried and is very prone both to leaking and slipping.",

By switching to the DivaCup, you will no longer produce 300 pounds of waste, which is about how much an average person creates in a lifetime using disposable feminine hygiene products. This also means no more spending tons of money on pads and panty liners, since these menstrual cups last up to a year. The DivaCup is soft and made from durable silicone that becomes more flexible with body heat. This menstrual cup is made with women's health in mind, so say goodbye to feminine pads and tampons. It features leak-resistant air holes under the rim to create a seal that secures the cup in place. It is simple to grip for easy removal. Once the cup becomes too old to use, the DivaCup is recyclable where facilities exist. We have also implemented our own program with the use of a very sophisticated holographic sticker so you can authenticate your cup online.",
