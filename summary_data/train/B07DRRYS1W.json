I reset the TV. Band still there. Hoping to get help from LG on this problem. Until then, I would recommend to those thinking of buying an expensive TV online, don't.

Once you have a OLED, it is hard to go back to normal TVs with their greyish \"blacks\". Love the pointer remote, but wish it had a querty keyboard for account entry. WebOS has a ton of free channels included that may be sufficient for some cable cutters that have Netflix/Amazon. Mainly use Youtube TV with this and it has a built in app to avoid having to use a 2nd box/stick.",
