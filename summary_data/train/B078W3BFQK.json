I like that you can adjust it from being tight enough to retain the glasses on your head (by pushing the strap up onto the temples) to loose enough to hang around your neck (by pushing the strap toward the end of the arms). I have skinny temples on my sunglasses, max width 3/8\u201d. If your glasses have wide temples, you can probably use these in the loose configuration but not the tight one.",

I slide the strap as far up onto the temples/arms of my Persols when not in their case as it doubles nicely as protection. They're so easy to adjust while wearing if you want your glasses to hang higher or lower or fit more snugly. And they stay put. Some straps you have to fight and push/pull and that's annoying and can bend your frames. Highly recommend these!",

The sunglass arms are 5/8\" thick and it wasn't easy slipping the strap on. I used a pencil to widen the opening and tweezers to help slip them on. Took awhile, but now that it's on I know the glasses are secure and won't slip off. Very happy with the purchase. As a matter of fact, I'm ordering one for my regular glasses.",

Now I have the awesome strap that I wanted, on the sunglasses that I love - perfect!",
