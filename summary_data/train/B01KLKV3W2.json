The holes aren't the most aligned, so only put together the table portion just lightly screwing in the screws until they're all in before actually securing and tightening them. Tape the key underneath for tightening after a few weeks.",

I am pretty good working with tools and it is not difficult to follow the directions but there a so many bolts and it makes the process atrociously tedious. The product is metal and cheap laminate and every time you tighten one set of screws, the others misaligned turning a basic task into one akin to herding cats. I felt like Sisyphus. The manufacturer needs to redesign this aspect of the product.",

There are two corners on the table top that were dented/slightly crushed, as other reviewers have said. I was ok with that, considering it was a fairly affordable table, and the corners on mine weren't nearly as bad as others'. However, all four of the wood seat parts (the part your butt sits on) of the chairs were broken in half. And I mean broken all the way through, snapped in half. Overall, I can't recommend this product. I am waiting to hear back from the seller about getting new seat parts, but I am not holding my breath.",

I would suggest getting the little sticky pads for legs to protect your floors from scratching. You can\u2019t beat the price for this. Worth the money for sure.",
