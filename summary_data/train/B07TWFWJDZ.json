It does mostly what a smartwatch can do (with some limitations (such as calling/texting). The price is OK. If you want a nice looking wearable this is a good choice.",

It works in tandem with her charge 2, so whichever she has on will compile steps for example and sync with each other so all data is collected.

Fitbit should either make their bands a bit smaller at the attachment point or make it possible to order a large instead of a small.

Lack of customization is a major issue. Just make a default clock that looks clean that we can customize the stats and the color.
