Although temperature control is very good and they were easy to clean and to use, the hardwares did not withstand. On one, the latch never shuts right and after 5 uses, it broke off. On the other, the red light never come on from day 1. When I called Amazon to see if I can return them, they told me the warranty time of 30 days had passed so I am stuck with both. They do the job and the krumkakes come out good, but I would give 1 star for the durability. The parts don't seem to last well at all.",

      "text": "I love this krumkake baker. I made krumkake with my grandma using a stovetop iron when I was younger. A couple of years ago I bought an electric pizzelle maker thinking I could use it for krumkake. It burned them so I gave it away. I decided to try an electric version again and bought this one since it was specifically for krumkake. It's wonderful. The nonstick surface makes it super easy to get them off the iron. The adjustable knob lets you set it at just the right time so your krumkake are perfection. Now I'm passing the krumkake making tradition to my kids.",

    "description": "The Chef\u2019sChoice\u00ae KrumKake Express\u2122 is a complete baking system that includes the cookie maker, a cone rolling form and a selection of favorite Scandinavian and German recipes. This versatile unit features instant temperature recovery so it\u2019s always ready to bake.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nPour a scoop of batter on the decorative, nonstick surface of this KrumKake maker, close the lid, and in only 60 seconds a perfect crepe-like cake is ready. Roll the warm cake around the included plastic form, and the cake hardens as it cools into a crisp cone. Children love the cones filled with softened ice cream, and adults will go nuts over fillings of chocolate mousse or whipped cream and fruit. Recipes in the instruction booklet offer Norwegian, Swedish, and German variations on krumkakes, so that cooks can choose between thick or delicate cakes. A numbered dial setting on the unit adjusts temperature to allow the cake color to range from golden to dark brown. Red and green lights indicate readiness, and a quick reheat time means 20 or more six-inch cakes can be cooked in a short amount of time. The unit is easily wiped clean, stores upright to save space, and comes with a one-year warranty against defects. --Ann Bieri",
