      "verdict": "The Skechers Arch Fit is engineered to deliver a comfortable walking experience to people with foot issues. It has built-in support under the arch, which prevents overpronation and relieves pain for those with plantar fasciitis. It looks like your typical athletic trainer which makes it easy to pair with casual attire. The Arch Fit insole is removable, so you can easily swap it with your orthotics if needed. It comes highly recommended to be used for daily walks and traveling.",
      "pros": [
        "A vast majority of reviewers are ecstatic with the comfort offered by the Skechers Arch Fit",
        "A good number of people with flat feet or plantar fasciitis reveal that this pair of walking shoes relieved discomfort",
        "Because of the Arch Fit insole, a lot of wearers have not used their custom orthotics",
        "According to multiple purchasers, this model was lightweight despite having supporting elements",
        "The overall design and style appeal to a lot of shoppers"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "A few users wish that the cushioning under the heel was plush for softer landings",
        "The flat shoelaces did not please a couple of owners"

      "text": "Very pleased initially with these trainers, very comfortable and a good fit. However, after only 3.5 months after moderate wear they are splitting where the fabric joins the sole on one of them - you would not expect this after such a short amount of time for the price paid. No clear information on how to contact the seller to discuss this further, hence this review and the low overall 2-star score. Would welcome a response from the seller.",
