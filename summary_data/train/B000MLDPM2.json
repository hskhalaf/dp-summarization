I've had this printer for more than three years and although the color print quality is very good, if you calculate the cost printing a certain quantity of 8x10 photos against the cost of having the same number of prints done commercially, you can save money by having the photos printed commercially. Probably well worth the cost in the long run to go for a good color laser printer.",

Now, the ink has to be recalibrated every time, which takes about 45 mins and pounds of ink. After calibration, it prints about 20 good-looking photos, and then they look like trash again. For such an expensive printer, I expected better. The CDs on the special tray always come out looking great. For that, I give this two stars. I wish I had bought a cheaper printer. I will NEVER buy another Epson.",

Another thing I love about this printer is that I can print virtually any size paper, which I couldn't do with the HP. So I can print off verses for odd sized home-made greeting cards, or print odd sized journaling for my scrap books. The colors are good and photos are sharp and clear.",

I'm familiar with Epson as I'm a large format digital printer by trade, but this is not a machine I'd recommend at all.

      "text": "I got this printer over a year ago, mainly because I needed something to print images onto CD's, and also for general office printing. The print quality on the CD's was really lacking, the colors were way off (heavily magenta), and I had to adjust my images to compensate for the color issues. I would NOT recommend for printing photos. I've used it since for office printing, and when it's working, it's fine, but there are so many times that it gets a printer error, and doesn't give any details on what's wrong. The ink runs out quickly and is expensive to replace. I wish I would have spent a little more and got something more reliable and higher quality.",

The colors are vibrant, but perhaps a bit too red and slightly over-saturated. I'm printing with Photoshop's default color profile and not Epson's, since Photoshop's starting point is more accurate (Epson's profile is too green). I've only had to tweak on the glossy prints, the archival matte surface paper is accurate from print number one.",

Skip Epson all together and go with another brand, their printers get consistently worse reviews than competing serious photographer photo printers.",
