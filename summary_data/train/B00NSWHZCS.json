All the parts fit together perfectly and are of high quality. It takes about 5 minutes to assemble. My first time using it I placed it in my garage, with the garage door down. I put it one foot away from the door to see if the net would hit the garage door during a shot. It did not. The ball comes back nicely to you off of the net (instead of getting tangled on the bottom). I'm glad I got this net.",

It's pretty simple to set up; taking 20-30 minutes the first time and about 5-10 minutes once you know what you're doing. My only complaint is that the bottom will not retain balls when the net is set up on a hard surface as the balls bounce out over the 1-2\" high lip. On the other hand, the balls bounce back on a very true line. This may not be the case if it's set up on a grass or other soft surface.",

Was easy to set up and we used it quite a bit for golf and baseball practice but I was hoping to get another year or two out of it.",

Just be careful not to over stress the poles when doing so. The metal parts (base), poles and net are all heavy duty, and should last for years. I glued a piece of astroturf to a piece of (16\" x 30\") plywood to create a hitting mat to save my lawn. Drill a hole to insert a tee and it's good for drivers as well. I'm well pleased and can recommend this product.",

Set up and take down should only take a couple minutes now that I know what to do.",

I've hit about 2100 balls into it at this point, that's 21 trips to the range at $10 a pop, so it's already paid for itself. Highly recommend a swing analyzer to accompany this as you won't get an exact read on your ball flight.

Returns plastic balls fine, but makes regular balls bounce on the concrete so sometimes you have to chase them before they roll under some garage fixture and are difficult to dig out.
