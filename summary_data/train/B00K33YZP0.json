The Epson software is not the most intuitive, but it works. So far no scanning issues (streaking, refusal to feed). Operates cleanly via USB. However, I have not been able to successfully set up the WiFi connection, and that was one of the reasons I chose this scanner over wired-only models. Neither of our Macs even sees the device over WiFi. This may be going back despite the decent wired performance.",
