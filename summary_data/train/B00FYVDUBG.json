It took me about 4.5 hours to get it all set up by myself, with powered tools. The look on my kids face was totally worth it.",

I have an 8 inch memory foam matress on the beds and they fit perfectly. Drawers are very sturdy. I highly recommend this for anyone who wants stairs over a latter for a bunk bed.",
