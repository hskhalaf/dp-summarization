Once the weight gets above 350 or so, they just start to break down. I even pair the pad with a hard foam kneeling pad that mechanics use, and the bite of the bar is still too much. I did like the Iron Bull brand, so I ordered another and I've covered it in duct tape to see if it will help. Fingers crossed! For lighter weight, I would still highly recommend this pad.",
