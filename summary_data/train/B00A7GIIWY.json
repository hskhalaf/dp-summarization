Do yourself a favor and buy a cheap Fiio amp to drive these if you plan on using them with your phone. They are the heavyest headphone I own. (BTW not worth the $400 asking price, they are worth the sale price of $80-150. For a $400 set of headphone go look at the B&W P7s. Another great product by Velodyne are the vLeves. Again not worth full asking price but they are nice headphone. For size comparison I placed them next to the popular Logitech G35 7.1 gaming headset in the attached image.",

They where coverage on some sort of oil and they smell bad.also they had a few scratches here and there. Both adjustments where broken upon arrival which means I could never get a proper seal and this things are really uncomfortable to wear.As for sound. This things sounds average at best ,nothing special about them. Maybe the headphones are fake or use ones sold as new ones. And last If you buy from a unauthorized velodyne seller, you're on your own since velodyne won't cover them which I didn't know when I brought this things.",

Velodyne is a great company but they really dropped the ball on these. The sound was muffled, with no highs but pretty decent lows. Terrible build quality! On top of all this, the seller (brandbargain) charged me a 10% restocking fee (which they do not list on their page!) and I returned the product within 2 days of getting it delivered (that's how much I hated it, I didn't even want it around me!) I ended up going with the Bang and Olufsen H6.. they're $399 but so worth the money.",

The clarity of reproduction is incredibly vivid, far better than the best I've tried in the past.
