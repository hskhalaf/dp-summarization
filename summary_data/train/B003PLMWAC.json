After they're dry, you iron them to set the colors in, and it stays permanently! No running in the wash (or the sprinkler in the yard, in our case). HIGHLY recommended as a quarantine activity!",

After they were dry we dried them in a hot dryer and they have been successfully washed several times. I was amazed how quickly the product arrived and how easy and fun it was to use.",

I ended up ordering a Tulip kit and like that MUCH better. Also, these stained the \"tower\" agitator plastic, and I'm still trying to get that off a month later.",
