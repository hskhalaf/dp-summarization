I make batches of hand made mouse pads to where I am pounding holes all day sometimes and I just wanted something with a longer handle. The grip is very nice and does not hurt my hand at all using it for hours at a time. All in all I am very happy with this purchase and if you are also looking for something durable and a bit longer this might be just what you are looking for. 5 Stars all the way...

      "text": "I purchased this Rubber Hammer at a great price! Actually, this product is better than I had expected. It's very lightweight - only 16 ozs. It's very well constructed and I love the handle grip. It works perfectly for my needs when I want the power and force of momentum as that of a regular hammer, but NOT the nicks, scratches, or dents on the object I'm striking. This has just the right amount of power! I'm very happy with my purchase!",

      "text": "If you need a rubber mallet, spend the few extra bucks and get one that won't break after the first few swings. I've had this happen to several of the wooden mallets available on Amazon -- hickory handles these are not! So fiberglass is the next best thing. This is just a basic mallet but stands up to a great deal more abuse than cheap wood handle mallets. Save yourself the trouble and just buy something that will last.",

I've found that it's always nice to have a rubber mallet on hand to make sure the shelves are pushed down tight. I couldn't find the one I already own but this one was very affordable and delivered in 2 days, thanks to Prime. It's comfortable to carry and swing. It does the job I need it to do very easily.",
