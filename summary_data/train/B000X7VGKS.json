I overloaded the previous one in the bottom deck cracked. Don't get me wrong, this can handle several bags of topsoil. I just tossed a large shovelful of wet sand into it from about 3 feet up. My wife loves this cart. The design is good and it stays put even on unlevel ground because of the 2 wheel 2 peg system. She also likes the small garden tool storage near the handle.",

This is one of the best products I have ever used and it has been used for everything from hauling rocks to carrying raked up leaves to using as a cart for plants I needed to move from one location to another. The cart part of my old roughneck is still good after 20 years, it was the wheels that gave out. I would recommend this product to anyone who gardens or farms. It is much easier to use than a wheel barrow and does many of the same jobs with a lot less effort (and I have used wheel barrows in the past). Great product.",

We looked at poly replacements but they were beyond what we wanted to spend and had the same geometry as our old ones -- not ideal because they were awkward. This new one is much easier for carting medium loads and just makes more sense. That's after about a month's use. Let's see how we feel after the summer.",

I was able to load it pretty much as full as I could lift. It bears the scars of use, but this cart is still going strong and I'm looking forward to using it for the backyard remodel in the spring.",

It has a slightly smaller capacity compared to other carts, but this means overloading doesn't result in a cart that can't be moved! I found the capacity to be sufficient. I also like the feature of the depressed shelf near the handle where I could keep my tools, waste bags and small plants to be planted. I have found multiple uses for it. I highly recommend it. The tan color also makes it attractive enough that when left in the yard it doesn't look unsightly.",

The wheel barrow will transport more weight, but the Rubbermaid tote will transport similar materials with more security. There won't be any items dropping out of the Rubbermaid tote like would happen with a wheel barrow. This is a great yard tote that won't get a flat tire, will take beating and keep on working. The price is right, too! I recommend this product.",

      "text": "This dump truck is well-made and perfect for dumping light yard waste. I wheel it around the yard with me while I weed my gardens. I have also used it to carry hedge and brush clippings. Everything dumps out easily into our compost pile. I was worried about the size being too large for my needs, but I like how much it holds. There is even a spot for tools and a water bottle. The wheels are plastic so they will not deflate. That being said, I would probably not use it for extremely heavy loads. It came fully assembled in a large plastic wrapping.",

      "text": "This little item is a fantastic stand-in for a wheel-barrow when you are a single user, and you need a means for expanding dehydrated mulch and placing it easily. I was looking for something that would have better balance than a wheel-barrow (which usually has only one wheel and therefore more wobbly), and would have hard plastic \"tires\" instead of a pneumatic tire (which most wheel-barrows have), since they have a tendency to go flat with lack of regular airing and use.",
