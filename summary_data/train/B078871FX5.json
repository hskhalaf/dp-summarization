Think somewhere between a Halloween candy size and a single serving retail candy bar. When I opened by bar, it looked sad. Some whitening throughout each bar I've had and some minor melting from shipping. It was plain ugly to look at. Flavor is lacking. Maybe due to a bad batch, but the flavor is your standard protein bar with a slightly more \"powdery/chalky\" aftertaste. Wasn't a good experience at all. I'd recommend shopping elsewhere for the dollar amount. Just not worth this price point ($22).",
