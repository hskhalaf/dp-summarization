They are super comfortable., fit well even with my ankle braces on, and most importantly I was able to play basketball pain free yesterday. Just one thing about the color. They say blue/ grey. It is not grey. It is teal. I almost sent them back when I saw it was teal and not grey. But when I put them on and they were so comfortable I didn\u2019t care about the teal.",

      "text": "The overall rating is intentionally lower for average scores to pick it up. Overall shoe is stable, and good for basketball, but it annoys me that I have to keep replacing shoe laces due to flawed design. This is really Adidas issue. This is my second pair of Adidas shoes where shoe lace failed within weeks of usage. The key reason is that the holders of the shoe laces are too narrow and they cut into the laces and within weeks the laces fall apart. The last one not only the shoe lace failed, but also the holes that hold the shoe lace ripped. The shoe becomes useless then. I'll put a separate review of that.",

It can be helpful for me playing more outdoor courts with hard bottom: I've been getting knee pains all the time. The downside is that the feet feel a little fatigue walking in them because of the bottom structure. A big plus is that it's simplistic. I can wear them not necessarily when playing ball as well.",
