      "text": "This item is one of the most elegant, simple yet effective solutions for keeping your MacBook Pro cool. I use mine with my 2016 15\" MacBook Pro while gaming; it tilts the back upward so that all of the vents are entirely free to vent heat. It works beautifully on a lapdesk. It will not scratch the bottom of your MacBook Pro or the lapdesk or other surface you are using. Photos show where I position the Just Mobile Lazy Couch before placing my MacBook Pro on top of them. The tilt is very slight but effective. Highly recommended!",

Use them everyday, I love just having the back raised with two now, really relaxing for hands. But originally I had gotten two pairs and used them for floating the mac on all 4 corners. This is totally brilliant because it lets your mac \"breathe\" from air flowing underneath + it \"floats\" it from any surface by about an inch. No more worries about using your laptop on that questionable Starbucks table that has that caramel sticky top on it.",

It came nicely packaged in a small half-cube box with a pamphlet that I initially mistook for instruction manual (why would I need instructions?) but was a small book of products that Just Mobile makes, all of which look like they would be high quality. The construction seems to be very high quality with an aluminum barrel filled with soft rubber and the feet fit together so that they don't stray apart when you throw them in your bag while on the go. overall I would buy again if I need more of them.",

I've used it on a few different types surfaces, it seems to work equally well with all -- wooden table, tile, glass, etc. It's a compact design, the two pieces fit tightly together when not in use, and look good when in use. One of the things I like but didn't expect was that it puts the Macbook on the perfect angle to keep the edges from digging into my writs after long periods of use. That was an expected plus for me. All in all, a great, inexpensive product.",

When the laptop is ventilated, I don't have to listen to the fan, the laptop stays cooler, and the laptop runs faster (processors drop to a lower speed when they overheat). While these are 5x-10x the cost of two erasers, they lift higher, don't scoot, are really well designed, nicely finished, sturdy, and durable. If your laptop gets hot and you work on desk surfaces (not laps), these are a great portable and minimalist alternative to cooling systems. Highly recommended.",
