Other brand in 500-600$ range do offer a shelf & is made of wood, however, this one is study enough & buying a separate shelf cost 20-30$. So it does offer more value. Assembly is easy, this is easier than Ikea furniture! I love the adjustable feature. It grows with your kids. My daughter are 5 years old & they love it!!!! Overall, I highly recommend it!",
