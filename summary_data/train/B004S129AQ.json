The plastic is fairly thick and the top seals well to keep foods separated during the trip to school in my daughter's backpack. I've used the same container for the last 3 weeks without issue. (In an attempt to make it last longer, I hand wash the lunch box after each school day.) I would highly recommend these containers.",

I'm disappointed that I ended up spending more money and receiving the cheaper color option instead. Feel a bit cheated. The boxes are much sturdier than I was expecting which is nice though. After getting them, I decided to also get the mini dippers that fit inside. Because I think they'll probably keep things separated but not liquids/dips.",

These little gems of a product save me time, hassle and energy and I want to meet the lady who invented these and be her best friend...LOL. Seriously, packing lunches is now fun, I have plenty of room for everything in the the cute seven dollar lunch box...and my kids are over the moon to have a smorgashbord of fun little tastes with their sandwiches.

But, I wouldn't say that these are leak-proof. (You couldn't put soup in one compartment, carry the container on its side, and think that the soup wouldn't leak into other compartments or out of the container. I have put soup in it, carried it UPRIGHT the whole time, and my soup didn't leak.) I've washed these in the dishwasher and used them in the microwave, with no warping or discolorations. I would purchase again.",

So much easier and cheaper to put his sandwich, crackers, fruit and veggies all in the same container instead of a ziploc bag. Which sometimes can be hard to open for him if I buy the ones without the zipper. Less mess also! Over all very satisfied with my purchase. Also I have had no problems with the corner tabs breaking and run the container and lid through the dishwasher all the time and they have not damaged.",

Because the lids are colored, I just leave an index card on their countertop(s) saying what food is in the container with the corresponding colored lid. Speaking of the lids -- they do not snap so tightly that it causes them (elderly people) problems trying to get them open, so, from that standpoint they love them too. That being said, if you're sending these to school with kids who 'rough-house', I could envision the containers opening up and spilling.",
