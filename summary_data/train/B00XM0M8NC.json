      "text": "Was hoping for more from these gloves. I'll give you two reasons for my disappointment. First, there is little to no padding in the palms. Second, the velcro strap that goes over the wrist has the prickly plastic part face DOWN, which means you'll be feeling it stabbing you if you don't line up the opposing side. The good news is these two issues should be easy to fix: provide more padding, and reverse the orientation of the velcro straps so the soft foam part faces downward. I didn't throw them away because they're better than your standard leather gloves (?), but as soon as I find something else, these are going in the garbage.",

I would definitely buy from this seller again. Fit Active Sports...",

But I\u2019ve also worn them through those exercises and just pushed through and was fine. These are really great because your hands don\u2019t get hot and it protects your hands and helps your grip for things like pull-ups. When you put them on, keep your fingers spread. This helps to not get the web to far in between your fingers. Definitely recommend these gloves.",

They are NOT comfortable for doing pushups on the floor, because the finger loops cut into the webbing of your hands. 2. You cannot wipe your forehead or face with them and expect to remove the sweat. The material does not absorb perspiration or water, etc. These gloves are strictly for protecting your hands during weightlifting, pull ups on overhead bars, kettlebells, and individual weights and dumbbells. The material is grippy and very durable. Stitching is tough and durable. I wash them once a week, but dry on low or just set on a towel following a wash. Highly recommended.",

      "text": "Great fit, and comfortable! These gloves are exactly what I needed. Or personal trainer recently changed our routine and started us on high weight low reps... my hands fatigued with the bar as the weight increased so I looked into something to help with my grip... these are perfect, but I could have used a size up only because my fingers seem to lose a little circulation in the latter half of our 30 min session (and yes I measured and ordered according to the chart recommendations). Overall though, I'm pleased with the comfort and my trainer even liked them and asked to try my husband's on then asked for the link. :)",

The gloves are great when doing pull-ups as your hand doesn't slip inside the glove as I often experience with regular gloves. And they do breath better because of the cut-out on top of your hand. The padding is minimal so it doesn't feel unnatural or like there is a barrier between your hand and the weight.
