That's kind of okay since the more spoon like one still has reasonably thin edges. But I still prefer the thicker material and thinner edges of others (which I unfortunately don't know the brand of).",

I'm not afraid of melting them and the one piece construction is everything. The tops don't come off, which means you can get pretty aggressive with them while stirring. And they're easy to clean because residue can't hide out between the top and the handle. They're also super sturdy.

They work well for mixing, bowl/pan scraping; they aren't as good for breaking up ground meats while browning (I use a wooden spoon). I like the stiff handles paired with heads that are just flexible enough to be used for stirring, deglazing, and scraping food out of the pan and into another container.",

The silicone is molded around the stainless rod but the texture of the silicone on the outside is kinda rough. Its not perfectly smooth and batter/frosting and such sticks to them more than the real smooth silicone ends on some other products. I like them regardless and would recommend them to anyone. It beats the wooden handle ones that keep soaking up nasty water from the sink.",

They have a good weight to them and are well-balanced, which makes them very pleasant to use. I particularly like the spoon. I found the edge of the large spatula disappointingly blunt, however, and for that I am subtracting a star. Both the spoon and the small spatula have much more tapered edges in comparison and I'm confused about why the large spatula isn't the same.",

One piece, easily cleaned, and well made. No gross-out factor any more!",

Not grey-ish black, but actually black. They match well in our kitchen and get plenty of use. Will update if we ever have to toss them due to product issues beyond regular wear and tear.",
