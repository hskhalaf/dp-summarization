      "text": "As an IT professional, I've used several keyboards, from desktops to laptops, for the past 20 years. Recently I've been experiencing some Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) symptoms and decided to buy an ergonomic one. This Microsoft keyboard appeared as a cost effective alternative to the more expensive ones (>$200). It took me several weeks to get used to typing on it (note that I love to test new devices) and it happens that the pain just got worse. I then decided to go back to my regular Logitech K810 and, voila\u0300, no more pain. Unfortunately I regret to say that this is a no buy device.",

Only downside is after a year and a half its cracked under the Function area since there is no support underneath.

The Logitech K860 was almost perfect except for the numeral pad. This keyboard is a little less quality but significantly cheaper due to the batteries needed. The separate number pad is amazing! Works just like a calculator and I LOVE it. You really aren't ergonomic if your reaching for your mouse. I also love the magnetic battery cover. This keyboard is quiet and very nice. Amazing value.

This throws the person's coordination off and they end up pressing the ALT-F4 key combination twice, closing windows they did not intend to close.
