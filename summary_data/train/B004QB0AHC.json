    "description": "Size:7 PoundsWhen your lawn runs the gamut from full sun to moderate shade, you need grass that can produce a thick, beautiful lawn despite variable light levels. Pennington Smart Seed Sun & Shade contains a mix of superior cool-season grasses, selected especially for your growing region, that will thrive where lawn areas receive full sun or as little as four hours of sun per day. Backed by years of breeding and research, the premium grass varieties in this versatile mix have earned the Smart Seed label. Selected for outstanding drought, heat and disease tolerance, these water-conserving grasses require up to 30 percent less water than ordinary grasses once they're established in your lawn. With Pennington Smart Seed Sun & Shade, your seed also benefits from Penkoted seed technology, which protects seed and ensures healthier, better plant growth. You'll enjoy a thick, fine-bladed, rich green lawn in sunny areas and in shade.",
