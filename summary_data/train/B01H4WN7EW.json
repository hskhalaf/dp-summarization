This Hamilton Beach blender is definetely somewhat quiter but I would NOT recommend it for making smoothies. It has to be run through several times and does not blend to the consistency of the Ninja. I will be relegating this blender to the back shelf and ordering another Ninja. I really wanted to like the Hamilton Beach but it just doesn't do a good job (especially for smoothies).",

This ensures the ice/frozen fruit chunks get fully broken down and turned into uniform bits. Trying to make a frappuccino with an ordinary blender leaves me with a cold watery/icy drink. Not with this - it fully blends amazingly well. You'll save alot over buying Starbucks with this!",
