      "text": "After A LOT of research on 33\" wide refrigerators (guess I'm old now), I decided to go with this Kenmore Elite model (manufactured by LG). I was about to purchase through Sears, but figured I'd give Amazon a shot, as I buy everything else here. The price was somehow less than Sears (has been corrected in past few days) and the delivery process, like others reported, was actually great. Good communication to confirm delivery time, and the delivery guys were friendly and respectful of my new home. The fridge is ENORMOUS inside, and a well-crafted stainless steel cube on the outside. LED lighting is trick, and it works great. Would recommend buying this fridge off Amazon anytime.",

      "text": "Hello Everyone, I received my refrigerator on July 12. A part malfunctioned within a week and it became completely dysfunctional. It took a week to receive a repair-person to come. He appeared today August 4th and said he will need to place an order for that new part and that they can only come back on August 17. This means I will have lived without my refrigerator a full month. Even though this refrigerator looks nice in terms of design, I might strongly suggest you look elsewhere, because I have seen a number of people complain that they suffered a similar painful experience. Thank you.",

Keeping a steady temp in both freezer drawer and fridge. Was delivered and old one removed using Amazon's link to Sears' Kenmore. All was included in price. Guys who delivered were careful and did a great job. Thanks!",

Addendum: After receiving a very helpful comment about my review, I learned that the stainless in this fridge is austenitic rather than ferritic--hence it is intentionally non-magnetic. Good to know.

This Kenmore bottom freezer fridge offers customized storage options in an aesthetically pleasing stainless steel design. With 24.1 cubic feet of interior storage space, this spacious Energy Star certified fridge/freezer combo has more than enough room for all your grocery storage needs. The adjustable split glass shelving offers slide-out access so you can easily access and remove pies, cakes, casseroles, and larger food items. A full-width pantry drawer is perfect for pies, pizzas and party trays. Use the 2 super-sized humidity controlled crisper bins to house your fresh fruits and vegetables. Features Tilt-N-Store, a flip-up door bin that gives you unlimited storage options. It allows for easy access and removal of food, drinks, and condiments.
