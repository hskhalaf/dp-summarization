But, watching things with more noticeable contrast, I started to see the DLP rainbows. Only a small percentage of the population notices them, apparently. I'm one of them. Lucky me. I returned this and went for an LCD projector. It's still a great projector, it's just not for me.",

Together, they ran less than 750.00. Now I have this awesome movie experience (and sports!) for a fraction of what a big screen that size would cost. I know that it doesn't do 4K yet, but I'm fine with that. When those projectors drop in price, I might consider the upgrade, but for now, this is an awesome projector for a great price!",

I was totally satisfied with that performance given the low cost and excellent picture. I was tempted to just get another 1070 even though it's old news now. But I'm glad I chose this newer model. It's a little larger, but it seems to me the size is due to upgrades in hardware and cooling, which is good. This projector was the same price as the old 1070 and the picture is even brighter with more accurate colors. Definitely recommend.",

Currently I am projecting on a slightly off white wall and the picture is fantastic, but I assume a dedicated screen might be even better.

Supposedly all of them same but price difference tell me there is something behind the curtain and, yes, HT 2050 has better colors and, in addition, if you wait for sale price you save money. Sure, you should also invest in some nice sound system and then life is good. I use regular white wall with picture size about 9 by 14 foot.",

This monster despite its somewhat large size displayed a great picture even when I had the lights on. The sound coming from the projector is great for watching simple vids. Movies and games, the colors and quality were great. My advice though is to use smart-eco mode since you don't lose significant quality or brightness but you do gain an extra 3000 hours or more (based on benq mentions).",

Even my wife that is not into the home theater thing, noticed a difference .The fan is also quieter than my previous projector. I'm very satisfied with my purchase and recommend for anyone !!!",
