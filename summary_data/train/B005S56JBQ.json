Update: the potting bench, after taking stain and spar varnish, and equipped with a bar sink & faucet, now doubles as our patio bar!",

I attach bags over it when it rains to protect their food when it rains. I'm thinking of getting a BBQ cover to put over it on rainy days that I cut a slit in for entrance, that way their food will stay dry and they have a place another out of the rain.

I plan to leave it how it is with its natural wood finish (I believe it's an oil based stain); it looks lovely. I like the little side drawer and pair of side hooks. I may add additional hooks on the other side because they're pretty handy dandy. It arrived quickly and thoughtfully packaged. All the hardware and clear instructions were included.

It wasn\u2019t very difficult to assemble, but with missing hardware, it took much longer than the 45 minute assembly time , as advertised! I waterproofed it after assembly. The wood soft. I\u2019m hoping that it will last more than one year.",

      "text": "The drawer had a crack on the left side where they had assembled it. Instead of sending it back I just glued and clamped it together. The other issue is that the drawer itself is wide open to the elements. I modified that by screwing a piece of plexiglass on the underside of the top shelf above the drawer to keep water out of it. One other minor issue,it would be nice if they furnished wooden plugs to fill in the holes where the larger bolts go. I filled all of the holes with exterior wood putty to prevent water penetration. After these modifications my wife did like it.",

The directions for assembly were not clear and it took us over an hour to assemble. We will use it as a surface while at the grill and not for potting, so it should be sufficient. But I can't imagine it'll last that long.",

And -- just the right amount of bolts and screws -- no extras \"just in case\" -- the exact number and that tells me this is a company that does superlative work, produces a product of which they can be proud, and are what other companies should strive to become. I sincerely hope to do business with them in the future.",
