I also love the fact that all numbers are actually engraved and so they don't wash off in the dishwasher. These cups are actually quite good-looking, and I like the extra measurements inside each cup. Overall, these are a must-have. They are a FULL set, including 2/3 and 3/4 cup, and even 1/8 tsp and 1/2 tbsp measures! So handy and so well made!",

These are great - the text won't rub off, they're metal so I don't need to be worried about putting anything hot in or on them, and they are sturdy. I also love the pour spouts and the intermediate tick marks on the cups. I do wish they gave more/different intermediate tick marks, but that's just cuz I'm lazy and a messy cook so if I could I'd like the option to not wash the measuring cup with the exact measurement I need, if I can re-use the larger cup that I'm already using.",

The cups also have extra indents on the outside/inside that allow you to use the same cup for multiple measurements (ex.the 1 cup having a 1/2 cup marking on it). Both the spoons and cups come with D-rings, but I pwrsonally don't use the ring for the cups. The chart it comes with is okay. The writing on it was printed at a slight angle and it will definitely rub off at some point (not indented in the metal like the spoons and cups, just printed ink). I did not deduct a star for that because I only really wanted the spoons and cups anyway.",
