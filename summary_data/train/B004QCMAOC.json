      "text": "This is a great tent for the price. If you are looking around at other tents and find them to be much more expensive understand it is because of a difference in weight, not quality. In backpacking, a tent over 3ish pounds is considered too heavy, this one is 7ish. So you would buy this tent because either you'll use it for backpacking and don't mind the weight or because you intend on using it for car or boat camping instead. I use it for backpacking and I am very satisfied with it. It has been through rain many times and I've never had any problems. At 70 dollars a problem free tent is quite impressive, in my opinion.",
