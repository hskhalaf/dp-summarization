      "text": "We bought this video for Christmas and are not disappointed. The graphics are awesome, the dialogue is fun, and it's easy enough for an eight year old to figure out. The whole family loves the Fantasia movie and wanted a way to interact with the characters from it. The controls are self explanatory and there are so many levels we have yet to beat the game. It arrived at lightning speed with Amazon Prime and was packaged well. I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of Mickey Mouse and Disney.",

The downside is this version is very slow. On the XBox, I played off the hard disk, on the PS3 I was playing on the Blu-ray so scene transitions were painfully slow. For me, double jumps were also easier on the PS3 than the XBox. My overall preference was for the XBox because of the speed (it was also easier for me to create different save files on the XBox), but visually the PS3 was much, much better.",

The Move is highly recommended to use with this game because it makes gameplay a whole lot easier and more interactive. Don't get me wrong, the game isn't un-playable without a PlayStation Move, it's just not the easiest thing in the world.",

The camera views really are as bad as the other reviewers say. It's not all that clear what you do. And, to be honest, it's not really interesting enough to both finding a walkthrough online. Considering the price I paid for it last year, even with the great Black Friday deal from Amazon, it wasn't worth it.",
