A new hole formed on the other side of the cage just days later. Our cage now looks like frankensteins monster, covered in tape and patch plastics.

Decent quality, especially with the change to how the cage sits in the base. I had the previous version of this cage when it was made by SuperPet, and it feels much more secure now that it has prongs keeping the base on. My only complaint is the cage is no longer the forest green in the product image. The base and shelves are lime green. I\u2019m a little annoyed at amazon for not having updated the picture, and I was very surprised when I received the cage.",

They can pop open rather easily when you take it apart to clean it, and the clips on the side (at least on mine) don't really clip on that well. Also, it is sort of a b**** to clean, especially since the top doesn't open. Be prepared to either pop the shelves out or reach in at weird angles to clean them.",
