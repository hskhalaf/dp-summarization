This desk was by far the least problematic to put together as in all holes lined up and all hardware was there. The only reasons I won't give 5 stars are: The boards aren't indentified with stamps or stickers so it slows assembly down a bit. Partial board isn't 5 star worthy. The only issue is this spluge of something that won't come off without damaging the finish.",

My wife is a little short and desks and chairs have been too high so we tried this which solved everything we set it at the height we liked and it is great! The materials are well made enough and it's holding up well to a lot of use so far. They included screw covers so no shiny silver throwing off the look. It takes up little space so its a good buy for those who can't get a full desk into a small room. with a little bit of extra side shelving my wife has plenty of room to work now.",
