      "text": "I have a Merax brand office chair and it\u2019s amazing! The only downside is that there\u2019s a small gap in the lower back region making it hard to sit up straight. I would usually go for the bigger cushions but only needed something that would fill in that small gap and it did just that. The pillow is very soft and doesn\u2019t sink too easily but then again I\u2019m a pretty light person (I weight around 140 lbs). If you need something large with extra support and more back coverage, I\u2019d look elsewhere, but if you want something that\u2019ll fill in any lower back gaps on your chair without any added bulk, then this is the way to go!",

I have a convertible sit/stand workstation but even with periodic standing I was still struggling when I eventually did need to sit.

I wish I had this years ago. 10/10. I'm definitely buying one for my car as well.",

As a matter of fact, I just bought an extra one so I can leave one at home, and one for work. Thinking to buy a third one for my car :)",

Hopefully this product will help many others .",
