I recommend pairing this with a separate subwoofer if you have a system that can crossover between them. For the price though I recommend getting the Edifier r1700bt's over these, as they cost less and sound way better, though take more space.",

One of the speakers finally blew out after really heavy use over 10+ year (I telecommute for work), which put me in the market for something similar. I was both surprised at how small they were (approx 2/3 the size of my previous ones) and by how much bass they could put out. That said, I use them as computer speakers and not for audio production nor gaming, etc. I'd be kidding myself if I thought I needed surround sound and a sub. If you do, these might not be the speakers for you.",

It really worth the money spent.",

They don't have very deep bass, but what they do have is an amazing rich and full sound at all volume levels. And about that bass, these little speakers will surprise you with how much bass they DO have. An impressive display of sound for such a small footprint, and an attractive design in both black and silver colors.",

    "title": "Bose Computer MusicMonitor -- Silver",
    "description": "Color:SilverFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nBOSE - BETTER SOUND THROUGH RESEARCH\nDedication to research and excellence. It's been the Bose approach to better sound since Dr. Amar G. Bose founded the company in 1964. But the commitment actually began years earlier. \n\nIn the late 1950s, Dr. Bose, then a graduate student, purchased a stereo system based on its impressive technical specifications. The avid music enthusiast was disappointed to discover the speakers didn't reproduce the sound of a live performance--and he became determined to recreate that lifelike audio experience for listeners. \n\nAfter extensive research, Dr. Bose and colleagues introduced the groundbreaking 901 Direct/Reflecting speakers in 1968. Their lifelike sound won immediate and widespread acclaim. \n\nSince those early days of 901 speakers, Bose engineers have kept their focus on creating better technology. You'll find that focus exemplified in the Computer MusicMonitor, with advances that ensure premium performance and convenience. \n\n\n\n\nEXCEPTIONAL AUDIO QUALITY IN AN ELEGANT, SPACE-SAVING DESIGN\nPremium Two-Speaker Bose System for Computers \n\nThis premium two-piece computer speaker system is also the smallest from Bose, yet it delivers sound well beyond its size. Computer MusicMonitor is recommended if your laptop or PC is a prime source of entertainment, you're particular about audio quality and you want an elegant yet unobtrusive system. \n\nUntil now, high quality desktop sound with convincing low notes has come only from large speakers or a three-piece system with a bass module. The MusicMonitor computer sound system is an alternative for serious listeners who prefer a two-piece solution offering exceptional performance, simplicity--and more desktop space. \n\nThis unexpected sound quality results from the latest in Bose amplifier technology, combined with highly efficient neodymium speakers and Bose digital signal processing. The system's proprietary amplifiers are smaller, lighter and more efficient than traditional linear amplifiers to help keep speakers small--yet powerful. Active electronic equalization balances low, mid and high frequencies for more natural tone and clarity. Acoustic design features dual internal opposing passive radiators for unusually deep, powerful low tones from a very small multimedia speaker system. \n\nSetup is easy--you'll need only one cable connection to your computer or auxiliary sources. Volume and power controls are on the right speaker. Or, use the handy remote control that comes with the system. And the speakers are magnetically shielded, so you can place them near your monitor without worrying about monitor interference or damage to magnetic media. To use the Computer MusicMonitor with other audio sources, just unplug the connection to your computer and connect the other audio source to the audio input. \n\nEnjoy the fullness and detail you may have been missing from your favorite downloads, Internet radio and much more, simply and elegantly. The system's understated, space-saving design and elegant brushed aluminum enclosure complement any workspace and fits nicely almost anywhere in your home. \n\nLifelike Performance \n\nExperience sound well beyond the speakers' size--and free up valuable desktop space. \n\nElegant Finish \n\nThese compact speakers are finished in brushed aluminum to complement any laptop, PC and workspace. \n\nPower and Volume Controls \n\nBoth power and volume are located on the handy remote and right computer speaker. \n\nHigh Output \n\nComputer MusicMonitor speakers feature thin but powerful neodymium transducers with 10 times the magnetic energy density of conventional speaker magnets. \n\nEasy Connectivity \n\nOne-cable connection to computer or auxiliary sources. \n\nProprietary Acoustic Design \n\nDual internal opposing passive radiators provide unusually deep, powerful low tones from a very small multimedia speaker system. \n\nProprietary Amplifiers \n\nThe amplifiers in Computer MusicMonitor are smaller, lighter and more efficient than traditional linear amplifiers. This helps keep the speakers small yet powerful. \n\nActive Electronic Equalization \n\nThe active EQ balances low, mid and high frequencies for more natural tone and clarity. \n\nMagnetically Shielded Speakers \n\nComputer MusicMonitor speakers are magnetically shielded to prevent monitor interference or damage to magnetic media. \n\nWhat's in the Box \n\n * Two MusicMonitor speakers \n * Speaker cable \n * AC power cord \n * Demonstration DVD\n * Power pack with attached cable \n * Remote control \n * Audio input cable\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSIMILAR BOSE PRODUCTS TO CONSIDER\n>",
