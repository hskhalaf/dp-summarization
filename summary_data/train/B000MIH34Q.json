I got mint (my personal fav for years) and the black tea blackberry. The black tea blackberry tasted like tea with a tiny tiny tiny hint of the blackberry so I was bummed it didnt taste more like berry. The product itself it great though. Highly recommend. (I have also tried lemon in the past which is good!)",

I think I can now add this one to my list of favorites. Especially because it has SPF, which I know I need but haven't been disciplined about. The balm moisturizes really well, leaving a thin, smooth coating for hours, so I find myself applying way less throughout the day. The scent - black tea & blackberry - is very subtle and I only notice it right after applying. When I run out of this tube, I'll probably try one of the other flavors. It's definitely a quality product that I'd recommend trying out.",

It's not as good as putting \"working hands\" or \"aloe vesta\" on my lips, but it's less obvious than a big tube and it has its own applicator.",
