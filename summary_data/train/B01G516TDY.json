      "pros": [
        "The upper unit of the Mudclaw 300 is flexible and durable, allowing for a reliable coverage to the foot, remarked some runners",
        "Most reviewers appreciated the mesh lining and the water repellent coating that keeps the foot clean and dry",
        "A large number of runners welcomed the protective components, such as the Gusseted Tongue, which keeps dirt from entering the shoe",
        "EVA makes up the mid-sole layer and it\u2019s coupled with the Meta-Shank groove design on the forefoot for more natural foot movement",
        "The Dual-C outsole is made up of sticky rubber for more durability and grip on the surfaces"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "Others thought that it was greatly missing the arch support needed for many runners who need such a feature",
        "The testers noticed that the outsole wasn\u2019t able to offer much traction on wet surfaces"

Mud And wet grounds is where they belong and they did s good job.",

I enjoy the hills around Sheffield but my Pearl Izumi and Brook 9, whilst great shoes, just can\u2019t cope with wet, muddy trails during the winter! I found the size 10 Mudclaw a snug fit, but this proved ideal, particularly on steep, challenging mud/rock slopes. And better still - after a muddy run - incredibly quick and easy to wash/ clean!
