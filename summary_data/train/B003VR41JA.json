I had to wash the green out of the doll's hair and it stained the shirt she was wearing green as well. Avoid this stuff at all costs and if you're looking for a spray for dollies, use Synthetic Wig Conditioning Spray or the African Pride braid spray at Walmart. Both are clear and way better than this stuff.",

      "text": "I thought this spray worked great until I took my style down. I used this product to moisturize my hair while wearing box braids. While wearing the style the spray definitely provided moisture to my scalp. However my hair felt very dry once I took the style down. I may have kept the style in for too long which could've contributed to my hair feeling dry. However I've tried other products while protective styling for the same length of time (1 month) and did not experience the same outcome. This product isn't terrible. I would just advise to be mindful that this product could possibly lead to dryness.",
