Have 93k miles on my car (bought it at 75k), and the car had a whining noise that changed based on engine speed a few months after buying it. Did a fluid change (not a flush), drained about 4 quarts, replaced the missing fluids, and now the car runs better than when I bought it. I'd recommend anyone who has a Nissan CVT (and it's not sealed) to change their fluid every 60-75k or so (service manual recommends it)",

Those ATF fluids might have ruined my tranny had I not found out the ATF fluid. The bottles are very similar. So Amazon sold me two much cheaper ATF fluid bottles as the CVT fluids, and it wasted my whole day since the car was not drivable without the correct CVT fluid.",
