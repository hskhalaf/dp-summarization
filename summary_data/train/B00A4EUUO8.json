All I did to add these bulbs in my current setup is add their serial numbers to the app during setup and it added them with no problems at all. My hue set up works very well with my Amazon Alexa (better than the apps themselves do) The lux bulbs are a bit brighter but if you want to add color this works well.",

I'm not sure I will use the color scenes very often. I probably should have saved a lot more money by purchasing the kit that only has white lights. What is such a downer is for the extremely high price you pay for this product, the application is one of the worst I've seen. It is cumbersome and not intuitive at all. There are no instructions for operating the software, other than to get the bridge and lights set up to be recognized by the bridge.",

New programs are coming out all the time for them. They are pricey, but with the bulb life worth it. Very well made and reliable. You can also have a lot of fun playing around with the colors- orange at Halloween, red at Christmas, green st Pats day. Glad I purchased them.",

Also, depending on the type of color combination you choose, you might hear a slight buzzing noise emitting from the light bulbs. I thought this would drive me crazy, but honestly I don't notice it anymore. When I have guests, no one notices any noise either. I'm a yes for hue lights!",

Well I guess because I have to buy a separate switch to turn on my lights should I not have my phone in my pocket or my Amazon Echo has a connectivity problem to the Hue bridge. But since everything programmed to come on when I actually need light it's only a minor inconvenience. I haven't purchased the separate remote switch yet but probably will soon.",

      "text": "Wow. Absolutely amazing!! This is honestly one of the coolest and most fun things I have ever purchased. Setup was a breeze and the app took a few minutes to get my head around (it's very intuitive, just dive in!)... now I am bathing my living space in fantastic colors that all fade and merge... and it's making me absurdly happy. I can't wait to surprise my friends. Invite them round with all the lights set to 'normal' and act as if nothing, and then at a certain point I will have the phone behind my back and with a gesture of the other hand, turn the room into a \"Neptune's Lair\" of deep blues and reds... :D",

This was done without notice, so people's lights suddenly stopped working if they attempted to re-pair them or reset their hub. What are you afraid of, Philips? edit: Philips has reversed their decision and I have amended my review.",
