I have to say, I am impressed with the results that I've achieved so far! By using this product, along with a clean diet, I am now at the lowest body fat that I have been at in many years. This product is a great way to kick start the fat burning process and keep it going throughout the day and night! The way that they put these fat burning ingredients together is genius! And the taste is good too!",

This stuff gives you a nice boost on top of the protein. Helps for the extra energy needed while running at a calorie deficiency. I'm drinking 3 shakes a day for a nice boost in protein intake. I will definitely continue to buy this. It's nice that Amazon gives you a discount for a recurring shipment. I will be switching to the 4lb. tub and delivery every 45 days, however, as it's a better deal.",
