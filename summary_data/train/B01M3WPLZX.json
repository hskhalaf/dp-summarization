The second time we received a replacement and it literally broke within less than 24 hours. It\u2019s a cute vacuum and the kids loved it, but it is cheaply made and not durable at all. My kids aren\u2019t rough with toys, but this vacuum is not worth buying. I\u2019m very disappointed in this product, especially since we have to spend time to send it back again and look for something else. Amazons Customer Service was amazing in helping us with the issues though.",

It light/well constructed/love the Rev trigger to make it act like it's vacuuming.

If you\u2019re buying this just for the suction, don\u2019t get your hopes up. All in all... we love this vacuum... even though we had to duct tape it together.
