      "text": "Gamer head is right. The boot time is not the issue, in low light, with a moving subject, forget it, you will never get the shot. The camera is very slow to focus under low light conditions. Also, you will find most everything indoors or cloudy conditions is low light. thus, no catching any spontaneous nighttime cuteness or following animals at the zoo on a cloudy day, etc. Over all a nice still shot camera, but must have very fast memory to use movie mode, and no low light movement or your shot is out of focus.",

Used & abused it, even left it out in a torrential downpour when it was almost new, and it has just now finally given up on me. I was thrilled to find that there are still a few new examples of this (long discontinued) model out there, and jumped on it.This is by far the best price I've found.",

Even after a year of ownership I still have a hard time finding the proper depth of field. Good camera for night photos. I still rely on my Pentax K100 for the artistic stuff.",

The instructions for using this with an Apple computer could definitely be more clear (not sure if the same issues exist for PCs). BUT in fact it is easy to set up the wireless (if only they'd explained it better to begin with!) and it works like a charm. You can set up your computer to display a slideshow of photos, and the ones you snap are automatically added to the slideshow as soon as you take them. Great for parties. Moreover, the features and photo quality are excellent. I highly recommend this camera.",

The battery lasts a very long time (about 300 shots per charge) and the scene modes are handy. Also the video quality is above average, if you want that feature. This camera is NOT being produced any more, but should be available from several vendors.",

Use the Live Histogram to set the aperture for the optimal exposure in almost any shooting situation. D-Lighting Automatic compensation for insufficient flash or excessive backlight. User selectable in image playback mode; saves a copy of the picture with the correction made without affecting the original image. Incredible versatility for the end user.
