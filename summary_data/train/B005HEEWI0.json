Unlike many other multivitamins, the iron does not upset my stomach and the level of Vitamin D is sufficient enough for me to not need a secondary one. I supplement these with DHA and magnesium glycinate and have never had issues with stomach upset in myself or my baby. It is important to note that these do NOT have galactogogues in them (the nursing support blend does) so they are safe to use if you have an oversupply.",
