The water feels nice, but I have no idea whether it Is working as a purifier... I suppose I should buy a testing kit of some kind.",

I have a hyrbid city water / well water system where I live (joys of living on a lake :), so the water has a higher level of chlorine and calcium. Within the first week of installing the Vivaspring in one bathroom I could tell the water was fresher. Fresher to the scent and how the water felt on my body. I even rotated between 2 showers in my home to test the difference. No denying the Vivaspring Shower Head makes a HUGE difference! Buying 2 more for my other bathrooms!!!",
