I have been using it for a couple weeks now and so far I have not had any issues. Initially when I purchased it I had almost a TB of media I transferred to it (across the network) and it handled that task very efficiently. In one case recently, we have had 2 separate TVs streaming media from the unit while I was also copying photos up to it and there was no lag, stuttering or other viewing interruptions. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase.",

So this can be configured as a 8TB with redundant back up, or 16TB raid which can be read/written to very quickly. And its future proof as the drives can easily be pulled out and replace. My favorite part is the extra USB ports on the back so that you can plug extra devices into the drive, and then have only 1 USB cable plug back into the tower or laptop. The simple hub is a great feature especially considering most people will use these large drives to backup important data. This is another great HDD from Western Digital.",

Burned in for 72 hours and counting without an issue. Copying data at 170Mbs, on average. One thing I noticed that was interesting was the power brick that shipped with this unit was different from the first. The first unit had what appeared to be a power brick for a single WD My Book drive. Perhaps the first kit shipped with the wrong AC adapter? 2nd unit seems to be working great. So far, so good.",
