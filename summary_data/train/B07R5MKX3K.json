They fit perfectly in my ear and are very light. Lots of positive to say about these buds, however during phone calls people hear me very low which is the reason I gave it 4 stars. If you don\u2019t use them much to talk on the phone these earbuds are perfect and have become my default pair to enjoy music and podcasts. It is also water proof and I shower with them to not interrupt my podcast.",

Would have been great if both ear buds would pair, but they would not. If you want more than one ear bud to work, then I suggest that you do not purchase this product.",

If you plan on using these in a busy city, e.g. NYC, be prepared for the bluetooth connection to be spotty and cut in and out frequently. When not using out in the streets, it performs just fine. The extended battery life and wireless charging are pluses and a major reason why I purchased as well, hopefully the technology improves in time... UPDATE: After 1 month of use, I've reduced to 1 star, the signal breaks up so frequently outdoors it's almost unusable. I guess quality is sacrificed for battery life...",

Sound quality is great but have had issues with the bud not sitting properly in the case despite the case being closed. Because it isn't sitting properly it sometimes connects to my phone when the case is shut which interferes with other Bluetooth devices I may already be connected too. That being said I think it's worth the price for good sounding truly wireless earbuds. Using it for phone calls is ok - not horrible - not amazing but decent for what I paid.",

These are not issues with Apple AirPods, but then you\u2019re not paying the same price.",

I use them mostly while doing yard work and they are a welcome replacement for the foam earplugs I usually use for hearing protection while mowing. Comfort is good, not great, and in my opinion a touch control button for volume, pause and changing tracks, as opposed to a physical button, would help with comfort, especially after having them in for an hour or two or three... Battery life is excellent and I love the charging case. Wireless charging on the case is also bonus! The case's design is simple and functional! Overall, I'm VERY pleased with my purchase!",

      "text": "Despite them not being apple white.....Bought as a gift for my daughter and she loves them. They aren't very big so they are comfortable yet don't feel like they will fall out. No complaints about the sound quality, she likes them. Case is small enough to carry around without being intrusive. She wears them a lot so the battery life is pretty long. She's an apple person so the USB C port is a negative for her. But the charge cable is included so it's a minor annoyance, if at all. Sounds, battery, portability, price = great value",
