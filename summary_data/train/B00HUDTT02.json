However, when I wash my hair with this, I cannot comb my straight, rarely tangled hair. It doesn\u2019t fully rinse out. It weighs down my hair and leaves a residue that makes my hair feel like I Pet a dog that just played in the mud and dried off. It makes it straw like, tangled, and look and feel dirtier than before it was washed.",
