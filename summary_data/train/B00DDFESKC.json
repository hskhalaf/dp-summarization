The main problem is that it just halts for 20-30 seconds at a time every few minutes, especially when using MS Office suit applications. That pretty much renders it useless for writing or being productive in any sense. Otherwise, it runs the web browser and Netflix just fine, so it is a suitable media machine. That's pretty much what I have relegated it to.",

Amazon has been helpful in providing a replacement, but I because I had already installed office on to the computer I am basically losing the value of that license. Hoping the replacement that they send is better than the first.",
