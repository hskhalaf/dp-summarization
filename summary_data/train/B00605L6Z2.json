They reminded me of fat hot dogs. Ordering a size larger makes no sense to me, since the length was fine; the width was the problem. To make matters worse, Amazon ships the shoe box in a glued-together plastic wrap that tears to pieces upon opening. Since the wrap could not be used for return shipping, I had to provide my own return box.",

The quality here is cheap as possible, what you would expect from knock-off discount outfits, Walmart, etc, but not from a major brand. However, designer labels like Puma, et al, are mainly just about fashion & marketing, NOT about quality. So these are par for the course for most designer merch.",

I have always had a wider foot and these have been one of the better shoes for support and overall comfort. I highly recommend Puma's for anyone that has just a tad wider foot than normal and wants a very comfortable shoe! Oh, and the prices are very hard to beat when found on sale, they are $35 and below for some of the more popular styles.",

      "text": "I've been wearing white Puma Romas for several years. I recently ordered a black pair and use those as my work shoes. They are very comfortable for all day wear. My feet are a little on the wide so they're snug at first, but not to the point where they are uncomfortable, and eventually they stretch out. My only complaint is that they take on a permanent odor after about 4-6 months. Maybe the issue is with my feet and not the shoes, maybe I wear the shoes tighter than they are meant to be worn. My workaround is I got some Odor eaters replacement inserts, makes them feel like brand new. Highly recommend these shoes.",

It's not a total deal breaker, but after a long day it can be noticable and I'm ready to take them off. If you have narrow feet, go for it, if wider than that, just be aware you could face the same issue.",
