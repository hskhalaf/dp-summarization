However, it is true what there are some flaws to the design. DO NOT USE more than 4 lbs torque on a driver to drive the screws and you'll be fine. Also, I purchased an L shaped bracket at the hardware store in order to mount from bottom (see photo attached) and make it stable when removing pool sticks. Really easy fix and works great. If it wasn't because of this design flaw that I had to fix I'd give it 5 stars.",

When installing, I recommend starting with the two middle horizontal bars (that hold the balls) and attach them to the two vertical bars. Start by screwing them in half way and proceed to attach the other pieces. Then screw them all in when satisfied with the outcome. This makes it easier to make sure everything is lined up correctly. Instead of the 2 drywall screw inserts they provided for mounting, I used my own (better ones). I also added small L-brackets under the bottom piece to secure the bottom to the wall.

I agree with some, I'm not to sure about the hooks to secure it to the wall, but that can be easily remedied with a quick trip to the hardware store. It's very nice looking and sturdy. Very pleased with it. Can't wait to give it to my boyfriend for Christmas!",
