The down side is that this is my 3rd machine of this model in 6.5 years and it just bit the dust again. The first one died a bit faster, but they seem to last on average 2 years. I prefer this model because it has plenty of room under the drip and under the steam wand to use my larger cups. Don't be foolish like I was 2 years ago and skip the 4 yr warranty. I fully expect to get my money's worth on the next one.",

Having tested for and eliminated operator error, I'm absolutely certain that the pump on this machine isn't consistent shot to shot. It is reasonably acceptable for a machine in the lowest tier of espresso making, but I wish some things were better thought out (spurting frothing wand, useless plastic tamper, water dripping below machine considered normal etc.)",

I suggest you buy a separate steamer/frother to use instead of the one included.",

They want copy of receipt which I'm supplying and they will send me another water tank but that's really not the problem. Whole product is not to its expectation. Never again",

But, this pump machine does not make espresso as strong as I like it. I can't seem to make it any stronger and think it is due to the fact that you can't put as much coffee grinds into the holder with this machine than you can with the steam version. Also, I bought some pods as the advertisement said you can use them in this machine, and the Krups I bought don't fit. Seems you have to use a smaller version which I've been unable to find.",
