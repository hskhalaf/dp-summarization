The pretty, pale pink band was filthy and dingy looking almost immediately and suede is almost impossible to clean. I have tried all recommended cleaning methods and nothing has been overly successful. I still wear the watch because the watch face is gorgeous and I just hope that no one actually notices the grimy wristband. Would not buy again, nor do I recommend this product.",

The strap also feels thinner than my other Fossil Jacqueline watches, almost like it's not made of real leather, even though it is stamped inside. But maybe I'm wrong... still. The rose gold also isn't as soft as is it in the photos, it looks a little closer to bronze.",

It is a very pretty watch and I liked the appearance very much. However, in under 3 months, the watch stopped telling time correctly and I would need to reset the date and time frequently throughout the week. This is disappointing because it is such a nice looking watch and I expected so much more.",
