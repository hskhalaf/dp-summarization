I also didn't worry about someone snatching my phone out of my hand. I did have to thread the leash through a speaker hole rather than the power port hole, but that worked just fine. I found that charging my phone was too difficult with the leash through the power port. Very happy with this purchase, overall!",

      "text": "It fit on Samsung 6 and Iphone 8 with no problem. Although tight cases might be a little disrupted by the extra thickness of the strap running between it and the phone. This was great for wearing around neck or knotting around a shoulder strap so a phone won't fall out or get pick-pocketed. Great for taking photos where there is a chance of dropping the phone or losing it. (like leaning over the railings somewhere trying to get a shot!) The release allows you to unhitch it easily and the remaining strap still attached to the phone can work as a wrist strap. Worked as advertized. Looked as pictured. A good product!",

After browsing thru several similar products, this seems to fit what I'm looking for. it's not made of cheap silicone rubber like the others (didn't want to risk hanging my phone on those) and does not block the camera or get in the way of my side buttons. I also like how there's no adhesives and I can remove it when I want to but I'll probably wear it all the time as it's very convenient to just wear my phone around my neck when I'm on my phone every few minutes. The 3 in 1 design allows me to use it in many different situations. Very clever novel invention! I'll probably give these out for Xmas!",

But the retainer clip that holds the loose strap in place so that it does not flap was on the WRONG side. So there is no way to retain the loose strap. The concept and product design is simple and works well when it is made correctly. I am disappointed and will have to return the product due to this defect.",

I like the hand strap on the back of the phone so you don't need to grip it. Wrist strap is lost on me, I don't think I would ever use it. Not sure if strap won't fray, will see how it holds up.",
