And each layer has two sided zipper hold, one for when you are inside (inside facing zip) and one when you are outside (outside facing zip). Hubby loved the \"ceiling\" opening so he could enjoy the warm sun and stare at the sky, while being shielded from the cold california beach winds. It fits two adults and my toddler child just fine, and should sleep up if camping just fine too.",

We couldn't get it packed correctly, so we put the black frame cables under SUV's spare tire compartment (folded them into a circle shape). Unfortunately, one of the ends to the cable must have stretched out and busted a wire that connected to the Cars Audio System. Now we have to get that fixed.

The spars are quite thick compared to some other 'tents'. It automatically unfolds rapidly in 1 to 2 seconds. Very quick to refold with a little practice and uh, moderate strength.

I camped on top of Desoto mtn and it was full on wind each night shaking the heck out of the tent and had no tears. Only recommendation would be set up a rain tarp or a custom rain fly. The one that sets up with it I don't think it will work well. I really like all the screens to create or restrict air flow. This is perfect size for all my gear , me and my dog.",

It IS light and needed to be weighted down but we just threw our beach bags in it and that sufficed. It has metal spikes to hold it down which would work anywhere but not in the sand. Nice tent!",

We used it on a trip with our toddler and 1 month old and it was great for privacy and beach naps. Nice to be able to open on one side and then change to the other side if the wind/sun changes direction. Feels very spacious inside- more like a camping tent than a sun/ beach tent (in a good way). Somewhat tricky to fold but able to do it once we learned how to fold it like a taco then twist (and watched a few YouTube\u2019s).",
