Make sure you do a good job balancing the camera on the stabilizer. It may take a little time on the first try, but your efforts will be well rewarded.",

One thing that would be awesome would be a built in loop to attach a carabiner to so that I could carry the camera/stabilizer rig hands-free. The construction feels very solid. I am currently wrapping my first full-length music video (attached above). And the customer service I received on a very small issue was taken care of with the utmost care and personal attention.

Plus, I get an array of shots at different angles and speeds, this was not able to handle that. If you want a stabilizer, get a motorized gimbal. It will be a bit more expensive, but it will make a 100% different, especially compared to this thing. If you do just want to do a couple of shots where you walk really slow, you could probably make this work.",

If you\u2019re on a tight budget this can work for you, just be sure to keep your hands steady and plan your shots so you can do them as slow and controlled as possible. My only other critique is that the rig plus my Nikon DSLR starts to feel heavy after 10-15 minutes. This would probably be best if used with a GoPro or phone.",

My son is a high school film student in his senior year and participates in film festivals, has a vlog and YouTube channel and is expanding his skills in film regularly. He will be attending college in the fall and will pursue his career in film. Being a high school student, he does not have a lot of extra cash to try the newest, latest and greatest products so he is excited about this new gift. He owns a several cameras from DSLRs to smaller video cameras and a couple Go-pro cameras.",

The design is also very well thought out. I appreciate the adjustability of the product to fit any camera. The color is right, the size is perfect (not too big or small), and the weight is not a problem for normal use. I bought this product to use in house walkthroughs so that I could easily move from room to room without the shaking or tilting. A stabilizer is a must-have for smooth filming and I believe I made a great choice with this one.",

I am still in the planning stages for my YouTube channel but I will use this awesome tool to stabilize live shots here in Boston, and from trying it out so far this mount has worked very well. Much more satisfactory than the stabilization function on the actual cam, I must say. Thank you Roxant for giving me such a superior and useful product!",
