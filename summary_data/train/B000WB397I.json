However, after spending much time researching and previously having purchased the Fellowes 99MS from Amazon, I bought this item not recognizing it is a ridiculously outdated shredder. I was so focused on safesense technology for my daughter's baby that I lost sight of the piece of garbage the shredder is. If you just want to have fun cutting up paper, this works. If you want your shreds secure--DO NOT BUY THIS SHREDDER. With deep regrets over my clicking back and forth and not paying attention.",

It smelled like burning plastic and won't restart. I checked the unit and there is no jam or paper in the teeth. I am just glad that I was home since it may have burned my house down if I weren't here to unplug it.",

The only complaint I have is that sometimes if you have a little slip of paper (like a single receipt), you have to fold it before you shred, or the shredder doesn't activate. That is pretty easy to deal with, though. I use mine at home, but it's versatile, and would be good for either home or office. No regrets! I recommend this product.",

Low noise, but still makes shredding sounds. Quiet compared to office shredders I think. The size is rather nice: I can hide it under my desk without notice. Be sure to oil it regularly for long life, preferably after each emptying of the can at the longest (follow the suggested instructions for best results).",

Capacity of shredded material is lower then my previous unit but not major thing. easy cleanup and maintenance. I do wish there were \"flaps\" that when you pulled out the basket the flaps would cover the shreds so they don't fly out or spill, but using plastic waste basket liners works like a charm.",

The warning lights on the top of the shredder help you utilize the machine to its full potential, and misfeeds do indeed correct themselves! I was a little reluctant to spend this much on a paper shredder I use rather sparingly, but I'm glad that I did.",

It can easily shred credit cards and it can be emptied very easily from the front instead of having to lift off the top! No more mess of little shreds of paper going everywhere!
