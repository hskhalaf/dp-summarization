Any problems have been with synch being wonky at times and not recording instantly which is an annoyance because of my impatience.

It doesn't seem like they should be so disposable. It also seems like they might last just a little longer than the 367 days. Hmmmmm..... I won't give them another $100 for another year.

I have discovered that I need 9 hours in bed to get 8 hours of sleep so this has changed the way I go to bed and I feel better for it.

They don't survive the treatment and only partially work after coming out. Usually they wont sync anymore despite resets etc. Because of their size, It's way to easy for them to be left in a pile of clothes and run thru a clean cycle. They should be made much more robust i.e. waterproof and should be able to withstand the tumble cycles. I wonder how many other people have had the same thing happen.",

Anyone needing a little motivation to get up and be more active this is the product for you. It is very easy to use. No programming required and with a touch of a button you can see your step/calorie burn count. The sleep band works great and reports the quantity and quality of each nights sleep. The Fitbit community is very incouraging and you will start exercising more just to see your numbers improve. This is a great product at a great price.",

I can see what times of the day or days of the week, I am inactive and that helps me to change my exercise habits. I also really like looking at my sleep and using sleepdebt to calculate how many hours I'm ahead or behind. It's a great device and a highly recommend it to everyone, I've ordered an Aria to go with it, which will add a new burst of excitement to my Fitbit.",

Amazon was nice and swapped it for a new unit. Now, less than 6 weeks later, the same problem is cropping up. At first, I simply couldn't see the activity information on the unit itself, though it was still recording. Then it stopped syncing the following day. Then it stopped recording altogether. Amazon is being very nice about taking the item back as defective. The second time around, I have no interest in a replacement, as I simply think the product is not durable enough to track activity.",

The activity tracker is great. You can see what you actually do during a work out. My only complaint is that I don't think the calories burned is accurate. There are other logs on the dashbord for sleep, heart rate, blood pressure and glucose that I have not used yet.",

    "description": "Color:Black/BlueThe new Fitbit Ultra Wireless Activity Tracker makes every step you take a step toward better fitness, even on your busiest days. Like the original, the Ultra tracks your day down to details a pedometer can\u2019t catch, giving you access to the exact steps you take, calories you burn and distance you travel, along with how long and how well you sleep. And now, with its altimeter technology, Fitbit can track the heart-healthy activity of climbing stairs, encouraging you to take the stairs not the elevator, or walking that hill. The Ultra also gives you more measures to track your fitness (a stair counter, a stopwatch, and fitness achievement badges), and more options (a clock, an iphone app, and new colors). Check your real time stats at any time with a quick glance at your tracker. It\u2019s compact and discreet enough to wear all day long in your pocket, clipped to your waist, or even attached to your bra. Good sleep is another key to good health and weight loss, which is why Fitbit can also track your sleep. Simply slip your tracker inside the included wristband and you\u2019ll see how long and how well you sleep. Fitbit wirelessly uploads your data to Fitbit.com whenever you\u2019re within 15 feet of your computer. Works automatically -- no buttons to push, no data to enter. At Fitbit.com, free online tools show how your activity measures up over time and keep you motivated, with no monthly fee required. Track your progress with graphs, see how you compare to others, or compete with friends and family. Plus, you can use Fitbit.com or Fitbit\u2019s new free iphone app to log what you eat from our database of over a 100,000 foods, or record workouts from activities like pilates, yoga, or cycling. The Fitbit ultra gives you a clear sense of how you\u2019re doing and encourages you to be more active, because the more you know, the more motivated you\u2019ll be. And these small changes can really add up: Fitbit users increase their daily steps by 43% and have lost an average of 13 lbs.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\n\nThe new Fitbit Ultra Wireless Activity Tracker makes every step you take a step toward better fitness, even on your busiest days.

When worn close to the body, this device tracks daily steps, number of stairs climbed, distance traveled, calories burned, and overall intensity of the activity level. Fitbit Ultra also contains an altimeter to track stairs or hills climbed. The compact design of the Tracker makes it easy to wear tucked into your pocket, clipped to a belt or bra all day.\n\nTRACK YOUR SLEEP\nYou can also wear the Tracker at night with the included Fitbit wristband to monitor how long and how well you sleep.
