It also has some space for additional memory cards. It's about all you need. Highly recommend",

The microSD slots are removable and pretty cool. You can refit those into any other vita game case to store your microSD since they're shaped the same as any other vita game card.",

The other half accept the game and it snaps in place, and the second you look sideways at the holder, they pop back out. Absolute waste of money, I set up the Amazon return within minutes of receiving it.",
