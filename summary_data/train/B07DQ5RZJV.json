In other words, it doesn't teach you to build a functional website (other than a very basic HTML page that takes 5 mins). It teaches you to make one prettier. I already have half a dozen CSS books. After five chapters and not really learning anything new, I perused the remainder of the book and returned it. Granted I have over a decade of web design and programming experience but haven't done it in a long time. The new generation who are calling themselves web designers are not really web designers. :(",

As a beginner I find this a very helpful resource. Where things go beyond the scope, the author points you to countless resources--other books, websites, etc. that can elaborate on the concepts.

I'm a computer programmer learning web design and I really appreciate the in depth instruction, the color coded pages, and basically how everything is in color makes it a lot easier to understand on a website level (unlike many other books which are just in black and white).",
