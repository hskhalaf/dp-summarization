      "verdict": "This low-cut hiking shoe from Merrell features an assortment of positive qualities, mainly led by its comfortable feel and protection against wet trail conditions. The footgear\u2019s traction and snug fit also registered positive remarks. On the flipside, the hiker\u2019s removable footbed disappointed by not delivering enough arch support. Taking everything into account, the Merrell Capra GTX is a shoe that can provide sufficient performance on the trail.",

I walk a lot during the day at work and these don't give me any aches on my feet after wearing them all day. If you have the chance and find the 1/2 size bigger than your usual size in other shoes consider it, but 1 full size on these fits still OK.",
