It looks just like the ad, and the battery was good, at least has been for a few tries. The lights are beautiful and cycle through a couple colors; your recorded message plays back filtered to \"chipmunk\" and sounds tinny, but it does repeat and then add some tweets that are nice, clear tones. I do see lots of tie wraps, so I'll warn my family to open it gently since others say the cage is delicate. It should make a nice present for my granddaughter.",
