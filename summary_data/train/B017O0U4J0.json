Just put it where you want it, and voila, you are ready to fill it up with your favorite wine. The wine bottles fit safely and effectively at a slight tilt in order to keep the cork from drying out. My husband and I love this wine rack. We have only had it for a little over a week, but we put it to use immediately. If anything changes, I will update my review.",

I recommend keeping your wine rack away from sunny locations, and away from heating vents, to preserve the quality of your wine. I would say keep the labels down.

Lays them on the side to keep the cork moistened, so no issues with corks crumbling for those bottles you hold on to for a while. The material, metal, is sturdy and it is easy to put together. My only complaint is there are some wine and champagne bottles that do not fit into the holder.",

I highly recommend this rack for people who need a decent storage system without having to break the bank.",
