      "title": "BEST UPGRADE FOR ASSURANCE WIRELESS LIFELINE PHONES. NOT MANY ARE COMPATIBLE. THIS ONE IS",
      "text": "not bad at all!!. i must say i have the assurance wireless lifeline phone and there are very few phone compatible with the Assurance/virgin mobile and the phone they give u is not only ancient but has nothing to it but text and call. no camera, no data, very poor internet options. The Kyocera Contact however, is an awesome phone. i have really big fingers and almost impossible to text but the Contact has a slide out keyboard that works great and it has a really decent camera on as well as many options the standard phone didnt have. so i reccomend this phone to anyone on Assurance wireless",

This phone works great, I love having the Qwerty keyboard on it (makes texting a little easier and faster) but was a little disappointed to find out that I can't transfer my own ringtones to it either through texting or by connecting it to my laptop. Still, very worth the money.",
