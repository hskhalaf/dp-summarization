Very sharp blade, very solid (heavy cast iron). I have found that attaching it to a board to stabilize it is necessary. So far, I have not found one log I haven't been able to split with my 4 lb. mallet in just a few strokes!

Comes with a cheesy plastic piece to mount to your chopping block that the kindling cracker is supposed to then clip into. Did not use it; just stood the kindling cracker on the chopping block and re-centered it once in a while. It will invariably \"walk\" about when it gets used. What used to take up to 2 hours to do is down to about an hour. It's makes a drudge-worthy job quick and easy.",
