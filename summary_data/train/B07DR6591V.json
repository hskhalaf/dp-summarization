I some trouble with the front brake as it was scrapping my front tire but my neighbor, who rides one of those $1000+ bikes all over the place came over and adjusted it for me. Otherwise I like the bike. The seat is a bit hard on one's butt but that is the way for most bikes so I will have to purchase a more comfortable seat. Otherwise, an excellent buy.",
