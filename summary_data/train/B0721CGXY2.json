      "text": "When it comes to motion controls the Switch is amazing. You won't experience it well with an inferior small plastic wheel. The Mario wheel is larger than anyother for the Switch and is of higher quality plastic as well. Simply it holds up to childrens destruction attempts. Removing the joycons is easy enough for a toddler and the fit is snug as well. Control is excellent. My 3yo is far better with the wheel than a joystick. The triggers work well, and the steering is easy for adults and small children. This is an incredibly fun way to play and accurate. Kids love it and it works well for adults too. Mario and Luigi wheels exceeded my expectations.",

We use both whenever we play Mario Kart on the Switch and it really gives you the \"driving\" experience and I think it's easier to control your character. I love the Mario/Luigi colors and logos and that the wheels are larger in size than other wheels out there. The down side is that our kids often want to grab the wheels from us to play with and we get last place from the distraction. It's a hit with everyone!",
