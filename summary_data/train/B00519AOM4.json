We didn't use cupcake liners, and they came out light and fluffy. The manual recommends a 5-6 minute bake time, but we found that a slightly longer bake time worked better. The cupcakes released easily. On the last batch, we didn't have enough batter to villa every cup, but the empty spaces didn't affect the quality of the cupcakes. Great little machine for bite-sized cupcakes.",

I tried the final batch without paper cups and they work fine if you like a little more of a crispy outside. The tops didn't brown but they were totally cooked. No clean up to speak of. Didn't have to heat up an oven. Very nifty little gadget. BTW I bought one of the used/like new ones listed for a few $$ savings. Looks new to me but the box had been opened is all.",
