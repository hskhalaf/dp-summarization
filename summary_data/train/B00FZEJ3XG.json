Those criteria continue to be met and while the battery is charged, I couldn't be happier with the camera. When battery power runs out, the lens is left OPEN - with no way to CLOSE it!!! This has happened to me a few times with a Wasabi replacement/back-up battery. And the battery indicator does NOT function accurately with the Wasabi battery. My suggestion to Olympus .... with the last bit of battery power, close the lens!",

I wanted a camera with long reach, with a fast lens for low light photos, not large in size but making quality photos. I am happy with the results. I much hesitated, comparing it to the new Lumix DMC-1000, but in the end the size and weight made me decide for the Stylus 1. I am happy with my decision The camera is small and light, but feels very well in the hand. The EVF is superb, even with glasses. Focussing is ultrafast and sharp. Zooming is fast but easy to control. I highly recommend it.",
