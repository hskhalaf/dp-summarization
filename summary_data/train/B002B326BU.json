Also if you are on line 2 and line 1 and line 1 is hung up, it hangs up line 2 also. The Last issues is if you place one phone on hold and then try and pick up the line from a different phone it's a blank line and doesnt connect. Technically these are just not what I was expecting.",

Cons: The functionality of the phone leaves a lot to be desired. Navigating through the phone is cumbersome. One of the main functions I use is speaker phone. You are unable to adjust the volume and sound quality if poor. Also people have a hard time hearing me when set to speaker phone. Overall: If I could redo, I probably would look for another phone. Not the greatest phone for everyday use.",

Other than that, i have not found anything to complain about yet...",

Also, if you want to add *82 or PBX dial 9 options, the pause system is not long enough to work on the network. It takes multiple strokes to do anything and the person who designed it made it so unintuitive that I have to refer to the manual repeatedly for simple actions - just too hard to remember. After 6 months I dumped the system and bought a comparable Panasonic system and it works great. Someone needs to tell RCA 9GE) to redesign this monster. I wish that I could get my money back for the total loss.",
