I ordered a new bottle last week as I was running low, and what showed up looked different in color (dirty beige/yellow rather than off-white) with the bottom of the container showing what can best be described as \"unmixed\" materials, large swaths of white and dirty beige/yellow thick liquid swirls. I returned that bottle and asked for a replacement. The replacement had the exact same problems: weird looking color and \"unmixed\" materials seen through the bottom of the bottle. I am returning this as well and switching to another brand.",

The shampoo is great - I have used both the Lavender as well as the Rosemary scented shampoo's. The shampoo foams up nicely, doesn't seem to bother the wiener's eyes and more importantly, rinses quickly and completely leaving a nice scent that hangs around for about 1 day. I give him a bath about once every 2-3 weeks and his skin is not effected or dried out. I can definitely recommend this doggy shampoo.",
