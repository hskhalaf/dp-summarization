I bought it based on the great reviews, but as you can see from the most recent ones, this model has not lived up to its 4 stars a short two years later. I kept the updates up-to-date (it is set up wirelessly), and like many others that have shared their feedback, started experiencing issues with playing discs a few months ago. We can still stream Netflix, but it's been frustrating hit-and-mixes with any blu ray or dvds. I expected to be able to get more from this player, so it has been disappointing.",

The wifi for watching netflix was just ok and over the past years it was very sporadic and always seemed to be confused if it had a slow or fast connection so reloading all the time. So watching netflix was ok. The blu ray itself was very good. 4 years ago I paid $100 more for this unit. The technology has come so far from this player and they dont even have any updates in the past year for the software fixes. If you want to stream buy the new Roku 3 is AMAZING and FAST. DONT BUY THIS LG FOR THE WIFI.",

LG's policy is to charge the customer 69 dollars for sending it back and then any parts for the repair. I've owned VCRs; LaserDisc, DVD and many other similar brands of consumer electronics and have never has as much trouble or received as little customer service and appreciation for brand loyalty as I have for the LG products. Just a warning for all of you who are interested in Blu-Ray players, based on my experience, stear clear of LG.",

Lucky Goldstar was known for producing absolute crap. I've never purchased anything from them until now. It appears that they changed the name, but, not the product.",
