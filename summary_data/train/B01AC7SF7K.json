I could not wait until Christmas! I had no idea just how she would respond. It was so moving, I cried! She began to play peek a boo and giggled with glee! This is a wonderful toy, so cute, soft and sweet. I would imagine any child would share in my daughters reaction! If you're reading this, please offer a good thought or prayer for Mia.

I wouldn't recommend this for a baby shower though. It's definitely better when the kid understands how to push buttons and hold things for their self. Even mommy loved this!

Press the right foot and it plays \"Do your ears hang low\" with flapping ears. Sound quality is good. For a younger child, either boy or girl.",

I don't doubt for a moment that a young child wouldn't be amused over watching this litlte feller...too cute! It arrived neatly packaged and with batteries installed. There's a pull tab to activate it, which was easily replaceable by opening the battery compartment.",

Its really cute and soft but there is a motor in the bottom of the doll so the bottom is hard. theres a flap so you can turn on/off and change batteries when needed. the ears move with the song and game which catches the eye of my baby. would recommend to those wanting a singing toy. because of the motor, it sits up right which is nice too.",

It's also very soft, so she loves to squeeze the legs and grab the ears. I'd definitely recommend as a baby shower gift, or as a baby gift in general.",
