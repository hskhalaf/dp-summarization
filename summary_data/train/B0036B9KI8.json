      "text": "Because the surface is a bamboo finished surface, it is polished to a very smooth finishing. This makes sliding spread dough a challenge even when using ample flour and semolina. I am coming to this conclusion in comparison with another paddle made of hard wood with a wooden fine grainy finishing, which is perfect when sliding your pizza dough with both flour and semolina. I usually make two pizzas at a time and I prepare them on the 2 paddles in the same time. I suffer from sticky dough with the Norpro Bamboo, where as the other hardwood paddle slides into the oven like a breeze.",

The bamboo does tend to grip on to the dough a bit too much, though. I've tried corn meal, bread flour, and AP flour to lubricate it, but it still does occasionally have a little bit of trouble coming off the peel. Even still, I have not had any disasters yet. It is essential for baking pizzas, making one's life a whole lot easier. I haven't tried any inverted cookie sheet methods before, but I am satisfied with this. Good buy!",

And I think it's all in the wrist technique to get the pizza on the peel! Came sealed in shrink wrap. My gift wrapping of it was entertaining.

Even with using a lot of cornmeal on the paddle, the dough still sticks to it and then you end up with a pizza ball instead of a nice pizza. I hope that it gets better with age.",
