The MMR-88 gives me access to the local am/fm stations during power outages when TV is not available.

If the solar panel on the top isn't enough, the hand-crank does a great job of keeping it charged well enough to put out plenty of crystal clear sound out of this perfectly portable little radio. The flashlight on the side comes with 4 modes: steady bright, steady dim, blinking bright and SOS bright. I'd carry this in my backpack on any hiking trip, camping trip, or to go watch the Pikes Peak Hill Climb of course.",
