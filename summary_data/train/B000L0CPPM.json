I added a little bit to the length and depth of each shelf that was recommended in the instruction sheet. My shelves are 28.625\" x 9.50\". The corners of the back of the shelves were cut off using 3.375\" instead of the 3.19\" recommended in the instruction sheet. The shelves fit perfectly. There is plenty of room in front of the shelves for your tall tools and items to stand upright.",

I paid my handyman to drill holes on the outside and screw in the shelves which hold less than 10 pounds of product each. I have over $300.00 invested in this mistake.",

      "text": "It assembled easily, and seems to stay together fine (make sure you press the pieces together until you hear a \"pop\" sound, otherwise they will fall apart). I would have liked more options for shelving, but I had to resort to cutting my own. I purchased some standard 3/4\" coated chipboard shelving and cut it. The shelf space is not rectangular-- some diagonal cuts on the back corners will help for a good fit, but you'll need some basic tools and a reasonable place to do the cutting.",

Took about 20 minutes to put together with my daughter holding the pieces while I banged them in place with the rubber mallet. Shelves are not included. We use the shed for tall items like shovels and brooms. We put the shed in our garage. Not sure how waterproof this would be if put outside because the top piece would not snap on without a tiny gap on each side. Overall good quality for the money.",

Buying two smaller sheds provides same space of a larger shed and provides me the option of placing one shed at a different location. High quality, easy assemble. I assembled it in about 30 minutes. You have to provide your own shelves. That was simple. I took the shelve measurements, went to Home Depot and they cut me 8 shelves (4 for each shed). Love the Product",
