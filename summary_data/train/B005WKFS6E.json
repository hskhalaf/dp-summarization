It is worth every cent. It makes a very noticeable difference on shine, manageability, etc. Note: This shampoo does not produce a big lather and you do not need to use very much at all or wash hair twice - don't worry about that. Just use it.",

It works best for my dry, fine hair if I leave it in at least 20-30 minutes. I sit under a hooded dryer to warm this conditioner every other wash day. About 15 minutes is sufficient. I\u2019ve not yet tried the shampoo, but I think I might. Overall, I like this product a lot and will purchase it again. It would be a \u2018holy grail\u2019 if not for the price.",

Good marketing strategy, because I am hooked. For me, it is great as the basic maintenance product because it does not weigh my hair down with a heavy residue, and gives my hair body and volume. I shampoo every day, and use this product 4 times per week. I use a clarifying shampoo once a week, and a purple color maintenance shampoo twice a week.",

My hair is much easier to deal with. I'll continue using it. On the market there are all kinds of shampoos and conditioners that I have used, but for me, I'll stay with the PETER THOMAS ROTH brand.",
