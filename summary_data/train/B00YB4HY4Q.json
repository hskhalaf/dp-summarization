Never had such a slippery pair of shoes. Internal cushioning is limited.",

      "text": "This Merrell (All Out Crush Light) shoe is absolutely great. I ran my first woodland trail marathon in them last weekend. I believe they made quite some difference. They are like a cross-over between road running shoes and true trail shoes, which makes them comfy, very light weight and with excellent grip on wet woodland trails & tarmac walks. Which makes them in my eyes the perfect shoes for soft natural trail runs. But be careful if you want to run longer distances on a road with them as well, they are quite slippery on wet autumn days if you run on concrete road surfaces or manhole covers. All in all I am more than happy with my purchase.",

They're very comfortable to have on and might be the most breathable runners I've ever had, but the trade off is both hard surfaces (tarmac/concrete) and rough surfaces (stone shingle) are incredibly uncomfortable to run on. Would not recommend, though I will try other, heavier merrell's.",
