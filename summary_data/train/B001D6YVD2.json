      "text": "Arrived in one piece which was I'm sure super annoying to the postal service but much appreciated on my end. I've used many different post hole diggers but I really like this one. It seems easier to use and more efficient at removal of dirt than most. The only issue I have is there are several nuts/bolts that want to loosen which gives an awkward feel and less driving force during digging. It is typically the center nut and bolt that connects the two handles. When this occurs I simply re-tighten but might look at some locking nuts. Overall it works as advertised and I'd say better than most.",

But, not Heavy Duty, so after about 40 \"hard holes\" in rock and root area the hinge point is worn out. I would have paid more for Heavy Duty Model but could not find one quickly on Amazon. OK value for the cost, so even though it is worn out, I am not returning it (because of the hard use).",
