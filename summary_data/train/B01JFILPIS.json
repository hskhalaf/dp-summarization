The holographic effect also makes these a little more unique and special than regular window film. I used the mosaic style film in our bathrooms and laundry room where I didn't feel like purchasing a rod and curtain set. I only cover the bottom portion of the window. So far, so good! No bubbling or peeling as long as you put them on tightly. Use a ruler or gift card as you go to remove bubbles.",

I would love to try some of the different patterns they offer. Instillation was very simple, and I have not had any issues with the film bubbling, lifting, or peeling off.

My bedroom window is on the first floor facing the street, so I needed something to increase privacy. I hoped that this film plus curtains would do the trick, but there's no way I would have felt comfortable changing. That being said, other purchasers seems to disagree with me, so maybe I'm just picky. I have applied other window films before, and this one was no different-- application is pretty easy, if it a bit of a pain.",

Being a school setting, it cannot be an item that permanently adheres to the glass - therefore, this \"static\" product is ideal. It is very easy to apply and remove. This was perfect and affords an beautifully subtle iridescent sheen amidst the tiny square pattern. I've received compliments on its appearance and had more than enough on the roll to share with some of my colleagues. Delivery was quick and the roll of window film was in excellent condition upon arrival. I highly recommend!!",

I did use the remainder on a shaded bathroom window and that has held up well, no curling. Sadly, I will be removing this and replacing it with something else.",
