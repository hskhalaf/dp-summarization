I was a little sketched out buying lip gloss from amazon but when I was opening it, it was easy to tell it was brand new: there was no gloss at or around the rim and once I used it, there was (if that makes sense).",

The new, much bigger applicator is part of the problem. Very disappointing in that respect. I've also decided that the Revlon luminous lip glosses are too shiny - looks like glitter on your lips.",

This gloss can be applied over most natural lip colors and look very nice. It feels so nice on my lips, I will say it comes off a little bit on the faster side, but this can also be because I've worn while eating and drinking so I guess in retrospect it holds pretty well.
