I returned this sanitizer and went to the stove top boiling method without changing anything else about my set up and had much lower bacteria levels. Making me think that this device wasn't doing what it claimed. Also, I didn't realize it until I used it, but this device does not dry bottles which is a bit disappointing. In my opinion, it's worth spending a little more on a sterilizer that also dries for just stick to the old fashioned method.",

The size and design (how you can use the large or small basket by itself) is nice, but you always have TONS of condensation after it runs the cycle. So much so that even when you take the bottles and things out after a few hours they are still wet and dripping. My counters are always soaked by the time I take everything out and empty out the remaining water in the bottom of the machine. Maybe this is how all sterilizers work? But I\u2019m not really a fan of that part.",

Dr Browns 8oz bottle is almost identical in size to others out there as well so there must be a good amount of bottles that don\u2019t fit. They really should specify that this only fits THEIR 11oz bottles and other standard 8oz bottles do not fit.

The Wabi would sanitize and completely dry so you could put the bottle pieces away. With the avent, you\u2019d need to put them on a drying rack which to me, voids the sanitizing!

      "text": "We been using this sterilizer for a month now is quite good and sturdy. We love the space it has for all kind of bottles and simplicity / sleek design for the unit. It does a fine job for a sterilizer and the only thing I do wish it had was a dryer too, along with the sterilizer, but otherwise it is a fine unit and would surely recommend this. We use this atleast 2 times a day for all kind of bottles, baby nipples, pacifiers, etc and then dry them out manually and it does the job. I would recommend this unit",

    "description": "The Philips Avent 3-in-1 Electric Steam Sterilizer SCF284/05 uses natural steam to kill 99.9% of germs and bacteria in just 6 minutes. Before sterilizing, wash items in warm, soapy water or the dishwasher. When they're clean, place them in the sterilizer. Fill the sterilizer basin with 100ml of water. Plug the sterilizer in to any standard electrical outlet and switch on. The sterilizing cycle will run for 6 minutes and then the sterilizer will automatically shut off for energy savings and safety. The 3-in-1 Electric Steam Sterilizer has an adjustable modular design. This gives you the option of using a small configuration for things like pacifiers, a medium configuration for breast pumps, toddler plates and utensils, or a large configuration for up to 6 Philips Avent bottles of any size. The sterilizer can be neatly tucked away on a countertop because it takes up minimal space in your kitchen. If the lid is unopened, contents will remain sterile and ready for their next use for up to 24 hours. The Philips Avent 3-in-1 Electric Steam Sterilizer is backed by a 2-year warranty.\n\nMANUFACTURER CONTACT INFORMATION\nCustomer help-line at 1-800-542-8368",
