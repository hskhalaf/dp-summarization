My old battery operated cutter couldn't handle larger woody stems; required 3 charged batteries for a day's work; and had a hand grip that was uncomfortable for me. Battery charging took at least 8 hrs. With this new cutter, I can charge the battery quickly and knock out the trimming. The grip is comfortable and adjustable for both man and woman. Highly recommend the tool. Excellent",

She listened to me, got the message right the first time and after ANOTHER very long wait she finished up and the part is on the way to me. Good for Chelsea, but not so good for Greenworks.",

I attempted to re-charge the battery, and it would not hold a charge. I called Amazon to report this issue, and requested a replacement battery. The Amazon representative informed me that the window had closed for returns, and that they would contact the manufacturer and get back to me. This never happened.

Sick and tired of getting crap from Amazon. Follow-up. One of the connectors on the battery were bent, not allowing it to slide into the groove on the edges.
