I've been using this one for 3 weeks now and have had a headache everyday and minor gastrointestinal upset. I'm not sure if it's because I switched brands or this one just isn't sitting well with me. Navitas always gave me a little energy burst where this brand does not. So maybe it's a caffeine thing. Either way, I won't buy this one again.",

I decided to try it anyway, thinking maybe it was in the packaging, or something. No, the taste was just like the smell. I'm afraid to use it, so now I will have to reorder from another company and I have wasted money I cannot afford to waste.",
