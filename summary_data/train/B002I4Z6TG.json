My hair stylist uses this straightener and every time she does my hair it comes out so silky and straight. I finally bought it for myself and it works wonders. Just be careful because it gets HOT - even with my coarse and curly hair I only put it to 410, so I recommend starting lower than you think and working up from there.",

My previous flat irons (CHI & Rusk) have lasted for years. I did order another unit in November because I liked it so much. Fingers crossed this one lasts at least one year.",

This croc flat iron was half the price and I was unsure about its quality. But it\u2019s been almost 2 years it\u2019s still holding up great! The negative charged ions in a titanium flat iron give the hair a natural shine. I have really long, thick & curly hair. And only have to pass the flatiron through each piece twice before moving on the the next. Love this flat iron and will purchase another Croc flatiron before going back to the more expensive keratin complex flat iron. They\u2019re basically the same the croc is just more affordable",

The iron comes on at 410 and cannot be preset to a specific number as my old one. I do like that the iron is wider and it does a more than adequate job, but I really am not pleased about the grip or the temp control.",
