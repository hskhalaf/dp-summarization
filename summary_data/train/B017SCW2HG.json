While it may not be as popular as some of Asics\u2019 flagship stability shoes, it delivers a firm and responsive ride that slight to moderate overpronators should be very comfortable with. With average price point, runners can expect a durable shoe with lots of comfort and reliability for the rigors of day to day running.",

I didn't want to pack a pair of dress shoes just to wear a couple of times during a 2 week trip. These all black running shoes served the purpose. Since I've been running in the first pair weekly for the past year, I figured a new pair would serve the same purpose on this trip.",
