I deeply regret this purchase. Even before it broke, I had reverted to the headset that came with my X-Box Live subscription. The mute thing is also a bummer. I was never sure if I was muted or not.

Even better, there are no cords to trip over or cables to yank free when the action heats up. The headset includes an adjustable noise-canceling microphone that blocks out unwanted background noise, along with a high-quality earpiece with crystal-clear sound that ensures you never miss a command (or an insult). And unlike many cheaper models, this headset is both rugged and lightweight, with a snug fit that feels comfortable for hours of consecutive gameplay. The device runs for up to six hours per battery charge, giving you plenty of juice each gaming session. U.S. gamers receive an added bonus thanks to the free two-month Xbox Live trial subscription that comes with each headset. Whether you're a talkative sports junkie or a natural-born commando leader, the Logitech headset is a perfect fit. The headset requires an Xbox Live-enabled game and an Xbox Live broadband subscription to operate. \n\n What's in the Box\nCordless headset, Xbox communicator, AC adapter, rechargeable batteries, setup guide, two-month Xbox Live subscription (U.S. only).",
