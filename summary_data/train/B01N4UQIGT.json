One had a vertical purple line, the other a horizontal white line, with random pixels always white. We tried the highest quality HDMI cables and had the same result with two separate computers. Interestingly, Windows 10 does not automatically recognize the monitor, even though it does recognize most others. Overall, a disappointing experience and we ultimately returned both the original purchase and its replacement, not wanting to waste our time with a third attempt.",

But the promises of B&O quality got me and I regret that as well. The monitor is very decent and I can't complain but I wish I would have gotten LED. These are older units so anyone purchasing this just know that you may be disappointed with the quality although the value is definitely there. Hope this helps!

My office does a mix of graphic design, instructional design, multimedia, and other graphics heavy work. The colors are rich and very well defined. The refresh rate ensures that all images are clean. The matte finish keeps glare to a minimum from any light source. The only draw back to these monitors are the function buttons. The buttons will trigger if you breathe on them wrong. Otherwise, after installing a pair of these at more than 40 work stations, my office has had nothing but rave reviews.",

My solution has been to set the monitor's screen saver to ON and prevent the PC from going to sleep or hibernating. I suspect there is a faulty solder joint somewhere in the monitor's circuitry that is causing this. Once it reaches operating temperature, it works flawlessly.",

I wouldn't say it looks as crisp or as clear as the laptop display, but as my job requires 6-8 hours of computer time, it works well. The one thing I noticed right away is that the monitor is very bright. As a preference, I had to dim the display quite a bit, but for those that want something bright and vibrant, this is a good choice. I didn't, and still don't, have any problems with ports, pixels, adjustments, etc. Overall it's a great monitor.",

I couldn't be happier with the quality of this thing. If it dies in less than 5 years I will change my rating.

      "text": "I have had this for about a month. It's been great! I work from home and it's improved my work life greatly. Large, super clear display with great brightness and contrast. I've even used it to watch a game, while I watched another game on a bigger tv (like my own sports bar!). The controls are a little wonky, since they are raised dots that are touch-sensitive and easy to accidentally bump, but nowhere near a major deal, to me. Audio is O.K. Typical audio for any LED/LCD monitor or TV. I see it as a bonus, since monitors rarely have audio. I've only used HDMI on it.",

But let's be real... do any of us ever do that? lol. This monitor performs as expected and it looks gorgeous while doing it. I bought three of them, bought the VESA adapters, and put them on a VESA stand. They all perform and look amazing. I use them for web development, office work, and video games. My only request is that in the next iteration of them that they build the VESA mounts into the monitor instead of requiring a third-party adapter.",

The poorly designed teeny controls to adjust screen dont work well my my larger hands. All in all, if can be acquired via amazon warehouse at deep discount, a good buy. Would buy again. If i were to do a multi-monitor setup, i would probably use these, unless the exact same bezel design were available with a faster response time.",

I would have thought otherwise but it is definitely better with the RGB.

Keep in mind that there is about a quarter of an inch black edge around the image even though some websites advertise this monitor as an edge to edge screen. The sound quality is okay but if you plan on listening to music I can definitely recommend getting external speakers. I only use these monitors for business purposes and photo editing.",
