Its been great for heavy leather, vinyl and the many layers of fabrics I use for making tote bags. When I hear a satisfying \"click\" as I'm punching a hole I know it's going to be perfect. I mostly use it for rivets, rivet snaps and magnetic snaps. I take my tools seriously and this is a wonderful tool, especially for the price.",

One of the holes is too tight and the next one is too loose. I would use my drill to make a new hole, it would do the job, but sometimes it would scratch the belt or the hole would be too small/too big. Also, my wife has purses where she'd like the strap adjusted. This device works so well and I can't believe it's taken me this long to purchase one. Do not hesitate to buy this - high quality craftsmanship and it works just great!",

I wasn't sure if this would work on fabric but it was amazing!! I had 2 layers of satin and 2 layers of interfacing. I added an extra layer of interfacing on the outside just to punch through. It worked perfectly. It isn't a sewing tool I will need often, but when I do, I am sure glad I have this. The punch is very sharp and did not fray the fabric at all. Highly recommended to have in your sewing arsenal.",

It is super simple and makes holes that are just as clean as the ones from the factory. So it is an excellent tool, that works great and was a great deal for the money; I recommend it.",

When trying it out, with the larges hole punch, on 8oz leather, the edge of the punch/cutter rolled inward...... now it's useless. And as far as I can tell, the cutters are NOT replaceable. Next, the pivot on the handle side is loose, flexes, and binds when trying to use the device. Overall, this is just junk! This one is going into the trash!!",

The price was a little higher than some of the others, but with the leverage mechanism it makes using it very easy and worth the \"little\" higher price.

      "text": "I bought this hole punch because the other 2 leather punches I had just ended up falling apart. This one feels much more well made. It punches holes beautifully and is easy to use. The punch also is very portable and I close it's handle and clip it shut ( make sure you turn punch so it is in between punches... the it can use the clip and stay shut) I am not getting paid or anything for my review, it is my personal observation. This is a good leather punch and I would recommend it !",

Pretty neat and easy to use tool. Dislikes as of right now are the stubby Phillip's head screw driver that only fits in tiny hands. No biggie seeing that I have thousands vested in tools anyhow. Also the rotary head/ locking clip are super stiff. Most likely from being new still. May loosen up the more i use them. Overall i would purchase again!",

Once in position, I can see that the wheel's tightness allows it to cut holes cleanly even through dense material.",

It is a thoughtful tool that comes with a measuring scale, an awl to mark a location and remove chads and extra cutting \"pads\". It works and can produce, with care, clear holes. But some simple improvements are needed: 1) a black cutting tube, against a black belt makes centering the cutter harder than necessary. The awl needs a larger handle; the current handle is so thin (small diameter) it can slip, dangerously. The measuring scale is clear plastic: it is hard to see the scale's black markings, against a black belt. This review is mostly a safety warning and in the hope the manufacturer address these issues.",

So I'd say that if you have a nice belt you don't want to risk messing up it is probably worth, or of course if you plan to be punching lots of holes. The product was easy to operate, and made a clean hole in my belt with little trouble.",

I think they should have made the whole plate metal; but they do give you extras so that\u2019s good. When punching through some fabrics I find it helps to rotate the tool once completely compressed in fabric. This makes the cut clean and complete. Other than that this tool works well.",
