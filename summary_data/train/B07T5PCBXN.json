After a few weeks of wearing the inside of the heel area has completely worn away. Do not waste your money, these are not for hiking, just for fashion. The soft outer construction means your foot will move around inside the boot after a few weeks usage and this will cause heel rub. Now an expensive pair of gardening boots.",

They are comfortable once they seat in, a really nice boot, great style, I hope they last.",

Use beeswax to waterproof if you buy nubuck leather,DONT use normal boot polish. Just seen identical boots on other buying sites for between \u00a320 and \u00a325,these boots must all come from the same factory with different manufacturers badges on.RIP OFF.",

Stepping into to work with these bad boys on everyone said I was ghetto-tastic. While I didn't know what that meant the smiling faces that met me and my new purchases confirmed that my staff do indeed love me despite their regular feedback to HR and senior management saying otherwise. WILL BUY AGAIN! :)",

The tree logo on the back began to scratch away and after about 3 weeks the heel fell off. This is all through general wear a few days a week. Definitely not what you\u2019d expect from Timberland.",
