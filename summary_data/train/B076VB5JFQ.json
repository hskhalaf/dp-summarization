But to the product at hand, I chose this Toshiba model for it's brand recognition and quality. The 1100 watts gives me plenty of power to play with. In fact, surprising power! Toshiba's 1100 watts of today exceeds in performance, in my opinion, the 1500 watt rating of my old unit. It's scary effective, and apparently a best seller. Instructions for use are a tiny bit complicated, though well documented. And only Four Stars for the clunky, bang-shut door when closing.",

I had to add a little more for a big potato, but it came out very evenly-cooked. No tough or black ends. Potatoes and reheating is my #1 use of a microwave. It's even easy to set the clock and start or mute the touchpad beeping. So far, very good!",

Cooking times are consistent and it's easy to use, although if you're someone who likes to be very specific with your timing settings, i.e. 2:17, then you need to realize that unlike many other ovens you have to go through a couple of steps to do this because hitting any of the numbered buttons starts the oven instantly for that many minutes. So if you started to type the 2:17 above, the microwave is going to turn on as soon as you hit \"2\" for 2:00 minutes. You have to do 'timed cooking' if you want to be specific, which is a bit annoying since it requires extra steps.",

For example, if you want to microwave an item for 30 seconds, you can't just tap out \"30\" on the timed settings and hit \"start.\" You'll get 3 minutes or sometimes 30 minutes. To override this default setting, you have to find the tiny touch button that says \"cook time,\" hit this button and then tap the time you want. Same with the popcorn setting. You have to tap the \"popcorn\" touch button twice or you'll be lucky if half your bag of microwave popcorn pops. Definitely not recommended.",

      "text": "Ordered this when our last one abruptly died. This one cooks faster than the one we had previously, and it does so with less noise. One feature I really like about it is, once you open the door the tones that sound at the end of cooking, stop; our previous oven would do all five tones no matter whether or not the door was opened. The only stainless steel here is the trim on the front; the rest is painted mild steel. Good buy for the price. Will see how long it lasts.",
