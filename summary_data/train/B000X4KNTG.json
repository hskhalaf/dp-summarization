If any adjustable pliers were more powerful than Knipex - the histories do not tell us. I've got 'em all - irwin, craftsmen, klien, channel lock (which are very very big and strong) but these are the best. The teeth are made of mithril and have a +3 grip vs. iron. Thru some form of elvish magic they seem 1/3 lighter than channel lock yet grip as tho the fate of middle earth depended on them. Buy them now!!!!!!!",

I already had the parallel version, which are fantastic, but often times I need the wider range of opening that these offer. At the tip is a beefy parallel, grooved section that's great for grabbing and leveraging things, as well as holding a nut for quick assembly. Farther back is the business end that excels in holding a larger nut. The spring button is easy to use and extremely helpful. Rubber hasn't budged on any of the handles yet. I literally tossed all my cheaper pliers, replacing them with Knipex a little at a time to easy the $ting.",

    "description": "Style:Pliers SetThis popular pliers set is a great starter set for all of your push-button cobra water pump pliers. The set includes all the most popular size pliers including a 7-inch, 10-inch and 12-inch.Equipped with an anti-pinching guard to prevent finger crushing.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\nSelf locking on pipes and nuts (view larger).No more time-consuming test-adjusting to achieve the correct size. With the Knipex Cobra water pump pliers, you can simply position the upper jaw to the workpiece, push the button, and close the lower jaw. And you'll also be able to say goodbye to blood blisters you get with other gripping pliers. With safety its first priority, Knipex has designed a built-in pinch guard that prevents blood blisters on your hand.\n\nThe unique self-locking adjustment and induction hardened gripping teeth means that once it's set, it stays. There's no slipping and no need to waste strength squeezing the pliers \u2014 ensuring operator safety and more efficient work. Cobra's unique jaw configuration can grip any shape object \u2014 flat, round, hex, or square. It also eliminates nut burring to avoid stripping pipes, nuts, or bolts. Additionally, the Cobra's newly redesigned adjustment provides 30 percent more gripping capacity than previous models.\n\nA simple push of the patented push button adjustment maintains jaw size setting and gives you the correct size opening every time. Just position the upper jaw to the workpiece, push the button, adjust the opening, and close the lower jaw. And it's easily done with just one hand for trouble-free operation in confined spaces. \n\nCobra water pump pliers are constructed from chrome vanadium electric steel, an innovative high alloy, oil tempered steel that ensures longevity. And their thin head design helps you get into spaces other pliers can't, so there's no need to change tools when working in tight confines. \n\nPatented push button system (view larger).QUALITY IN EVERY DETAIL\nSometimes we give our pliers a really hard time. We try to destroy them to find out what makes them good and long-lasting. Because we don't want to leave anything to chance, we take a long, careful look. \n\nThe steel Knipex uses is precisely hardened with a maximum of 0.8 percent carbon and defined parts of chromium and vanadium, guaranteeing optimum cutting performance and service life \u2014 even though it requires special production and costs a bit more. But our high product demands require this.\n\nThe rivet of our high-leverage diagonal cutter also has to stand up to a lot of stress. That's why we literally give it backup: we forge it straight onto the pliers. This means extra effort as we have to precision mill the rivet to a few hundredth millimeters. But satisfied users are worth this effort.\n\nKnipex also looks closely at the small details. The angles, the sharpness, the hardness, the toughness of the cutting edges. The precision and smooth movement of the joint. The handle design and the finish. We keep reviewing these subjects, we research, we test, and we improve our pliers.\n\nABOUT KNIPEX\nHeadquartered in Wuppertal, Germany, Knipex is an independently-owned family enterprise steeped in tradition and specializing in the manufacturing of high-quality pliers. It all started back in 1882 when C. Gustav Putsch set up his own forge shop in Cronenberg (now a suburb of Wuppertal), and the company is now run by a fourth generation of that family. The world's leading brand in pliers today, Knipex is focused on the performance, service life, and ergonomics of its tools in order to meet the high expectations of professional users.\n\n00 20 06 US1 COBRA PLIERS, 3-PIECE SET\nAT A GLANCE\n * Adjustment at the touch of a button directly on the workpiece\n * Fast, firm adjustment directly on the workpiece\n * Self-locking on pipes and nuts: no slipping on the workpiece and low hand force required\n * Gripping surfaces with special hardened teeth\n * Pinch guard prevents operators' fingers from being pinched\n * Chrome vanadium heavy-duty steel, forged and oil-hardened\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\n7-1/4-inch pliers (87 01 180; view larger).\n10-inch pliers (87 01 250; view larger).\n12-inch pliers (87 01 300; view larger).\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nFast adjustment directly on the work piece eliminates time-consuming test adjusting of the correct opening size.
