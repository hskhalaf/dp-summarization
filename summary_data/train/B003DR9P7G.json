      "text": "This product does an excellent job holding an acoustic guitar, a banjo and a ninja sword I have displayed in my living areas! Both items that I have displayed using this item are held vertically, but I have no doubt that if you really like the style of this mount it would also hold items horizontally if two mounts were used. The wood backing of this mount seems as if it could be painted or stained as well because the rubber hands that hold the item can be removed making this task easier if necessary.",

Keeps it flush against the side wall of my closet for easy access whenever I may need it to answer my front door, etc. The soft padding prevents your shotgun from getting scratched if you just want to use it for display purpose. I like the small design and ease of installation. It comes with the wall inserts and screws, so it's easy and quick to install.",

Only wish there was a stud there where I mounted but the mounting screws are the top end type. They have the heavy duty anchor that screws in. Also the hanger is covered very well to protect your firearm. Well worth the price. If you are worried about security then don't hang on the wall and store in a safe. Also you could put a wire lock safety on the gun but that defeats the purpose here.",

It also rotates to allow the gun to hang straight no matter what kind of grip or stock you have. It's great for allowing you to hang a firearm anywhere you want and saves a lot of wall space horizontally (vs a traditional gun rack). The hooks are nicely padded, too, to minimize wear on the finish of a wood stock. Recommended if you need a hanger for a single long gun.",

It took about 10 minutes to mount all told so I am pretty happy. I don't really like the vertical hanging look but that is my aesthetic opinion and has nothing to do with the quality of the product or wether it works as designed which it does very well. :)",
