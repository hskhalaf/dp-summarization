Colourful games look great on it. Manufacturers need to improve QC. It might be time to move away from IPS and try a VA panel. Update: Just sent back my third back due to BLB and too much glow. The cost of returns is cheaper than the companies to actually do quality control before shipping them out. Until the a new panel comes along that is not a crapshoot like this AUO one that is in all current 1400p144hz IPS screens then I'm bowing out of this bullsh*t",

Can also be used with ULMB for competitive fps games and Gsync is handy if you run into lower than 144 fps. not as fast as your TN screens but with much better colours and viewing angles makes this a solid all rounder. Only 4 stars because it's so expensive",

On the plus sides are: - Very nice build quality, monitor itself looks and feels valuable - 165 Hz working great, no flickering, no noise (no feeps of condensators), no heat - I totally see no ghosting. And this for an IPS panel! Its great :) Viewsonic is an underdog in my view. Underestimated but good. Not perfect (backlight bleeding, but ok for me) so 4 stars.",

There are also times where the monitor turns off and doesn't come back on, but rarely.
