Fierce ingrown hairs and razor burn. \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc I tried a small spot first and didn't have any side effects so I went for the whole shebang. Left it on for 9 minutes. Wiped off with a warm washcloth and boom, silky smooth everywhere! I would recommend layering it a little thick so it works best at getting all the hair. I had some sensitivity afterwards for a few hours but went away quickly, and it was nothing compared to what I was experiencing after shaving. Seriously, I've tried everything and this is BY FAR the best!",

The handle is long enough to reach where I need, it is small enough to fit into small areas, and it doesn't nick or burn me. The reasons I didn't give it five stars are that you sometimes need to go over an area multiple times to catch all the hairs, and the case is poorly designed so that it is difficult to close, and things fall out easily. Overall a good product though.",

I used this on my legs (until I gather the courage for bikini line) for 8 min total, checking around the 6 min mark because I am scared lol Got all the hair except where I applied it too thin, so make sure you really coat the areas you want hair removed. Easy to get off and kinda fun to use the spatula, but ended up using a cloth because, again, I was scared hahah Good for if you're lazy and are tired of razor burn!!!",

      "text": "The best body hair removal product I've found YET! Works great to remove the hair from underarms and on the unmentionables. Way better than Nair and a few other brands. What I like about this product is they have several ways for you to seal it closed so that the formula doesn't go bad. You must twist it closed after use and put the plug bag inside of the top. This extends the life of the product. Other products I used would seem to go bad after a few uses and I would never get my monies worth.",

LMAO \ud83d\ude02 my hair was easily two-and-a-half 3 inches long. 98% of it came off on the first application. I know if I followed up in a week and did it again it would be as smooth as a baby's bottom. It just works.",
