Plus all the ways you can open the screens allowed for me to pet him easily when stressed without him escaping! It's very sturdy too and folds up for easy storage!",

      "text": "Finally got a chance to use our carrier for memorial day weekend . It was our first time traveling with our new pet and we were a bit stressed about how he would handle flying as well as the carrier. Well he must have liked it quite a bit because of all the three of us he slept the best on the red eye. He was not keen being zipped up in it but once in was quite comfortable both times. Really liked the collapsible bowl and nail clippers. We did find opening the inner fur liners a bit cumbersome to both open and close. Besides that quite happy with carrier .",

      "text": "Excellent! I have 2 chi's, 9 lb and 4 lb. Both fit comfortably in this carrier. The expanding sides are so nice! Pups have 2 'porches'. One on each side. The full mesh on the other ends allows pups to see out. The zippers are a bit crazy, so I put marked zipper pulls on certain zippers to make it easier. Would like all zippers to be double zippers. This size fits under Southwest seats with some squishing, which the carrier allows. It is tough to open sides when under seat. Carrier folds to about 3 inches height for storage. Would be nice for carrier to have wheels.",

      "text": "Great carrier. Airline approved. But please take note of the following issues: 1) When the sides are opened, the top part doesn't remain stable and will fall down a little. If the sides are left closed, the top part stays in place without falling down. 2) If your cat does not enjoy being in the carrier, pushing on the sides of the of the carrier will cause it to flip. Not a major issue and probably not exclusive to this carrier only, but if you need your cat to stay in place, despite fighting to get out of the carrier, then you need to invest in a sturdier carrier.",
