Otherwise, they're going back.",

There is one velcro strap so it's easy enough that she can take them on and off. Overall, really great boots and am happy that I bought them.",

They are extremely well made, a reliable product that would last years if a child's foot didn't grow so fast. They are completely waterproof and the tread is phenomenal.
