Similarly, if I set the bag down too hard, it would take the full brunt since it sits at the bottom of the bag. Here's what it looks like after a few minutes of use. The camera is now sunk down and all the contents inside the bag are willy nilly. I do like that the bag has the right depth for my items. I may end up purchasing my own means of adding dividers to the bag...",

It also had space for an additional point and shoot camera. Because of the snug fit, there was no movement within the bag when used. Very comfortable on the back when carrying it. My go-to bag from now on.",

I will still buy a larger bag that houses laptop and camera and camera equipment for long road trips and big travels. But for everyday use this is perfect! Worth Every Penny!",
