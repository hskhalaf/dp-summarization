It was packaged as it had come directly from manufacturer and I do not believe my blender was used. It just made me really question quality control so I returned and went with something else.",

Needless to say, I've stopped using it. It was an okay blender, but could never get a smooth smoothie out of it. It was also a pain to clean. Anyway, if you're going to use your blender for more than the occasional mixed drink, don't waste your money on this one, put down the extra cash for one of the professional ones. I decided I wanted more out of my next blender so I replaced it with a Vitamix.",

And then Cuisinart hurricane caught my eye and I\u2019ve decided to give it a try. So, this blender is VERY powerful! It blends perfect green smoothies for my baby. Even kale and chia seeds are dissolved! It\u2019s on a loud side though. But other than that , I am completely happy with my purchase! For the price-quality ratio this blender is the best value !",

We finally received the replacement today and it's missing the removable \"plug\" in the top. I now get to waste my time returning this and waiting for a vitamix replacement. I'll never order a cuisinart or from this third party ever again. Buyer beware.",

      "text": "Do not buy this blender. I paid $165 for it thinking it would last.....in less than 9 months the bearings went out in the blade mechanism at the bottom of the jar/pitcher. We were getting a metallic taste in our smoothies when we stopped using it. While it was functioning it worked fine though very loud. I had to spend $51 to get it packaged up/mailed (bulky and heavy) back to Cuisinart and $11 to them to send it back.....$62 to get it repaired......not a very good warranty. You could spend half the price and get one that would last a year or more.",

      "text": "Don't want to spend the money on a vitamix? This is the blender to get. I got this a couple days ago and am very satisfied. I feel like it definitely has power - 2.25 hp is 1677 watts of power which is a lot. It hasn't failed to blend anything so far. I've made smoothies and nut milk in it. Clean up is easy. I like it better than the Ninja we had before. It's quieter than the ninja. Feels more substantial than the ninja. Expectations exceeded!!",

      "text": "This is an industrial grade blender in my opinion given how powerful it is an the large capacity. It was way too much blender for us. We prep smoothies and protein shakes two-three times a day for two people. There is sufficient volume here to prep enough solution for 4-6 people and there is no intermediate setting between 0 and low speed. The noise is pretty loud also. would be perfect for a business but not for us at home.",

      "text": "This thing blends like no one's business - a true blending demon. The annoying thing about it is that when you plug it in and turn it on (or if it was already plugged in and on and went to sleep), it has a \"splash screen\" that takes \"forever\" (read: 5 seconds?) to \"welcome you\" to the wonderful world of Cuisinart. This is a blender, not the Starship Enterprise - just turn ON and BLEND.",

      "text": "I purchased this blender in February of this year and 10 months later it no longer works. The digital panel blinks uncontrollably and no longer shows any information - a digital malfunction. This is very disappointing for a $300 plus blender! I never placed any parts in the dishwasher - everything washed by hand. I called Cuisinart and was told I have to mail the unit back to a repair facility and PAY for shipping both ways. That is the most outrageous, poor customer service I have ever encountered. This product is clearly defective and they don't stand behind their appliances. Buyer beware.",

None of that plastic stuff that melts at high rpms. Edit: 1 year later aaaand its broke. The bearing for the blade seized up and is very hard to spin. (Seems lots of other people are having this issue too) This was not used that much, and the most I ever threw at it was a frozen banana in my protein shake. Cant find just a replacement blade assembly for this model anywhere.",
