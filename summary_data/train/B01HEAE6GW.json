These shoes exceeded my expectations: great in the water, good support, excellent traction, easy to shake the rocks and sand out while wearing, quick drying, protected my feet, and look awesome. What's not to love? I climbed rocks both wet and dry, swam, portaged, everything just fine in these shoes. The other guys on the trip were impressed and several mentioned wanting to purchase a pair of these shoes. I can't recommend them enough and plan to purchase another pair.",

I put them through some torture at the Frio River in the Texas hill country with significant amounts of wading in rocky waters which would destroyed most shoes I\u2019ve tried before and these held up without a scratch. They were comfortable except they rubbed a little bit on my arches. Not enough to cause pain or drop a star.

The back strap is loose but the rest of the shoe fits fine. I can try to use the elastic to get it tight all over, but that to try to shore up the back just makes the extra elastic band ridiculously long and event tucking it under the cross straps still leaves several inches past the toe. For the price I expected better. I loved my old ones, but will likely look to a different brand in the future.",

So I exchanged them for a size 10.5 which felt too short by had an appropriate sized toe-box. Returned the 10.5 in favor of 11's again and the threads started unraveling on my first walk around the house and in the garden (not even on a hike or anything like that).",

Their construction and materials are high quality and the fit is true to size. They are very light weight but also provide protection. The footbed is comfortable. One thing though, they don\u2019t provide significant support at the arch or around the foot if you intend to wear them for a lot of walking. Keens do a better job with stability and support. But these Merrell\u2019s are great for what they are. They are not clunky at all and are nice looking. That\u2019s why I have two pair.",

They were stable, they didn't slip on the rocks, and the water drained from them unbelievably fast. We paired them with wetsuit bottoms and wetsuit socks. We were very comfortable in 50-60 degree water. Love these shoes.",

I typically need wide shoes, but these fit really well and don\u2019t become distorted by my thick feet. The materials are holding up really well and the bottoms have barely begun to wear out despite walking many thousands of steps over the past few months. They dry quickly and the ability to walk through just about every terrain, including streams and rivers, is empowering. I\u2019ll be sad when I have to hang them up for winter. Great for any urban/rural hiker. Chicks dig em too ;)",
