They are definitely lower in sugar than a lot of the similar products. So long as I\u2019m paying less than $2 a bar for these, I\u2019m satisfied. I was worried about the freshness of this order, especially since they were delivered on a hot, humid day, but they were fine. Will re-order in the future",

I doubt i will finish them and certainly won't use them on intended road trip. waste of my money as they are not returnable. Thanks but NO thanks.",

I carelessly cracked one of my teeth crunching into one. Also, although well within the expiry date, the Cinnamon Pecan smelled and tasted somewhat rancid. Searching online, I read that pecans become rancid quickly in warm environments, so perhaps storage conditions were less than optimum. Or perhaps it was just the cinnamon combined with my imagination! I purchased a different variety, Caramel Almond & Seat Salt, also ships from and sold by Amazon, and found them very satisfactory. Almost too much so, as I ate three the day they arrived!",

They are incredibly tasty, and easy to throw in your purse, lunch box, or in your vehicle. Obviously they have chocolate so if you keep them at high temperatures the chocolate will melt. I just threw them in the freezer, and once the chocolate was re solidified I took them out to munch on.",
