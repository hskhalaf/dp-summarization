At the slightest rain or even heavy dew during an early morning drive, it will run off the treated trim onto any nearby surface leaving an oily, hazy residue. It's not permanent nor does it cause lasting damage but it looks awful and require a the vehicle completely again to remove... during which the remaining original aoplication of VRP is washed away as well. Point is, other products do not have this shortcoming, go with them. Strongly recommend against spending money on this.",

Be bad at your self for that one. Aside from that. Try cleaning the plastics an rubber. With degreaser/alcohol before applying. No product will last on a dirty surface.

I said no, I use auto-wash and apply Chemical Guys product to tires only last time. Anyway, he thought my car looked great. That's it. I've used 4 times still have plenty left. 5 Stars *",
