What arrived was more or less ropes from hardware store cut inaccurately to length and transparent Scotch tape wrapped around the ends (NO BRAIDING). The rope was already \"fraying\" not only at the ends but other areas of the rope as well. AGAIN, what is pictured is not what they are selling. SEE PICTURES",

To my pleasant surprise the ends were beautifully finished and after a month of use they are a solid as new. I'm shocked these ropes are sold for this price. They have an excellent feel in the hand, the dock end loop is well manufactured. The rope is supple, holds knots excellently and appears durable in the month or so of my use. Highly recommended.",
