There is an entire industry growing up for providing work arounds for Nikon's short comings like converting .NEF files to something accessible like .JPG. Nikon provides software allegedly for this purpose but it just doesn't work. I never got snapbridge to work in any useful way. I managed to transfer a few photos to the cloud, eventually, but definately no video - snapbridge needs a lot of time to do not much. Transfer using memory cards is way more practical.",
