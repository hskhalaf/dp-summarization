The flexibility of the poles allowed me to slightly rock back and forth in the chair without worrying that it would break. Money well spent. [EDIT 4/9/2018: After having used this chair for a few times, my biggest complaint is that the interchangeable feet often are DIFFICULT to remove, particularly after a heavier person (like my grandpa) has sat on it.] If you found this review helpful, please hit the \"Yes\" button to encourage me to write more.

The chair easily toppled backwards if you lean. I liked the color and the exchangeable feet, however, the feet did slip off too easily and fell out when I lifted the chair off the ground.

You do have to stretch the cloth a bit to get the last leg in but not too hard, they also have finger loops for you to use to pull the pocket over the leg. Hopefully this will hold up well over time, but so far so good!",

I've used it now for a few months and can report I am very happy with the chair overall. The chair is sturdy, comfortable and easy to assembly and take down. The ball feel were especially great for using the chair on a grass surface watching fireworks. I also like that the ball feet can be removed and exchanged with standard feet based on ground conditions. Highly recommended!",

The problem is that the end caps that secure the shock cords frequently get caught on the removable footpads or on the cloth seat material. This happened on both chairs that were purchased months apart. On one chair the end caps are permanently stuck inside the \u2018removable\u2019 feet - rendering them now nonremovable. The other one suffered broken shock cords when trying to remove the feet. If you never disassemble the chair, I assume it would work fine.",

Like the instructions said it is a little hard to assemble the first couple of times but has wore in nicely. Holds my 225# in great comfort. Took it on a bike trail in Nebraska, totally awesome to have a comfortable place to sit at every stop. Great for campfires, just the right height. Will keep in the trunk of my car for soccer games.",

Larger feet snap right onto the smaller ones so you only need to keep track of the easier to see large ones. Pocket is perfect for hankie or cell phone. A great design!",
