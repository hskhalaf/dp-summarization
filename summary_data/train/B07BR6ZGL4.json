OEM Genuine makes the purchase very nice since the systems are shipped fast, and come with a simple install. No garbage software except McAfee and that is a pretty easy removal. In all I am a very satisfied customer. If you are looking to buy we have these deployed for teachers and counselors in a High School and they not only hold up so far, but do the job well.",
