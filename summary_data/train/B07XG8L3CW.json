      "text": "I have struggled to find a decent pair of wireless headphones but really pleased with this purchase. I found my previous headphones never stayed in my ears especially at the gym so love that these come with a comfortable hook around ear. Sound quality is very clear. I can use for just over 6 hours before it needs to be recharged which is pretty normal for wireless headphones. Comes with auto pairing so as soon as I switch on my Bluetooth on my phone it pairs with the headphones. Definitely recommend as one of the best wireless headphones I have used so far.",

I was hoping for something like the Sennheiser in-ear sport earphones that I have been using for years, but without the wire connection. Even with the bass frequencies turned right up in iTunes Equaliser (32, 64, 125 Hz) and the treble turned down a third for the 8k and 16k, the sound was very trebly. So I returned them straight away. A shame really because visually the design of the charging case is good.",

I went for a 10k run and they were only both connected for around 10% of the run. Frequently dropping in one or both ears.

The sound from the earbuds is clear although there's not a lot of depth to the sound. It's in stereo as I can hear the music play from left to right in some songs. They're a decent set of earphones.",

Cable included as well) - Good grip in ears - Functions accessible from headphones multifunction buttons Improvement Opportunities: - Charging case size. If you prefer something small to carry in your pocket, this is probably not for you. The is slightly big. I definitely recommend these headphones",

For me, the low end & high end of the music is just right The length of time that they can be used, lasts me over a week, walking 2.5 hours a day., & put back in their case to recharge.

      "text": "These are the best bluetooth earbuds I've ever tried. I have small ears and very narrow ear canals so finding earbuds that stay in my ears without hurting is near impossible until I tried these. The sound quality is great and work brilliantly for music, audiobooks and phone calls. Easy to set up and connect to your phone and great instructions if you need to reset them. I cannot fault these in any way. They are light weight, and flexible ear arms. They stay charged for ages and the charging case fits great in my small handbag.",

Pairing with my phone was simple amd works. Music quality is amazing, really happy with the sound. However I noticed a small and short crackling noise ever so often randomly during playback. Not disruptive to the music thought. For the price they are absolutely perfect. Especially that they hold on my ears even during sport like running. Finally headphones that don't fall out! The 3 different ear piece adapter make sure of this. 5 star. When in doing get them, I didn't regret it.",

I have tested myself and the sound quality is also great! High loud volume and well defined. I think this is a good value for the money. Also (as current covid19 situation) we clean them every day and there is no problem with getting them wet. My wife is not the most careful person with technology and so far they are resisting very well. She is happy with this purchase. Thanks!",

These have been great! The sound is clear, it cancels out any noise & they look very nice too. I couldn\u2019t ever afford the expensive brands but these look really cool & are a fraction of the price. I\u2019m really happy with my purchase.",
