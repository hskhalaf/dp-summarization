It\u2019s trying too much to feel like a trainer. If I wanted to wear a trainer I\u2019d wear a trainer! DO NOT BUY! Go for the KSO Evo instead.",

Most of my running shoes are destroyed within 2 to 3 month's, so we shall see. However, I can feel how beneficial these shoes can be, they have a nice balance to them.",

I feel connected and stable and they\u2019re soft and comfortable too. It took me three goes to get correct size. Gradually decreasing each time. Glad I persisted though. Fitting wise I\u2019m normal width 11 and got to 10-10.5 for best fit. Should be snug. I use thin injinji or vibram toe socks too.",

Get some \u201ctoe socks\u201d. It\u2019ll keep the trainers fresh. Overall I can only conclude that standard trainers are mitten shaped because they\u2019re easier to make and not better.
