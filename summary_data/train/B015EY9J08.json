The only downside is it is LOUD. A non-issue in a large conference room but if you were buying this for movies at home it would be prohibitively loud and would ruin the viewing experience.",

      "text": "This is a great little projector for many purposes. I bought it because I needed a battery driven projector to be used in the field or in the studio, to project images onto a model for photography purposes. However, this is also powerful enough to give an actual presentation, if needed, or as a backup for my talks at camera clubs, in case the main projector dies mid-presentation. The built-in memory slot allows me to store images to be used, I just wished that it would store the thumbnails instead of recreating them each time, which is slow and tedious.",

I also bought a carrying case for storage. We love how easy it is to setup.",

I have the same projector, except that this time I went all the way to fing what it seems an upgrade. Many new cool features but very noisy and my remote doesn't work, so I am going for a replacement. The projection is very clear tho, but hard to watch a movie near the projector.",

A quick audio out line to my portable speaker (UE megaboom, beats pill, whatever) and I'm at the movies in my backyard. Nice product. I'd definitely recommend!!!",
