After installing and replacing a noisy bathroom fan, we couldn't even hear this fan working over the sound of the furnace air blower in the basement - a piece of paper at the intake confirmed it was running. It's amazingly quiet and has several installation options that allowed us to mount inside a wall cavity and use the intake vent with screen (in the picture, this will be relocated on top of the sheet rock when it's in). Highly recommended if you want a quiet fan. i would have video taped it but you wouldn't have heard it over the sound of my AC unit running.",

This unit is quiet and it moves about three times the volume of air over the in-ceiling vent fans. My daughter had a problem with the ceiling and walls being wet after a shower, I installed this unit and vented it about 9 feet across the attic to an outside wall and this eliminated the moisture problem. Over a number of years I have installed four of these units for other people and have never had a problem with durability or failure.",

I have witnessed first hand entire neighborhoods where the whirring of fans could be heard from the front walkway. I have had repairmen and acquaintances within 20 feet of these babies without an audible sound emanating (with a little help of additional insulation). I find them amazing and reliable, as they have been running 24/7 for close to a year now.",

      "text": "Just reiterating what others have said. The only noise you hear is the air moving through the grates. I mounted it in my attic above my bedroom to vent the 2 bathrooms in the house. I can' t hear a thing in my bedroom...not even a hum of any kind. I'm fairly sound sensitive and this fan is quiet on a whole new level. When I move I may just take this fan with me. Very nice to see a product that works as well as claimed.",

Then used two inlcuded short brackets to keep the unit from swaying off the hanging brackets by attaching them to the bottom of the joists.

This fan will normally keep the mirror from getting steamed up in my tiny bathroom. If I turn it on after a shower, the steam is clear within a couple of minutes. Just a note about the noise level, the only noise we hear is the suction from the fan, not motor noise.",

The housing is very well constructed, very sturdy and is epoxy or powder coated. The unit when running is very quite and really moves the air. The duct inlets are shaped to easily receive flexible or ridged duct. I am very pleased with this product and may purchase a second one for our garage.",

    "description": "Style:240 CFMPanasonic FV-20NLF1 WhisperLine Remote Mount In-Line Spot Ventilation Fan, Quiet Air Flow. Energy Efficiency (CFM/Watt): 4.1 CFM/W, Current (Amps): 0.46A, Advanced Features: Single Speed, Air Volume Exhaust (CFM): 240 @ 0.2\" SP, 225 @ 0.3\" SP, 200 @ 0.4\" SP\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nPanasonic WhisperLine fans are designed for multiple-task ventilation. This means that you can ventilate multiple areas or multiple rooms with just one fan. For example, you can place inlets over the shower, tub, toilet and/or vanity in a single bathroom and still use just one fan. In recent years, homes have become more airtight and energy efficient. While this lowers the cost to heat and air-condition a home, it also retains pollutants that can be hazardous to its occupants. One way to improve the air quality of the home is through whole-house ventilation with a Panasonic WhisperLine fan which removes stale air and provides fresh air on a slow, continuous basis. The Panasonic FV-20NLF1 WhisperLine 240 CFM In-Line Fan has a totally enclosed condenser motor and a large, double suction blower wheel to quietly move air. The blower wheel is designed to draw air in from both sides allowing more area for the air to enter the wheel. Panasonic fans are quiet enough that you might not even know they're on. This fan is designed to give you continuous, trouble-free operation for many years due to its high-quality components and permanently lubricated motors which wear at a slower pace. We designed the electrical configuration of this model's condenser motor to allow it to operate at lower temperatures, increasing the life of the motor and bearings. The fan housing is made of heavy-gauge zinc galvanized steel and painted to protect it from rust. This in-line fan fits a 6-Inch duct and can be installed in five different positions and joist, truss and suspension brackets are included to help make your installation as easy as possible. With a 1.4 sone level and rated 240 cubic feet per minute, this fan is Energy Star qualified. The Panasonic FV-20NLF1 WhisperLine 240 CFM In-Line Fan is covered by a manufacturer warranty for period of three years from the date of the original purchase and is sold one item per package.",
