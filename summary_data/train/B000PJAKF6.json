The size of this sink is TINY.... like woah pictures didn't look that tiny! BUT it is perfect for my tiny bathroom and gets the job done. My husband wasn't very happy about installation, no instructions and needed to buy additional parts. Overall it works great!! I included a picture with hand for size reference!!",

It is more an antique white, not a bright white as I had hoped. My husband tried to polish it out the scratches with no luck. I emailed the seller and received no response. Sadly, we decided to return the sink. It has been 20 days since we returned the item and still no refund.",

The brackets need to be screwed onto the wall, loosely. It shouldn't be too tight. The sink then needs to be stuck on to the wall with silicon glue (or any good glue recommended by your local hardware store.) Once the sink is on the wall, the screws should be tightened for full support. Please note: The bracket is not strong enough to hold the sink. You need the glue. The brackets are just for extra support.",
