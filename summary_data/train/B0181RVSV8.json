He's a 43 lb Cattledog measuring 19\" high at his shoulder, 27\" around his chest and 20\" long- shoulder to base of tail. The small is adjusted to almost max length. The leash attachment is on his back but like another reviewer, I'll add a carabiner to the front for more control.",

Unfortunately, my dog has worn them out hiking several times and each time, they gradually slide to one side or the other. I'm not sure if it's because my dog has a short, coarse coat (boxer/mastiff) or because of his gait or what. I wish they didn't slide because I would use them on all of our longer hikes :/",

Only thing I would complain about is its somewhat difficult to remove the pack from the harness while it's on the dog, the buckle placement could be much better. Also stealing the strap padding from my other harness to use on this one as they are sub standard in my opinion. If you don't mind a little customizing though this pack is an amazing start",

If the pack isn't evenly balanced it will immediately start to tip towards the heavier side (duh), but it seems that it doesn't take much offset weight for this to happen. It's 4 star review is because sizing is off. My dog should have fit the Large size based on their listed measurements, but I had to return and get a Medium because even when made as tight as possible, the large just did not fit. If your dog is in between sizes, go for the smaller size",

The saddle bags themselves are durable enough, but the retention strap to compress the saddle bags for smaller loads did not compress enough on the last day of our 4 day hike. The mesh that the saddle bags are affixed to is the weak link. The seams started to separate and give way. It is a high stress point that is not reinforced.",

The packs are large enough to fit water bottles or food and toys, and have multiple zippers and places to clip things on. And I love that the pack is detachable from the harness. The only complaints I have are that it is difficult to get on/off because the three buckles are hidden, and that the pack slips to one side easily and must be readjusted often.
