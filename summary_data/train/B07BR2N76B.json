It is fine enough looking: it fits in my counter. I followed the directions. Thank goddness my attachment worked with out an adapter, and now my kitchen is awesome. Had for two days. Ran it six times. Heavy loads and smalll loads it freaking awesome. The pics I am postin are when my sink was full and I was awaiting this Godsend. Highly recommend for now.
