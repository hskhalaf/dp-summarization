The App is OK but not great you can setup way points but it just flys to them no adjustment on how high or to wait.. The FPV distance is maybe 100ft before it starts dropping signal. I originally wrote a 5 star to get a free battery but never got it. Personally this one is better than the other brand thats 5g but not much better.",

I would like the company to either reimburse me for this unit or replace it with a unit that lives up to the drones capabilities. If you read the reviews there are others who have the same issue.

This drone does not require an FAA license for recreational, non-commercial use. Like all drones, there are some restrictions when flying close to an airport.

      "text": "I purchased this Holy Stone drone because my grandson was having so much fun with his. As long as everything is synced it has operated without a flaw. At long distances the WiFi signal sometimes gets lost, but reconnects when it\u2019s in range. Setting the RTH high enough is important to avoid crashing into something. No problem if you\u2019re lucky enough to be out in the wide open. For the price, this has been unbeatable",

I returned the unit. Amazon accepted return and refunded promptly. Looking online I discovered that there was an issue with some android phones. Too bad, as the unit otherwise was very good.",

The case is really helpful to bring the drone everywhere you want without damaging it! Batteries are better than expected, lasting around 20 minutes each, when fully charged.

Consequently the props did some weed whacking in nearby brush before I could get the drone back under control. To its credit, the propeller blades held up very well showing no signs of damage.

It has the ability to follow you and doesn\u2019t just get lost. The GPS system allows it to only go a certain amount away from you. It even lands itself if it is running out of battery. For a cheaper drone this was a good purchase.",

Given the social distance requirement in the past few months, I would highly recommend this drone to keep you from having to talk to your neighbors :) Except if the battery dies and you have to go fish it out of the trees!
