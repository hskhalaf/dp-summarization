I knew my filter needed to be replaced but, I didn\u2019t know it was the reason my pool was cloudy and full of debris. I was hesitant to buy a new filter because they are very expensive at the pool store and this one is less than half of what they wanted to charge me. Upon installation in one week my pool was crystal clear and has been now for weeks. Will be continuing to by this as long as it is available.",

This is the 3rd season with the old filter so it lasts a while. Got a new one so I could clean one and run the other.",

After researching online I came across this replacement which was actually better quality but with a significant price reduction again. We are very pleased with our product and it is doing a great job at keeping our pool crystal clear.",
