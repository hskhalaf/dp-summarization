The instructions aren\u2019t that great, but if you\u2019re unable to figure it out without the instructions you\u2019re better off just watering your garden with a hose. Easy to adjust, just twist the nozzle until it\u2019s spraying how you want. I set mine to mist to optimize the pressure. Had to do a little tweaking at the end to get the pressure standard throughout, but as you can see by the video, it turned out great! **My garden is 8\u2019x4\u2019**",

Has the correct hose adapter that will connect to an outside hose bib faucet or garden hose. I found out that instead of warming the tubing in hot water I could use a hair dryer to soften the tubing for inserting the fittings. Hair dryer worked fine and was not as messy as a bowl of hot water. I plan to used Gorilla Glue to glue the fittings in the tubing so they don't loosen up in the heat of the summer sun. Definitely worth the money.",

About a year and a half ago, I spent countless hours running this throughout the yard to every plant, and it's been nothing but hassle since. As soon as the weather gets warm the hose stretches/expands and the connections come off. I constantly (once or twice a week) have to figure out why where the new failure is and fix it using some 1/4 clamps that I ended up buying separately. This thing completely defeats the purpose of automating your irrigation. Do yourself a favor, and buy the Rain Bird hose. That one doesn't expand under the sun and lasts MUCH longer.",

It took some experimenting and trial and error, plus a few accessories, but the system works perfectly now. One tip: If you are covering more than 10 plants or so, it's better to split the connection at the hose and have multiple adapters or starting points. The flow through the black tubing starts to become uneven after too much distance, so I used several garden hose splitters and started a new tube every 10 plants. The system has great pressure throughout now, I'm watering about 50 plants from one faucet.",

Honestly if you can go to a local sprinkler supply store (more common than you might think) and they\u2019ll actually give you direction you need and give exactly what you need and talk you through how to make it all work. Home Depot has everything you need as well so don\u2019t waste your time and money on this package.",

Otherwise it works great to water our garden while we are on vacation.",

Package does not provide enough line to use all components that come with it. Overall, good price, needs a few tweaks to be better but the greenhouse veggies get water.",

Because it\u2019s just one long run of narrow rubber pipe, you\u2019ll have pressure issues toward the end of the line. I\u2019m not sure who this is for, but definitely not good for raised beds tapping into an outside spigot. Ultimately had to trash this and go with a sturdier product.",
