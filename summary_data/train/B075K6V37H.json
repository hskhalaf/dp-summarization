It has several different types of fidget activities, each giving a different tactile experience. You have buttons that click, buttons that squish, knobs, thumb stick, spinner, and a clicking switch. The only complaint I've heard is the desire for some of the knobs to click. However, this doesn't seem to be a huge deal breaker, as they really enjoy using it. In fact, I ordered one for myself!",

The switch does make a slight clicking noise, so it can be a little noisy, but the rest of the cube sides are quieter and could be used in a quiet area. Overall, I love it.

The 2 non-click buttons out of the 4 are way too squishy and get stuck down sometimes. The 3 gears don\u2019t have any detent and just spin freely (but may be designed this way). The circular spinner is cheapo plastic and fits loosely. Every side is just bad.",
