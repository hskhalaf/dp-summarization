It does need a little shaping after unpacking but once you get it shaped the way you want it holds the shape very well. Has a cord so it doesn\u2019t fly off your head while riding or simply wearing. You can also choose to use the cord to rest comfortably on your neck to let it just hang behind you instead of wearing it on your head. Very cute addition to my cowgirl look!!",
