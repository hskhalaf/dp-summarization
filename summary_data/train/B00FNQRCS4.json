I can't believe this has such great reviews (although I did enjoy using it until it stopped working). Did I get a faulty product? How do I reconcile?",

I am so passionate about this amazing hair dryer that i've bought it for my mom and sister. Everyone needs this hairdryer. For the price you will not get a better hairdryer. To be honest, you could spend 10X the price and this would still be the better buy.",

Either way, this one gets your hair dry quickly without causing a lot of heat damage. I was looking for the cheapest/best model out there, as long as it had 3 heat settings and 2 speeds, and this one works great. However, I don't really have any experience to compare it to, I am sure there are much better models out on the market, but if you don't have hundreds to spend on one, this one feels very decent for the price.",

I can't use it anymore as the burning smell is too strong and don't want it to cause a more serious issue.

The power of the air flow on high, med, or low will dry any thickness of hair. I enjoy the cool setting to balance off the heat.

      "text": "Really pleased with this hair dryer. I have thick shoulder length natural curly hair and it usually takes a long time to dry. I can, however, using heat diffuser, dry it in about 7-10 minutes with this dryer. Also, I can use highest heat setting when I want to straighten my hair with round brush and a little smoothing oil. Very pleased with performance of this product st this price point.",

As long as it has standard hot/warm/cool and high/low settings on them, I'm set. It seems to operate relatively quieter than my old Conair hair dryer and the attachments are definitely a big plus.
