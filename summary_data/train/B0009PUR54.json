The only down side, the mantles are not stocked at the local sporting goods stores. Order enough spares when you find them on line.",

On off knob seemed weak plastic too much play, passes up the off/on spot when lighting or cutting off. Also the metal protecting globe is bent and chipped in a spot.. none of this seems would effect the functionality. Undecided if will exchange it for a actual brand new one seeing these small issues.",

The top was so off in BOTH directions that I had to cut, bend and reweld them so it could open and close. The mantle is so hard to find and expensive on Amazon I had to find a cross reference and buy #3018 mantles from Cabelas where it is 1/10 the price.",

I also picked up a coleman micro lantern at the same time that runs off the butane/propane mix canisters and it blows this away with much brighter and whiter light mostly due to the fuel being burned as they use the same #51 mantles.

The downside of all propane lanterns is harsh light, when burning it produces a very bright light akin to a welding torch which is fine but can be difficult to use close to lamp.

The nipple at the bottom of the Lantern is shorter than the nipple on the post preventing it from depressing the post valve correctly = no gas to the lantern and failure to light. I do have a knack of fixing things so I place a small washer under the nipple shoulder and was able to lift it enough so it would make proper contact with the tree. Yes it works but not the way it should. works with the little coleman tank just fine.",
