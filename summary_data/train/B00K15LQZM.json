No complaints on screen color and/or quality. OS X gives ability to utilize full resolution, while scaling entire screen so that text and icons aren't super tiny. So, it's similar to the built-in retina display. No compatibility issues whatsoever. OS X even remembers the positions of windows when I disconnect and reconnect the monitor, switching between the built-in screen and the 28-inch. For the price, I would buy it again.",

Sometimes, the power button stops registering touches as well, and I simply can't use the monitor at all (can't turn it on). It's too bad, because except for the buttons this is a fine budget monitor, but you'll have to get something else if you want one that works consistently",

So I bought a second one about a month ago. Dead pixel. Got a replacement. Dead pixel on that one too. Got a third replacement. It has several dead pixels. This is getting very annoying. I've had my hands on four of these monitors and only one of them has all pixels intact. It's amazing that with 8 million pixels, missing one or two of them is so noticeable, but it is.",
