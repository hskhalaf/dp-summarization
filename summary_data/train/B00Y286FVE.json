Graco replaced my pad within a few weeks but the replacement has done the exact same thing. I will be return this to Graco. If I could give this no stars, I would.

After research and all of the great reviews we got this to use for travel and as a bassinet for our newborns first 4-5 months of life in our bedroom. The mattress has, from pretty early on, formed an indentation on where she lays. You can see where her body and head are. She\u2019s within the weight and development specs to be using the mattress. It is upsetting as she gets \u201cstuck\u201d in the same position now she\u2019s started moving more which I feel works against her development when something impedes movement. Returning.",

This was a wonderful way to keep a child safe while quickly using the restroom or baking and helping a little one be in sight but not in danger!

Side buttons are either stuck or too loose and will bot do what the manual says they will do...assuming you can actually press them. Then comes the time I needed to aet it up for a guest... one side wouldn't lock back in place. These guys are shrewd enough to not have a longer than one year warranty on it. Amazon will not touch the warranty either. Such a pain and a disappointment. I doubt that I shall have the guts to travel with it.",

      "text": "I normally like the Graco Pack 'n Play, but this one has an odd coating on the fabric (mattress and tops of sides.) This item is a good price, but I think Graco has really down graded their pack 'n plays in the last several years. I feel almost as though these pack 'n play travel beds last only for one child, and then I would not trust them for another child... I wish Graco would improve their quality because I love the ease of use of this pack 'n play for travel!",

I have taken this everywhere though and it is light weight compared to some. it is extremely easy to set up and dismantle as well. The wheels are a great feature for moving this around by yourself.",

The soft bottom is also helpful for catching your baby when it falls. Available in gender neutral colors only, since your child is obviously too young to choose it's identity. But wait, there's more!! If your child grows up and decides to be a Dogkin, this will easily convert into a dog kennel!! Lucky you.",
