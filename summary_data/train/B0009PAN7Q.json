We put a command hook on the wall in the powder room so that the Baby Bjorn trainer could be stored while my daughter is not using it and so guests don\u2019t sit on it by mistake. She knows how to pull it off of the wall and place it on the toilet. Also, it fits the toilet seat perfectly. Definitely get this trainer seat as opposed to others.",

I really didn't realize how much it moved until one time she almost fell off the seat when she sat. Since then she has been using the smaller kid potty and refusing the adult potty. I wish I looked at trainer seats more carefully because this baby bjorn one is perfect! There is a dial that can adjust so that depending on the toilet it can widen to fit the seat snugly. I showed my daughter how the new seat didn't wobble and she was sitting again on the adult potty immediately!",

It seems comfortable enough that he can sit there for long enough periods of time, which are needed, when potty training. Highly recommended, and it has become the preferred potty, as we also have a Baby Bjorn potty, which is also great, but with this, there is no mess to clean up.",

I don't want to buy another to go on the toilet downstairs, this was already an expensive item.

      "text": "I bought this for when my little 3yr old newphew would come to stay with me for a few days. He was struggling with potty training because he was afraid he was going to fall in into the toilet. I bought this along with the little stool and it worked great!!! he was no longer afraid of falling so he was more apt to go potty in the toilet. Now he is fully potty trained and when he comes over he just puts the stool and the potty over the toilet and goes without any help. I highly recommend.",

It has not wiggled at all even once. Thanks to the smaller hole, my daughter now has the confidence to sit on the potty and actually push my hands away.

I don't think this toilet or the last 4, from previous apartments, is any different in size and even with the adjustments this trainer will not fit. It's too oval shaped and goes right up the back of the toilet seat making it a very awkward and barely usable fit. Be careful if you think your toilet is a little small or of a more rounded than oval shape.",

    "description": "Color:White/Black\n\nThe BabyBj\u00f6rn Toilet Trainer is easy to adjust and fits firmly onto most toilet seats. Ergonomic design allows your child to sit comfortably and correctly. A FRIENDLY SEAT FOR EASY TOILET TRAINING\nA child is more likely to use a big-person toilet if he or she feels comfortable doing so, and the Toilet Trainer is designed to achieve this. Making kids feel safe and at ease, the trainer's soft, ergonomic shape provides a comfortable seat without any sharp angles. However, always help your child climb on and off the toilet trainer until it is safe for the child to do it on his or her own. The contoured curves also make it easy for kids to get on and off the toilet by themselves, helping them feel independent. To encourage this independence, a perfect accompaniment to the BabyBj\u00f6rn Toilet Trainer is the BabyBj\u00f6rn Safe Step. Another key design feature of the Toilet Trainer is its opening, which is wide enough for parents to help kids wipe, but small enough to prevent a child from slipping through.\n\nFITS TOILETS OF ALL SIZES\nNo matter how large or small the toilet is, the BabyBj\u00f6rn Toilet Trainer will fit. The trainer features an adjustable dial that adapts it to toilets of all sizes. The bottom of the trainer has a soft rubber edge and adjustable wings, both of which ensure that it stays in place securely and doesn't slide under little bottoms.\n\nMINIMIZES MESSES WITH BUILT-IN SPLASH GUARD\nThe BabyBj\u00f6rn Toilet Trainer makes for hassle free cleaning for parents and caregivers. An integrated, angled splash guard helps prevent kids from making messes outside of the toilet. This splash proof feature translates to fewer accidents for kids, which in turn builds their confidence and makes them feel secure about using the full size toilet again and again.\n\nCLEANS EASILY\nFor those family members who don't require the training seat, the Toilet Trainer has a convenient, built in handle that makes it easy to remove and replace. It is easily cleaned with hot water. Like all BabyBj\u00f6rn designed products, the Toilet Trainer has a distinctive style.\n\nQUICK FACTS ABOUT THE BABYBJ\u00d6RN TOILET TRAINER\n * Ages: 2 to 6 \n * Warranty: 2 Year Express Warranty \n * Helps potty training kids use a full size toilet\n\n\n\nBRAND STORY\nBy BabyBjorn",
