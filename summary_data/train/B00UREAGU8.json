I anticipate I may be able to stretch this out over 9 months. It leaves face with a radiant glow and the oils definitely gets rid off any dullness in appearance. I added an additional 10 mins to the drying time and received better results. Will not rate a 5 until I determine results are consistent. I've only been using the mask for 2-3 weeks now. I apply it twice a week and I have noticed an improvement in the radiance department. Definitely worth a try, but still not sure if it's worth the price.",
