It was humorous how cheap the white bottoms felt and the top of the shoe was flimsy fabric, as in you could make the shoe go (and stay) completely flat if you press down on it. Some will give me grief about my expectations for a $20 pair of shoes, but they failed in my \"cheap alternative shoes\" experiment.",
