      "text": "I wanted a way to mount this without the provided screws. My wall is relatively smooth and the large Velcro strips hold up to 4lbs per set. I put 2 at the top, 2 at the bottom. That's 16lbs of holding strength so far. The shelf itself is 9lbs. I am only using this to display my POP Figures. I am not saying YOU should mount yours with the Velcro, I am just sharing what I was able to do. For safety reasons, I would suggest you use the provided mounting screws instead, especially if you are putting anything with a bit of weight onto it.",

Assembly takes about 30 minutes if you work patiently (which I'd recommend as you don't want to strip any screw holes or gouge the laminate finish). Requires an Allen wrench (included) and takes a little hand strength but easy enough to assemble. You will need a drill to mount it to your wall via 2 holes.",
