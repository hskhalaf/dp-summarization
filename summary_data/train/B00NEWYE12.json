The auto-focus is always perfect, and this was definitely the biggest bang for your buck if you're looking to get a semi-professional camera. The only down side is that it is so high quality that it highlights every single pore on my face haha!",

The built-in Wifi works great, the quality of the photos is top-notch. Yes, this is a bit on the expensive side and you could probably get an entry-level Canon EOS for around the same money. However, this camera serves an entirely different purpose; you should buy this camera when you want the quality of the EOS, but the portability of a point-and-shoot.",

After diving deep into the settings and menu system I find this camera a joy to own. Definitely not \"pocketable\" as some reviews state unless it's a jacket pocket. Slightly awkward to grip one handed, addition of a flipbac 3 grip corrects that issue. Overall excellent compact camera.",

Designed to provide stellar images, the Powers hot G7 X is a compact digital camera powered to inspire your most impressive photography.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\nPOWERED TO INSPIRE\nThe PowerShot G7 X is a premium high-performance camera that puts exciting and impressive capabilities in a sophisticated, compact package. It starts with the sensor: a large and light-grabbing 1.0-inch, 20.2 Megapixel* High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor powered by Canon's latest generation DIGIC 6 Image Processor for beautifully rendered low-light photography up to ISO 12800. The IS lens is a f/1.8 (W)\u2013f/2.8 (T) that puts more in your frame while staying bright to the maximum 4.2x Optical Zoom (24mm\u2013100mm), with a 9-blade circular aperture diaphragm for artistic background blur, and a minimum focus range of just 5cm for precise macro shooting. Wi-Fi\u00ae**- and NFC-enabled***, the PowerShot G7 X is selfie-ready with a high-resolution multi-angle capacitive 3.0-inch touch panel LCD. Shooting is a joy with High-Speed AF (0.14 sec.), 31 AF points, full-resolution continuous shooting up to 6.5 fps and 1080p/60p HD video. Designed to provide stellar images, the PowerShot G7 X is a compact digital camera powered to inspire your most impressive photography. And it delivers.\n\n* Image processing may cause a decrease in the number of pixels.\n** Compatible with iOS versions 6.0/6.1/7.0/7.1, Android smartphone versions 2.3.3/4.0/4.1/4.2/4.3/4.4 and Android tablet versions 4.0/4.1/4.2/4.3/4.4. Data charges may apply.\n*** Compatible with Android devices version 4.0 or later\n\nSERIOUS IMAGING POWER IN A COMPACT CAMERA\nNEW 1.0-INCH, 20.2 MEGAPIXEL* HIGH-SENSITIVITY CMOS SENSOR\nLarger than the sensors widely used for compact cameras, the PowerShot G7 X camera's new 1.0-inch sensor achieves a beautiful balance between high sensitivity and high image quality. The sensor is able to collect more light in a shorter time period without the overflow that causes blown-out highlights. This means better detail and more subtle image quality, with rich gradation even at high ISO speeds all the way to 12800. A high signal-to-noise ratio delivers minimal noise and distortion with breathtaking dynamic range, particularly notable in bright areas. And photography enthusiasts will appreciate the changes in image processing for the PowerShot G7 X, which include target exposure value and contrast characteristics of highlights. Thanks to this change, dynamic range in bright areas is expanded with gradation attributes that are similar to EOS. Also, by changing the exposure index standard, it is possible to shoot at almost the same brightness with the same aperture, shutter speed and ISO settings as EOS. The PowerShot G7 X natively captures images in the 3:2 aspect ratio, which is the same as Canon EOS SLR cameras. The camera's image creation technology was designed with post processing in mind, and features an Aspect Ratio function, enabling RAW image capture in both 3:2 and 4:3 aspect ratios while maintaining the same angle of view.\n\n* Image processing may cause a decrease in the number of pixels.\n\nCANON DIGIC 6 IMAGE PROCESSOR\nThe PowerShot G7 X is powered by the latest iteration of Canon's proprietary processor, the DIGIC 6 Image Processor, which takes still and video image quality to a beautiful new level. Improved light sensitivity allows for higher resolution with less noise when shooting in dark conditions, and Dynamic IS now detects and compensates for tilt and parallel movement (shift blur) to create video that's exceptionally free of distortion. The DIGIC 6 Image Processor also enhances the performance capabilities of the PowerShot G7 X, powering full resolution high-speed continuous still shooting (even in P, Av, Tv and M modes) and the advanced star shooting modes. The processor allows for MP4 video recording for better compatibility with mobile devices and tablets. Highly compressed MP4 video not only preserves space on your memory card but also improves playback on mobile devices. The new processor also supports an MF Peaking function, giving you a pro-level focusing tool.\n\nCANON HS SYSTEM\nThe Canon HS SYSTEM lets you take bright, clear photos as they happen, whether the light is cooperating or not. Beautiful low-light shots are possible with minimal noise and truly impressive detail in both highlight and shadow areas. The system is the result of two technologies in the PowerShot G7 X: the large format 1.0-inch High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor, which captures more light; and the DIGIC 6 Image Processor, which actively reduces noise at high ISO speeds up to 12800 and processes images at high speed, even at full resolution. Experience the freedom of using higher shutter speeds in far more situations, allowing you to capture images with exceptional clarity and detail.\n\nADVANCED OPTICS FOR SOPHISTICATED IMAGES\nF/1.8 (W) \u2013 F/2.8 (T), 4.2X OPTICAL ZOOM (24MM\u2013100MM) LENS\nThe remarkable new lens on the PowerShot G7 X camera takes full advantage of the camera's large sensor, giving your photography a wide range of expression. With a very bright aperture value of f/1.8 at the wide angle and f/2.8 when fully zoomed to a factor of 4.2x (24mm\u2013100mm), this lens not only puts more in your frame, but is equipped to capture an incredible variety of situations with artistry and precision. Equipped with a 9-blade Iris diaphragm, the lens lets you achieve a beautiful background defocus with shapes that are nearly round. Capture macro shots from as close as 2.0 in. (telephoto at 1.3 ft.). From a design perspective, each of the 11 glass lenses on the PowerShot G7 X has a multi-layer coating on it, which is similar to the Super Spectra Coating technology developed for EF lenses. These coatings have features like a high transmission factor, ultraviolet protection, resistant surface hardness, and stable characteristics. The coating also maximizes suppression of unwanted reflected light from ghosting or flaring to deliver clear images with high image quality.\n\nCAPTURE MORE ANGLES \u2013 EVEN SELFIES\nHIGH-RESOLUTION MULTI-ANGLE TOUCH PANEL LCD\nThe PowerShot G7 X camera's LCD screen can tilt up 180\u00b0, so taking that perfect selfie is a snap! In fact, the multi-angle LCD encourages creative framing because it's easy to achieve a flexible array of camera angles. Capacitive touch-panel operation feels familiar right away: simply touch to access quick control settings, focus and shutter release right on screen. A resolution of 1.04 million pixels makes the glare-free display ultra crisp and clear, so it's easy to compose your shots, choose camera settings, and review and share your images.\n\nCONTINUOUS SHOOTING GIVES YOU THE SHOT YOU WANT\nFULL RESOLUTION CONTINUOUS SHOOTING AND HIGH-SPEED AF\nPowered by the DIGIC 6 Image Processor, the PowerShot G7 X camera gives you a seamless, high-speed continuous shooting (up to 6.5 fps) experience that's fully available in P, Tv, Av, M and Auto modes. Shooting and processing are now performed in tandem, reducing buffering time to deliver high shooting speeds. With the significantly higher AF speed, achieving focus nearly the instant the camera is aimed is made possible. With no separate mode setting and no reduction in image quality, you can freeze brilliant action shots with ease.\n\n31 AF POINTS\nWith 31 focus points arranged in an expanded, wide pattern across the image plane, the PowerShot G7 X focuses with admirable speed and precision. Smaller focus frame sizes also make it possible to obtain accurate focus on small subjects. The PowerShot G7 X also supports 1-point and Touch AF.\n\nSIMPLY TAP TO CONNECT\nBUILT-IN NFC (NEAR FIELD COMMUNICATION)\nThe PowerShot G7 X camera supports NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, eliminating the need to manually find and open the Canon CameraWindow app** on your mobile device. Simply touch the NFC icon on your camera to your compatible Android\u2122* device, and the CameraWindow app will launch automatically for remote shooting and quick, easy sharing of your images. Built-in NFC technology also makes it simpler to install the app. If the app hasn't been installed yet, once you touch the devices together for the first time, the download screen will display automatically.\n\nENHANCED WI-FI\u00ae CAPABILITIES\nThe PowerShot G7 X is equipped with built-in Wi-Fi\u00ae technology for convenient sharing and transferring of your still images and video. Easily post your images to social networking and media sites \u2013 Facebook\u00ae, Twitter\u00ae, YouTube\u2122, Flickr\u00ae, and Google Drive\u2122 \u2013 through CANON iMAGE GATEWAY# directly from your PowerShot camera, or save them to the online photo album to share anytime, anywhere. The camera can also connect directly to both iOS\u00ae and Android\u2122 devices***, and upload images via the free Canon CameraWindow app** without a computer. You can control the destination of your uploads to share with everyone or to selected groups, and even add comments. Sharing video is also easy with the PowerShot G7 X, which records video using the MP4 format. Enhanced Wi-Fi\u00ae makes posting in real time possible, so you can keep everyone up to date with amazing photos and video even as events unfold. The built-in Wi-Fi\u00ae technology on the PowerShot G7 X also allows you to transfer images to other Wi-Fi\u00ae equipped PowerShot cameras or print your photos directly to a PictBridge (Wireless LAN) certified printer.\n\nMOBILE DEVICE CONNECT BUTTON\nOne-touch connection to your mobile device or computer is also made possible on the PowerShot G7 X with the camera's dedicated Mobile Device Connect Button. You can choose to transfer images to your smartphone or tablet for immediate sharing with the CameraWindow app**, or to your computer on the same network with Image Sync to make saving and organizing your images easier. When the camera finds a linked computer on the same wireless network, images are sent directly to it. Otherwise, images are temporarily stored on CANON iMAGE GATEWAY# then transferred once a connection is made, eliminating the need for cables.\n\n* Compatible with Android devices version 4.0 or later.\n** This software enables you to upload images to social network services. Before uploading images, please be aware that image files may contain privacy related information such as people and places. If necessary, please delete such information. Canon does not obtain, collect or use such images or any information included in such images through this software.\n*** Compatible with iOS versions 6.0/6.1/7.0/7.1, Android smartphone versions 2.3.3/4.0/4.1/4.2/4.3/4.4 and Android tablet versions 4.0/4.1/4.2/4.3/4.4. Data charges may apply.\n# One-time registration is required on CANON iMAGE GATEWAY online photo album.\n\nTAKE CONTROL OF YOUR HD VIDEO\nCANON FULL HD VIDEO WITH MANUAL CONTROL\nWhether you're creating artistic film clips or capturing special occasions, the advanced video capabilities of the PowerShot G7 X camera will get them the attention they deserve. Incredibly realistic 1080p Full HD video is recorded at 60 frames per second with stereo sound in convenient MP4 format. Video is smooth and richly detailed even when played back on a large-screen HDTV via the camera's HDMI output. The MP4 format's small file size lets you fit more on a single memory card, and makes downloading and sharing quicker and easier. In keeping with the camera's sophisticated capabilities, Manual movie mode is also available. Adjust Av, Tv, and ISO speed \u2013 you can even select focus points by using the touch panel LCD screen \u2013 either before or during video capture to express your vision your way in a wider variety of situations \u2013 all from a compact that fits in your bag.\n\nAPPLE IFRAME\u00ae\nThe PowerShot G7 X also records video in the Apple iFrame\u00ae format, a computer-friendly standard that speeds up the importing and editing of videos. The format keeps file sizes small, so uploading or e-mailing high-quality videos is quick and easy. The iFrame format enjoys native support in compatible Mac and Windows video applications, so you won't need to make time-consuming conversions that can degrade quality.\n\nOPTIMAL IMAGE STABILIZATION IN ANY SITUATION\nINTELLIGENT IS\nIt's easy to capture clear, steady images with the PowerShot G7 X camera \u2013 even in low light without using a tripod \u2013 because it is equipped with Canon's innovative Intelligent IS. The system automatically analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation, allowing you to focus on framing and capturing your shot. For stills, the system selects from Normal IS, Panning IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Tripod modes. When shooting video, the system selects from Dynamic IS, Powered IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Active Tripod IS modes. Icons clearly mark the image stabilization mode, whether you're shooting still images or video.\n\nSTILL IMAGE SHOOTING\nNormal IS Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills. Panning IS Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement. Macro (Hybrid) IS Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting. Tripod When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed. VIDEO RECORDING\nDynamic IS Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking. Powered IS Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified. Macro (Hybrid) IS Corrects for motion blur that is likely to occur when shooting video while walking. Also compensates for the shift-type camera shake common in macro shooting. Active Tripod IS When shooting video while using a tripod, the image stabilization is active to compensate for slight camera shake. CONTROL DESIGNED WITH PHOTOGRAPHERS IN MIND\nCONVENIENT CONTROL RING, EXPOSURE DIAL, AND MODE DIAL PROVIDE INTUITIVE MANUAL ADJUSTMENT\nThoughtfully designed controls distinguish the PowerShot G7 X camera as the first of its line, and will satisfy even advanced photographers. The front control ring makes easy setting changes possible, with customizable zoom, Tv and Av assignments. A two-layer exposure compensation dial is easily accessed from the secure, concave thumb grip, and keeps pace as you quickly and actively create images. A mode dial and dedicated Movie button \u2013 as well as two customizable functions buttons on the back of the camera that you manually set to gain easy access to some shooting modes and functions \u2013 all contribute to the camera's quick, convenient operability.\n\nCAPTURE THE NIGHT SKY LIKE NEVER BEFORE\nSTAR SHOOTING MODE\nStarry skies were formerly out of reach to all but experienced SLR camera users; however, star shooting modes on the PowerShot G7 X camera make these wonderfully impressive images accessible to all. With just a tripod and simple settings, you can capture exquisite Star Nightscapes, Star Trails, Star Time-Lapse Movies and Star Portraits. In Star Portrait mode, the camera consecutively takes two shots of the subject, plus one of the night sky, and then merges them into a single image, creating beautiful portraits with a starry background. The modes can be performed fully automatically or with manual controls for extra versatility. Support functions including Night Display, Color Adjustment and Star Emphasis make any starry sky easier to capture.\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\nHDR HANDHELD (NO TRIPOD REQUIRED)\nAlthough the PowerShot G7 X camera has been designed with an expanded dynamic range for excellent capture of bright areas, high contrast environments can be further controlled with High Dynamic Range shooting mode. In this mode, the camera will shoot three different exposures in succession (underexposed, overexposed and normal) and then merge them into a single image. Underexposed areas are combined with the overexposed and vice versa, resulting in an evenly detailed image with flattering shadows and highlights. The camera allows you to use this mode without a tripod, and features four sub-modes in addition to Natural \u2013 Art Standard, Art Vivid, Art Bold and Art Embossed \u2013 which provide striking effects that add to the creativity of your compositions.\n\nRAW\nAs with many EOS DSLR cameras, the PowerShot G7 X camera uses a 12-bit converter to process the output of the CMOS sensor, resulting in true color, smooth tonal transitions and natural gradations. The PowerShot G7 X lets you shoot in RAW mode, which records all the information captured by the sensor, giving you outstanding flexibility and complete creative control when editing your images with Canon's powerful bundled software. The camera also allows you to record in RAW and JPEG formats simultaneously. Now, in RAW mode, you can even select among several aspect ratios, including 16:9, 3:2, 4:3, 1:1 and 4:5.\n\nND FILTER\nThe PowerShot G7 X camera includes a neutral density (ND) filter. The ND filter reduces light coming into the sensor, which allows you to set longer exposure times and very wide apertures to create striking photographic effects.\n\nCREATIVE SHOT\nThe Creative Shot mode featured on the PowerShot G7 X camera can help anyone create images with artistic flair. Rather than randomly applying filters, Creative Shot mode takes advantage of Canon's advanced image and scene analysis technology to apply any of the 46 filter options based on the individual scene, subject and exposure. In addition to the original shot, the camera automatically produces and saves five unique variations of the composition by cropping it, rotating it, or adjusting its color, tone, and more. The result is stunning artistic photos that are perfect for sharing.",
