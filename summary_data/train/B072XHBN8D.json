You do need two good hands to get the sock onto it, and have to have some reasonable control of your legs, to get your toes into the sock. You do need to b end over and pull the sock up, situate it properly etc. I am fat and have arthritis in my knees, so I simply can't reach my feet to put my socks on. This item works well for me, but a more disabled person might need a different solution. The plastic is flexible, so it doesn't stretch your socks out.",

Even with looser socks you'll probably need to use a grabber as well to pull up calf-length socks all the way.
