Unfortunately the mfgr. removed the rubber surface from the wooden wheels so that on hard surfaces (such as wood, tile, vinyl...) the wheels slide rather than roll; the once delightful action of the alligator doesn't \"act\" . What a disappointment and an embarrassment to gift this to a friend's child and realize that it's a \"Misfit Toy\". Did Plan Toys get bought out by a hedge fund, hence thoughtless cost cutting??? Update: Mfgr's website shows the foam rubber traction rings on the alligator's wheels. DId MMP living sell me an unauthorized knock-off?",

While the Alligator certainly makes more noise and is a great toy, it is prone to tipping over and our toddler ends up just dragging it around on its side or its back. The Snail however, has no \"upside down\". It works right side up or upside down and always manages to right itself if it gets on its side for some reason. Can't say the same for the Alligator. Our family is happy with both. Nevertheless if this is your first purchase and you're trying to decide between the Snail and the Dancing Alligator, you might be happier with the Snail.",

They all flock to this silly little snail. The paint on him is wearing but I haven't had any issues with it falling apart. It's still intact the way he came.

      "text": "We bought our toddlers several different pull toys, including the Melissa and Doug frog, and this alligator is by far their favorite. We think that the \"clacking\" noise it makes when pulled is the reason. They seem to really like the sound of the alligator \"dancing\" behind them. And I can honestly say, it is noisy but not too annoying (most of the time, anyway!). I prefer wood clacking over animated plastic toys any day of the week! Overall, this is an excellent, well-made and adorable toddler toy.",

If it is on its side, it immediately rights itself as soon as he begins to pull it.
