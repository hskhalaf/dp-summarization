However, after two icing/snowing nights in Colorado, I am very impressed with this cover. Yes, it's thin but it feels as durable as something much heavier, and the light material makes it easy to handle and store. It fits my Honda Odyssey like it was custom-made and even being fussy about position and catching the flaps in the doors and such it goes on in about a minute. Best solution short of another garage space!",
