If there is a downside it would apply to all of these kinds of gloves not just this brand: the fabric has no texture so they slip especially on my knitting needles, but I will learn to work with them.",

I have ordered the large size, and anticipate a better experience. UPDATE: In my experience, the Imak gloves are not so compressive as these, even with the larger size. The grip dots are very useful (especially for driving), but make the gloves overall a bit stiffer in flex. Definitely will buy again when these decompose after use/washing.

I had tried a pair of cheap compression gloves from the drugstore once and they tore the first time that I put them on. These are much better made, they really help with my aching finger joints, and they don't look particularly \"medical\", they just look like funky gloves. I do wish they came in black but, hey, you can't have everything! Great purchase, I plan on getting another pair to keep handy in my briefcase.",

I did a bunch of research and settled on these fingerless gloves so I could continue to work without having my hands on a heater all day. I'm glad I bought them. My only complaint would be the top binding is tight and restricts circulation to my finger tips but may stretch out over time - I just take them off when my fingertips feel cold. The other complaint is my skin itches for a bit after I put them on but I either get used to it or the reaction stops over time. - Rick's wife Ann",

Added bonus they keep my hands warm too even with the open fingertips. Much better than another brand i bought which was more $$ and much looser and shorter.",
