In my case, I clip it, using the built in clip, to my bike jersey and it functions flawlessly. I have not used it for much longer than 90 minutes, so I can't speak to full battery life, but it is plenty long for my needs.",

Good sound quality. I wish it had a better battery life. I use it when I work in the yard and just clip it my collar. I bought an extra so I could change it out when the battery dies. I have bought 5 of them for gifts to others. I think it is a good price for what it is.",
