The moist heat option is simply to wet the hot pad down which is pretty gross in my opinion. Usually they have a little insert that you moisten to put inside the hot pad which seems much more comfortable to me then putting a wet pad directly on me.",

It has a tendency to \"float\" above the surface of my shoulders rather than on them.",

The dimensions of this unit is 14\" X 22\". There needs to be an X-Large option based on the dimensions of perhaps, 18\" X 26\" or 28\"? I can't even bring the neck magnets together, because I have a size 18\" neck. How about it, PureRelief?",
