      "text": "Having lost my second Leatherman, I decided to try a Gerber multi tool becasue of the lesser price ($34 vs. $110. The build is great, and the ergonomics fully addressed. That being said, here are the down sides: The knife blades are 2 1/2 inches long, which makes them virtually useless in a working or a survival situation. The other con is the nylon case, which is useless, as you cannot easily slide the multi tool into and out of it. otherwise, this is a very useful multi tool.",

Also you always have to take care when inserting the multitool as it easily gets snagged where the survival guide resides. After a couple of weeks my only gripe was that the spring actuating the scissor movement came out of the guide under the shear. I have to be careful of the amount of force I use and keep rebending it back under the shear. Other than that minor inconvenience, they are great as a back-up to other multitools or a reliable blade.",

      "text": "This is an excellent multi tool for the price. The range of tools is better than many more expensive multi tools. I bought one of these for my son and one for my nephew and they are both very happy with them. One minor issue (not enough to drop the rating) is that it's difficult to fit the tool into the pouch with the \"survival chart\" in the second pocket. The grip on the toolis excellent, better than the metal grip on other Gerber multi tools. Even though it's made in China, there is less \"play\" in the tools when they're locked in place than some of the \"made in USA\" Gerber products I have bought previously.",

Only one strange problem with it that I keep thinking maybe I'm missing something: some of the tools like saw blade are nearly impossible to get out unless you have fingernails or something else to stick into the small space. Maybe there is some trick I haven't figured out yet.. I hope so, because otherwise its great.",

I simply picked this one because of the price and what I wanted on a multi-tool which were: straight and serrated edge knifes, scissors, screwdrivers, and pliers. The handle is not really rubberized, more like 1/3 rubberized, but that doesn't matter to me. Love the spring loaded pliers and scissors and the locking feature for all the tools. Very glad I picked this one instead of one that would have cost 2x or 3x more",
