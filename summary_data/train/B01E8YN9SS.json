I recommend using a vice if you're new to regripping though. Makes it easier for the newbie. If you're on the fence about getting a super stroke, try it. You will not be disappointed!",

Definitely helps take the hands out of the stroke. Obviously they work since you see gazillions of them on the Tour. Only wish was that the front panel was a little flatter where your thumbs rest so as to more positively align the putter face. This may only be a problem for me, however, as after using the Zebra grip for 30 years it may take a bit longer to adapt.",

She has carpal tunnel, so it\u2019s difficult for her to keep the face of the club perpendicular to the target line. Used lighter fluid as a solvent on my grip tape and this grip slid right over it without any issue. About an hour later it was ready to use on our indoor putting mat. My wife loves it, she says it\u2019s much more comfortable than her old grip and the larger size gives her more control.",
