I've used them approximately 24 times and 2 already have ripped covers. Granted, we're not gentle with them, and it may have caught on something without my knowing. That aside, the covers are not as sturdy as the older set I still have. But for dodgeball, they're perfect because they don't hurt! (Okay, still stings if you get it in the face.)",

The weather hasn't allowed them to play outside yet, so they play indoors. The balls are so light they don't damage anything inside. Very colorful too.

      "text": "I bought these in order to have a durable ball for dodgeball games that would not injure someone if hit hard. I use them for a youth group, so there tends to be very small people and larger people playing together. They are great because you can throw them very hard and not worry about someone getting hit in the face. I also really like how these balls fly in the air with better accuracy than others I have used. The only thing I would say is they could be just a bit bigger than they are. (6 inches)",

    "description": "OUTSIDE OR IN \nOur Champion Sports dodgeballs are perfect for any number of children\u2019s games, including handball, kickball and four square. From the playground to gym class, these soft but strong balls provide hours of fun and exercise. They\u2019re popular with schools, summer camps, recreational centers, rec leagues and families. \n\nDURABLE \nCoated with patented Rhino Skin, these balls are built to last. They can withstand years of rough play and regular outdoor use. Designed and made in Sweden, high-tech Rhino Skin is so tough that it\u2019s virtually impossible to tear. The quality is tough to beat. \n\nFUN FOR ADULTS \nGrownups can join in on the fun, too. Dodgeball is a great party activity for summer BBQs, birthday parties, tournaments or any type of adult gathering. Or, get the whole family outside for some action-packed bonding time. The game is entertaining and interactive, and it\u2019s a great way to sneak in some extra physical activity. \n\nWON\u2019T STING \nRhino Skin was designed to be a non-sting coating, so these playground balls won\u2019t hurt or leave bruises when they strike like large rubber balls. Lightweight and spongy, they\u2019re safe for kids to use but rugged enough for teens and adults. \n\nFOAM CORE \nOur dodgeballs have a low-density foam core that provides just the right amount of bounce. The balls easily fly when thrown to reach long distances, but they won\u2019t bounce all over the place when they land. The foam core prevents huge bounces so the balls stay in the game area, whether that\u2019s a giant gymnasium or a small driveway. \n\n- Champion Sports Rhino Skin Low Bounce Dodgeballs \n- Patented Non-Sting Rhino Coating \n- Low-Bounce Foam Core \n- Foam Density 28kg/m3",
