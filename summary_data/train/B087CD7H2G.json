Most of songs which I played sound much better on Sonos one which is under $200. I noticed many users are complaining about same thing on sonos community forum stating distorted bass and muffled sound which exactly I am also experiencing. Sonos support stated they identified potential bug and will release it next week so wait to apply that fix to see if it fixes the sound quality before returning. As of now my recommendation is not to buy and really surprised how this soundar got very good prelaunch reviews .",

Oh, be sure your HDMI ports are set for Bitstream for Dolby Digital 5.1 passthrough, if you have that capability on your TV; otherwise PCM will only provide Stereo 2.0.",

People have good older tvs that do have earc. Many tv don't communicate well throu arc for sound. Sonos relying on tv arc is a fail as the variation of sound that passes through is based on the tv communicating with sound bar. Sonos should have added atleast 1 dedicated hdmi input...this allows them to control the sound input/value. So great sound, but big miss on input.",

      "text": "I have had the arc now for about a month and its a very nice sound bar buy it needs improvements for sure. The bass is distorted and pretty disappointing for 800$. I bought the 3rd gen sub recently and it helps but you can still notice some of the higher pitch bass that gets distorted with music. For movies the arc is amazing when in Dolby atmos. For music it needs some work. Still happy with the purchase but it has some improvements that should be worked out soon according to sonos.",
