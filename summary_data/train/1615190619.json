I tend to deviate from the recipes a bit, but that's how I cook. Always looking to improve without adding calories, of course. The major critique I have for this book would be to watch the spice level. If you don't love spicy things, greatly reduce the red pepper flakes, etc used in the spicy recipes. It'll save you from making something you won't eat because it's too spicy.",
