Be aware that if you have it turned wrong, the LED lights are extremely bright and can hurt sensitive eyes. First time Mom turned it on, she had the lights facing her and cried out in pain. I drew a smiley face on a small piece of paper and taped it to the handle. I told Mom to always be sure she can see the smiley face before she turns the light on. That has worked out perfectly.",

I've used the old one for about 3 or 4 years and I absolutely love it but this one seems to be much, much better. This is a great magnifier for reading. And I love the new improvements.",

The magnifier is perfect for him. He really likes the illumination, which is even and really helps him in reading. The horizontal glass enables him to read more text through the lens. He can turn the lights on and off and also dim them, but he typically just keeps them on full illumination most of the time. The magnifier is fairly light weight compared to other magnifying glasses, even with the larger lens, which makes it easier to hold for longer periods of time.

If you're getting a magnifying glass for someone with macular degeneration, you don't want a magnification that's too high. They can only see one word at a time and it makes for extremely slow reading. I bought my mother a 20x magnification so she could read books. 20x is too high a magnification for reading. It's great for reading pill bottles, but bad for reading books. The second thing I bought her was the Large Ultra Bright Handheld Reading Magnifier (3x Magnification) with 4 built in LEDs.

When you hold this as shown in the photo (most natural way to hold it) the light switch is under the thump which makes it easy to accidentally turn it off while you are holding it over page to read.

This has resulted in one instance so far where the three AAA batteries in the handle were run down when the magnifier had been put away in the provided faux leather case with the light inadvertently turned on.

Obviously, it is not cheap, yet the level of distortion and waves that occur as the glass moves across the viewed object or material is significant. If a vendor is going to have something made in some third world country for pennies and then seek to sell it for $25, it should at least spend some of that money on quality control. As for the light, the dimmer switch does not lower or heighten the light in any progressive or uniform fashion. This feature matches is consistent with the quality of the lens. I would expect that a fair price for the overall quality of this product is about $5 to $7.",

My husband wants one to help him with jigsaw puzzles. Also a friend who has Macular Degeneration tried it and said she wants one because the viewing area is wider than her round magnifier. She also thought it was more helpful than the other magnifier we purchased which has greater magnification. The design is user friendly for holding the device and reading. I sincerely thank you for making this product available at a reasonable price and making life more pleasant for vision impaired loved ones.",
