Possibly other people are able to fill a water bottle without getting the outside at all wet but I think those people are likely superhuman. The rest of us when we fill a water bottle often splash water down the side which means that you want to be able to put your cover on a full water bottle once you\u2019ve dried it off. Because who wants to put a soggy wet cover between your sheets? Just really annoying.",
