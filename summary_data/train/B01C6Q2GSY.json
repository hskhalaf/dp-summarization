What's not included is a HDMI compatible monitor, a USB compatible mouse and keyboard. While you can just buy the RaspberryPi 3 card by itself for a lower price, this kit contains all you need to power up and get going without having to buy cables, memory card and case separately.",

I tried the OS's offered from NOOBS, but wanted one aimed at elementary kids that contained learning software and games, none of these worked. I finally found a perfect kid-friendly Linux distro that was light enough to run on the Pi. Using Etcher, (since I wiped NOOBS off the microSD) I burned Ubuntu Mate (again), then loaded the packages and desktop for \"Edubuntu\" which has a number of games and educational programs. It seems to run smooth and she loves all the programs offered. 5 stars for the Pi!",

Power adapter works well, no power issues even when overclocking. HDMI cable is pretty standard, but has some strain relief built in and is decently sturdy.

Unfortunately today one of the tiny black chips on my board blew (I think it's the 3.3v regulator but I'm not certain). As soon as you power it on it gets insanely hot. I emailed Canakit asking for a replacement board (I have 10 days left on my warranty) and not 3 MINUTES LATER, I recieved a response telling me that the new board will arrive in 4-5 days.... wow. That is service that deserves a review. Thank you very much, I highly recommend this product.",
