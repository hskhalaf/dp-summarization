The reaming mechanism works really well to clean out the citrus fruit; however, the pulp filter plugs up and does not let the juice run through, then you run the pulp spinner feature, which I thought sounded really cool, but all it does is put the pulp back into your juice, and the juice goes everywhere because even the drain spout is plugged with pulp.",

I am very disappointed with this juicer and will be looking for a different one. I have generally been happy with Cuisinart products, so this experience was a real let-down.",

I wish there were a secondary strainer you could place below the cone to catch more of the orange pieces, but a strainer works just as well.",

Currently I use the plastic reamer as a bottle filling stand and plan to salvage the motor out of this device because it is hard to find high torque motors.",

The filtering system is not very good- the pulp jams up the wholes, making for non-drainage after juicing a few oranges. Clean-up is also more difficult- the strainer is difficult to wash.
