      "text": "I've bought other Mediabridge cables in the past and have been very pleased with the quality, build, and price. I was using an older 6\" 3.5mm male to 3.5 mm male cable to connect the headphone output from several devices to the input on a portable headphone amp (the mightly little PA2V2 by electric-avenue). When that started developing issues, I purchased this Mediabridge (2') to replace it. As others have posted, it is well constructed and provides a firm connection, but not so tight that it requires too much force to insert or remove. The cable is thick, yet compliant. Sound quality is very good as well, I couldn't detect any 'colorization' as is often the case with cheap cables.",

The ends come with covers so you don't want to lose that for they will protect the tips of the cord. They work great for all my speakers, my headphones with detachable cords such as the \"Skullcandy Hesh 2.0\" They work fantastic. There is no complications at all. I highly recommend these because they look like they will last you a long time. I would update this review after a few months to see how they take my abuse. Other than that, I am very happy with this purchase and do recommend it :)",

I listen to headphones at work eight hours a day and have bought many male to male cables. I know mediabridge guarantees them for a year, but frankly I'll be happy if I get six months. If I get at least six months out of this cable, I would definitely purchase more. The reason I say almost perfect is I would prefer an L shaped connection with volume controls.To my knowledge they do not have one. Beyond that minor imperfection, I would highly recommend.",

I tested the cable out between an iPhone and an aux input on my car and all is well. If you are asking, yes I would recommend this product.",

I really do like this audio cable with its gold plated connectors and a solid build quality.

      "text": "I bought this cable so that I could hook my iPhone up to my car stereo to listen to it. I've had it for six months now, with everyday use, and it has held up great. The last cable I bought was a different brand and stopped working after just a few months of use. I've been very pleased with this cable. The cable is fairly short, though, at just two feet, but it works out well for our car, because I don't want a bunch of extra cable floating around. Would definitely buy again!",

These i use from device to headphones. If you have ever looked at exotic stereo eqiupment priced in the stratosphere, you may note that the price of the connecting cables is ridiculous. Yes, ridiculous. Therefore I concluded that there is little real significance in these cables for hundreds of dollars/ft. I was and am amazed at the difference. Yours is very noticeably better, louder and clearer. Even though the two cables purchased were very affordable and similar(low priced) the difference was really something.

The only reason I didn't give this cable 5-stars is because the cable itself has grey text printed along its entire length.
