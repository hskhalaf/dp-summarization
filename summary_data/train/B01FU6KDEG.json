      "text": "Item was clearly used, the box holding the camera had no tape holding it together, there were multiple bar codes taped over each other on the back of the box stating \"NEW\", and the cardboard insert meant to hold the camera in place was torn on one corner. The clear sticker meant to protect the camera's display was removed, and the camera display had fingerprints and smearing from previous use. The camera itself would not accept any SD card that was inserted, and any attempt at alleviating the problem through a recommended firmware update required an SD card! Overall I don't recommend purchasing this camera, maybe others have had better luck, but that's exactly what it is, LUCK. Buyer Beware",

Such as mounted to a helmet and in a case. This is a failure to keep the app working properly by YI.

It allows for an external mic via a mini-jack (but you need to remember to set audio to the external mic in the menu). I recommend the rubber housing skin - because if you drop the camera, it will break. Also get extra batteries and the underwater housing - all so affordable. I highly recommend this camera!

The result is impressive for the video, the audio was useless. The microphones picked up noise directly through the mechanical mount and overloaded the mic inputs.

I'm seriously wondering how YT vids and site reviews showed clear images. Got this cam just before a once-in-a-lifetime, 2-week vacation to CO. Wanted to capture the views and ziplining Royal Gorge. Couldn't even use it. We used our phones instead and had superior quality compared to this 'thing'. We lost out on getting vids of whitewater rafting and other events we specifically wanted a good cam for. Should have gone with the Osmo or Hero7. This thing is total junk. Will be trying to return it.",

One thing they need to fix is if you use lens distortion correction and electronic image stabilization you get some weird effects. Otherwise there is no Action camera in this price range that can give you so much functionality for so little price. Compared to the first generation, this is amazing. I dropped it from the second floor off a balcony and all that happen was the case split open. I pushed it back together and it was like it never happened except a little rough patch on the edge and lens housing that took the bulk of the impact force.",

FYI - my usage purpose is NOT underwater and not particularly shock sensitive... no biking or skiing here, so I was not worried that it didn't come with a protective housing. I use it more like a point and shoot camera for filming camping and shooting practice in the woods and it works great for that purpose without the plastic housing.",
