Good grip, probably slightly better than my old much cheaper pair, although hard to compare as these were worn down, particularly at the heel causing slipping on down hill. The lacing is, however, so much better if it needs tightening for downhill, especially if muddy, no struggling with double knots. Have to see how they wear, but so far seems a good purchase.",

Sizing; do order a half size or size larger than you would normally. The laces are QUICK LACE and are tighted with a little toggle.

The biggest improvement I noticed was that by foot felt a lot more comfortable and secure in wet/muddy conditions as opposed to me road shoe.",

Not waterproof so you get wet feet in deeper water but they warm up and are comfortable afterwards. I'd say they are a little narrow and small in fit but otherwise great. They will save an expensive pair of road shoes from being ruined in the mud and allow you to continue to run in the worst of conditions.",
