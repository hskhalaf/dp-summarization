      "text": "Recommended by my vet. I have a very finicky dog that needs to take a lot of medication twice a day with food or her stomach will hurt. She turns her nose up at 90 percent of everything I tried. EVERYTHING! I finally started making her chicken and rice for her meals. But then she was not getting full nutrition. ARGH! But she Woolf\u2019s this stuff down as if it was fillet mignon and she\u2019s now getting a much more balanced diet as well. So relieved. Thank you!!",
