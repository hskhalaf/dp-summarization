      "text": "Great sound bar - awesome sound for the price. I researched all the common names, Bose, Sonos, etc and preferred the open architecture of play-fi + Klipsch was too hard to pass up. ***Update 4/14/18****** The soundbar will not pass a chroma of greater than 4:2:0 (4K UHD @60hz), so if you have a video requirement that is higher than that the sound and picture will stutter and dropout - I am looking for a workaround (e.g., an hdmi splitter that can send different video signals to different outputs). Klipsh has no information regarding updating the soundbar - Dropping to 3 stars from 5 for this - if they do the upgrade I will change it back to 5.",

      "text": "I ignored other reviews that discussed my same problems. Big mistake. Hassle, one big hassle. First ,the HDMI arc cable from the TV did not produce sound. This was a brand new top of the line TV. I contact Klipsch and put in a help ticket. Never heard from them. By the way, I followed the directions that looked like a grade school kid put together. Pathetic. So I bought an optical cable and great news- sound! Well not so great. The subwoofer did not pair with the sound bar. Or did not power up. I could not tell. By the way the directions for pairing showed pictures of a different subwoofer!",

The owner's manual / instruction manual was LESS THAN USELESS. The instructions were comprised of one step - download the app and follow directions in the app - that's it!! That's all it said. Without the app working properly I had a $600 pile of useless electronics so I sent it back for a refund. Apparently some folks are able to set it up and make it work, and supposedly it sounds great, but I was not able to do so.",
