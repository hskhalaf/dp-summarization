      "verdict": "Those who choose to invest in the Xpedition III Low from Ecco are in for something quite empowering. From having a true-to-size fit and towering durability to being remarkably comfortable and amazingly stylish, wearers are simply bound to make great strides in this footgear. That being said, a good amount of cash (or credit) is required first to take full advantage of its promised excellence. Nevertheless, the Ecco Xpedition III Low is an astounding trail companion thanks to its host of stellar traits\u2014yes, even with its rather high asking price factored in.",
      "pros": [
        "The durability of this Ecco shoe impressed dozens of users",
        "Its fantastic level of comfort shocked a large number of reviewers",
        "Several owners applauded the Xpedition III Low\u2019s enamoring aesthetics",
        "Based on some reports, this day hiker runs true to size",
        "A decent percentage of wearers found the shoe\u2019s width not too tight and not too narrow",
        "This hiking footgear received praises from about a handful of testers for its astonishing arch support",
        "The Ecco Xpedition III Low was considered unbelievably versatile by a very few"

      "cons": [
        "Its steep price tag didn\u2019t sit well with a couple of purchasers",

      "text": "I bought these for my husband as he was starting to suffer from sore ankles, feet and hips... (We're a bit older and wiser now and realised he'd had his current saloman shoes for over a year) so these were an early Christmas present. Within a few days all his aches were gone. They're a great fit, very comfortable with great support that you don't realise is there. They're a lot dearer than some other shoe and trainer brands, but worth every penny... We've bought these before and we'll be buying them again! (my dad swears by them too!)",

I cannot rate them as 5-star yet, because it will take time to see how well they last on rough tracks and if they are fully waterproof in thicker, wet vegetation.",

They are a little large because I often buy UK 8.5 but that size wasn't available. That said, as mentioned I am very happy with the purchase and am happy to recommend them. I haven't used this brand before but I am a convert on the strength of their performance so far.",

Sure they'd be fine if you need a slightly wide size 44 (9.5-10) fitting. In all other respects these boots appeared superb - hence 4 stars.",

Good looking, light weight and very sturdy, but frankly speaking, need time to test its durability. It's suitable for trekking and hiking.The most important thing which surprised me was of its low price when compared with Amazon US and on-line stores in China. But I have to rank it with 4 stars instead of 5, not because of shoe's problem but because of logistics problem. It cost me a long time to receive it.",
