At first I was really excited because its a protein blend and the benefits that go with that. However, my stomach can not handle this protein powder. I am not lactose intolerant and I have no known food allergies so it must be the digestive enzymes that are in this product. I get severely bloated, gassy and most recently diarrhea which has led me to stop using Combat. I'm going to try another blend and see how that goes. Really wish this product worked for me. I know a lot of my friends have no issues with it.",

I blend it with ice, skim milk, water, and sugar free instant coffee mix. The only complaint I really have is that it is incredibly sticky so you have to blend it.",

Using a blender helps but that's a big inconvenience when you need to mix up some as you're rushing out the door. It's annoying how expensive whey has gotten and at this price point they cut corners and use artificial flavorings; so lame. All because lifting and working out is popular now they can get away with charging this much. Bottom line this is decent compared to the all alternatives though",

Another user mentioned they get stinky farts from this protein as well. I can confirm, farts after drinking this are FOUL! But I still like the powder. I will buy again.",

I like to mix it with yesterdays left over coffee and milk, about 3:1, pre-workout to get a little caffein boost. I always seem to make small gains in weight with this. It's my 'go to' protein powder.",

Overall this is the best bang for your buck around after only two weeks of taking it I am already seeing results. Highly recommended.",
