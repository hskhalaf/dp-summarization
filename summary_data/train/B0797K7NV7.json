It's known that Converse have a flat insole so I recommend getting shoe inserts for all-day wear. These usually last me a year or two, but yours will probably last longer if you're not constantly taking them to outdoor events. Great classic shoe.",

But I didn't get them for their support, I got them for their style. I usually either wear them to work where I sit most of the day or I'll wear them running around. If I was going to be standing all day I wouldn't choose them but I'm very happy with my purchase and will buy another pair after these.",

I normally wear size 8 (women's), but having owned a pair of Converse Chucks before, I knew that they tend to run about a half-size larger. I ordered a 7.5, and length-wise, they fit perfectly. My feet are slightly wider than most girls' feet, so they're a little tight on my pinky toes. I've worn them about a week, and they're getting more comfortable now. White Chucks match with almost any outfit, so I'm really happy with these.",

Converse uses a different measuring system than other major brands (which makes no sense to me), which is why you should order about a size smaller for males or females.
