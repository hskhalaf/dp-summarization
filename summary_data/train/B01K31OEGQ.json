If you are looking for solid wifi that connects when you expect, and stays connected to the internet, you should really get a different router, as this one is not for you. I often wonder as I reboot this router in the hope it will actually work, if it was made as some kind of cruel joke router instead of an actual functional router.",

Downloading the new firmware (which I had to do twice for it to take) and changing the WiFi channels on both the 2.4ghz & 5.0ghz helped greatly. For a smaller home network this router is still simply, just fine. I am going to keep it but I probably wouldn't recommend it to my friends.",
