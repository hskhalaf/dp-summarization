However, after turning it off it wouldn't come back on. I let it cool down and tried again and it burned and died completely... From the look of it, this thing is clearly hit and miss. Unless you are fine with a low quality potentially junky device, do not buy this thing. And by the way, the warranty on it seems useless. You have to show that you have used it properly, and shipping costs are on you.",
