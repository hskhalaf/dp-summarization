Instead, they ship you dozens of tiny little pieces that require extensive assembly. The entire point of a folding bookcase is that it ships in a compact form and all you need to do is unfold it and perhaps attach a few shelf holders. I would strongly advise against buying this. For the amount of labor required, you could just buy some dimensional lumber and make the bookcase yourself from scratch. You'd end up with better quality for less money and about the same amount of effort.",

Poor way of doing business for a product that is actually a nice looking, well designed product, but not having the accessories package in the box is crap!!!!!",

I only gave four stars because one of the pieces from this shelf was split, but I have five other shelves (that I ordered about a year ago) that don't have problems. I am in the process of requesting a replacement part, but it looks like the manufacturer will send a replacement without any problems.",
