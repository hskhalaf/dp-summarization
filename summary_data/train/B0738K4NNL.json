Jacket came very quick with my amazon prime and I'm really happy I took the chance on it. Considering buying in another color as well. The navy blue is a nice change from my regular go to of black.",

Some parts had no down at all as shpwn in the photos. I wouldn't recommend this...save up for a better made jacket.",

As for the confusion about the \"inner pockets without bottom seams\"-- those are the outside hand pockets, not inner pockets. No design error. No frills construction means it does the job but doesn't inspire confidence that it will last a long time.

However, I am not sure how long this will last. Feels a little flimsy. My north face jackets last me decades. I would think of this as a lightweight fashion staple in the wardrobe. Good for traveling.",
