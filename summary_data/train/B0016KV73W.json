Clean up is EASY as the bags completely cover the potty and seal extremely well when you tie them. I love this thing!",

Once (TMI), my daughter had to go on the train and I really did not want to have her use the train's public bathroom. She squatted between seats; no one knew what was happening, and you coudln't smell ANYTHING. I think I may actually re-buy these for those car trips and cookouts over the summer break.",

Cons: if you have a 2.5 yo that is as tall as a 4 yo this seat will be too short/small for them. I didn\u2019t realize how small this seat was.

      "text": "This seat cover is so needed!! You have a potty training child BUY IT!!! You can use it anywhere, it folds down and it can sit up as a potty itself if you need to. My friend used it in the back of her car with her son when there was no potty anywhere around. and it was so simple you attach a bag and bam you have a toilet!! We have used it on the side of the road when a little girl just couldn't hold it!!! And it fits perfect on any toilet since the flap fit out ultra wide. Plus it has a pee guard for little boys!! Its such an amazing seat!!!",

It's definitely not the most comfortable looking seat but it gets the job done if you need something portable.",

I must say you have to order the bags separately because it doesn't come with it. Our trip was so smooth thanks to this potty travel toilet",

She's quite tall for her age, and she still fit on this potty. Get the potty - and the refills - for stress-free travel. And put a new liner in immediately after you dispose of the used one so you're never caught off-guard.",

When they sit on the seat, they're sitting on a plastic bag, and that seems to freak her out. Ok, she's a toddler, but I wish it were designed so the bag fits under / around the seat.",
