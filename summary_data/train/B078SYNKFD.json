      "verdict": "The X-Mission 3 from Salomon gives runners the grace and power to traverse many types of surfaces with ease. Durable components allow the foot to be protected from any immediate danger, and trail-optimized sections help in performing exceptionally well on unpredictable terrain. Still, it can function on the roads, making trail-to-asphalt transitions quite easy.",
      "pros": [
        "Breathable coverage is provided by the 3D Mesh upper",
        "The Sensifit overlay system wraps around the foot in a secure but customizable way",
        "Runners appreciated the inclusion of the Sensiflex stretch panels, which support the foot while also encouraging flexibility",
        "The Quicklace system was welcomed by many runners because it made it easier for them to adjust the tightness and looseness of the fit",
        "Underfoot cushioning is handled well by the plush and durable full-length foam unit",
        "Anti-abrasion rubber with non-prominent gripping lugs make the outsole useful on both the trails and the roads"

      "cons": [
        "A few runners noted that the toe area was a bit tight",

      "title": "Great on trails",
      "text": "Well this is s tough one as this shoe has great grip and flexibility for trails but not great energy return. My GT2000 4 have better energy return bon harder surfaces but too stiff for comfortable trail running. It's like I need to be able to swap shoes during s running session which isn't practical. I do give this case 4 as it does seem durable even with my weight and heavy use on trails just wish it had more energy return but that may compromise it's flexibility.",

They are always good quality, and they seem to fit me well, just have to order a half size larger than normal ( 12 instead of 11.5 ) These are comfy, very grippy ( except wet rocks ) and look good enough to go out and about in. Mainly bought for my 4.5 miles walk to work, over a mix of pavement & trails.",

      "text": "They not only look pretty stylish, grey/green/black, and go with almost anything from gym-ware to casual clothing, I cannot recall putting on a new pair of anything before these that fits so well and seems so made to measure! The grip is good (evidenced by me walking confidently through a potentially hazardous path of shiny wet leaves without slipping) and the laces are unique to me, tightened by a kind of pull-cord, which I have to say, works well as it`s nice to have the pressure of tightness up above the ankle instead of compressing the entire top of the foot. All in all, expensive and worth every penny.",

However, it appears to me that the long end would then dangle towards the floor... My partner is a size 9 but unfortunately was unable to actually get the running shoes on as they are far too narrow. They appear to be made to be breathable and would probably be fine for someone with far narrower feet.",

The arch to the shoe and the way they lace (which is very handy!) makes them fit differently to other shoes. They are beyond comfortable and make you feel like you're walking across styrofoam! I love the design of the shoe, not too fussy and not too plain. On a warm day they also breath really well too.",

The fastening system doesn't allow the shoe to open fully, and even if it did, the throat is structured so that it restricts the opening. Had to send them back. Which was a pity, as they otherwise seemed like nice shoes.",
