The only battling you do is with trainers or gym leaders. This game could have been so much more if they just added the normal battling and training aspects. For a child this game would be more fun but for a long time Pokemon fan you will most likely be disappointed.",

I don't even mind the more lax nature of the game, I think the design choices that make the game more casual are great. But what's left over is just a retread of the old game with nothing to distinguish save the face lift. But it's not enough of a face lift to warrent the price.",

Only major downside is the annoying Poke\u0301mon GO like \u201cwild\u201d encounters. Motion controls don\u2019t work 100% of the time, causing a lot of poke balls to go to waste. Also, no pro controller option is so, so baffling... Despite these sett backs, still a great game overall.",

You no longer battle Pokemon except with other trainers that you come across in the game. Instead, when you run into a wild Pokemon, you simply aim and throw your Pokeball at it in hopes of capturing it with more powerful Pokeballs eventually being available to capture higher level Pokemon.",

      "text": "I played the original Pokemon Yellow back in the day, and gotta love the update. I can see why some people might not like the catching system and lack of wild battles, but it's fun just for the nostalgia and the pokemon! Plus Eevee is the cutest thing ever. If you're looking for an experience like the traditional pokemon games, this might not be what you're looking for, but if you're just a fan of pokemon and want to have a fun little romp in Kanto, then you'd probably enjoy this!",

It retains the same elements from the early gen1 games, but adds in new things, like newer moves, REMOVES THE DUMB HM'S, and wild encounters a lot less annoying (what with the short animations and not having to send out any Pokemon to battle it) If you enjoyed gen1 and want to revisit Kanto, buy it. If you're looking for that complex, competitive layer that was found in Sun and Moon, it won't be for you.",
