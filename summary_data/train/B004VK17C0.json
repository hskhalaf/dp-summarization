Reached out to the company and they put a new driver in the mail. Great customer service. However, the next day, the head flew off the 3 wood. This occurred at the driving range with a professional instructor there, so you know he wasn't abusing the clubs. And, he only weighs 125 pounds, so it's not like he is too strong for typical clubs. I don't get it. Now I'll be asking for a full refund. I am hoping they will stand by the 1 year warranty.",

I've used them many times at the driving range and have gone to the course at least 10 times now with them. I would recommend them for people looking to get a good starter set and not pay the crazy amounts for callaways, or taylor made.",

      "text": "This is great for beginners and intermediates.. the only thing that i cant find to figure out is the driver but that can then again be the way i swing... i need less degrees or it might be a bit short for me. Also the bag doesnt look to fancy but who cares? If it bothers you when you get then buy another one used! My recommendation of the beginner/intermediate sets out there is to get this one!",

The only minor problem is the 3 wood is a little flexible kind of like a women's club but it still hits nicely. Perfect for a begineer like myself and even for intermediate players.",

I recommend this set to any beginner who wnat to improve their game. Its a nice 16 set of clubs!!",

    "description": "AMAZON.COM\n\n\nPINEMEADOW PRE 16-PIECE COMPLETE GOLF SET\nHit the course with confidence with the Pinemeadow Pre 16-piece complete golf set, which includes everything you need for a day on the links. The Pre Set starts with a titanium-enhanced 10.5-degree driver with a controlled-launch graphite shaft. The driver is engineered for maximum distance and power, helping you make short work of par 4s and 5s. The middle distances are covered by the fairway wood and hybrid. The wood includes a graphite shaft and a low-profile 15-degree head to create better shots from the fairway and rough. The hybrid is even more versatile, with a premium steel shaft and a 21-degree head that excels when hitting from any type of lie. The driver, 3-wood, and 3-hybrid come with custom head covers.\n\nThe set also includes a full range of stainless-steel irons (4 through 9 and pitching wedge)--each with perimeter-weighted heads, a wide cavity back design, an oversized sweet spot, and a tour-style grip. And once you've reached the green, you can pull out the Pre mallet putter, which is weighted for an improved feel and response. The putter allows you to align the ball precisely each time, giving you the confidence to make important putts. To complete the set, Pinemeadow added a lightweight dual-strap carrying bag with an integrated kickstand and rain hood.\n\nDRIVER: Titanium enhanced 10.5 degree driver engineered for maximum distance and power.
