The viewing window is big enough for me. Easy to download pics to my computer. This camera is capturing many memories for me. I'm enjoying this camera and would purchase another from Canon. I recommend you buy another battery so when vacationing and or on outings, you'll have another on hand. As you know, the battery always gets low during inconvenient time(s). There have been many times, it's given out but luckily my backup battery is always on hand. :-)",

      "text": "I used to have a Canon S200 and this is superior in so many ways. Superquick from power on to being ready for picture, terrific pictures (colors are awesome), tiny camera (pocket size), fast scrolling through pics on camera, good red-eye reduction software, great video. In total, I am completely satisfied with this camera. I bought the 300 instead of the 400 as I read that the pictures with the 400 are not as good due to compressing more resolution on the same size CCD. Don't know if this is the case, but the 4 megapixels is plenty for just about everything.",

The only other downfall is no on demand battery meter, it only lets you know a little before it goes dead. The camera takes great pictures, easy on the eyes menu system and plenty fast w/o superfast memory. If you want better than this in the Canon line skip the SD400(it dosen't take better pictures) and go right to the SD500.",

My little cousins loved using it because it's so easy to take pictures. Lag time is practically non-existant. Battery life is incredible! I'm buying another one.

I suppose I could've bought a case or screen protector, but figured it was at least engineered well enough to survive in a pocket. After all, previous cameras and cell phone lcds always have. Luckily, J&R accepted the return and refunded my money. Feature-wise, I haven't yet found anything else I like quite as much as the SD300.",

It is not just mine, I know people with this camera and orbs frequently show up in dark pictures and sometimes in other pictures. This was cool for about a day. Other than that I like it, I mean I didn't return it and that says something.",

Read the reviews on this website and you will see that many customers have had a mysterious 'memory error' and/or the lens jamming (E18 error). These problems have shown up at about 18 months on all of these models. Since Canon hasn't fixed the problem in over 3 years since it first started showing up, I wouldn't want to bet that the new SD300 camera won't also turn into a paperweight after 18 months. Oh - I forgot to mention that Canon will 'fix' the cameras for $150. Nothing like turning a defective camera into a profit center.",

    "title": "Canon Powershot SD300 4MP Digital Elph Camera with 3x Optical Zoom",
    "description": "Canon Powershot SD300 4MP Digital Elph Camera with 3x Optical Zoom\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nFrom its ultra-thin design to its high resolution, high performance features, the PowerShot SD300 Digital Elph is like no other digital camera. Compact and easy to use, its softly flowing metal body is richly appointed with coating. It's a camera as beautiful as the pictures it creates.\n\n High-resolution elegance and an impressive zoom\nThe ultra-sleek, ultra-slim 4.0-megapixel PowerShot SD300 Digital Elph comes with a 3x optical zoom and 3.6x digital for an 11x combined zoom. This makes the camera as stylish as it is powerful and allows it to deliver the resolution to create stunning prints and on-screen images. The optical zoom makes brilliant close-ups effortlessly easy.\n\n New large 2.0-inch LCD screen for easy image preview and playback\nThough its body is superbly slim, the PowerShot SD300 Digital Elph has an oversized 2.0-inch LCD screen that makes it easy to frame and play back your scene.\n\n Impressively small, surprisingly powerful\nThe PowerShot SD300 Digital Elph's UA lens features a glass-molded aspherical design with an ultra-high refractive index. The advantage? You get exquisitely sharp and colorful images from a 3x zoom lens that's smaller than previous 2x zooms.\n\n Canon's latest imaging technology enhances picture quality\nThe PowerShot SD300 Digital Elph is the first in the PowerShot line to incorporate Canon's new DIGIC II Image Processor. Designed to improve processing speed and image quality, the DIGIC II processor provides markedly faster camera startup, autofocus, and playback, plus it assures that every image is more colorfully vibrant.\n\n Selectable movie recording speeds\nThe PowerShot SD300 Digital Elph is the first digital camera to let you shoot in a Fast Frame Rate Movie at 60 frames per second with full motion video (320x240), so you can capture fast-moving subjects. The camera also gives you the option of 30 frames per second (640x480) for general shooting. For e-mail attachments, select the compact movie setting.\n\n Expand the creative ideas\nThe PowerShot SD300 Digital Elph lets you take as much or as little control as you like. Nine preset modes allow you to handle even tough shooting conditions with confidence, and new scene modes including Digital Macro Mode widen your shooting capabilities. Or you can select manual and do everything yourself.\n\n Auto\nThe camera chooses all the settings so you can concentrate on your subject.\n\n Manual\nThe ultimate in creative control, you set aperture and shutter speed.\n\n Stitch Assist\nBuild inspiring panoramas by neatly aligning sequential images.\n\n Digital Macro\nShoot larger-than-life close-ups with one-button simplicity.\n\n Portait\nThe camera sets a large aperture, focuses the subject, and artistically blurs the background to make your subject pop.\n\n Night Snapshot\nCapture people against a softly glowing night background without a tripod.\n\n Kids & Pets\nShoot moving subjects without losing your chance to get those unforgettable moments.\n\n Indoor\nImproves natural color and reduces camera shake while shooting under artificial light.\n\n Underwater\nAchieve natural-looking color even when shooting underwater.\n\n One-button downloading and printing plus ID Photo Print and Movie Print\nThe SD300's Print/Share Button makes direct printing easier than ever. Simply connect the SD300 to a Canon Direct Photo Printer or PictBridge supported printer, press the Print/Share Button, and print! Also use the Print/Share Button to transfer images directly to a computer (Windows).\n\n Print your own ID photos in 28 different sizes or use the Movie Print function to output multiple stills from a recorded movie on a single sheet using any Canon Compact Photo Printer.",
