      "text": "I have recommended to many patients to get wrist splints for night time for carpal tunnel, but when I developed carpal tunnel I was not entirely sure which to try. These looked like they would give good support so I gave them a try. They did not work for my carpal tunnel - it puts too much pressure over the median nerve and actually made my symptoms worse. The key is to keep the wrist in a neutral position at night without putting pressure on the nerve, and these do not do that at all. I ended up returning it since it was not helping. It may work for other purposes but definitely would not recommend for carpal tunnel.",

If you want to wear them during the day it can rub uncomfortably on the base of the thumb (see photo). I also had to customize the metal bar inside the splint. I've also found sometimes the bar slips down too far, which impeads proper function and is not comfortable. My solution for this was to add a piece of Velcro sticker on the bar and stick it to the inside of the bar space.",

This braces allows your blood to flow and provides rigid support which trust me, you need. ESPECIALLY if you are going to wear these at night. The interior is soft enough and in general the brace is quite comfortable. I only had to wear mine for about 4 work days before the (internal) inflammation had finally subsided; I am sure these braces provided the rest my wrists needed.",
