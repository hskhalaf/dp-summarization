      "text": "Easily the most poorly designed piece of electronics in a decade. It is poorly balanced. It is sometimes hard to get it to stop fast forwarding. The touch screen is inconsistent in terms of sensitive to touch. Once programmed, it is very hard to make changes to equipment settings and it does not \u201clearn\u201d even after repeated manual changes to the same setting. The battery dies suddenly (though having rechargeable batteries is a nice touch). In short, a complete waste of money. It is so bad that it will be a while before I buy anything else from Logitech. An update - purchased this in October. It died in January.",

The last complaint is that it does not always turn devices on or off when its supposed to and of course the \"help\" button to fix it is behind the lock screen.

When the I dropped and shattered the Harmony One, I found that Logitech had replaced it with this newer model. Having received the Touch, I found the One's wonderfully formatted physical layout replaced with a larger touch screen that was significantly less useful. Overall, I cannot recommend this product.",

The layout is cleaner, the balance is better, and the touch screen is much better than the comparable features on the older Harmony 700 (there is no touch screen). All in all, a substantial improvement. The setup was easy, interfacing with the Logitech on-line software to copy the old remote settings to the new Harmony Touch. Tweaking the settings was slightly confusing, and I'm still fine-tuning some the sequences. Overall, this is a good product, and if it lasts as long as the 700 did, will be a worthwhile expenditure overall.",

It is easy to set up (if you have the model numbers for your equipment) and the event based programming (Watch TV--Watch a Movie--Listen to Music--etc.) work very well. Only the needed components turn on and everything is set for the activity chosen. The ability to choose up to 30 channels for immediate switching is why I bought the unit (the Comcast remote being 'clunky' to use) and that works great. Beyond that, one can fully control any of the devices in your system and this remote 'knows' all the commands. This one really does work.!",

      "text": "We've been considering getting a universal remote for years and bought this on the recommendation of a friend. There are a few issues which have made it a somewhat disappointing choice. First, you ABSOLUTELY cannot move while it turns on the various components (TV, DVR, Tuner). If you do, you will be unsuccessful. Second, since it's somewhat small (not usually a bad thing), you do find yourself pushing the wrong buttons when you're just adjusting the volume. Third, although they say not to keep it in the charger, you have no idea how long the battery stays charged and, so, when it's low you no longer have any control of your components. Good thing we kept all of our remotes!!!",

Everything worked the first time after programming. The favorite TV channels on the touch screen if my wife's favorite feature. I would recommend this to anyone needing to get rid of the multiple remotes cluttering up your coffee table!",

Amazon of course had it the cheapest.",
