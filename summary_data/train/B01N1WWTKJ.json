What I didn\u2019t like about this was the issue I had with charging, after each use I would place these in the charging case only for them not to be charged when I would next use them also both earbuds needed to be in to be able to use them.",

A pity as I had seen very positive reviews of the technology. Hopefully others will be luckier and have newer stock.",

Think of IQbuds as like having a stereo equalizer in your ears to adjust treble and bass. Primary dislike: battery life should be longer.

Only real issue I have is that they can be kind of painful to wear for long periods which is probably what you'd want to wear them for since they can be used as extra ears, but i have found ways to make them fit better and have mitigated that problem a bit. A bit pricey but if you want high quality ear buds and don't expect them to be as good as bose over ear headphones like some of these people, you will be happy.",

So not new.. none of the items were in the correct spot where they should have been in the box, just scattered about. Not a good first impression. Ear goop on the earbuds(they could at least cleaned them), the case that holds the buds was scratched on the outside,\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44 When ever I put the earbuds in they would make a loud feedback into my ear not the best feeling every time I use them. Had high hopes for these... To be fair the sound quality was pretty amazing, and the app is fun. Definitely not worth the big bucks for a used product though.",

Unfortunately, I had to return them after two days because the the bluetooth connection on these are spotty at best. With my phone in my front jeans pocket, the sound would cut in and out constantly. The get started guide even warns of a low connection when the phone is near your waist, but a high connection when your phone is near your shoulder. WHO CARRIES THEIR PHONE ON THEIR SHOULDER?!?!?!

The Bluetooth connection is HORRIBLE. I had my phone sitting on my desk, on my left side (that's where the Bluetooth antenna is), literally 3 feet from the earbuds and they continually cut out. Don't even think about putting your phone in your pocket! Basically if you are not keeping your phone on your left side, above your chest, the connection is spotty at best. For $300 I should be able to have my phone anywhere on my person and not have to worry about losing a connection. Returned after two days.",
