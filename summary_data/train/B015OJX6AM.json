I like this aspect but it may mean they might ware out quicker....we shall see. The color is great, though it does say 'blue depths' so I was expecting a very dark dark navy. They are more of a bright navy color, but I really like it! It's different. Delivery time was excellent. I ordered on a Tuesday and received them in the Netherlands on the Friday.",
