We unboxed, downloaded the Aura app, and were excited to get started loading photos for my parents. But the Aura app required read and write access to all photos in my phone\u2019s photo library before I could take the next step. I tried and tried to say \u201cno\u201d and continue, but there was no way around it. And there\u2019s no way I\u2019m allowing some unknown party that kind of access to my photo library. So, if you\u2019re concerned about the privacy and integrity of your visual images, this is not the frame for you. Back it goes.",

This isn\u2019t a cheap device you\u2019d pick up at Walmart- it\u2019s very sturdy/heavy and has an Apple like packaging feel. As for loading photos, it\u2019s no different than texting. Select your photos, click done, and they are on their way to the frame. The auto dimming and motion detection is on point. My only complaint is the proprietary cord connection. If you have four legged chewers in your family, be-warned. Sigh- suppose a usb-c connection would have been too much",
