Excellent choice for our guest room and compliments the decor nicely....also, for what you get, can't beat the price! AWESOME DEAL!!! Very happy with this purchase.",

So when they had their last sale I got the idea to check Amazon. I am so glad I did!!! Not only did they have the color I wanted, but it was $50.00 cheaper than their sale price. Great quality and beautiful colors. Would recommend this lovely addition to my bedroom to everyone.",

It's a shame cause it's beautiful color but it's a pain every morning trying to tug it into just the right place to where it covers the mattress. Really wasn't worth the money for how it looks on my bed and the aggravation that comes with it.",

The sheets got a little softer when washed, but the set also shrunk so much it is now unusable on our bed. And yes, we followed the washing instructions on the set.
