      "text": "I have been using flash drives for many years. I can't comment on the durability of this individual drive as I just got it, but a SanDisk drive has never failed me while in use. Speed was as expected for USB 2. I'm using these for archival backups so USB 3 speed isn't as critical as expense. Transferred 125 GB of files in one operation and lesser amounts in others. The device did not warm up in use. The Vault encryption would have added time to the operation. I only used it for sensitive documents. No point in encrypting family photos and home movies.",

The red plastic handle is translucent and there's an activity light that lights when it's connected to the USB bus. As far as I can see the rate of flashing is independent of any activity that's going on. It flashes constantly at a rate of about once per second. Still nice to know when it's connected. Transfer speeds are fine for my use (synchronizing files between the computer and flash drive). I haven't measured it but it seems neither too fast nor too slow. Time will tell how long it lasts.",
