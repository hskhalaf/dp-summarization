They can take a soft bounce or a firm push without issues, but don't expect them to stay upright with excessive horseplay or while doing belly flops next to them. That would be unreasonable given what they are used for. I have a small inflatable pool used mostly for socializing with adults and these are perfect!",

One thing that was a little annoying, leading to my 4 star review, is that if the float is properly inflated and full of air, it's a bit difficult to take your drinks out of the float--so you just wind up lifting the whole thing and smacking yourself in the eye with a unicorn horn.",

They actually hold a drink well and float, super fun addition to the pool. Pleasantly surprised with the quality and size. Great for the skinny hard seltzer cans, a plastic party cup, or a regular sized can",

Fits a regular beer/soda can and holds it in place. Did well floating in the pool with a few waves from the kids. Not sure if they will last more than one season as they are just basic vinyl floats, but good enough for the price.",

The only thing of note is that the palm tree acts as a sort of sail, so if you let it go, the wind takes your precious drink away. I tried tying a string to it, but that was worse. It ended up acting as a nice way to trick me into exercising, as I had to swim to reach it. All in all, 10/10. I bought another pack.",
