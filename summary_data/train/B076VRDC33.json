But now that I\u2019ve actually tried it, I literally went to Amazon right after I took it off and ordered some more. It rejuvenated my skin, and I could really feel the hydration and see the glow on my face. Korean beauty products are well known for their ability to restore moisture on your skin. And this product is so simple to use. Open package, put on face, wait a few minutes with a gold mask, and voila! flawless skin come through! \ud83e\udd29",

      "text": "Other than emotionally scarring my son, this mask seems pretty good. This was my first ever \"stick this one piece of film over your whole face\" mask. When opening I was shocked at how SUPER WET it was. It seemed like it was covered with 1/4\" of aloe-mixture. Therefore, it has the potential to be very messy. It definitely added some hydration to my skin, but I am not sure I will buy another as I am willing to bet there are masks out there just as hydrating that cost less. Plus, I can only afford so much therapy for my kids....",

Because I do have a tendency to break out when using new skin products I used this for the recommended time, and after removing I waited an hour then lightly rinsed any residual moisturizer off. It was a lovely little spa treatment!",

Overall an amazing mask I would recommend to anyone!",
