Also I think my neighbors first thought I was crazy. In fact I thought I might be before I tried it, but now I am having the last laugh as they pay for a cheap mower every two years and all the gas.",

I spent more time picking out teeny tiny sticks out of the blades then anything else. Sometimes it just wouldn't keep going because grass was stuck in it. I was a sweaty mess after I was done and it's a fairly cool day. Oh and you can't get it close to anything and it super clunky to turn.",

Easy assembly, but pay attention to your blade height. Can be adjusted by the two bolts at the bottom of the mower. Very simple and just fun to use, not to mention a great cardio work out.",

It does a pretty good job of cutting the grass, however, for it to work properly, your lawn needs to be completely level without any divots or holes in the yard. Mine has those things. This meant that the grass was constantly longer in some areas than others. I bought a Ryobi Battery Powered Mower now and it does a really good job on the card. I would recommend this for really small yards but nothing extensive. If you are going to be buying a Reel Mower for a bigger yard, look at the Fiskars StaySharp Reel Mower. I have heard nothing but amazing things about that.",

When you call the average wait time is 20 minutes and the \"service centers\" they provide are either out of business or simply refuse to work on Remington reel mowers. I found out the hard way and unfortunately it cost me $75.00. Do not buy this! Shame on them.",
