Softwood makes shipping less expensive, sure, and it's a lousy choice for a crib.",

It's not Oak, that's for sure, but I own some Maple furniture and I'd say it's closer to that. I was happily surprised by the relative hardness while being as light as it is.

My husband had it put together in less than an hour on his own without much difficulty. The crib is modern, sturdy and much less expensive than some other cribs with similar looks. We bought a standard crib mattress and it fit without any issue. Baby hasn't yet arrived so we can't comment on the ease of lowering the height for a bit but overall we're pretty pleased!",
