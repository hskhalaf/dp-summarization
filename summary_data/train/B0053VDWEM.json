I was able to do all the things that probably jacked my knee up in the first place with this on. I kept wearing it, and minded my knee and it eventually healed. Gave it to my father and he hasn't given it back. I wish their were more color options or that it was a bit more affordable or came with two, but I'm perfectly please with what I got.",

Using center/outside of knee for starting point, measure 4 3/4\" down your calf. Measure around calf for circumference. Make sure measure tape is not too tight or too loose. If your thigh measurements are split between two sizes, choose the Comfort (C) size. Refer to sizing chart & video for correct sizing.",
