I wonder why they ship a thin cushion and sell a thick cushion as an upgrade. At $250 a stand, the thick cushion should be an option in the base price. Another critique, seems like everyone online tries to wrap the front of the deck to help deaden noise. They could ship it with a solution for that.",

This stand awesome and easy to use with practice. I still have a little trouble getting the cleat by the seat to dig firmly into the tree on the first attempt, but it is too easy to re-adjust. You will need to add cord or rubber to the platform. This is my only complaint. Nothing is perfect. The seat makes noise on the platform when collapsed and you are backpacking it into the woods.",

The integrated bow holder works well as long as the stand is hung perfectly, for my Bear Motive 7 anyway. I wouldn't depend on it in all situations. I also bought the easy hook strap, but found this stand so light that I could easily hang it using the climbing sticks and a linemens belt.",
