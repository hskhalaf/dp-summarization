Vent panel on each side has a canvas overhang to still allow air movement yet prevents rain from blowing in. This is my first year so I can't speak to longevity but they are heavy canvas and seem well made and look like they will last. Would definitely buy again.",

They fit our couch and two chairs perfectly and we love the fact that they have elastic straps on the bottom corners to slip easily over the feet. We recently had some extremely heavy winds and the covers stayed in place. Heavy quality, but easy to stash in covered storage. Would highly recommend. Especially for the price, we're very impressed.",
