      "verdict": "The Supra Method, a sneaker of choice of mostly skaters, is splashed with dozens of attractive colorways. The cut-away segment around the collar is supported by a stretchy and spongy neoprene which doubles as insulation.It\u2019s the same material that makes up the protruded tongue and the covering across the midfoot for a cozier feeling on the instep. The Achilles area is kept secured as the raised heel works as a supportive buttress, while the cushioning inside cradles the feet from impact.",
      "pros": [
        "The Supra Method allows for effortless on and off, according to many",
        "Supra does not scrimp on materials in constructing this well-assembled sneaker, as detailed by many buyers",
        "The cushy upper offers comfort to the arched part on top of the foot, mentioned by users",
        "This cushioning in this shoe is liberally distributed offering a fantastic comfort, as noted by lots of reviewers",
        "The removable insole works like a mattress under the feet, as stated by a reviewer",
        "The cushioned neoprene works as added support on the Achilles heel cited by a couple of users",
        "In spite of its full-bodied frame, the Supra Method is lightweight, as stated by several reviewers",
        "The mid-top cleatie concept of the Method shoe looks even more charming with jeans, mentioned by some users",
        "Its rubber sole has tons of flexibility and shock absorbency, noted by a couple of skaters",
        "According to a couple of reviewers, its flex grooves allows users to have control on their boards"

      "cons": [
        "Some reviewers feel that the heel area is a bit wide",
