When you do that, it only sucks dirt in a 2 inch path out of the 13 inch span of the front of the vacuum. This means you have to work 6x as much AND forget about even getting anywhere near the baseboards. I can go on and on about the lack of functionality this \"WANNABE a vacuum\" (any vacuum, pick one..its better than this one) does not handle. Do yourself a favor and buy a broom instead!!",

It\u2019s definitely top heavy so when you use the hose to clean anything it tops over. It also doesn\u2019t work on hard floors, which is kinda a big con for me but that\u2019s where the cone end. This vacuum is incredibly powerful, it pulls pet hair and dust I didn\u2019t even know was in my carpet, out. I am extremely happy with this purchase and would recommend to anyone with pets!",

With 4 pets the embedded hair in den carpet was unimaginable. This vacuum went over it like nothing and the carpet is clean clean. I was amazed and I really wish I had taken a before and after picture. It worked so quickly. It\u2019s a bulky machine so it\u2019s not easy to transport throughout the house, but I wanted a quality machine for a good price and I assume the bulk is a byproduct of the high suction power. Anyway, best vacuum I\u2019ve owned.",

It picks up just as well as my old Electrolux canister vacuum but doesn't kill my back lugging it up and down stairs in a split level home. Maneuverability is great and it's super easy to empty and clean. The canister is huge, too. Two mild flaws only: 1) I wish the cord was retractable, and 2) the hose attachment with the spinning brush doesn't work too well, because it only spins from the force of the air being pulled through it. I don't find myself using that attachment much anymore. Otherwise, this is an amazing product for the price. I'll only buy Hoovers from now on.",
