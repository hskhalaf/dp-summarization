No where in the documentation did it say there was a tiny switch on the bottom of the unit to set it to PC or MAC. Had I known that it would have set up a lot easier because it came set to MAC. On a laptop without a NumLock Key you still might have a little work to do. Other than that it deserves 5 stars.",
