The trundle is now also unlevel due to the wheels which is only obvious when it's pushed in, in the close position. I'd say the trundle needs not only stronger materials but additional wheels and support so that it wouldn't droop towards the floor. The headboard/footboard arrived with black stains on them probably from the manufacturing process. Update: after a trip to Lowes, we purchased washers to put inbetween the wheels and the frame. One of the wheels has been losing its ball bearings and won't come off!",

      "text": "This was easy to assemble. Parts are clearly marked and it went together in an hour. I suggest using a screw gun. When assembling the trundle mattress bars - place the plastic ends and mid piece, place over holes, insert open end first then middle and side against front board. The side board helps with inserting the plastic end into holes without any issues. Do not remove plastic from holes or they will break. Two years it has been used in a guest room and still looks great! I would buy another one.",
