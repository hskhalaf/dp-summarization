I've replaced the hard-drive (which is normal as hard-drives don't necessarily last as long) and I would have replaced the processor if it wasn't hard-wired into it. They simply don't make them like the used to and I was so upset when it just stopped multi-tasking efficiently and had to get a new one. Needless to say, everyone in the family still uses it for personal use because EVERYTHING on it still works.",

And make sure to get a touchscreen, like this little beauty--that's what Windows 8 is for--not for mousing and keystrokes. The little computer is fast, fun, very light. Perfect for surfin and light computer work. My husband thinks the screen is too small for movies--I think it's perfect. Crystal clear and sound is fine. It's NOT a gaming machine. I traded down from a 13.3 Toshiba Satellite that is coughing its last breaths and I love. Great little machine for the \"pinklover\" in your life.",

Still struggling a bit with Windows 8.1 (which you have to update to), but that is not an Asus problem. The laptop is a perfect size and the battery life is perhaps not the 5 hours advertised, but it is reasonable....haven't actually timed it out. And I LOVE the pink color. It's one possible minus is that when the battery needs replacing, you have to remove the back of the unit to get to the battery; however it CAN be done. I'm just hoping that maybe the original will last until I'm ready for an upgrade.",

I ordered this along with a 120gb samsung SSD (7mm as it must be a low profile SSD) and an intel wifi/bluetooth card, knowing I'd want those two upgrades.. swapping out the stock hard drive and wifi card was a piece of cake - only took 10 minutes. To all those who say this laptop is too slow - upgrade to an SSD.. it makes a world of difference, and is completely silent (compared to a traditional HDD which you can hear). I don't use the touch-screen much, but it is multi-touch which is nice. Overall, a great value. Highly recommended.",

As it comes with Windows 8, I just have to say that based on 20+ years of IT experience, Windows 8 is a total disaster. You are going to be much better off with a Windows 7 laptop or a laptop that has a downgradable license and comes with Win7.",

There is one important drawback, however: the trackpad is way too sensitive and positioned in such a way that, at certain angles, it's easy to brush it with the back of the palm while typing, which can make your cursor move and your focus to be lost. It can be difficult to write something long, and it's very frustrating when filling up web forms. Of course, this can be solved by just deactivating the trackpad and using an external mouse.",

DUHH. but overall i would recommend this beauty to anyone wanting a decent laptop and needs to be extremy mobile. im planning on getting for my self!",
