I had some people tell me that if I tried to do more than one thing at a time on it, it would struggle to cope. As I write this I have 10 tabs, Word, and Outlook running. No issues at all.

      "text": "Simply put: not powerful enough to run Windows 10. The quad-core Celeron is barely enough for daily browsing, but the 2GB and 32GB of flash are not. I installed Linux on it, and even with Linux you have to choose a light distribution (I used Lubuntu) to get enough free memory. Also, the touchpad is very small and not very accurate. My advice is to forget these kind of subnotebooks. If you just have to browse the internet, watch netflix etc, maybe when traveling, get a Chromebook with touch screen (see the Acer R11, for example). If you have to seriously use Windows, don't waste your money. Spend more, but get a decent laptop.",

This is a cheap lap top, it cannot process a lot and does struggle with doing a lot of things at once. If you know that and still want it, it's lovely! Great design, very light, works incredibly well. I only ever have a hard time with it when I have more than three things open (Chrome, Word and SPSS for example). But I am very glad I bought this and really recommend it especially for how cheap it is.",

This does the job perfectly, with a surprisingly speedy performance and a solid battery life that gets me through the day. I picked this up as an open box return via Amazon Warehouse Deals and am very pleased to have done so. A recommended buy, for sure.",

It is also slightly too big to be really useful. And it is very underpowered. Windows 10 takes nearly its whole power. I bought it to replace an Ideapad Flex 10, but it is nothing like as robust a machine. I made the huge mistake of buying two of these at the same time. I have been using ThinkPads for years, but will be very hard to encourage to buy another one after this experience. I am replacing it as soon as I can.",

Ironically the 100S is still quite happily working while this happens. I've spent a week trying to resolve it by installing and reinstalling and it isn't worth the grief just avoid it.",
