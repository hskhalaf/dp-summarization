This being (not the best) excellent quality and incredibly low price, its value makes it a 5 STAR BUY! I've been a carpenter for 15yrs and I would absolutely recommend this product to coworkers, general contractors, really anyone with the need for a stand like this, I would recommend buying this one!

The one fault I did find in it, is that the tightening screw for the arms that hold the round support attachment to is in the corner of the square tube. This means to store it vertical you have to remove the tightening screw or risk breaking the tri-knob. No big deal, just would be easier to store though and doesn't deter usage.",

With the \u201crails\u201d attached to the bottom of the saw, it can still be used on the ground or on a work table, which is nice. Be careful folding the legs of the stand; it\u2019s pretty easy to get a finger pinched. Otherwise, highly recommended.",

I especially appreciate the side arms that hold the baseboards in place instead of having to have someone standing there holding it so it doesn't move.
