Look at the customer photos closely. Even the 4 and 5 star rated reviews, almost every single knife has a rounded tip. Almost none have an intact point. If you're OK with removing a major aspect of the utility of your blade, have at it. You'll have very sharp knives for the main body of the blade...but you'll lose the point completely.",

      "text": "It's a decent small belt sander, but really poor for knife sharpening. You cannot control the direction of the belt, so you have one bevel being pulled along toward the burr and one bevel cutting towards the spine. This generates an uneven bevel and an inconsistent burr on all steels I have tried so far. Also, due to the soft belt materials and the innate tendency of soft belts to convex grind with barely any pressure, it's nearly impossible to not round tips. It makes me sad, because it's a made in USA product with great build quality.",

I'm not a pro knife sharpener but I was shaving the hair off my arms with every knife in the house after using this thing. I sharpened every blade in the house in less than an hour. It comes with 2 sets of belts and I purchased an extra 2 set, I could start a small business with this thing. This is the easiest sharpening kit I have ever had. You can buy the second generation sharpener for double the money but this will be fine for most folks.",

I'm going to order some 320 grit and 800 grit belts from an aftermarket manufacturer (Red Label Abrasives) and will try these to avoid removing too much metal, especially when sharpening softer steels, and for any knife that's not \"butter knife dull\".

I thought I had the Henkles sharp. Nope. I did one knife that needed sharpening, and omg .., surgical sharp. In fact, after washing the knife, I bumped it with my hand. Not a slash across the blade, just a soft bump. It cut me pretty good. The Kershaw Brawler ... not a great knife but I like the tanto style. It dulled rather easily. The Thermite is my favorite. But, again, after using this sharpener ... razor sharp. Add the leather belt with compound and you'll never use a stone again.",

The little sharpener itself is easy to use and does sharpen knife blades fairly sharp (but not razor sharp). The little belts it uses are way too thin and wear out before a good hard steel blade becomes sharp. You can buy replacement belts, but in my humble opinion, a good sharpening stone does a better job, just takes a little more elbow grease.",

You do have to be careful about the tip of the knife because it will round off the point if pulled completely through. Not a big problem just technigue.
