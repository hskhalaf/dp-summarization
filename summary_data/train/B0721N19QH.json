Love that fact that you can play indoors and it keeps the kids active and off their devices!! It's simple to play and does not damage walls, furniture, etc.. The red \"birdie\" is for slow play and the yellow one is for faster play. Paddles are sturdy yet lightweight! Fun game!",

My dog grabs them when they hit the ground, cuz he wants to play too, and he hasn't damaged them. I got these for our family to play with during the COVID quarantine and we have hours of fun daily with them. The # for us to beat is 127 back and forths :) My children are in their 20's and love these. They would be great for all ages! Get them and get outside, you won't regret it!",

They have birdies which you can play even in the house or closer together and the other two birdies are great to play in the backyard or pretty much anywhere. We also tried the ball but that\u2019s a little too hard for us but the teenage girls love that. Everything fits just perfectly into the carry bag which is included. Very fun and it is so nice not to be concerned about having a net!! Highly recommend if you have kids and want to keep them occupied for a while and having fun!",

Overall, it's very fun and addicting to play this game, can get quiet a good workout especially if playing in a tennis court. The reason why I didn't give five stars is because of the birdies. The rackets are well made but the birdies are weak, they are fun to play with but after a game, one part of the birdie would fall out. Wish the birdies were as sturdy as the rackets.",
