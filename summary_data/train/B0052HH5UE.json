Not sure how well this would hold up with a larger dog, but it stays up just fine for mine, even when she jumps & puts her paws up on the ledges. If you have a rowdier dog, I\u2019d imagine this might slide all over the place so I would recommend having this on non-slip carpet or a rug of some sort.",

I found that one was not large enough for the dogs to move around freely, but the purchase of two allows me to have the dogs have the ability to move away for our RV a little. The pens fold easily and are about 2 inches wide when folded. If you had a large dog I would worry about them jumping, but my four are content to wait until we let them out.",

I haven't been able to figure out how this could be changed, though, so it's probably just the nature of the pen for indoor use. I would definitely recommend this for people with puppies or small dogs, since it keeps them in one place, but gives them space to move around.",

Loved it so much, I purchased a second one & had it shipped to my family in another state. So, that we would have a safe zone for her, while we're visiting.
