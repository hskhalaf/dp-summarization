They'd constantly track it into their food dish, and no amount of sifting could handle the food particles and waste. I switched over to this repti-mat, I'm happy and the dragons are happy! Every week I remove everything from their terrarium, shake this outside, brush it off, and it's good to go. I replace it every 2-3 months. No more sand in their food, and it's really easy to keep clean. It comes in a large sheet, which you can cut down to size to suit your needs.",

He\u2019s 8 months old so maybe it\u2019s due to him going through growth spurts - but this is first time we\u2019ve tried the brown one, it just seems more fibery than the green. The box on this one was quite bashed and torn too. But outside Amazon packaging was perfect - so someone at dispatch sent this out in poor condition. The mat was ok tho.",
