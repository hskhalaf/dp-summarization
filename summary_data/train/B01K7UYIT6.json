After that short amount of time, I suddenly find that the front of the show just wore out and created a hole. This hole developed to a bigger hole and now I cannot use them because they lost gripping strength when I toe hook or even smear. I expected a lot more for the money for the shoe cost. This is really REALLY disappointing.",

I originally wanted to go with the 43 because it was comfortable enough to wear when walking for more than 5min. I decided to size down to 42.5 because i heard these stretch. I'm glad I did as I think the fit is just right (very snug but not painful). These aren't hardcore by any means, but for a beginner I really like them. I I switched out the laces for \"Quick Lock\" stretch laces. This makes slipping off the back heal of the shoe between climbs way easier and faster.",

This is especially important because leather shoes like these stretch (about a half size) and if they become too big you won\u2019t be able to keep your toes on small ledges.",

Then I went in and climbed with a size 10 shoe at my local gym, which started to hurt after a while... I looked and it was a 43. Fortunately this shoe came in, and I guess they run a bit larger than the manufacturer of the gyms shoes... because these fit perfect (might even be a smidge too long). But I'm totally satisfied.",

If you have average feel like I do, you'll look like one of Cinderella's evil step sisters trying to squeeze into the glass slipper. No way anyone can fit into these unless they can describe their foot as \"dainty\". Length on them is completely fine, but the width is insanely narrow. The second, glaring, and unfortunate problem with these is the sole. Basically, the sole is hard and slick- think old crusty leather, and you are close. I'm dumbfounded that these are marketed as climbing shoes, honestly.",
