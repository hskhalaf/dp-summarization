The apps have improved immensely the FLV app (free) plays MKV, avi, even Ts, files (for Hauppage users) without the need for conversion. The ,Here, map app is also good for navigation. Itunes compatible apps, help sync Itunes music with the Nokia Phone. It uses a nano sim card slot but it also has a slot for a micro SD card, which is nice for me because I had alot of files on my 16Gb SD card. If your looking for a smartphone that is good value for money then this phone is it.",

Only downside is windows store doesn't have everything that apple and android have, so expect limited choice on apps, but that is a downside with the windows store not this phone. 5*",

A number of Apps that I would have searched for on Android are pre-installed on Lumia including maps software, compass, photo manipulation and a whole bunch of other stuff. Finding the few apps not pre-installed was easy too. The design is brilliant as well as the clarity of the images. Certainly a great buy and not pricey at all as am on contract through Amazon with O2.",

I longed for the cosy and utterly comfortable windows phone environment. Ergo I have returned to this phone again. My partner has my last one. This phone truly fits all my needs. The camera is perfectly adequate, call quality is excellent, apps are fine (I'm not a facebooker or instagramer). An absolutely solidly built phone with a superb OS. Easy to use and for me just perfect.",

I contacted seller and they arranged a return immediately and my refund was back in my bank two days after returning. The seller also replied almost immediately to any questions. 5 stars to them. 3 for the product. Avoid this phone",
