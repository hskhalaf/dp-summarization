I emailed the seller about the size before ordering and was told these would be the correct size.

Very poor quality. I wouldn't pay more than $2 for this item, much less the price I paid. I'm hoping to successfully send mine back. They are definitely NOT WORTH IT!",

The Dark Red is closer to what I wanted but it's still slightly more brick red than cranberry red, and the Wine color looks too dark for my room decor.

      "text": "I was hoping this pillow case would be softer. It's more like a canvas material. It would be ok for pillows that you don't plan on using and just want the cases for looks. They would hold up well. I wanted something softer because I sleep with my pillows. This case is very uncomfortable. And it was only one case, not two, like I expected.",

So fit, plastic hidden zipper and quality of workmanship were very good. However, color of pillow in photo appears darker more like a taupe. Pillow is really a cream color. The feel of pillow fabric more like linen than a satin/cotton feel. Overall, very pleased.",

I returned it and reordered thinking I would receive the correct shade of blue....instead, I was sent the same different color of light blue... I was very disappointed that the three pillows didn't match....am now searching for another12\"x20\" cover, but this time...a print instead of a solid color...

The color is accurately reflected on the Amazon website, but the pillow cover that arrived was 20\"x20\" in a package that says 22x22. So, you may have to order a SIZE LARGER than what you actually need. I have 10 pillows, so it's a costly mistake. Also, the seems are flimsy and tear easily, particularly along the zipper opening. The zipper is super tiny (which is good so it does not show or stick out), but I am concerned that the fabric seams will tear with any significant pressure.",
