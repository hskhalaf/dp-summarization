For $51 the set should include 2 pillowcases, a flat sheet, a fitted sheet, and a comforter. In reality, the set is 1 pillowcase, a fitted sheet, and a comforter. I\u2019ve never boughten a sheet set that didn\u2019t come with a flat sheet or two pillowcases before. It\u2019s a ripe off. Don\u2019t waste your money.",

It would have been nice if it had some small throw pillows or something but for the price I felt this was a good deal.",

      "text": "I use this set on a spare bedroom in my son's room. The quality is just ok. It looks great with all his spiderman decor, but I don't think it's good enough quality for everyday wear and tear. It feels like it would get worn out quickly. It works for us, since I only really need it for decoration and the occasional sleepover if he has a friend over. Just rating it appropriately for those who may be looking for an every day set for their child.",
