It's smaller and very discreet. I have used it with two different iPhones (4 & 5), and it works pretty well. The noise assassin feature is very effective. People on the other side of the line have told me they can't tell I'm on a Bluetooth headset, and this is while having moderate surrounding noise (I haven't tried with heavy/intense noise, although in those circumstances I wouldn't even bother talking on the phone). Mine was a refurbished unit, but it works just fine.",

The sound isn't muted, tin-y, or weak like one would expect out of a mono-speaker bluetooth set designed primarily for taking calls. Obviously you'd get better sound out of dedicated music headsets, but this is definitely one to go for if you're looking for a low-cost option for both music listening and phone calls. I knock one star off this thing because the A2DP doesn't work until you update it from Jawbone's website, and the lack of simulcast for A2DP devices is disappointing (You have to go more expensive for that!).",
