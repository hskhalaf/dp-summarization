Because it was not expensive, I originally thought it was going to be ok for a year, but have been very surprised and happy 3 years later. The screen still operates flawlessly, the sound quality is good. It has taken the rough ride of my jeep both on and off roading. Only issue is the volume from bluetooth pairing with phone could be higher max (it is a Jeep after all).",
