      "text": "Bought these 6 months ago. I do delivery work and on average work 11 hour days, 5-6 days a week. The shoe is lightweight and comfortable. They fit really well as I also replaced the inserts with an arch orthotic. The upper fared pretty well, but the soles wore down to the foam. That being said, this shoe has lasted a lot longer than the Nike and Saucony that I have worn for this type of work. I also realize that it is a running shoe and not a work shoe. That being said, I would definitely buy them again.",

Now I'm a walker and can't justify a $150 running shoe so I thought I'd try this model at essentially half the price. I am glad I did, their lighter but have more then enough cushioning for my 5 mile walks. I don't know how much bounce on heel strike you'd get on a run compared with the higher end models or how much sooner it might breakdown, nut these are quite nice for the money. I understand their now discontinued, I would have bought another pair if I knew.",
