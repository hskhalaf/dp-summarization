However, recently the large numbers in the bottom window have started to fade. The solar battery indicates a full charge, so that can't be the problem. I have worn the watch almost every day for the last year under normal conditions (nothing crazy or extreme). I even take it off before a shower. For a watch that looks super tough............its very disappointing. With this in mind, I would not buy this watch again. Bummer.",

The sensor button that switches from barometer to altimeter, compass etc is just in a horrible place. Just going about my day I end up hitting that button so when I check the time I have to switch back to clock mode. Not a huge issue, just a minor annoyance.

      "text": "This is a great watch. Radio time adjust. Barometer which is great in this area because of summer storms. Thermometer is useless as far as I can tell. Altitude might be useful if I get out of flat country. Very legible display. Solar charging always a plus. Out of the box you may want to charge it fully in sunlight. If you spend a lot of time outdoors don't worry about it. It will get there. I am very happy with this watch. It is a multipurpose tool actually. Stopwatch, Timer, sunrise sunset times. For this to be accurate you have to enter latitude and longitude. Other features I will probably not use.",

The atomic watch sync is not as easy to do as you may hope; you still have a really accurate watch but I choose this one in particular for that feature. Which leads us to number two... 2. For the price you pay and not being able to properly use all the features, I would have rather go with the mudman. Still a really good looking watch, you just have to have in mind that if you live far from any of the sync antenas or in a urban area, you are going to have troubles syncronizing the atomic watch.",

If you need extremely precise measurements for temperature, altitude, compass, then you should use a dedicated scientific device designed for the specific purpose. This watch is like a jack of all trades, but master of none if you need general readings only, but not acutely precise for scientific purposes, work roles, etc.",

To certain level the sensor does not work as I expected. The temperature reading is your skin temp. I still struggling on altitude reading as the instruction does not present a real example how it works. So except sensor I like it.",
