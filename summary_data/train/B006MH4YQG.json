After inspection the axel bolts threads were overlapped and pulling them apart was going to be difficult and was likely to damage one or both of them. I had to loosen one and then it was possible to separate the wheels and open the chair. This only happened the first time and appears to have been created during packing. Shorter axel bolts would totally eliminate this from happening.",

Just watch your fingers when you take it out of the trunk and open it up. If your fingers are in the wrong spot, they can get pinched in a major way. No, it won't take a finger off or cut you, but you will wish you had been warned about this propensity. Other than that caveat, we love it. Also, you may have to tighten up the axle nuts a bit, if the wheels are rubbing on the side of the chair. Jim A.",

Update: I finally took the footrests to Norco and someone loosened the rests free of cost and quickly. Yes, most kind of them! Unfortunately, when set at perfect setting for the feet, the rests hit the wheels and we had to place them in the original position. It is impractical for my husband and discouraging.",

It\u2019s uncomfortable, it doesn\u2019t feel sturdy- even after a tune up (which it needs when you first get it), and much like a car, it actually pulls to the left. I mean on flat surfaces. It pulls to the left!!! Purchase in an situation where you need a chair immediately, I suppose?",

      "text": "I purchased this because it was lighter than the one we had and I'm constantly lifting it to put it back of the car. Unfortunately the spoked wheels are quite flimsy and one is now bent and wobbly. Also, it is much more difficult to push when a 200 lb. person is in it than the old Medline chair. I suspect that's because of the treaded tires. The tires make noise whe rolling on carpet. I used it while traveling on vacation for two months and now it's too late to return it.",
