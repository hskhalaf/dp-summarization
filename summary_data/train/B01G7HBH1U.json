Had to install prior to assembly but I was evenly pleasantly surprised to find out how easy the assembly was even after the wires and light fixture had been hung..... the price is definitely worth it! Love this product.... packages were clearly labeled for each set of teardrops. This made it very easy to assemble and the directions were clear. If you do assemble after the fixture is hung, I recommend hanging crystals in reverse order working your way back from the center to the edge.....overall excellent buy, looks gorg. in my Glam room!",

Installation was straightforward, but the instructions were lacking so definitely look up a YouTube video or something before starting if you aren't familiar with replacing light fixtures.",

Chandelier is rather heavy once assembled. You need to put the bulb in, hook the the little bead strings into the holes all around the light, so it\u2019s a little time consuming but definitely worth it. Compare prices to Menards, Lowe\u2019s etc this is a win. My guests always ask about it, I let them think it was more expensive. I\u2019ll probably get a 2nd and 3rd one for our hallways since it\u2019s so glamorous and lightens up the room (no pun intended \ud83e\udd23)",

That also got a bit tough because you have to connect the wires and connect to the mounts with all the beads.

Pretty simple, just attach the hanging pieces, they are packaged by size. HOWEVER, if you have poor coordination, elderly, poor sight, it may be difficult to assemble.

We have this located in a little area that is basically a walk-through from main entry area to our bedroom - there is a washer and dryer there and then the door to the walk-in closet. It's smallish, but really cute and perfect for our space.",
