The upside of the product is that you can turn the pad off and still use the keyboard but then it's like who wants to use a mouse. Anyway I still reccomend this product",

Since purchasing the VicTsing Keyboard, I have had absolutely none of the problems the others continually caused, so I have also bought a second VicTsing for my sister.....This is an excellent product!
