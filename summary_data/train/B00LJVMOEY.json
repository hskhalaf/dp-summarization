The third one that arrived today has massive color adjustment issues that do not seem to be resolvable. Viewsonic has been VERY poor in their response to my needs in replacement of defective product. I have always bought Viewsonic monitors, considering them to be flagship product. I will never again purchase a product from this company. And if I don't resolve the current issues in the next 2-3 days, I will toss the monitor in the garbage and purchase a new one from another vendor",

This includes Game, Movie, Web, Text, and Mono presets to enhance black levels in games and movies, color luster for online images, and color temperature for reading text.\n\n\n\n\nBLUE LIGHT FILTER FOR MORE COMFORTABLE VIEWING\nProlonged exposure to certain levels of blue light can cause eye discomfort. ViewSonic displays feature a Blue Light Filter setting that allows users to adjust the amount of blue light emitted from the screen, enabling longer viewing times and increased eye comfort for work and multimedia applications.\n\n\n\n\nPLANET-FRIENDLY MERCURY-FREE LED BACKLIGHTING\nLED backlighting enhances display performance, delivers an outstanding color range, and adjusts contrast ratios for remarkably detailed images. ViewSonic's mercury-free LED backlighting conserves more energy when compared to conventional displays. In addition, LED backlighting provides for a slim, lightweight profile that saves desktop space.\n\n\n\n\nECO-MODE CONSERVES MORE ENERGY\nViewSonic's proprietary Eco-mode feature is built into all LED displays, offering options to select \"Optimize (80%)\" or \"Conserve (65%)\" settings that save up to 35%* power. Especially in low ambient light, Eco-mode adjusts brightness and improves visibility, while reducing eye fatigue and prolonging the display's lamp life. With Eco-mode, both lamp replacement and energy expenditures are reduced.\n\n\n\n\nVESA-MOUNTABLE\nThe ViewSonic VX2880ml features a 100 x 100mm VESA-mountable design that allows you to mount the display on a monitor stand or on a wall, depending on your specific needs.
