One caveat: they don't seal perfectly around the ears, unless you have small ears, but they do well enough that I can hear very quiet passages while someone else is doing something noisy in the next room. Thus I didn't take away any stars. As they are sealed, no one else can hear what I am hearing which helps when watching Formula 1 on the iPad while the wife watches something on the TV. The second cable is a great addition too. They also fold nice and flat into the case which does make them more portable than the headphones I take to work. Like I said at the start, great headphones!",

They've truly introduced a level of listening to music that I didn't know I was missing.

Also, these isolate noise quite well for those of you who like to travel. Would def. recommend to anyone who has 400$+ to spend on headphones. Also, for anyone looking to use these as a gaming headset, the V-Moda BoomPro mic IS COMPATIBLE with these....this was a plus for me.",

I have been searching for a long time for an over the ear closed headphone that was portable, and would provide me an audio experience closer to what I get at home. After many attempts and failures, I stumbled upon these. Portable and planar magnetic, awesome. These are the most natural sounding headphones i've found for this purpose. Reproduction from the highs to the very lows is done very well. At the same time, the treble is a bit forgiving on those less than perfect mp3s. These do run on your mobile phone or tablet, but they really don't shine until you put a better dac/amp with them (like the HA-2 or similar).",
