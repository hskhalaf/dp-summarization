I had a camera watching the trap and it appeared as thought the way the trap door hung on the Havahart model was just a little intimidating for them. Purchased this one and I had it up for 3 days and caught flying squirrels on 3 of those days. I was able to catch 2 in one day actually on both days. This trap is very good and I highly recommend. What I don't reccomend is the instructions which were completely in Chinese.",

I caught something every day, drove the little furry fellas down the road for a little vacation time and set them free. I feel better, they feel better. Catches everything from tiny field mice to full grown chipmunks. Don't let anyone tell you about ways (soap or sonics) to rid yourself of outdoor pests that are eating your car's insulation. Trap em and send em away. We no longer see anyone around. I still bait it up but we catch very little any more. So worth the money and effort. Easy to use and works every time.",

These work well, hard to set and place in an area once they\u2019re set cause the smallest bump in moving will set the trap off and you have to reset again. Have to also make sure to place these traps somewhere where the flaps are not obstructed by any objects either or the prey will get away. Overall better than the snap traps so far but need something more to lure the rats in.",

Having learned from prior experience that those traps are not no-kill if you don't deal with it soon enough. The mice get caught inside those tiny traps and essentially panic and overheat and die a horrible death. The small tube traps are also usually opaque plastic so you cannot see what is caught inside.",
