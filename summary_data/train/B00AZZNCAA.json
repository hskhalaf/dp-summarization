The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is that the handles were kind of stiff and didn't want to move freely and the chains that hold the lid weren't exactly the same length, leading to the top opening a bit crooked. The plates are good quality, and the rest of the accessories are also very nice. I found this basket in a catalog at a much higher price so found a good deal here at Amazon.",

The lid doesn't stay open and it doesn't have anything I can use to keep it open, I had to use the napkins to wrap the plates in so they don't get scratched. The blanket is too small for two people to sit together comfortably and it doesn't seem like it's for out door use. I instead ended up ordering a blanket specifically for outdoor picnic use. It's also not insulated at all.",
