The springform didn't seem to close tight enough leaving a small gap at the bottom, where the latch is, and the batter leaked out. The ring is also not sturdy enough and easily bends, not retaining it's circular shape. I HIGHLY suggest purchasing another springform pan instead of this one, waste of money.",

Most of my recipes I have to cut back on a little because it will overfill the pan. I have one other pan from a different company that I don\u2019t have this issue with because its wall is a whole inch higher. So if your cheesecakes have a lot of filling or you build the crust high up the sides, be careful, you may make too much and overfill or waste.",
