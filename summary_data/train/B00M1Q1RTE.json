      "text": "Got this to replace my lovely small nokia flip phone. It is larger than I expected. Most of the features are OK, but not as good as the Nokia. The ring and text tones are OK. I wanted another basic flip phone to protect the keys and screen. I did not want a smart phone as they are more expensive to run and I have no need to carry a computer around with me! Most of the smart phones are getting bigger and bigger. If I want to take good pictures I use my camera.",

It's very well made and looks classy - unlike the previous 2 Doro phones we've bought which were rather Mickey Mouse looking. It has a very clear bright screen and a very large font is available which mum can read without her magnifying glass. Also, the sound is good and clear, and the instructions are intuitively easy. All in all, an excellent buy.",
