I placed it right on the shelf in my office where it comfortably sits. It has a CD compartment, FM/AM radio and even has a outlet so that you can attach your MP3 player or cell phone. I really lucked out because I needed a CD player in hurry so I purchased this one for a little over twenty dollars got it in a day and half and I luv' it so much. This thing is sooooo.... cute. Luv' It!!! In my opinion Lisa's Choice",

Only the bottom ON button works wherein it is IN a bit more when pushed in to turn on and out a bit more when machine is Off.- BUT MACHINE STILL RUNS,EVEN WITH BUTTON IN OFF POSITION. Also, the Lights to buttons never worked...Tried to return it, but no is the answer. My honest opinion, it is a WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME a cheap item, probably a fake replica made in China.",

I should have checked that before my return time was up. Not the color I ordered or was pictured but I don\u2019t really care lol. I ordered two one black and one pink (pictured hot pink cane in back with light pink) for my kids who listen to music at bedtime. Works great for what I ordered it for and the price.",

She loves that it is pink. I love that it has a replay feature so I could play a CD over continuously through her nap. I will likely purchase another for my other daughter.",

      "text": "I bought 2 of these - one for each of my daughters (ages 10 months and 3)...we only use them at night to play music when they are going to sleep. Neither of the children play with them. I was intially very happy with the purchase as my 3 year old wanted a \"pink radio to play her music\" . . . however, both CD players are broken with only a few months of use. One doesn't play the CD at all anymore and the other skips. If I could figure out how to return them or get a refund, I would. Unfortunately I no longer have the original boxes. A complete waste of money.",
