That said, even on the Switch there is no excuse for the frame drops this game suffers from. The game looks good, but it doesn't look good enough to justify these performance problems. And while I do applaud them for making such a true-to-the-source remake, the amount of content in this game simply isn't worth the $60 asking price. Frankly, $40 would have been pushing it.",

They fixed a few other issues the old game has with the bonus \"Seashell Mansion\" . If one passed a point with the shells you were out of luck. Now it makes it a point to rid of that. plus an explanation on what the mansion is. A little expensive, could maybe loose $10, but still a good game.",

I would say for someone like me who doesn't remember their way around there is a solid 40 hours here. There is a dungeon mode but I haven't check that out yet.

Updates for artwork, obviously, and music, but this AA game pricing isn't quite there, especially when you can't share the dungeons online. Great nostalgia bonus which topped it into 5 stars for me",

The map has some functionality and your conversations are archived. Really pleased with the game. Gotta say though, $60 for a 2D game is kinda steep.
