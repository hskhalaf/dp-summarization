He loves baths but because he's an older dog he slips a lot when I bathe him so I have to hold him with one arm and bathe him with the other. I thought I'd give this item a try and it worked perfectly. He just loved it. He was so comfortable as he leaned into it while the tap was running over him. It made bathing him so much easier for me as well. I highly recommend this for pets, especially seniors. It's very kind to their old bones.",

Only thing that is annoying sometimes is that the bloom slides around sometimes in the sink. Super easy to adjust and move the bloom back to its original position.",

It's not a huge problem, just really inconvenient since 1 hand is always on baby and I feel like I use more water than I should be needed. 2- the petals are thick and absorbent which means when you're all done with bath time, you have a soaking wet and heavy mat to deal with.

After a couple of these traumatic experiences, we decided to invest in blooming bath. He was a different baby when we used this! He was calm and so relaxed that he eventually fell asleep in this! It was so easy to clean it later, you just throw it in the washer. It dries well in the dryer on gentle setting too. I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a cozy happy bath time for their baby.",

The flower fit perfectly in the sink and we are able to move around the petals to insure nothing short of a comfy bath for her! No plug needed as the flower takes care of that. A shift of a petal allows to drain throughout bath when sink fills up! We ring out in sink and hang on clothes line/shower rod to dry. Washed in machine with no damage also. Would highly recommend to all! Would make a perfect gift to new parents also!",

      "text": "The first 2 baths we gave our son was a regular sink bath with a towel in the bottom. Holding our less than month old was a little difficult and he was upset the entire time. I bought the blooming bath and used it last night, it was easier to bath him because it provided more traction, made the space smaller and allowed some water to pool in the bottom which kept him so much calmer. He barely whined! Totally worth it! As he gets older we plan to continue to use it. I prefer giving our baby baths in the sink so we aren\u2019t breaking our backs leaning over the tub. This is a game changer",
