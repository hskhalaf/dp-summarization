This is a high quality piece of equipment! I've printed ABS, PLA, TPU and HIPS. As well as combinations of TPU/HIPS and ABS/HPS. This printer was able to handle them all and produce quality prints. Be warned that ABS/TPU/HIPS are all complicated to print with and these are all about having the settings dialed in correctly. The customer service is outstanding. The CEO wrote me personally to answer all of my questions. I couldn't be happier with this purchase.",

I can say with confidence that this machine is one of the most reliable, feature-filled printers I've found for this kind of price. The laser engraver is just a brilliant add on. You also get an alert when you run out of filament which is great for someone like me who uses every little scrap he can to save money. I'll be buying a second one of these at the end of the year to be able to print more at once.",
