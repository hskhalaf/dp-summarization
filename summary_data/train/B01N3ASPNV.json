Considering the age, I had expected this sooner. I'm not happy they broke but I'm sure it would've happened at some point. Being that I got mine so long ago, I cant say whether they've changed anything since then, but mine didn't have even one tiny bubble nor any other artifact left behind after application.

You have to make sure to clean the screen of the Switch and clear it of any dust that would cause air bubbles under the glass. But if applied well, the glass will be clear and free of any bubbles. I suspect that, like glass protectors for phones, the glass screen protector will crack more easily than the actual Switch screen. However, that's the point. That the protector cracks and takes the brunt of any impact instead of the screen. It's also why it's nice that this comes in a two-pack, for that inevitable replacement.",

Within that first week, I encountered an infuriating (albeit very small) scratch on my screen. Being a sane switch owner, I immediately ordered a screen protector. This particular screen protector comes with more goodies than the official Nintendo switch one (almost all switch screen protectors come with two (2) screen protectors) It also appears to have a higher quality than the official Nintendo as well. Please remember to clean before applying so you don\u2019t have dust or lint stuck between the screen and the screen protector!",

Use some regular tape to hold the screen protector in place before removing anything. Make sure it is aligned correctly to the Switch screen first before installing. On to the actual review: everything was included and looks like it should protect the Switch screen. We are generally pretty careful so unless something happens won't know how well it protects the screen. The installation was relatively easy. No issues with this product. We have used various other screen protectors from this company for other devices and no issues so far",

It comes with wet & dry wipes that do an excellent job of cleaning the screen and removing dust. The screen protector goes on easy without air bubbles (well you just push them to the sides if you get any before pressing the screen protector all the way down).",

The protector is crystal clear as advertised and seems high quality, and I will update this review if I have any issues with it. My only thoughts are the card they give you to scrape out the bubbles is bendable cardboard so I ended up giving up and using a plastic gift card instead.",

It provides a nice, hard, screen for your Switch instead of the plastic, easily-scratched one that the Switch comes with. Worth it for just one, but for two it's a no brainer.

Had to raise and reapply several times to get the bubbles out completely though, and it caused the very corner of one side to not be as sticky but its hardly noticeable. I will say they work great with the touchscreen still being responsive, and considering I dropped it on our hardwood with no damage or injury to the unit, they work as advertised. Glad I got it before that happened. Recommend to anyone considering.",

Installation and instructions was straight forward and it comes with the necessary cleaning wipes, stickers to lift dust, squeegee and microfiber cloth for a smooth install. It comes with two glass screens and took me less than 3 minutes installing 2 screen protectors. I had some air bubble pockets while installing but I just lifted the glass from the corner where its closer to the bubbles and they disappeared quickly with no problems. The glass also reacts very well to touch and is a must to protect the screen of your nintendo switch. I highly recommend this product!",

      "text": "Nearly sh*t myself the other day when my Switch fell off the kitchen counter top and landed on the screen side. I thought it was all over..... I lifted my switch and screen was cracked but the game was running fine. Suddenly I remembered I placed a temped glass on my switch when I bought it 2+ years ago. I pulled it off and my screen was fine, no damage at all from the hard fall, it was the temp glass that shattered. I bought this over 2 years ago and it was WELL WORTH IT! Saved my switch.",
