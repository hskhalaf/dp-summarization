To make a pot of coffee involves taking half the parts off (2 lids, move water spout, etc) and sooner or later the 1mm thick pad under the pot will not be seated properly, which will result in the coffee valve not opening and a big countertop mess. The pad cannot be positively locked to the base in any meaningful way. It\u2019s as if they never tested this thing.",

However, it makes coffee quick. It is very simple to use. It was very simple to clean. The carafe holds the coffee hot enough for a relaxing weekend cup of coffee. The people who received this coffee maker replaced theirs and are still using it....and if you knew them, that is very impressive.",

My first Moccamaster brew basket would overflow if I was not careful with the flow adjustment. Now I don't have any worries and the coffee is perfect.

The plastic parts, carafe, and body just look flimsy. In fact one of the plastic tabs that holds the coffee container in place arrived broken. We would have just exchanged it, but we were so disappointed with the build quality, we returned it. Bought a different brand; couldn't be happier. I am not sure the heating element alone warrants the price point of this unit.",

This comes close to filling the basket (after the grounds are wet) and I would worry about making 8 or 10 cups.",

The carafe is great, but you could buy that separately. I regret purchasing this machine. It is over priced. Update: After a few months of use, I am hating this machine even more. The plastic foot easily moves out of its groove, and if you have to move the machine to fill it with water or grounds, the foot will become dislodged there is no snap or lock.",

The cup design is very different and a little more complex, but seems fantastic. The pot has the. new spout which helps retain heat while brewing and \"stirs\" the coffee. I wish there was somewhere convenient to store that piece , like a hook on the back of the machine. Bottomline, these are the best brewers out there!",

The Technivorm Moccamaster solves these problems. Our coffee is very hot, and very delicious. WE now enjoy the best coffee we've ever had. The downside is that we only like our own coffee now. I recommend investing in a good electreic grinder also, because I wish I had been grinding our own coffee all this time. The coffee has no bitterness, my stomache is not effected, and any coffee is vastly improved by grinding at home. Happy drinking !",

It is also better constructed. The Bonavita is built ok. Listen, there's a big price difference between the 2. So, it is worth the extra $$? Maybe not. Really depends on how much you want to spend. The Moccamaster is also better looking, so if you care about what looks better on your counter top than this is the one for you.",

The differences between the older CDT and the new CDGT are minimal. It comes with both the brew-through cap and the solid cap, it doesn't have a selector switch for whole pot, half-pot, or stop brew, the styling on the front of water tower is different, and it doesn't have the plastic plate under the coffee pot (or my husband threw it away when he unpacked the box).",
