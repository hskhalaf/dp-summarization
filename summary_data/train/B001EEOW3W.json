A footgear with a remarkably true-to-size fit but still having a spacious enough toe box also points heavily to this shoe.

They were well made but the materials used were plasticky and cheap and they were completely unwaterproof. They seemed to absorb water at the first possibility so were totally not fit for purpose. They were light and comfortable and the soles gripped well but they looked cheap and were not very attractive. They did not have the usual merrell insole to support the instep and promote even wear so the sole was quite thin.",
