This is solid, beautifully-stained wood, with a lovely counter-top. Sure, it's not the same quality as an custom-made oak cabinet, but it's a fraction of the cost. After a couple months, everything works perfectly, with no signs of wear. All the parts were there, and instructions were reasonably clear. Assembly time was less than 90 minutes, and I enjoyed the process. There are a few points you might want a second set of hands. In all, I was surprisingly impressed, and really glad that we bought it.",

Also it would be extremely helpful if each individual piece is labeled. Overall a solid piece for the price. Great value!!",

The magnet for keeping the cuboard closed was very hard to install, ended up breaking through the wood on accident so it doesnt really stay closed.

The wheels roll smoothly and are great to move unit around where you need it. Assembly directions are clear and straight forward once you layout and identify all your parts. Each part has a letter code on paper but I couldn't see that it was on the pieces. That would have been helpful.",

It's a 2 person build mainly i think because you have to start building it upside down and then flip it right side up and its rather heavy. I still did it by myself. I love it. Its really nice quality, and very sturdy. The wheel locks are great, but i can't very easily use my toes to pop them in place, oh well.",

It arrived quick and my sister put it together before I arrived home. It fits my large microwave on top and I've used the shelves to store everything from canned goods to boxed crackers. The drawer is a great addition too. It's on the slender side, but blends in well enough with the entire cart that my toddler hasn't noticed it's a new place to explore.",

This helps, although I could use even more space, and it was a nice addition. Later when we buy a house or move we can always use it in the kitchen again or even as a TV stand. I would definitely buy it again.",
