      "pros": [
        "With 5 socks to contain even large spills, and chemically inert pillows and pads for different absorption needs, there is enough absorption power in the Oil-Dri for small industrial spills of oil or non-corrosive chemicals",
        "However, the 20 gallon bucket is compact enough to find space in the average household garage, where it is especially useful for the occasional oil spill or car fluid leak",

    "title": "Oil-Dri L90410 20 gallon Universal Spill Kit",
    "description": "Size:20 Gallon\n\n The Oil-Dri L90410 20-gallon universal spill kit includes five socks, two pillows, 10 bonded pads, three disposal bags with ties, an emergency response guide book, and a 20-gallon overpack container to help confine and absorb spills of non-corrosive liquids. The kit contents come packed in the yellow plastic overpack container for high-visibility storage before use, and for transport of waste after a cleanup. The socks have a recycled cellulose filling and will absorb up to 1 quart of liquid per 12 inches of sock. Socks can be deployed in a variety of shapes to help contain liquid leaks and reduce the spread of spills on the floor. The pillows have a recycled cellulose filling and can be used to absorb steady streams of liquid. The universal bonded pads are made of chemically inert melt-blown polypropylene bonded between a spunbond cover stock layer and a fine fiber layer for absorbing liquid spills. This kit can help a facility meet emergency planning requirements, providing a benefit even if it's never used. \n\nSpill kits are used to contain, clean up, and dispose of spilled liquids such as water, oil, and chemicals. Spill kits typically include absorbent products (such as socks, pillows, and pads), a disposal bag, and a closeable container for storage. Socks are tubular fabric sleeves, commonly known as skins or sheathing, that are filled with an absorbent material and can be placed around a spill as a barrier to absorb and control the spill. Pillows are closed fabric bags that are filled with an absorbent material and placed on top of a spill to absorb the liquid. Pads are made of layers of absorbent material and are placed on top of a spill to absorb the liquid. Spill kits also may include gloves, safety goggles, and manuals, among other items. Common names used to distinguish different kinds of kits include Universal (for the cleanup of oil and water), Oil Only (for the cleanup of oil on land or oil in marine environments), and Hazmat (for the cleanup of aggressive liquids such as acids). Spill kits are commonly used in industrial, marine, and automotive environments, among others.\n\n Oil-Dri manufactures products for the containment and cleanup of fluids such as oil, water, and hazardous chemicals. The company, founded in 1941, is headquartered in Chicago, IL. \n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX?\n * (4) Universal socks, 48\"\n * Universal sock, 120\"\n * (2) Universal pillows (variable sizes)\n * (10) Universal bonded pads, 15\" x 19\"\n * (3) Disposal bags with ties, 33-gallon\n * Emergency response guide book\n * Yellow plastic overpack, 20-gallon",
