The maximum return date was only one month later but that was not a problem as these are Beats so they will last for years. It is now 2 months after purchase and the volume control on the headphone cable has literally just fallen apart in my hands. Worse still I can\u2019t return them to Amazon despite them being only two months old! I spend a small fortune on Amazon and I am a prime customer - not at all happy!!!",

So these have been returned for a full refund (no issues with Amazon they have been excellent). I wouldn't buy Beats again. Will try Bose now.",

Despite my disappointment, Amazon did a first class job in accepting my return and refunding the money. So paid less than half the price for Plantronics Backbeats Go2 that work a treat.",

Considering these are supposed to be ideal for working out, you want good energy-inspiring volume that really makes your workout music hit hard but this product won't do that for you. Definitely not worthy of the name Power Beats",

Also after wearing them for longer time they start to hurt my ears. The sound is quite disappointing as well.
