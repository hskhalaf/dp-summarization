The whole point of a sterilizer is to sterilize and keep the bottles clean, DRY and ready for the next feeding in the middle of the night. This item does not dry the bottles. Infact it dries them slower than placing them in a drying rack when they are inside the sterilizer due to the moisture build up. I found this product much better.  It gives you clean and dry bottles in an hour with single push of a button. Totally worth the extra 20 bucks.",

They work great but I can only sterilize 2 of the larger bottles at once in the bags. With 8 bottles a day and pump parts I was spending an hour+ running things through the microwave. Boiling wasn't much better. This sterilizer has cut my sterilization time down to 24 minutes! I can run a full days bottles and pump parts through in just 3 cycles. Really wishing I would have bought this a month ago when I returned to work because this essentially equals an extra 30 minutes of sleep for me!",

Washing/sterilizing them in the dishwasher took 1-2 hours depending on the wash cycle I chose and this only takes ~8 minutes after a quick hand-wash. Another benefit is that the dishwasher caused some discoloration of the bottles and I don't get that with the sterilizer. I also used microwave sterilizer bags in the past, and while they worked faster they only held 2 bottles at a time while this holds 6. My only issue with this product is that while I appreciate the little tongs for picking up the smaller parts they are useless on the bottles.",

      "text": "I originally bought this because our growing infant was going through a lot of bottles. I thought if I bought this, it would ease some of the work of bottle washing. I didn\u2019t know you first have to clean by hand all the bottles before you can use the sanitizer, and then to add insult to the problem, I still have to hand dry all the bottles or leave them out to air dry. It just adds more work than I expected. I tried to return this, and once I did, for some reason, Amazon sent me another one and won\u2019t refund our money. I\u2019m hoping someone from Amazon\u2019s Customer Service will reach out and help us.",

I have decided to sterilize the bottles the old fashioned way, by boiling them in a large pot.",
