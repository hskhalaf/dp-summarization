I tried glass cleaner, alcohol & ammonia but nothing removes it.. I also don't like the doors not coming together when closed. Kinda defeats the purpose of having an enclosed cabinet to minimize dust. My husband threw the return slip out so I'm stuck with it, plus he put 2 LED lights on the top which really shows up my Swarovski collection which is beautiful.",

As it stands, I now think that any additional returns would arrive in the same condition. I will do my best to repair this and see how that goes. Too bad, it's a nice little cabinet.",
