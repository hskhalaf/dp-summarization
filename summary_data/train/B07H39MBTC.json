The size of these are perfect because they can fit in pretty much anywhere. They all fit neatly into the clear bag that is much higher quality than I expected. The pack even comes with a set of labels to use to make sure nothing gets mixed up! As you can see in the picture, nothing about these feel cheap. The look pretty sleek to be honest. Overall, a very quality travel accessory and something I'd recommend to anyone traveling soon.",

Customer service is good. The seller contacted me right away to see if the product was satisfactory. I'm thinking of ordering a second one for the things I pack in my checked luggage as the clear plastic makes it easy to see what is inside. highly recommend",

I always wrap extra blue or green painters tape around the seals anyway, just in case. It can be unstuck and re-stuck (are those words?) several times before the tape wears out.
