      "text": "Way above expectations, I love this camera! I have already taken some wonderful pictures with it of wildlife in my area. I wanted a camera to take high quality pictures with extended zoom, without me putting a lot of thought into settings on the camera itself. If that is what you want from a camera, this is the one you have been looking for. Click or Mouse over the picture that I have included to see a larger version of it. I love the clarity of the subject itself and how the foreground and background are blurred. This picture was taken in the automatic setting using the Auto button, conveniently located on the back of the camera!",

When I loaded the pictures onto my desktop and saw them in Corel Paintshop Pro X7 I was very happy. they looked great. The camera has many features which are very easy to use and get to. Other reviews think it's hard to get through the menus but it's not. Minus one star for the LCD display but otherwise a great camera for me. And a great price at 138 bucks. The SX410 just wasn't worth the extra 60 dollars for me.",

Loaded with automatic features, and the flexibility to \"go manual\" if you like, the built in flash works well, and the lens quality is great a 28-210 MM wide angle to telephoto covers most needs for the amature photographer. Only downside is the Li-Ion battery (proprietary) made it difficult to ship (i'm deployed to Antarctica, so I had is shipped home, then re-shipped here to get around Amazon's policy of not shipping Li-ion batteries to APO addresses). It's capable of taking pics every 0.8 seconds, as well as shooting 30 FPS 780p HD video. A 32 GB memory card holds hundreds of images, and the manual says it gets around 200 images on one battery charge.",

Great zoom power for photos and easy to use, vivid colors. Acceptable to \"almost\" above average night photos, with proper adjustments of the ISO (set it to max 1600). Of course it will never beat a Digital SLR Camera (big price difference). Certainly a good beginners camera for those going outdoors not wanting to carry all the accessories that comes with a Digital SLR (lenses...). Looking forward to many more photo adventures with this camera!",

She's actually looking at whats out the window more often now and has taken hundreds of photos and videos since receiving the camera for Christmas. She takes if everywhere.

I haven't tried it out at night yet, but I would definitely recommend this camera as an affordable option for anyone taking up close pics, selling items online like Etsy shop owners, where showing small details is super important!",

Everyone I know on FB wants to buy this! Seriously, if you want to take great pictures, without having to think about it, this is the camera you need! I bought a case for it that works great. So easy to use and understand. You can also go into settings and do them yourself, but I'm not that savvy. LOVE IT!",
