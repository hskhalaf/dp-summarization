I do eat sunflower seeds but have never tasted its butter, so I didn't know what to expect. It does not taste exactly like peanut butter but is very close in taste, and consistency. It is also very filling. I am on the Keto diet and wanted to mix it up a bit and have more choices for breakfast other than eggs. I believe this butter with a little home-made Low Carb Chia Seed Cherry or Strawberry Jam slathered on a low carb slice of bread would be delicious!",

We've purchased the non-organic type of sunButter before and it was delicious., so I'm not sure if its the switch from regular to organic - which it totally shouldn't make a difference. I only ordered the organic because it was prime and the regular type was not available. I figured organic should taste even better. I was very disappointed. I saw someone else have a comment about the bad taste, so i'm not sure if it was a bad batch, but, i wasted my money.",

The Sunbutter by itself is soft, easy to spread and tasty if I decide to lick the spoon. It didn't separate into hard and oily layers. I have to keep it away from the kids due to the cost (guilty feelings about that) but I will order it again when I run out.",

I have tried other brands, and this is the best sunflower seed butter I have used. My only complaints are that the oil and base tend to separate creating inconsistency in the thickness and the ability to spread the product is negatively impacted. Overall, I will be using this as my primary peanut butter replacement for the foreseeable future.",

I love the taste, and often enjoy it on sliced apple or on a stalk of celery or a rice cake. It really hits the spot as an excellent snack. It is also something I can easily take with me in an emergency situation to a location where I otherwise would have very little to nothing I could eat.",
