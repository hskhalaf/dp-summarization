The camera was never exposed to rain and never immersed. I do, however, live a couple miles from the beach, and the humidity is often high. Seems that was enough to ruin the camera. I would warn anyone who lives in a humid area to avoid this product.",

Superb product and a great value.",

The best part is that the Panasonic don't have the software for download in its website.. If I want it I'll have to Buy it. This is very disappointing.",

    "title": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS10 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 16x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and Built-In GPS Function (Black)",
    "description": "Color:BlackFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \nThe LUMIX ZS10 features a versatile 24mm ultra-wide-angle and powerful 16x optical zoom LEICA DC VARIO-ELMAR lens. It's MOS sensor enables full-High Definition 1920x1080 video recording capability. And high speed burst shooting up to 10 frames per second at full resolution. A new, large, 3.0-inch, 460,000-dot Smart Touch Intelligent LCD which allows for Touch Zoom, Touch Auto Focus (AF), Touch Shutter, and Touch Playback. The LUMIX ZS10 also features a built-in GPS (Global Positioning System) function allowing geotagged images to be pinpointed via online maps and easily shared with friends and families. \n\n24mm Ultra Wide-angle 16x Optical Zoom LEICA DC Lens\nThe compact, versatile lens system is the hallmark of LUMIX ZS series and now this lens system is totally redeveloped for the DMC-ZS10 in both optical and mechanical design. The new high-quality LEICA DC VARIO-ELMAR lens system is even more versatile with 24mm ultra wide-angle* to powerful 16x optical zoom (35mm camera equivalent: 24-384mm). Comprising 12 elements in 10 groups, including an ED lens and 3 aspherical lenses with 6 aspherical surfaces, this advanced lens unit suppresses chromatic aberration which tends to occur in telephoto shooting. It also boasts a short total length of lens unit despite its higher versatility with longer zoom range, which is made possible by development of a new mechanism for the structure of lens barrel. The lens system is also compatible with high shutter speed of min.1/4,000 sec. \n\n* Converted to standard 35mm camera equivalent, at the maximum wide position.\n\n\n\nVenus Engine FHD\nFor the image processor, the Venus Engine FHD is incorporated that features exceptionally advanced signal processing capabilities. By separating chromatic noise from luminance noise and applying the optimal noise reduction to each, you can capture clear and beautiful images even when shooting at high ISO sensitivity levels. The Venus Engine FHD also provides precisely selective noise reduction to the chromatic noise without affecting the border of colors which is judged from the brightness level of a pixel. Linking smoothly with the MOS sensor, the Venus Engine FHD processes a large amount of signals at high speed, making it possible to record high resolution consecutive shots and full HD movie recording. \n\nLarge, 3.0-inch, 460,000-dot High-resolution Smart Touch LCD\nThe DMC-ZS10 large 3.0-inch Smart Touch LCD features a high 460,000-dot resolution, and a wide-viewing angle allows you to zoom, Auto Focus, release shutte and playback with the touch of a finger. The big screen reflects fine details, making it easy to check the focus before shooting. It also serves as a small photo and video viewer, allowing you and friends to enjoy viewing the still and motion images together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 3D Photo Mode\nThe newly added 3D Photo Mode* produces a 3D image in the camera. The image-processing method used by LUMIX records beautiful images with less distortion or visible image links. The camera takes 20 panning shots and automatically selects the two most suitable images, one for the right eye and one for the left eye, to synthesize a 3D composite. The 3D image can be viewed on a VIERA 3D HDTV. The 3D image format is compatible with MPO, so it can be played back on other MPO-compatible equipment such as TVs and digital photo frames, or printed.\n\n\n\nTouch AF Tracking Subject Detection\nOnce the AF subject is selected by touch control, it continues to track the subject even if it moves until you press the shutter. When you're taking images of active children, pets, sports scenes or subjects in a moving object, this function eliminates the need to press the shutter button halfway down repeatedly to readjust the focus. The Touch AF Tracking makes sure you don't miss those once-in-a-lifetime shooting opportunities.\n\nPOWER O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer) Shake Detection\nEveryone has had an experience of taking a photo at night and hoping to capture all the memories and beauty, only to be disappointed at the poor result. Panasonic has worked on the low-frequency vibration hand-shake component, which is physically generated when pressing the shutter button or when shooting at night with a slow shutter speed. The POWER O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer)* nearly doubles the hand-shake correction power of conventional MEGA O.I.S. You get bright photos without blurring even from handheld shooting at slow shutter speeds. * The POWER O.I.S. is automatically turned on in the iA Mode and can be turned on or off in the P/A/S/M Mode or some Scene Modes.\n\n\n\nIntelligent Scene Selector - Scene Detection\nWith the camera in the iA Mode, the Intelligent Scene Selector automatically sets the Scene Mode Scenery, Portrait, Macro, Night Portrait*1, Night Scenery, Sunset or Intelligent Handheld Nightshot*2. The camera judges it from the various detection results such as focusing and brightness level of the circumstance*3. You are free from changing settings every time the scene changes when taking images with these Scene Modes to get beautiful results.\n*1 In the iA Mode, the Night Portrait is not identified when the flash is turned off.\n*2 The Intelligent Handheld Nightshot Mode must be turned ON in the menu prior to use.\n*3 With some subject and shooting conditions, it is just not possible to judge the best shooting details. When this happens, it is recommended that you shoot with the Scene Mode that best suits your purpose.\n\n\n\niA (Intelligent Auto) Mode\nWhen you don't know which mode will give you the best shooting results, or when a sudden photo opportunity pops up and you don't have time to change settings, simply choose the iA (Intelligent Auto) Mode and let the camera do it all for you. Just choose the iA Mode, aim at your subject, and shoot. Four detection and correction functions are simultaneously activated to optimize the settings, so you get stunning photos every time.\n\nGPS with Place Name and Landmark Information\nThe LUMIX GPS displays not only latitudes and longitudes, but also the area information that covers 203 countries or regions and the landmark information of over 1,000,000 locations in 82 countries or regions. This function allows geotagged images to be pinpointed via online maps and easily shared with friends and family.\n\n\n\nLUMIX Image Uploader\nThe DMC-ZS10 gives you a new form of communication by letting you share your photos and movies. All you have to do is checkmark the photos and movies you want to share and connect the camera or SD/SDHC/SDXC Memory Card to a computer. Uploading automatically starts by simply following the guidance.* Facebook can be used for photos and YouTube for movies. You can join these social networking services without having to install any special software. It's easy to share photos and movies on the spot, which means that your friends don't have to wait for you to come back home to see them. \n\n\n* LUMIX Image Uploader starts up automatically on the computer the supplied software \"PHOTOfunSTUDIO Ver. 6.0\" or later is installed.\nIn other case, start up the menu by double-clicking the file \"LUMIXUP.EXE\" in the folder below:\n[My Computer] > [Removable Disk] > DCIM > AD_LUMIX (Windows)\n* YouTube is a trademark of Google Inc.\n* Facebook and the Facebook logo are registered trademarks or trademarks of Facebook, Inc.\n\n\n\n3D Image Viewer / VIERA Link\nPhotos or movies recorded in AVCHD on the SD/SDHC/SDXC Memory Cards are easy to view on a Panasonic VIERA TV. Simply insert the card into the VIERA Image Viewer (SD/SDHC/SDXC Memory Card slot) on VIERA TV or DIGA Blu-ray Disc Player to playback your content. Alternatively, you can use an optional HDMI mini cable to output the still and motion images you took from the DMC-ZS10 directly to the TV for VIERA Link. Most of the control is possible using only the TV's remote control. Especially, the pictures taken with the 3D Photo Mode via the 3D Image Viewer offering users a whole new exciting experience.\n\nWhat's in the box\n\nCamera \nBattery Pack \nCharger \nStylus Pen \nHand Strap \nUSB Connection Cable \nAV Cable \nCD-Rom",
