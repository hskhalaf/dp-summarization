The item arrived quick and was as advertised. For the money I think they are pretty good. Being reusable is a plus. I like that they are silicone vs the pasty ones and they provide adequate nipple coverage. Personally I would not say these are to be worn alone under sheer clothing but more for a smoothing effect under a bralette or a solid colored dress or top of medium weight.",

There is a large area for the nipple so it doesn't get stuck to the actual cover. The covers are formed to make it completely smooth and flush with your skin so you don't see divots or lines through whatever you're wearing. Removing them is amazing as well, the adhesive is strong enough to stay in place all day but it doesn't pull your skin when you remove them. A great purchase!",

I also suffer from hot flashes so a tight garment of any kind is miserable . These little gems allow me to be comfortable in the Florida heat without added pain.",

It doesn't irritate my skin either which is great. The covers as a whole are very soft and unnoticeable when wearing them. They work best for T-Shirts and such, but not for blouses or thinner materials. This was my first time buying anything like this, so now I know what I do and don't want in a cover....",
