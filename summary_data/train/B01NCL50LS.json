Very comfortable, fit is perfect and the toe box is roomy without being too loose. It would be hard to find a better looking better performing shoe at this price. Definitely a home run for UA, if you need a good looking shoe to play in or just for comfortable casual wear I would definitely give these a shot!",

It runs very small and needs more Velcro attached closer to the tongue, so the strap stays closed. The way it is now, it comes apart as soon as I stand up, or walk. I\u2019m going to take them to a shoe repair shop and see if they can add Velcro to it. If not, I\u2019ll either return these or slice off the straps.",
