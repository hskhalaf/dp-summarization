Almost all his joints are on ratchets, so loose joints are not a problem. I am extremely satisfied with my purchase.",

My only complaint is that this toy, like Ultra Magnus, is part of the \"Combiner Wars\" line but has NO combining function outside of fanmods. In the comics, he ALMOST fuses with the Constructicons... Overall, I recommend this figure for any adult collector as it may be tedious for little hands.",

The articulations are responsive and just outright fun to pose it! This figure is an absolute nod to how Megatron looked in the G1 cartoon series, even though his alt mode is a tank rather than his iconic gun mode, but I don't mind it! I can't to get Optimus Prime from the Power of the Primes line to pair up with (or against) the Leader of the Decepticons himself! All Hail Megatron!",

      "text": "This re-imagination of Megatron definitely harkens back to g1 Megatron, as another reviewer has already noted. The figure is easy to transform and he looks great in both tank mode and robot mode. He has articulation in the hips, waist, wrist, elbows, shoulders, and his head so he is very posable. The decal set includes both decepticon and autobot insignias so you can choose which faction he is part of. In the IDW comics, Megatron becomes an autobot by the time the Combiner Wars happen. Who knows, maybe he'll return to his old decepticon ways down the road, but for children of the 80's, like me, he'll always be a decepticon. This is a must-have for fans and collectors alike.",

The other reason I passed on the Masterpiece Megatron is that it's so damn ugly compared to the Masterpiece Prime. This one actually gives it a run for its money! It's not perfect, of course. It's very light, the legs are not very stable and the articulation is poor, to say the least. But it looks so good I can't go lower than 4 stars.",

If your kid plans to roll it around in tank mode, dont get this.",

Long ago, he forgot he was a hero, and became nothing more than a tyrant. The war he launched eventually drained his home planet of life. Not even the death of a world could sate his hunger for conquest. The war between Autobot and Decepticon rages on, and with Megatron leading the Decepticons, the action gets more intense all the time! This awesome Megatron figure is a massive force for evil in robot mode with an enormous blaster that will pummel any unsuspecting Autobot. But when it's time for some truly massive firepower, he converts to an enormous tank with a missile launcher!
