Weve primarily used it to heat refrigerated milk and generally we keep the milk in the bags while we get the bottle ready.",

One bottle would be cool after the set heating time was up and I had to set it a second time. On a different occasion the bottle ended up too hot. Additionally, the bottle warmer only has two ounce increment so we had to waste an ounce every time she needed to be fed because she drinks three ounces with each feeding. Nice concept but it did not function at all like it was supposed to.",

As soon as you realize that, you can still use it, but each time the hot water raises and disappears you should remove the bottle, shake it and check by yourself if it\u2019s already within the desired temperature. Even if you settle a lower timing, which is possible, don\u2019t leave the bottle inside after it ends, the bottom part is going to be too hot and again will overheat the milk.",
