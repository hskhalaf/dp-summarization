I cant find any faults with the product other than limited color availability The paint isn't thin it's exactly the correct viscosity it should be. If you use 7 quarts to paint a small car you need to buy an hvlp gun. I shot all these with a Sico mp500 hvlp at 20 lbs and the results are great. If you don't have to match a factory color I highly recommend these paints for ease of use.",

I never got an exact value, but I think I remember the best results coming from a 4:1 (1/5) mixture. In any case when you shoot with a lacquer make sure you\u2019re using a 1.8mm or 1.7mm gun. The thinner the paint the smaller you\u2019ll get away with but the less protection you\u2019ll have. Thin using a little bit of paint thinner, but if all you have is a stronger solvent go ahead and toss it in the mixture, just be sure not store that newly mixed paint in plastic. Good luck.",
