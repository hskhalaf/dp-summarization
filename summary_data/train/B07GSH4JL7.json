The diapers are incredibly soft, my little one could easily pull them up, they stayed on - no slippage - and she easily removed when sitting on the potty. Best of all, super leak proof and absorbent. She slept in them overnight and NO LEAKS even with a heavy pee. It's the small things in life that make the biggest difference. Added bonus: My toddler loved the design, \"Ohhh, sooo cuuuute.\"",

The issue is in training your toddler to pull them up and down, they come undone on the sides and then don't go back together well enough to keep using them. We usually just replace them at that point, even if there wasn't an accident. We bought the 104 ct so it will be a while before we burn through them as we switched to another brand of training pants.",

Combined, these two features allow for shifting of the pull-up during use and leaks.

I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a knock off brand or what but do not buy these, save your time money and frustration and stick to ones in store or through their website. We\u2019ve been using honest diapers/training pants for years and have never had an issue. Recognized immediately that the thickness, quality and materials are not the same as the ones we know and love.",
