You can see from the picture that G5 Montecs don't have a problem blowing right through ribs or any other bone they contact. They hit like a hammer and I can count on a pass through regardless of the shot angle. Great product.",

The arrow penetrated completely through the right shoulder bone, through the deer's heart, out of the deer's body cavity, and partially into the deer's right leg. No deflection and the arrow busted through the bone like a tank.",

Their shape allows you to simply place iron a wet stone and move it back and forgot sharpen them. You can shoot this broad head into the dirt, clean it, sharpen it, and use it again. I prefer the carbon steel if you plan to re-sharpen. It takes a better edge and with less effort than stainless steel.",
