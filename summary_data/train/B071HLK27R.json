No point in upgrading the headphones if they will be bottlenecked/hindered by this very noticeable hiss. Cable management needs work. It's bulky and uneven. Stabs your neck when laying down I had to modify the adapter to be more slim. Still uneven but that's too hard to fix.",

People can hear me, and I can hear them. The only thing that I would have loved more, was if this came with some j5\u2019s, or even my favorite headphones ever, j3\u2019s. The battery lasts all day at work, and keeps going for me to watch shows on my phone when I get home. I love these, and they don\u2019t seem like they will break anytime soon, I\u2019m sure to get a long, happy life out of them.",

That being said (long story short) there are flaws. The rear cable management is hard to perfect, and can leave dangling cords. The shoulder rest part is slightly too small, which is fine for walking, but if you run and your body bounces it can fall off way too easily, and they arent water resistant as far as I know which is only a slight convienence. Other than that, they are fantastic",
