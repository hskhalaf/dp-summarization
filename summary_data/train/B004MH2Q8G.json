I lifted it up and at about 7 inches off the stove, the handle broke. The top of the handle sliced my finger and the hot water burned a large area on my stomach and the tip of my thigh. Be careful with this kettle!! I don't even use it to boil water, as I make sleepy time tea for my 8 and 10 year old. I'm lucky that my injuries were so minimal. They could have been far worse.",

I am surprised at how well this teapot insulates - my tea stays hot for up to an hour! Very happy with this purchase.",
