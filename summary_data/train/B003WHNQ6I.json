Shooting 419 grains at 293fps. has been a great set up for me. I can not see me ever going back to a 1-3/16\u201d broadhead.",

I shot a doe at 20 yards earlier in the season and she only ran about 40 yards before falling over dead. Grim Reaper's motto is \"Watch em' Drop\" and that's exactly what I did. The damage was brutal and the blood trail was very impressive... I could've tracked her while jogging if need be. I don't plan to ever use another broadhead!",
