The first toothbrush went crazy. It randomly started turning on, mostly during the night, sometimes 3 or 4 times. Also, the usage between charges got shorter and shorter. Finally, it stopped charging all together. The second brush simply fell apart while brushing. The metal rod where the brush head attaches came loose and the thing fell apart. Phillips didn't care and in both cases told us to go away and buy a new one.",

In between the two-year warranty period, I have had the toothbrush replaced at least 3 times. I wish it would last longer, but I keep on buying it since it keeps my teeth very clean.

Complete stopped working 1moth ago which was after two and half years. Warranty expired after two years. At that time, I could use it just for 5 or 6 days after each charge.

The rod connecting to the vibration motor gets looser and looser until eventually the motor doesn't vibrate the toothbrush at all. Better off buying a cheap sonicare toothbrush (the internals are essentially identical anyways) if it is going to fail this quickly.

      "text": "This toothbrush has done wonders for my teeth. After a few weeks of using it (and brushing twice a day), I've noticed that I have less sensitivity, my teeth are whiter, and my mouth feels much cleaner after brushing. I love the glass charging station, not that I have to use it often because this toothbrush holds a charge for a long time! It travels well too, which is a definite plus. Sure, the brush heads are expensive, but for the kind of clean you're getting, they're well worth the price.",

      "text": "The brush is amazing! During 2 years I was enjoying this brush! But right after 2 years passed my brush went crazy, it started randomly turns on by itself and there is no option to turn it off completely. When I turn it off by pushing the button it turns On again. It really scary to wake up at night because the brush started vibrating. I had to wait until battery sit down and no I don't want to charge it again. Moreover, the brush's button is not waterproof, so toothpaste with water flows into the space between the button and the brush body. Because of that after some time it become difficult to press the button.",

I also had purchased a DiamondClean toothbrush in 2016 that lasted about 2 1/2 years and stopped working. For the steep price tag, this toothbrush should last at least 5 years and not until after the warranty.",

This is such a terrible system it makes you loose site on the quality of the actual brush.",
