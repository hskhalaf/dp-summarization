There's no padding but its thick enough to have strong support and no nipples showing. I could wear this under a very shear shirt or tank top and feel I'm well supported. I'm very happy with the purchase, probably the best strapless I've owed!",

On the upper band, it squeezes you flat to the chest wall, causing flesh to pop out the top or out the side armpit (it'll go the path of least resistance. Not a good look and sending it back. For smaller cup sizes (guessing a B or less), this might work well. Looked well constructed, just not for me.",
