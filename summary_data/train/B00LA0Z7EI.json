      "text": "It fires up and heats very evenly; can get up on sear temperature rapidly. Its a keeper for sure. You will find yourself turning to this instead of firing up your large Weber! The best point of all, in my opinion, is that it has two burners thus it will allow you to cook indirectly. Sear your chicken or ribs, then turn off the heat under them and finish slow cooking indirectly with the other burner turned down low. Hook this grill up to a 20lb propane tank and it will cook \"forever.\" Six Stars I am extremely pleased with this grill.",

So nice to only have to use the little propane tanks rather than the giant ones. Plenty of space for 6 kabobs. One note- If you compress the grill and store it vertically (which it was designed to do), residual grease will seep out onto the ground. If you're concerned about staining, I would recommend a grill mat (yes, they exist!) be placed underneath..",

The only negative item to report is that there is really no low heat size on the grill, despite lowering one burner. Far better then any box store product that we have tried over the years.",

On my charcoal Weber grill it burns off easy but on this grill it sticks hard and sticks on the lower section which is hard to clean. Overall a great grill.",
