It's beautiful and the contractor liked that it did not have predefined orientation for installation. The front and the back are identical, so the drain can be installed on the left or the right. Note: This sink is over a hundred pounds and will require some bracing to hold it in place. Also, be very cautious about moving it solo as it's not easy to lift with good form. I have not attempted to move it at all due to physical limitations, but have observed several others doing so.",

      "text": "We've had this sink for about 6 months now. It is rock solid (and weighs accordingly!) and still looks great. We bought the insert rack and so with that, we have not had any dents or scratches. My only issue with it is that it does not have enough pitch to allow food to easily go down the drain into the disposal. I end up chasing food around with the faucet for quite some time (which wastes precious CA water) or I have to lift up the rack and push everything down. Otherwise, it is a perfect sink.",

Is that all sinks but I never noticed it??? The sink cleans beautifully with a light scrub. I purchased a standard plastic tub to fill with hot soapy water for hand washing dishes.",

I would put it in the middle so all the crap can be swept into it and the faucet, being directly over the drain can whoosh it all away. Other than that, it's beautiful and I love it.

It has been about 8 months and we have had no problems with chipping/staining/etc. Picture quality is not great but for reference cabinet color is BM Simply White.",
