Still skeptical, I waited to submit a revised review but within three days, the replacement nozzle was here. I am extremely satisfied with the product and amazed at the great customer service. I definitely would do business with this The FitLife company. Only reason I didn't rate durability is that the hose is still new.",

      "text": "I've had expanding garden hoses in the past, but this one is the best I've used. It's well built, with brass connectors, giving the impression that it will last quite a while--because the material is of greater quality, and heavier, and the internal core is stronger. I'm very happy with this. The instructions say to keep it out of the sun when not in use, which is impossible in my garden, so I have no idea how this may affect the hose's long-term health. However, in my last home, a much cheaper brand was stored in the shade, and went to pieces fairly quickly. So it's all about quality--and the FitLife looks like it will last a long time.",

The connection and nozzle feels cheap, but has no problem performing so far. Replacing that old cheap grey hose with this was a great thing. Putting this up is also easy since it auto shrinks as water is expelled from the hose. As well, the hose fills up really fast and builds pressure in no time.",

This tends to make the usable hose length less by 3' or so. So far so good. Time will tell if it is worth the extra cost compared to a cheaper hose.",

I love the convenience of having it fit in a small bucket when not in use. It's very lightweight and easy to handle and the fittings look strong enough for long-term use. The pressure stream on the Jet setting isn't as strong as I had hoped but it's satisfactory. I would highly recommend this product, at least in my area where we don't have much of a weather problem (California).",
