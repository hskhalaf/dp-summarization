The fit the of screw in infuser and tea basket are terrible. It is impossible to get them to stay in place. The handle and lid seem great and comfortable at first. However the lid does not have a vent so pouring is very slow and it spirts liquid all over the counter no matter how slow and carful you try to be. I do not recommend this pitcher for anyone. Look for something else. Total waste of money.",

The tea tubes will not tighten to the lid after a couple of uses, so you end up with the tubes floating around in your tea -- not really useful for loose teas. So far, Ive found the infuser tubes to be more useful, and more durable. After quite a few uses, the infuser tubes tighten and stay attached to the lid as they're supposed to. Since I use teabags for making tea, I simply put my teabags in the diffuser tube rather than the tea tube. LOVE the bonus \"ice ball\" molds!",

The only negative, and it's very minimal, is that the part of the lid which slides open and shut broke off in a matter of days. It doesn't affect it's usefulness at all. I actually find it more convenient, though it does slightly affect it pitcher's asthetics. Great product! I highly recommend it.",
