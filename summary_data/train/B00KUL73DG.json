A word of caution for a diy filter change, when you remove the old make sure you don\u2019t lose any leaves from the top of the old filter in to the fan. I saw one drop and thought oh well. Well my fan made a super annoying sound for a day from the leaf. I re opened it but could not vacuum the leaf out or grab it with my hands. I gave the 13 year old neighbor ten bucks to put his smaller hand in there (with his dads approval) to get the leaf and make sure there were no others. He got it and all is now well.",
