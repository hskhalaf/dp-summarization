I tried to gauge from multiple reviews on people with large breeds to see if this was big enough and opinions seemed split 50/50. I decided to give it a shot for my 90 lb boxer/American bulldog. It claims sleep surface is 25 inches wide, but not really, if you take away the overlap from the bed bumpers. I took pictures to give you a good size reference. It\u2019s soft and cushiony, I love the feel of the fabric and the grey is really pretty. You can tell it\u2019s really well made and will definitely last.

Also, after pre-treating, a trip through the washer and then more treatment after the washer, this still smells of the accident that caused it to be washed in the first place. If it can't come clean, it's of no use - a shame for the money I spent and the landfill it will end up in. The bottom cushion is not very thick or dense - not close to what I expected based on the description. On another note, this is made of a very shiny, cheap-looking material. Not a fan of that aspect, either.",

He's been playing rough with it at times, chewing and scratching, but no tears or rips. Feels pretty tough and the material is good.
