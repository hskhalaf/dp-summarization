Even while working, the thing devours batteries, and the procedure for replacing them is far from plug n play. You must remove the batteries from all stations and transmitters (I have two of each), wait 60 seconds, then replace them in one transmitter, then in both receivers within 30 seconds, etc... The two transmitters are in two different places in my yard, and the receivers are in two different places in my house. Replacing batteries every 3-4 months is annoying and a pain.",

So naturally, I purchased another La Crosse (WS9160U-IT) to replace it and it turned out to be VERY INACCURATE! So, I figured that maybe I received a defective unit and returned it for a new one. But the 2nd replacement also turned out to be very inaccurate. (I am willing to accept \u00b12 degrees off. Up to 8 or 10 degrees off is absolutely unacceptable.) A weather station without accuracy is pointless. These were not my first weather stations and all the set up (and reset) procedures were followed carefully. Both were returned and I will try another brand.",

And the display MUST be inserted within about 30 seconds after the sending unit. With that caveat, it is a nice product. Be sure to read the Ward Wagher novels at Amazon.",

      "text": "The first one I bought worked ok inside but the outside temperature never registered. Kept it as had tossed the packaging and could use it for indoor temperatures. Purchased a 2nd one and once again the outside temperature didn't register. Called the company, went through the process to \"reset\" it and still never registered the outdoor temperature. Was told to purchase new batteries even though the 3 sets that I had tried were all brand new. This time I kept the packaging and returned it. Am now trying another brand, hopefully with better results.",

Then this Fall a squirrel knocked the outdoor one off the table causing it to come apart. Nothing was broken so I tried setting up the batteries again to no avail. So I replaced the batteries in both with new ones. That didn't seem to work so I gave up and ordered a new set of thermometers. These worked well for about a month then the outdoor one failed. New batteries worked for about 2 days. Now no reading from outside!. I've given up and will shop elsewhere.",

I am very pleased with the support given by La Crosse (though it is a pain to have go through the process of trying to prove that the sensor no longer works). This is a no-frills model that I bought simply due to its larger LCD display that is easy to read from a distance (unless, of course, it's dark).",
