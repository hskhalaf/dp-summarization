Therefore, when you place it on your rearview mirror, your camera is always aiming at an angle slightly to the right instead of striaght ahead. Just imagine how is your rearview mirror is positioned in your vehicle for the driver to see the back view of the car and you will know what I meaned. Again, you are paying for what you get. I am sure some other dash cam will allow you to adjust the camera shooting angle but certainly you will be paying more money than you are paying for this one.",

You need a special tap in to avoid this problem. It still works as a recording device without the backup camera.",

It's not a big deal but you do have to turn it off before you can use the mirror.",
