Because of this, the shoe already has a following who did not hesitate to get a pair when it was relaunched. It brings with it a reliable ankle hold that helps users stand their ground. Furthermore, it is light, flexible, and grippy on the mat because of its split-sole unit.",

      "cons": [

Comfortable, get a good grip, and flexible while wrestling. One down side is that it\u2019s very narrow and hurts your feet first two three practices. After that it fits better like it should.",

    "description": "REISSUED FOR 2017!\n\nThese are in stock ready to ship. If you don't see a size we are sold out in it. Several sizes are going to be hard to find shortly. Don't wait in particular for 8.5 to 9.5, we are predicting we did not buy enough of those sizes. 9.0 ad 9.5 are sold out at ASICS until 10/1 or so. Don't wait if you want these for Fargo or a Summer Camp.\n\nThe ASICS International Lyte shows why ASICS has been a constant on the mat. With the attention to detail and high quality, this is the shoe for all your serious wrestlers.\n\nThe International Lyte is ultra-lightweight and has the popular split sole for optimum flexibility, super suede for durabilty and comfort and the MONO SOCK Fit system for a \"sock-like\" fit.\n\nFeatures:\n\n * Super Suede Ecsaine\n * MONO-SOCK Fit System\n * Weight 8.3 oz.\n\nWe want your shoes to fit the way you want them to fit. So we have our \"Buy Wrestling Shoes Worry Free\" program that provides one free exchange for sizing changes (see website for details).\n\nWe typically recommend adding 1/2 size to your normal gym shoe or sneaker size shoe. For example, if you are a size 9.0 gym shoe, order a size 9.5 in these shoes. We find that allows a little room in the toe for comfort and or growth.",
