It's frustrating to figure out when you're first using it (esp if your still an amature pasta maker, like me), but when it comes down to it, it gets the job done. It's not made out of the sturdiest materials, but it seems strong enougn to roll out my dough just fine. I opened it up to oil it, and it actually looks pretty simple and possibly even repairable (with some basic mechanical knowledge) if it happens to break.",

It's a little bit of a pain and takes practice to use since it's a hand crank machine, but all in all gets the job done and is much more consistent than hand rolling. My only real complaint (and maybe it's something I'm doing wrong) lies with the spaghetti/linguini attachment. All the noodles stick together and you have to pull them apart by hand, which ruins most of them! Getting one bowl of spaghetti took me about 30 minutes. Overall, I am happy with this product and I would recommend it!",

This the machine does well. The reason for the 3 stars is that the cutting head does not stay on. The attachment methodology is very poor. I will be modifying it in my shop to see if I can get it to stay on. My only other complaint is minor but annoying, the crank handle does not have a detent to stay in place and constantly falls out of the machine while cranking.",
